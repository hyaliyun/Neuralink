He was also collaborating with Jon Torres at the time of his death . - The premiere took place at the Teatro Apollo in Rome on 19 January 1853, where it \\"began a victorious march throughout the operatic world,\\" a success due to Verdi's work over the previous three years. It began with his January 1850 approach to Cammarano with the idea of \\"Il trovatore\\". There followed, slowly and with interruptions, the preparation of the libretto, first by Cammarano until his death in mid-1852 and then with the young librettist Leone Emanuele Bardare, which gave the composer the opportunity to propose significant revisions, which were accomplished under his direction. These revisions are seen largely in the expansion of the role of Leonora. - The United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organization to promote international co-operation. A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person who used instruments of the continuo group as independent parts? Bach's early cantatas are Choralkonzerte (chorale concertos) in the style of the 17th century, different from the recitative and aria cantata format associated with Neumeister that Bach started to use for church cantatas in 1714. Wolff points out the relation of Bach's early cantatas to works by Dieterich Buxtehude, with whom Bach had studied in Lübeck. Christ lag in Todes Banden shows similarities to a composition of Johann Pachelbel based on the same Easter chorale. Although there is no evidence that Bach and Pachelbel met, Bach grew up in Thuringia while Pachelbel was based in the same region, and Bach's elder brother and teacher Johann Christoph Bach studied with Pachelbel in Erfurt. Another of Pachelbel's works appears to be referenced in the early Bach cantata, Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich, BWV 150, and there has been recent speculation that Bach wanted to pay tribute to Pachelbel after his death in 1706.The texts for the early cantatas were drawn mostly from biblical passages and hymns. Features characteristic of his later cantatas, such as recitatives and arias on contemporary poetry, were not yet present, although Bach may have heard them in oratorios by Buxtehude, or even earlier. Instead, these early cantatas include 17th-century elements such as motets and chorale concertos. They often begin with an instrumental sinfonia or sonata (sonatina). The following table lists the seven extant works composed by Bach until 1708, when he moved on to the Weimar court. Bach uses the limited types of instruments at his disposal for unusual combinations, such as two recorders and two viole da gamba in the funeral cantata Gottes Zeit ist die allerbeste Zeit, also known as Actus Tragicus. He uses instruments of the continuo group as independent parts, such as a cello in Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich and a bassoon in Der Herr denket an uns. The cantata for the inauguration of a town council is richly scored for trumpets, woodwinds and strings. Wolff notes: The overall degree of mastery by which these early...

Roberta Adams skipped the thick how-to guide on child-custody forms and sat down at a computer at the Lamoreaux Justice Center in Orange on Wednesday. The Garden Grove woman answered a series of questions to create and print a form to file with the court. \\"It's easy,\\" said Adams, 25. \\"I thought I'd have all kinds of questions and have to take the forms home.\\" A University of California, Irvine, study released Wednesday found an interactive computer system effectively helps people fill out paperwork for restraining orders, eviction defense, small-claims cases and requests for filing-fee waivers. Not only does the system make life easier for people who can't afford a lawyer, but it also might improve efficiency in the courts because the forms, which are printed out when completed, are easy to read and are being filled out correctly, the study found. Since the program started in 2000, more than 6,000 people have used the free system, located in public buildings throughout Orange County. The system was developed by the Legal Aid Society of Orange County with about 800,000 in grants. The program avoids legal jargon, offers a courthouse video tour and sticks to a fifth-grade vocabulary. Users can choose English, Spanish or Vietnamese. Kiosks are in courthouses in Fullerton and Orange, the district attorney's family-support office, the Legal Aid Society in Santa Ana, Irvine City Hall and the San Juan Capistrano Library.

I can use this background: For example, if a circuit has a potential difference of 100 volts and it is intended for the circuit to contain a 100 ohm resistance, then the wires carrying the current for this circuit will be designed for 1.0 amp. If that 100 ohm resistance is suddenly cut out of the circuit and only 0.10 ohm resistance remains, then the voltage will push 1000 amps of current through the circuit. This current overheats the wires and may damage the circuits or start a fire in the walls or the appliance. There are many possible causes of a short circuit, one possible cause could be something overheating, melting wires, and thereby fusing the circuit closed, bypassing the resistance. Another cause might be something damaging the insulation of a wire, allowing the incoming and grounds wires to touch. In any case, once the resistance is lost, the voltage pushes a huge amount of charge through the wires causing them to overheat. Now, I have a new situation: Customers bought two types of electrical ovens, type A and type B. They were all happy at first but type B ovens started to short circuit. Answer this question please: Which type of oven had fewer instances of voltage pushing a huge amount of charge through the wires? A:","completion":"Type A ovens had fewer instances of voltage pushing a huge amount of charge through the wires. This is because customers reported that only type B ovens started experiencing short circuits. Short circuits occur when the normal path of electrical current flow is altered, causing a drastic reduction in resistance. This situation allows for a large amount of current to pass through the circuit, which can lead to overheating, damage to connected components, and potentially fires. In the given scenario, type A ovens did not exhibit these short circuit issues, indicating that their electrical components and wiring remained intact and designed resistance values were maintained. Hence, type A ovens did not experience the adverse effects of short circuits, such as increased current flow and potential hazards, as compared to type B ovens."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sandra wants to go on vacation, and would like to go somewhere warm. Sandra will likely choose a place near the equator or near the poles? Answer:","completion":"Sandra will likely choose a place near the equator for her vacation. The passage clearly states that areas near the equator are warmer than areas near the poles as they receive more direct sunlight. As Sandra desires a warm vacation destination, it makes more sense for her to pick a location near the equator, where she can enjoy a warmer climate due to the increased direct sunlight. Equatorial regions generally have higher temperatures, and their climate is characterized by consistently high heat, with minimal variations in temperature throughout the seasons. The sun is most intense in these regions, as the rays strike the surface at a perpendicular angle, almost for the entire year. On the other hand, regions near the poles receive indirect sunlight, causing lower temperatures and harsher environments. The sunlight strikes the Earth at a low angle near the poles, resulting in the absorption of lesser solar energy and hence cooler temperatures. With this information in mind, Sandra's preference for a warm location for her vacation naturally points her in the direction of choosing a place near the equator.

Premise: \\"I have no joke for this, but may I be the first to weigh in with 'Dana Plato's Retreat?\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"I would not like to talk about 'Dana Plato's Retreat.\\"?","completion":"If we analyze the given premise: \\"I have no joke for this, but may I be the first to weigh in with 'Dana Plato's Retreat?'\\" and the hypothesis \\"I would not like to talk about 'Dana Plato's Retreat.\\", we can observe that the premise and hypothesis are not directly related, but the premise does provide indirect evidence for assessing the truth of the hypothesis. In order to fully understand the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, let's first break down the premise into its components: 1. \\"I have no joke for this\\" - The speaker acknowledges that they don't have a humorous remark to make in the given context. 2. \\"May I be the first to weigh in with 'Dana Plato's Retreat?\\" - The speaker wishes to introduce the topic of 'Dana Plato's Retreat' in the current discussion. Now, let's analyze the hypothesis: \\"I would not like to talk about 'Dana Plato's Retreat.\\" - The speaker claims they do not want to engage in conversation about 'Dana Plato's Retreat.' To assess the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, we can infer the following: The premise demonstrates that the speaker is interested in discussing 'Dana Plato's Retreat' to some extent, as they wish to be the first to mention it. The use of the phrase \\"weigh in\\" implies that the speaker wants to contribute to the conversation on the topic. This directly contradicts the hypothesis, which states the speaker would not like to talk about 'Dana Plato's Retreat.' While the premise doesn't offer definitive proof to support or refute the hypothesis, it does provide enough information to suggest that the hypothesis is likely false. Since the speaker willingly introduces 'Dana Plato's Retreat' into the conversation in the premise, it's reasonable to infer that the speaker is actually interested in discussing the topic, contrary to the claim made in the hypothesis. In conclusion, based on the given premise, it's reasonable to assume that the hypothesis \\"I would not like to talk about 'Dana Plato's Retreat.\\" is likely false. The premise demonstrates that the speaker is interested in discussing 'Dana Plato's Retreat' and actively wishes to contribute to the conversation on the topic. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis but rather contradicts it."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: What type of details about giovanni battista niccolini can be gathered from the following bio?

Troy Davis, who is set to be executed by lethal injection tomorrow night, has lost a bid for clemency launched by his defence lawyers who said he was wrongly convicted of killing a police officer. Georgia's board of pardons rejected the last-minute plea even after it attracted high-profile support, and his execution will go ahead as planned. It was the last hope for the 42-year-old, who was convicted of killing police officer Mark MacPhail, in Savannah, Georgia, in 1989. Anti-death penalty activists, who also claim Davis was wrongly convicted, chanted and held banners through Atlanta last week. It is the fourth time in four years his execution has been scheduled by Georgia officials. Scroll down for video. Conviction: Troy Davis, left, is set to be executed by lethal injection on Wednesday after he was convicted of killing police officer Mark MacPhail, right, who was shot dead in Savannah, Georgia, in 1989. Peace: Police officer Mark MacPhail MacPhail's mother Anneliese MacPhail remains convinced Davis is guilty. Steve Hayes, spokesman for the Board. of Pardons and Paroles, said the panel decided to rejected Davis' request for clemency after hearing hours of testimony from his. supporters and prosecutors. Troy Davis was convicted of the August 19, 1989, murder of Georgia police officer Mark MacPhail, who was working as a security guard at a Burger King when he intervened in an argument between several men in a nearby parking lot. He was shot in the heart and face without having drawn his gun. One of the men, Sylvester Coles, went to police and implicated Davis in the killing, and he was arrested four days later. During Davis’ 1991 trial, many witnesses testified they had seen Davis shoot MacPhail. Two others testified that Davis had confessed the murder to them. The murder weapon was never found, and no physical evidence linked Davis to the crime. Throughout his trial and subsequent appeals, Davis has maintained his innocence but was sentenced to death in August 1991. Seven of nine witnesses to the. murder changed or. recanted their testimony in recent years. Several stated they had felt pressure by police to implicate Davis. New witnesses implicated Coles in the crime. Many appeals in state and federal courts followed. Davis and his lawyers argued that the racial composition of the jury and poor advocacy from his lawyers had affected his right to a fair trial. In an August 2010 decision, the conviction was upheld, with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia declaring that the new evidence cast only 'minimal doubt on his conviction'. Subsequent appeals, including to the Supreme Court, were rejected. In July 2007, September 2008, and October 2008, execution dates were scheduled but stayed shortly before the events took place. The decision appeared to leave Davis. with little chance of avoiding the execution date. Defence attorney. Jason Ewart has said that the pardons board was likely Davis' last. option. His lawyers have long argued Davis. was a victim of mistaken identity. But prosecutors say they have no. doubt that they charged the right person with the crime. MacPhail's relatives said they were relieved by the decision. 'That's what we wanted, and that's. what we got,' said Anneliese MacPhail, the victim's mother. 'We wanted. to get it over with, and for him to get his punishment.' 'Justice was finally served for my father,' said Mark MacPhail Jr, who. was an infant when his father was gunned down. 'The truth was finally. heard.' Kim Davis, the inmate's sister, declined immediate comment on the decision. Amnesty International USA director Larry Cox said in a statement that the decision was 'unconscionable'. 'Should Troy Davis be executed,. Georgia may well have executed an innocent man and in so doing. discredited the justice system,' Mr Cox said.- but Mr MacPhail’s mother. Anneliese remains convinced Davis is guilty. She said the upcoming execution of her son's 'killer' will bring her peace. ‘I will never have closure,’ Ms MacPhail told CNN. ‘But I may have some peace when he is executed.’ The case has captured international attention because of concerns about the quality of evidence involved in Davis’s conviction - but Ms MacPhail said she has ‘never had any doubts’ it was him. ‘I think these people are just against the death penalty,’ she told CNN, of the many protesters who claim to be worried the state will put an innocent man to death. ‘They don't know what happened.’ Georgia's Board of Pardons and Paroles is expected to meet on Monday to consider whether to stop Davis' execution by lethal injection, which is scheduled for next Wednesday. Marching army: Thousands gathered in Atlanta, Georgia, to protest the pending execution on Wednesday of Troy Davis, who they say was wrongly convicted of killing a Savannah police officer in 1989. Crowds: Thousands gathered in downtown Atlanta to protest the pending execution on Wednesday. ‘I pray that this rally will have an. impact on Pardons and Paroles,’ said marcher Solana Plaines, of. Savannah, Georgia. ‘I hope they will do the right thing.’ Davis declined to order a special last. meal. He will be served what's on the menu at the Georgia state prison. in Jackson before his execution on Wednesday - grilled cheeseburger,. oven-browned potatoes, baked beans, coleslaw, cookies and a grape. beverage. Davis's supporters say there is no physical evidence linking him to the crime and that key witnesses in his trial have since recanted their testimony. ‘You just can't give up hope,’ said Ellen Kubica, who travelled all the way from her home in Germany to attend Friday's event, which featured banners reading: ‘Too much doubt to execute.’ Martin Luther King III, son of the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, joined the march. Reverend Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist and television show host, also attended. Anger: Reverend Al Sharpton speaks to a standing-room only crowd during a prayer service at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia, in support of death row inmate Troy Davis. Megaphone: Martin Luther King III, son of the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, joined the march. ‘The only thing left to decide is whether you have the courage to do the right thing,’ he said of the parole board. ‘It is blatantly clear that there is no reason for this man to be sitting on death row.’ 'The only thing left to decide is whether you have the courage to do the right thing. It is blatantly clear that there is no reason for this man to be sitting on death row' Reverend Al Sharpton. In a rare move, the U.S. Supreme Court in August 2009 ordered a new hearing for Davis to assess what he said was new evidence showing his innocence. The justices transferred the case to a U.S. District Court in Georgia for a hearing and determination of his claims that new witnesses will clearly establish his innocence. A year later, the judge, William T. Moore Jr, rejected Davis' claims of innocence. But on Thursday, supporters of Davis delivered petitions with more than 600,000 names to the parole board. New York: Demonstrators gather near Times Square in Manhattan to protest the execution of Davis on Friday. Message: A woman holds a sign at a protest outside President Barack Obama's campaign headquarters in Chicago, one of 300 rallies held worldwide on Friday, ahead of a last-ditch parole board hearing for Davis. In a column last week in the Atlanta Journal Constitution, former FBI Director William Sessions called for Davis's sentence to be commuted to life in prison, saying the case was 'permeated in doubt'. However in an opposing column written in late 2008 and republished on Thursday, Spencer Lawton, the district attorney who prosecuted Davis, said the condemned man had a fair trial. The claim that seven witnesses at the trial had subsequently recanted their testimony was ‘not believable’, Lawton wrote - and he denied any witnesses had been coerced by police. See video here.

Analyzing the information given in the premise, we can break it down into the following components: 1. \\"He had to\\": This statement implies that there was a certain obligation or necessity for someone (referred to as \\"he\\") to perform a specific action or task. The nature of the action or task is not specified, but the emphasis is on the requirement or compulsory nature of the act. 2. \\"said the Kal\\": This part of the sentence tells us that the individual or entity named \\"the Kal\\" is the one who expressed the statement or idea mentioned in the first part (\\"He had to\\"). This means that the Kal is the source or originator of the statement, reinforcing the notion that \\"he\\" (the subject) must perform the task. Now, let's analyze the hypothesis: \\"The Kal said that it was necessary for him to.\\" 1. \\"The Kal said\\": This portion of the hypothesis establishes that the Kal is the one who made a declaration or assertion about something. It matches the second component of the premise, indicating that the Kal is the one providing the information. 2. \\"that it was necessary for him to\\": This part of the hypothesis summarizes the content of the Kal's statement. The phrase \\"it was necessary\\" aligns closely with the idea inside the initial part of the premise: \\"He had to.\\" Furthermore, \\"for him to\\" designates that the necessity discussed in the statement is related specifically to the person referred to as \\"he,\\" which is consistent with our understanding of the premise. Based on this detailed analysis, we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"The Kal said that it was necessary for him to.\\" accurately reflects the information and meaning present in the given premise, \\"He had to, said the Kal.\\" As a result, we can consider the hypothesis to be true within the context of this premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: 38.4 Muscle Contraction and Locomotion The body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle. Skeleton muscle tissue is composed of sarcomeres, the functional units of muscle tissue. Muscle contraction occurs when sarcomeres shorten, as thick and thin filaments slide past each other, which is called the sliding filament model of muscle contraction. ATP provides the energy for cross-bridge formation and filament sliding. Regulatory proteins, such as troponin and tropomyosin, control cross-bridge formation. Excitation–contraction coupling transduces the electrical signal of the neuron, via acetylcholine, to an electrical signal on the muscle membrane, which initiates force production. The number of muscle fibers contracting determines how much force the whole muscle produces. Q: The body contains how many types of muscle tissue? A: (a). two. (b). seven. (c). four. (d). three. The answer is:","completion":"(d). three. Step 1: Identify the relevant information from the paragraph.

Sentence 1 states that there are typically three courses, along with wine, offered at a set price. This implies that when a customer orders or pays for this set-priced meal, they will receive three courses accompanied by wine. Sentence 2 reiterates the same concept, but with a slight variation in the phrasing. It says that wine is generally part of a three-course meal at a set price. This statement further establishes the relationship between the set-priced meal and the serving of wine as a component of the meal. Although both sentences are not identical in wording, they represent the same underlying concept of offering three courses and wine at a specific price point.

This sharing of electrons results in the formation of molecules, and the bond between the atoms is known as a covalent bond."},{"prompt":"Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who quits the band when Stevenson urges them to go on tour? The film begins with the Descendents' origins in the neighboring communities of Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach, California in the late 1970s. Middle school friends Frank Navetta and Dave Nolte start the band in 1977 by writing songs together on guitar. Classmate Bill Stevenson impresses them with his musical talents and becomes their drummer. In 1979 they meet bassist Tony Lombardo in Long Beach and recruit him to the band. Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single. Stevenson's high school classmate Milo Aukerman joins the band as lead singer, and the new lineup builds a local following through their catchy and melodic songs, energetic live shows, and Aukerman's image as a nerd. They release the Fat EP (1981) and their debut album Milo Goes to College (1982), so named because Aukerman leaves the band to study biology. Stevenson drums in Black Flag for the next few years. In 1985 the Descendents reconvene for a second album, I Don't Want to Grow Up. Navetta has burned all of his equipment and moved to Oregon, and is replaced by Ray Cooper. Stevenson pushes for the band to tour, but Lombardo declines and quits. He is replaced by Doug Carrion, and this lineup records 1986's Enjoy!, after which Cooper and Carrion both leave the band. Stevenson recruits bassist Karl Alvarez from Salt Lake City, who brings in his close friend Stephen Egerton to play guitar. The new lineup releases the 1987 album All, themed around the philosophical concept of \\"All\\" invented by Stevenson and friend Pat McCuistion. Aukerman leaves the band again to attend graduate school.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1: How do I get rid of annoying girls? Dealing with annoying people, in this case, girls, can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies you can employ to handle the situation. Firstly, remember that what might be annoying to you might not be a big problem for others. Here are some tactics to consider: 1. Communicate: Have an honest conversation with the person(s) involved, expressing your feelings and concerns. Use \\"I\\" statements to express how their behavior affects you without putting them on the defensive. 2. Set boundaries: Establish personal space and time limits to protect your well-being. Politely but firmly express your need for privacy and personal space. 3. Stay calm: Keep your emotions under control when dealing with the annoying person. Stooping to their level or getting angry can only escalate the situation. 4. Distance yourself: If the person continues to be annoying, limit your interaction with them. Try to avoid social situations where you will have contact with them. 5. Focus on yourself: Sometimes, our own emotional state can play a part in our perception of others. Make sure you're taking care of your own mental health and not projecting any personal issues onto others. 6. Seek help: If the situation escalates or causes emotional distress and all other methods have been exhausted, consider talking to a counselor, teacher, or someone else who can provide guidance. Question 2: What is the best way to get rid of an annoying company? It is unclear from the question whether you're referring to a company in the legal entity sense or a group of people. However, I'll provide a response for both situations. Annoying company as a legal entity: If you are dealing with an annoying company, you can employ different tactics to deal with the situation: 1. Terminate the business relationship: If you're a customer or client of the company, you can choose to stop doing business with them and seek alternatives. Make sure to communicate your reasons for terminating the relationship so they can learn and potentially improve. 2. Voice your concerns: Contact the company's customer service department or, if possible, its owner or management to express your concerns. Often, businesses are responsive to customer feedback and will take steps to remedy the situation. 3. Use social media: Share your experience through social media platforms or leave reviews on websites such as Yelp, Google Reviews, or Trustpilot. Publicly expressing your concerns can encourage the company to take action directly. 4. Report the company: If their behavior or practices violate any laws or business regulations, you can report the company to the appropriate local authorities, such as the Better Business Bureau (BBB) or relevant regulatory agencies. Annoying company as a group of people: If you are referring to a group of people that accompany you, you can follow some of the strategies similar to dealing with annoying girls mentioned earlier. This includes communicating clearly, setting boundaries, distancing yourself, and seeking help if necessary. Regarding the question of whether questions 1 and 2 are asking the same thing, they are not directly asking the same thing. The questions are contextually different, as Question 1 refers to individual interactions with annoying girls, while Question 2 focuses on either dealing with an annoying legal entity or a group of people. However, similar strategies can be applied in both cases, such as communication, setting boundaries, and seeking help when needed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Suspect in murder of actress, yoga teacher charged in 6 other crimes in 2016 The man suspected of murdering a Washington, D.C. yoga instructor and part-time actress had been charged with a crime six other times in 2016 – including just days before Tricia McCauley was found sexually assaulted and strangled to death in her car early Tuesday. Adrian Dwayne Johnson, 29, who also goes by Dwayne Adrian Johnson, was charged on Dec. 17 for alleged thefts at a CVS and Meridian PCS. At a hearing for those cases, a judge ordered Johnson to wear a GPS monitoring bracelet, but there’s no record he ever showed up to receive the device, FOX5 reported. POLICE: EX-STUDENT WHO FATHERED SON WITH TEACHER KILLED BOTH The next time police intercepted Johnson, they were arresting him and charging him with first-degree murder in McCauley’s death. Authorities linked Johnson to McCauley after he allegedly robbed another CVS on Monday while in possession of her car. ARKANSAS MAN ARRAIGNED IN ROAD RAGE KILLING OF 3-YEAR-OLD Late Monday, police sent out a critical missing person alert with images of McCauley, her distinctive, small, white Toyota Scion and the suspect. Not long afterward, a police report stated that officers responded to a sighting of the car and found it. When they went inside a nearby CVS, they found the suspect, who gave them the key. Police found McCauley unresponsive in the car and she was pronounced dead early Tuesday, according to the police report. Johnson’s six other charges stem from alleged thefts or robberies. He’s also wanted in two other counties for failure to show in court in other theft cases, NBC4 reported. Johnson has been ordered to undergo multiple mental health screenings and attend drug rehabilitation in past cases, however, it’s unclear if any of the screenings took place or the rehab was completed. Interim Police Chief Peter Newsham said police don't believe McCauley, 46, and Johnson knew each other, and they don't know how Johnson encountered McCauley. The last known contact with McCauley was around 4:30 p.m. Sunday, Newsham said. McCauley was expected at a large Christmas dinner that night, but host Bill Largess said Tuesday she hadn't arrived when they were ready to start. People texted and called, but got no response. McCauley had come to the dinner for the last 15 years, but they weren't too worried since she had slept through it once a few years ago. But the next morning they heard that she missed a flight to visit family on the West Coast. “That's when we knew something was definitely wrong,” Largess said. A vigil was being held Tuesday evening at a yoga studio where McCauley worked.

The unlikely pair _ an itinerant hitchhiker turned Internet celebrity and a lawyer three times his age _ met amid the neon lights of Times Square and headed back to a squat brick home on a quiet New Jersey cul-de-sac, authorities say. CORRECTS SPELLING OF LAST NAME - In this undated photo downloaded from the Union County Prosecutor’s website, Caleb “Kai’ Lawrence McGillvary is shown. McGillvary, 24, is being sought by New Jersey authorities... (Associated Press) Days later the lawyer was found beaten to death in his bedroom, wearing only his socks and underwear. The hitchhiker was arrested Thursday and charged with his murder. Caleb \\"Kai\\" McGillvary took a star turn in February when he became known to millions as \\"Kai the Hatchet Wielding Hitchhiker\\" after intervening in an attack on a California utility worker. McGillvary described using a hatchet he was carrying to repeatedly hit a man who had struck a worker with his car, fending off a further attack. Once lauded as a hero, McGillvary, 24, now returns to the spotlight under nefarious circumstances. He was arrested at a Philadelphia bus station Thursday evening and charged with the murder of Joseph Galfy, Jr., a 73-year-old attorney. \\"I believe that everyone is a little safer with this person off the streets,\\" said Union County Prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow. McGillvary will be processed in Philadelphia and sent to back to New Jersey in the coming days, Romankow said. His bail is set at 3 million. Galfy was found dead in his Clark, N.J., home Monday, two days after authorities said he met McGillvary in New York City. Galfy, who lived alone, was found by police who went to his home to check on his well-being, Romankow said. Statements posted on McGillvary's Facebook page following the homicide were \\"sexual in nature,\\" Romankow said. McGillvary's last post, dated Tuesday, asks \\"what would you do?\\" if you awoke in a stranger's house and found you'd been drugged and sexually assaulted. One commenter suggests hitting him with a hatchet _ and McGillvary's final comment on the post says, \\"I like your idea.\\" It was a hatchet that helped give McGillvary a brief taste of fame in February when he gave a rambling, profanity-laced 5-minute interview to a Fresno, Calif., television station about thwarting an unprovoked attack on a Pacific Gas & Electric employee. The interview went viral, with one version viewed more than 3.9 million times on YouTube. McGillvary later traveled to Los Angeles to appear on ABC's \\"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\\" Kimmel asked him what people were saying to him since the Feb. 1 incident. \\"Hey, you're Kai, that dude with the hatchet,\\" he responded. Romankow declined to say what object was used in Galfy's beating. Romankow said McGillvary, who said in his TV appearance he prefers to be called \\"home-free\\" instead of homeless, traded on his fledgling celebrity to meet fans across the country. Authorities know he was in Times Square based on witness accounts, the prosecutor said. \\"He was well-known,\\" Romankow said. McGillvary spent at least two nights in Galfy's home in Clark, 20 miles west of New York, Romankow said. The dark brick home is neatly landscaped, with carefully-pruned bushes lining a path to the entrance. Red tape labeled \\"evidence\\" is affixed to the front door. Authorities believe McGillvary took two trips to meet a fan in Asbury Park; Galfy picked him up after the first trip and brought him back to Clark, Romankow said. It is unclear how McGillvary got to the train station a second time. After heading back to Asbury Park, McGillvary and the fan went to Philadelphia, then to Glassboro in southern New Jersey, where McGillvary spent Monday night. Tuesday he boarded a train in New Jersey bound for Philadelphia, Romankow said. McGillvary swiftly gained notoriety after he was interviewed in February. McGillvary told KMPH, the Fox affiliate in Fresno, that he was traveling with a man, now facing charges including attempted murder, who veered into the worker.

Union County law enforcement has issued an arrest warrant for him for the murder of Joseph Galfy, Jr., in Clark, N.J., according to the Union County Prosecutor's Office. Galfy was reportedly found dead inside his home on May 13. The cause of death has been declared as blunt force trauma. Authorities say Kai — identified by his full name, Caleb Lawrence McGillvary — is considered armed and dangerous and has cut his hair in an effort to conceal his identity. He's charged with murder and bail is set at 3 million. SEE ALSO: Shrouded in Viral Mystery, Kai the Hitchhiker Gains a Cult Following McGillvary, a.k.a. Kai, was passing through Fresno, Calif., in February when he saw a man attack a utility worker with a car and assault a woman at a gas station. He then hit the man on the back of the head three times with a hatchet to stop the attack, and his interview shortly thereafter became a viral sensation. Videos of him have since been viewed millions of times on YouTube and he appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live, where Kimmel gave him a surfboard as a present. So what could have prompted such a dark turn in McGillvary's story? While his official take is unknown, below is a cryptic status update to his Facebook page from Tuesday, the day after Galfy was found dead. Be warned; it contains graphic, NSFW language. Police say McGillvary was last seen at a light rail station near Haddonfield, N.J., and are offering a 5,000 reward in the case.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"Yes, the questions \\"How can I get traffic on my website?\\" and \\"How can I get traffic in my website?\\" are essentially asking the same thing. Both are inquiring about strategies to increase the number of visitors, or 'traffic', to a particular website. To answer your question, there are several effective strategies to increase website traffic and attract visitors: 1. Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Enhance your website for search engines. This includes the strategic use of keywords in your content, optimizing your meta tags, and creating high-quality backlinks. Consider the use of long-tail keywords as they typically have a lower level of competition than common keywords. 2. Content Marketing: Publish valuable, engaging, and original content regularly. This could be blog posts, articles, infographics or videos. High quality content can attract organic traffic, boost SEO performance, and encourage repeat visitors. 3. Social Media Promotion: Use platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to advertise your content. This can expose your website to a wider audience, increase brand visibility and attract more visitors. 4. Email Marketing: Send regular newsletters or promotional offers to your subscribers. This not only keeps your audience engaged but also drives them back to your site. 5. Online Advertising: Pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, social media ads, and other forms of online advertising can significantly increase website traffic. 6. Guest Blogging: Writing guest posts for popular blogs in your industry can expose your brand to a larger audience. Usually, you get the opportunity to link back to your site in your author bio, which can boost traffic. 7. Influencer Marketing: Collaborate with influencers in your industry to expose your brand to their followers. This can bring in a significant amount of traffic, particularly if the influencer has a large following. 8. Website Analytics: Use tools like Google Analytics to analyze your website’s traffic. Understand which pages are the most popular, where your visitors are coming from and what they do on your site. This information can help you refine your strategies to boost traffic. 9. Website Design: Ensure your website has a user-friendly design, is easy to navigate, and has a fast loading speed. A better user experience often leads to higher dwell time, lower bounce rates, and thus, more traffic. 10. Collaborations and Partnerships: Partner with other websites, brands, or online communities in your industry for collaborations or content exchanges. This can expose your website to a larger audience and potentially increase traffic. In conclusion, obtaining more website traffic involves a combination of several strategies, and what works best can depend greatly on your specific industry, target audience, and available resources. It may take some time and experimentations to determine the best approach for your brand. Remember, quality and relevancy are key - attracting the right kind of traffic that is likely to engage with your content and opt for your products/services is more important than just increasing the overall site visits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article using the following points: Lindsey Stone posed for the picture in October at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery. Stone and her coworker, who snapped the photo, were fired Wednesday. Her father, Peter Stone, called the pose a 'total lapse of judgement' Facebook page 'Fire Lindsey Stone' has amassed over 19k Likes. Competing page 'Hire Lindsey Stone' was created in support of the 30-year-old, only receiving 39 Likes.","completion":"Title: The Controversial Photo at Arlington National Cemetery: Lindsey Stone Caught in the Crossfire Introduction: In today's world, one wrong move on social media can ignite a whirlwind of public outrage and have far-reaching consequences. A striking example of this phenomenon is the case of Lindsey Stone, a woman who faced severe backlash over a now-infamous photo taken at the Arlington National Cemetery. Background: To understand the gravity of this situation, let's rewind to October when Lindsey Stone and her co-worker visited the sacred Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Arlington National Cemetery. This site is well-known as a place of remembrance and national pride, honoring the sacrifices of countless American soldiers. The Controversial Photo: During their visit, Lindsey and her friend decided to have some fun and pose for a lighthearted photo. Little did they know, this moment would lead to a 'total lapse of judgement,' as described by Lindsey's father, Peter Stone. The photo quickly went viral, drawing public ire for its perceived disrespect to fallen service members. Immediate Aftermath: As the photo spread across the internet, a Facebook page titled 'Fire Lindsey Stone' was created, swiftly amassing over 19,000 Likes. People from all walks of life came together to condemn Lindsey for her actions at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and to demand that she be held accountable. Employment Fallout: Facing mounting pressure, Lindsey Stone and her co-worker, who had taken the photo, were both eventually fired from their jobs on Wednesday. This decision fueled further debate over whether such an extreme measure was justified or if the online outrage had gone too far. Competing Support: In response to the widespread calls for Lindsey's termination, a competing Facebook page was created called 'Hire Lindsey Stone.' This page aimed to provide support for the 30-year-old woman amidst the online firestorm. Though the page garnered a significantly smaller following with only 39 Likes, it demonstrated that there were individuals who felt the backlash had crossed the line into cyberbullying. Conclusion: The Lindsey Stone case is a powerful example of the impact social media can have on our lives. It showcases both the solidarity that can emerge in holding people accountable for their actions, and the potential for online backlash to escalate out of control. In such situations, it is crucial for society to strike a delicate balance between defending expectations of respect and refraining from perpetuating harmful cyberbullying culture."},{"prompt":"What is the missing first step of the following process: - The lungs remove oxygen from the air - Oxygen diffuses from alveoli in the lungs to the bloodstream - Hemoglobin in red blood cells attaches to the oxygen - Red blood cells carry oxygen all around the body - Oxygen diffuses into cells from capillaries.

Say 'yes' if the claim is true otherwise say 'no' Q: CLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL. POST : Throwaway account since my sister is on Reddit. &amp;#x200B; Some context: my sister is 27, I am 19. She married her husband, Jack, when she was 22 and I was 15. I'm not close to my sister, or Jack at all. I'd met him a handful of times and we got along fine, but I wouldn't even really say that we were friends. &amp;#x200B; Soon after I added him as a friend on Facebook, my sister's husband Jack started liking all of my stuff on Facebook. Not just photos and statuses, but things that I was tagged in, or even if I said that I was 'interested' in an event. He even went and liked all of my old profile pictures. I would get texts from friends asking me why this man they didn't know was liking dozens of their photos and statuses at a time and I didn't know how to explain. I don't know what brought this on, considering we hardly ever interacted. I asked my brother about it and he found it strange, since he had a much closer relationship with Jack and Jack never liked any of the things my brother posted on Facebook, even though he posted more often than I did. When this started I was 16, and Jack was 24. &amp;#x200B; The entire ordeal made me uncomfortable, but I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to tell my sister or my parents because I was worried that this might cause unnecessary tension amongst all of us. In retrospect, I should've just talked to my sister about it, but it seemed petty to say that I didn't like that her husband was just liking things on Facebook. And I was 16, I didn't know how to handle this kind of situation. So I blocked Jack, but I realized that if he ever used my sister's Facebook account that he would see that I was still active and know that I blocked him. So I blocked her too. I meant to unblock both of them after awhile to see if the problem was solved, but I forgot. &amp;#x200B; Now fast forward to last month - nearly 3 years after all of this happened. Jack and my sister have since divorced (she found out that he had cheated on her with a coworker), and my sister discovers through my brother that I am still active on Facebook and she puts it together that I must've blocked her. After explaining the situation for the first time ever to my family, she goes ballistic and calls me a bitch for not unblocking her and telling her about Jack after they had gotten their divorce. She also takes Jack's side in the matter, saying that it was a selfish of me to find him just liking my stuff creepy. My defense was that she was already hurt by finding out Jack cheated, and had no intention of getting back with him after she found out - telling her about the liking incident would rub unnecessary salt in her wound, especially seeing as how we already barely talk to one another. I also explained that I forgot that I had blocked them, and fully intended to unblock them at one point. Needless to say she's now unblocked, but Jack's still blocked.

South Slavic dialects historically formed a continuum. The turbulent history of the area, particularly due to expansion of the Ottoman Empire, resulted in a patchwork of dialectal and religious differences. Due to population migrations, Shtokavian became the most widespread in the western Balkans, intruding westwards into the area previously occupied by Chakavian and Kajkavian (which further blend into Slovenian in the northwest). Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs differ in religion and were historically often part of different cultural circles, although a large part of the nations have lived side by side under foreign overlords. During that period, the language was referred to under a variety of names, such as \\"Slavic\\", \\"Illyrian\\", or according to region, \\"Bosnian\\", \\"Serbian\\" and \\"Croatian\\", the latter often in combination with \\"Slavonian\\" or \\"Dalmatian\\". Serbo-Croatian was standardized in the mid-19th-century Vienna Literary Agreement by Croatian and Serbian writers and philologists, decades before a Yugoslav state was established. From the very beginning, there were slightly different literary Serbian and Croatian standards, although both were based on the same Shtokavian subdialect, Eastern Herzegovinian. In the 20th century, Serbo-Croatian served as the official language of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (when it was called \\"Serbo-Croato-Slovenian\\"), and later as one of the official languages of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The breakup of Yugoslavia affected language attitudes, so that social conceptions of the language separated on ethnic and political lines. Since the breakup of Yugoslavia, Bosnian has likewise been established as an official standard in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and there is an ongoing movement to codify a separate Montenegrin standard. Serbo-Croatian thus generally goes by the ethnic names Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, and sometimes Montenegrin and Bunjevac. Answer the following questions: 1.

Answer the following question: When Patch finally found his way out of the seed-pod, Toro was gone, and there were rats all around him. Some hid beneath the huge black seed-pods, some scuttled in the shadows of the nearby mountain. Patch knew from their smells there were at least a dozen of them. There was another smell too, mixed with that of the rats. The very same unsavory squirrel-smell he had detected in Silver's abandoned drey. \\"What do you want?\\" Patch asked, from his perch atop the mound of seed-pods. He was concerned but not yet frightened. Rats and squirrels were neither friends nor enemies. Squirrels were bigger and stronger, but rats were far more numerous. There were legends of long-ago wars between the two species, but no squirrel Patch knew had ever been attacked by rats. Squirrels lived aboveground, in the sun; rats frequented the night and the dark underworld. Of course, squirrels found rats disgusting and disagreeable -- but so did all other animals. An unusually large rat climbed up to the top of a seed-pod. It was almost as big as Patch himself.

News article: Image copyright Privat Image caption Stan Vanuytrecht: \\"I thought to myself: that's the place for me\\" A divorced, Trabant-driving Belgian has beaten 50 competitors to land the coveted post of - hermit. Stan Vanuytrecht will have no heating, running water or pay at the Saalfelden hermitage in the Austrian Alps. It has had a hermit for all of its 350 years and the local mayor said Mr Vanuytrecht \\"radiated calm\\". His beard will help. His predecessor lacked both beard and cowl and lasted only one season, hinting at \\"arch-conservative Catholic\\" criticism. 'Well anchored' Mr Vanuytrecht admitted he was surprised to be chosen. \\"I thought I didn't have a chance,\\" he said. \\"But when I read about the Saalfelden hermitage, I thought to myself: that's the place for me.\\" The views are great, the facilities not so. He can't even expect to be left alone. The hermitage season only runs from April to November - in winter it is not habitable - but many people hike up to enjoy the views and it has been known for some of them to seek counselling. The white-bearded, pipe-wielding Mr Vanuytrecht feels he is well grounded in that, having had experience with the homeless, alcoholics, drug addicts, prisoners and psychiatric patients. And poverty. After divorce from a partner who suffered mental illness, he \\"had to make do with very little. I was glad when I had money for food,\\" the Saalfelden visitors' website reported him as saying. It said the deacon and practising Catholic was now financially secure but cares not for luxury items. The BBC's Bethany Bell visited the hermitage when the job was advertised and Saalfelden parish priest Alois Moser told her: \\"For us it is important that [the winning candidate] has a Christian background so that this monastic tradition is preserved.\\" Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Wanted, hermit: The BBC's Bethany Bell reports as the call went out Erich Rohrmoser, mayor of Saalfelden, said: \\"We opted for Stan Vanuytrecht because his personality appealed to us.

Photo: Hans Enzwieser/BIPs/Getty Images In mid-January, a small village in the Austrian Alps briefly made international headlines. For Austrians living abroad—a demographic that includes yours truly—that’s usually not a good thing. This time, however, the news was refreshingly free of National Socialism or subterranean sex dungeons. Instead, the town of Saalfelden, in the state of Salzburg, was in need of a new hermit. The previous one had quit after just one season. According to the job posting, Saalfelden is one of the only places in Central Europe that still has a tenanted hermitage. In the mid-17th century, a chapel and adjacent living quarters were built into a rock face overlooking the scenic Saalfelden Basin. Sitting at an elevation of roughly 3,300 feet, the space has been inhabited ever since. In recent years, the resident hermit has been expected to live in the cliffside dwelling from April until November. Applicants for the position should have “a connection to Christian beliefs” and be “at peace with themselves,” according to the posting. The aspiring hermit also shouldn’t be a total misanthrope, since the job includes conversing with visiting hikers as well as pilgrims seeking spiritual guidance. Applicants should be prepared for an ascetic existence: there’s no electricity or running water, and the position is unpaid. The Daily Mail asked, “Is this the worst job in the world?” Not everyone seems to think so. In fact, the initial deadline of March 15 was moved forward to the end of February due to the unanticipated number of applications. “We were taken totally by surprise,” says Alois Moser, a local priest who, along with Saalfelden’s mayor, Erich Rohrmoser, will be choosing the next hermit. Over the phone, Moser said they were initially hoping that a brief news item on Austrian public television would yield one or two qualified candidates. Instead, the ad went viral. Moser has since heard from people as far afield as the United States, Argentina, and Thailand. It’s hardly Powerball for international recluses—Moser said he had just over 20 applications when I spoke with him in mid-February—but the response is still unprecedented. At least four women are seeking to become Saalfelden’s first female hermit. Though they will be up against the stodgy traditionalism of the Austrian Catholic church, Moser says every applicant will be given careful consideration. As for why so many media outlets deemed the hermit gig newsworthy (or at least clickbait worthy), Moser thinks that something about the simple, solitary life “registered with the current zeitgeist.” Recent trends in digital detox and gung-ho individualism seem to bear this out. On the one hand, there’s the ominous rise of the doomsday prepper. On the milder end of the spectrum are the back-to-nature movements that signify a sort of low-stakes rebellion against the pervasiveness of the internet. “It’s the yearning of our time: to escape the rat race, the incessant media, all the fear and the unrest in the world. There’s a desire to withdraw from the drama and the pace of it all,” says Brother Raimund von der Thannen, the 68-year-old Austrian Benedictine monk who was Saalfelden’s hermit from 2004 to 2015. Von der Thannen, who now lives in an abbey in the Styrian village of St. Lambrecht, believes the need to get away from it all has only increased with the rise of social media. “There’s this horrible pressure to constantly present yourself to the world via simplistic means, be it over Twitter, or YouTube, or what do I know,” he says. “It’s a constant pressure to promote a version of yourself that’s not real. Everyone wants to come off as a world champion, but everyone’s really just a dope.” With his reserved demeanor, prodigious beard, and cowl, von der Thannen so embodied the stereotypical religious recluse that it was a hard act to follow. His short-lived successor, a Viennese priest and psychotherapist named Thomas Fieglmüller, was chastised by conservative members of the community for not being sufficiently hermit-like in appearance. (He didn’t have a cowl or a beard.) “Maybe I was the wrong person for the job,” Fieglmüller told the Salzburger Nachrichten, though the article states that he left on good terms and plans to attend the swearing-in ceremony for the next hermit. Asked why he decided to take up residence in Saalfelden all those years ago, von der Thannen said he was inspired by a desire to free himself from the shackles of materialism and the need for recognition. “Not having to be important is such a wonderful thing,” he says. He’d been employed at a bank, had worked as a tax adviser, and had been an instructor at a trade school. He’d had his trials, too. Divorced with two adult children, von der Thannen is a cancer survivor and former gambling addict, though he stresses that prospective hermitage occupiers need to have conquered any such demons before taking up residence—Saalfelden is not rehab center with a killer view. “You can’t be running from something,” says von der Thannen. “It has to be an unforced decision.” This feels consistent with the line from the vacancy notice about aspiring hermits needing to be “at peace with themselves.” After all, accepting a life of solitary reflection is only one half of what the job entails. The other is being well-adjusted and empathetic enough to offer solace for those in need. The aspiring wise man on the mountain, in other words, shouldn’t only be looking out for number one. “That’s the whole point,” says von der Thannen. “Being a hermit only to get yourself into heaven is really not enough.” ||||| There's no running water, electricity or pay but 50 people from around the world still applied to be one of Europe's last hermits. Now there is a winner, Austrian officials said Wednesday. \\"We opted for Stan Vanuytrecht because his personality appealed to us. He radiates calm and comes across as well-anchored,\\" said Erich Rohrmoser, mayor of Saalfelden near Salzburg in the west. Vanuytrecht, a divorced, Trabant-driving former artillery officer, surveying technician and Catholic deacon from Belgium with a white beard and a pipe, said he was surprised to be chosen. \\"I thought I didn't have a chance,\\" the Austria Press Agency quoted the 58-year-old retiree as saying. \\"When I read about the Saalfelden hermitage I thought to myself: that's the place for me.\\" ||||| Stan Vanuytrecht chosen from 50 applicants for post, which comes with no heating, running water, internet or pay A Belgian man has won a competition to live as a hermit in a cliffside cell above an Austrian town. Stan Vanuytrecht, 58, a former artillery officer who drives an East German Trabant, beat 49 other candidates to secure the position as one of Europe’s last hermits. Vanuytrecht is due to move into the 350-year-old hermitage, built into a cliff above the town of Saalfelden near Salzburg in western Austria, this month. “I had thought I had no chance,” Vanuytrecht, who comes from near Brussels, told the Austria Press Agency. “When I read about the Saalfelden hermitage, I thought to myself: that’s the place for me.” He said he had long dreamed of becoming a hermit but the opportunity had not arisen.

But the views are spectacular and the air very clean. The Saalfelden hermitage has been occupied every year since its foundation. But when the previous hermit – Thomas Flieglmüller, a former priest and psychotherapist – announced he was leaving to concentrate on a writing career in Vienna, the local priest Alois Moser started advertising for successors, who had to submit their applications by post. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Saalfelden is one of central Europe’s last hermitages. Photograph: Handout/AFP/Getty Images The job description was for someone with a “connection to Christian belief” and the ability to “be at peace with themselves” at 1,400 metres (4,600 ft) above sea level. Vanuytrecht said he thought his previous experience working with homeless people, alcoholics, drug addicts, prisoners and psychiatric patients would stand him in good stead. His divorce and the poverty he experienced as a result was also good preparation, he added. The trained surveying technician, who is also a Catholic deacon, will not be completely alone. He has been told to expect a number of visitors who come by to pray, chat and enjoy the view. He said he liked the idea of combining the peace in the mornings and evenings with the intensive dialogue and pastoral care of his visitors during the day.

He exudes calm and gives the impression of being centred. And he told us he could imagine spending a considerable length of time living in Saalfelden.” Flieglmüller’s predecessor was a Benedictine monk who stayed for 12 years.

Christine, however, experienced the opposite effect as her mean-spiritedness often led her to feel disconnected from others and emotionally unfulfilled. Lastly, Emily's compassionate approach had a positive impact on her well-being. Research shows that being kind and empathetic towards others benefits one's mental and emotional health. Christine's mean behavior, on the other hand, likely caused her to experience feelings of guilt or self-dislike, which negatively impacted her well-being. In conclusion, Emily's life was better than Christine's due to the different ways they treated others. Kindness played a crucial role in Emily's life, contributing to her strong relationships, positive reputation, personal fulfillment, and overall well-being. Christine's mean behavior, however, led her down a path of isolation, missed opportunities, and poor mental health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Context: The filming was kind of a long process, but maybe it didn’t need to be? Or maybe it did? The first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie’s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie’s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell’s script and getting any other shots we needed to get. Perhaps we didn’t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn’t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn’t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I’m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects. I get a tad obsessive if I’m allowed, which can often benefit me, although I do become a giant pain in everyone else’s ass. The main thing I learnt from the filming process was that you can plan out exactly what you want to do, and how your going to do it, but once you get into the location with the actors this plan often changes – however, you are still much better of having the plan than none at all! As the neurotic freak I am, I had all the shots I wanted to use storyboarded. I had originally planned to shoot all the establishing shots, stick them in a timeline and then also shoot the other shots (with fill in actors) and add them to the timeline to see how it looked.

CHAPTER VI: FIRKET June 7, 1896 Since the end of 1895 the Dervish force in Firket had been under the command of the Emir Hammuda, and it was through the indolence and neglect of this dissipated Arab that the Egyptian army had been able to make good its position at Akasha without any fighting. Week after week the convoys had straggled unmolested through the difficult country between Sarras and the advanced base. No attack had been made upon the brigade at Akasha. No enterprise was directed against its communications. This fatal inactivity did not pass unnoticed by Wad Bishara, the Governor of Dongola; but although he was nominally in supreme command of all the Dervish forces in the province he had hardly any means of enforcing his authority. His rebukes and exhortations, however, gradually roused Hammuda, and during May two or three minor raids were planned and executed, and the Egyptian position at Akasha was several times reconnoitred. Bishara remained unsatisfied, and at length, despairing of infusing energy into Hammuda, he ordered his subordinate Osman Azrak to supersede him. Osman was a Dervish of very different type. He was a fanatical and devoted believer in the Mahdi and a loyal follower of the Khalifa. For many years he had served on the northern frontier of the Dervish Empire, and his name was well known to the Egyptian Government as the contriver of the most daring and the most brutal raids. His cruelty to the wretched inhabitants of the border villages had excluded him from all hope of mercy should he ever fall into the hands of the enemy. His crafty skill, however, protected him, and among the Emirs gathered at Firket there was none whose death would have given greater satisfaction to the military authorities than the man who was now to replace Hammuda.

Write an email with the following subject: Suggested revisions to EOL Paperless Confirm Amendment text","completion":"Subject: Suggested Revisions to EOL Paperless Confirm Amendment Text Dear [Recipient's Name], I hope this email finds you in the best of your health and spirits. I am writing to share with you several proposed revisions to the text of the EOL Paperless Confirm Amendment. Our team has been diligently working to refine this document in order to improve its clarity, accuracy, and overall coherence. These suggested modifications aim to enhance the reader’s comprehension and ensure coherent continuity of our processes. Firstly, in Section II, which deals with 'Terms and Conditions,' the text could benefit from a clearer, more precise presentation of the subject matter. Current verbiage seems generic and may lead to confusion. I propose that we refine our language and make the implications of agreeing to these terms explicitly clear. This would entail replacing jargon with simpler, yet professional language, making the statements more directly relatable to our clients. Secondly, in Section IV, 'Client Information,' we need to tighten our confidentiality clause. The present language is not robust enough and leaves room for potential ambiguity and legal loopholes. I suggest we seek legal counsel to draft a stringent, unambiguous confidentiality clause that enforces the highest level of data protection. Furthermore, in Section VI, 'Dispute Resolution,' the existing text appears to lack an adequate explanation of the mechanisms for resolving potential conflicts. I would recommend providing a more comprehensive step-by-step guide, along with examples to handle possible contentious situations. This not only aids our clients but also equips our sales team with solid information for defusing conflicts. Lastly, on a general note, I suggest we produce a concise executive summary at the beginning of the document. This would give the reader a quick snapshot of the entire amendment and its impact. It also sets the groundwork for the details to follow, making it easier for the client to understand and absorb. I hope you find these suggestions valuable and they contribute to enhancing the quality and effectiveness of our EOL Paperless Confirm Amendment document. They are, of course, open for further discussion and refinement as deemed appropriate by the team. Please take your time to review these proposed modifications, and feel free to add any feedback or additional suggestions. I am available to discuss these changes further at your earliest convenience. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

(CNN) -- The amateur video shows men, shirtless and seeming dangerously drunk, rolling on the ground or staggering near a counter top covered with booze bottles. Another part of the video shows a man babbling incoherently with a syringe nearby. This is not a scene at a college frat house. It is a video of employees of an American security contractor working in Kabul, Afghanistan. \\"It reminded me of times I'd visit my friends going to college that were in fraternities,\\" said John Melson, a former employee of Jorge Scientific who was based at that villa in Kabul on assignment to support efforts to train Afghan security personnel. But OPTIONS: - Afghan rejected the suggestion that work was compromised. - Afghanistan rejected the suggestion that work was compromised. - American rejected the suggestion that work was compromised. - CNN rejected the suggestion that work was compromised. - John Melson rejected the suggestion that work was compromised. - Jorge Scientific rejected the suggestion that work was compromised. - Kabul rejected the suggestion that work was compromised. - The Company rejected the suggestion that work was compromised.","completion":"The amateur video of employees of the American security contractor, Jorge Scientific, raises concerns about the conduct and professionalism of these individuals as they participate in the crucial task of training Afghan security personnel. The situation has the potential to impact not only the immediate work environment but also the overarching goals of the mission in Afghanistan. Jorge Scientific rejected the suggestion that work was compromised. However, it's vital to critically analyze whether such behavior could have any effect on the mission and its objectives: 1. Operating in a foreign country: When working in another nation, it is important for security contractors and their employees to respect local customs, values, and sensitivities. The inappropriate and unprofessional behavior displayed in the video runs the risk of offending local partners and harming the reputation of both the company and the broader mission. 2. Trust and confidence: The partnership between the security contractors and the local Afghan security personnel relies on trust and confidence. Such incidents can erode the faith of the local population in the ability of these professionals to deliver effective training and support. This could lead to a deterioration in the relationship between the security contractors and the local Afghan forces and ultimately damage the wider effort to stabilize and secure the country. 3. Safety and security: The video shows employees handling dangerous materials, such as syringes and excessive amounts of alcohol, in a careless manner, posing significant risks to their health and safety. Such reckless behavior could lead to accidents and injuries, which might result in strained resources, negative attention, and increased costs for the company and the mission. 4. Employee performance: Engaging in excessive alcohol consumption and substance abuse can have a detrimental effect on an individual's ability to perform their duties. This could result in decreased productivity, poor decision-making, and a lack of focus, which might undermine the overall effectiveness of the training and support provided to Afghan security personnel. 5. Workplace culture: The video portrays a lax and irresponsible work environment, which might encourage similarly inappropriate behavior among other employees. This could contribute to a negative workplace culture, affecting morale, teamwork, and overall performance. While Jorge Scientific has rejected the suggestion that such behavior could compromise the work being done, it's necessary to recognize the potential effects of such conduct on the mission's success. The delicate and important nature of the task of training and supporting Afghan security forces requires the utmost professionalism, dedication, and respect for local values and customs. Incidents like these could jeopardize the mission and harm both immediate operations and the long-term goals in Afghanistan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The humour was gentle and subtle, as indeed were the three characters (witness their sympathetic treatment of the little old lady shopkeeper).

Young undocumented immigrants seeking permanent status in the United States received an unexpected boost Thursday on Capitol Hill as a small group of House Republicans mounted a last-minute effort to bring up an immigration vote in Congress. The group of eight Republicans — some freed from political considerations by upcoming retirements and others facing tough re-elections races — defied their own party leadership, quickly persuading 10 more Republicans to sign on to a petition that would force debate on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. With all 193 Democrats expected to sign on, Republicans will have to persuade just seven more members of their own party to join the petition to trigger a vote on several immigration bills on the House floor. But Republican leadership said the effort would be wasted if the end result is a presidential veto. \\"I think it's important for us to come up with a solution that the president can support,\\" House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters Thursday. These types of petitions are rare and seen as a threat to leadership's ability to direct legislative action. \\"It's better to use the legislative process,\\" Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters Wednesday. But that argument appears to be losing sway with House members who see an opportunity for legislative action in a mid-term election year. The growing group of House Republicans are joining Democratic colleagues who have long criticized Ryan for not bringing immigration bills up for a vote. \\"This is about making sure we're not consolidating power in the White House,\\" said Representative Mia Love, a Republican from Utah and one of the first lawmakers to sign petition. The immigration issue had all but died after an effort to pass a DACA fix collapsed in the U.S. Senate earlier this year.

Stephen and Shelli had married just six months before near their home in South Jordan, Utah. They were in Hawaii on a family vacation with two of their sons. The family had rented electric motors and headed towards a nature preserve near Waikiki. But Shelli had fallen behind and the family turned back to make sure she was okay. Shelli lost so much blood that her heart couldn't function properly and she went into shock at the hospital. Physicians were able to make her come to herself. On the first and second days there, she lived through half a dozen operations. On day three, the worst of Stephen's fears came true. Shelli didn't wake. She had shown heart failure and lung failure. \\"I thought every heartbeat would be her last,\\" Stephen says. As days passed with no change, one doctor gently asked if it was time to let Shelli go. An MRI showed her brain didn't have much chance of supporting life. Stephen couldn't bear the thought of trapping his wife's beautiful spirit in a body that would never work. If he kept her alive, what kind of life would she have ? He called family, religious leaders, and physician friends in Utah for guidance. And he decided there still was a chance. The family moved Shelli to a Utah hospital closer to home. In the next few weeks she started opening her eyes, but it wasn't entirely clear how conscious she was. Nearly seven weeks after the accident, Stephen was joking with his sister in the hospital room when he saw Shelli smile, a big toothy grin. \\"Did you understand that?\\" he asked. She smiled again. Stephen fell to his knees in thanks. Shelli's recovery has been slow but steady. Initially, she couldn't remember much of the previous months, including her own wedding. Shelli has endured 17 operations so far and may require more surgery. She will definitely need more months of recovery. But she is able to walk. \\"She's got her life back.

Avoid banging into a wall or an obstacle more than once or twice in the cup. Avoid falling off the track more than once in the cup. Stay in first for a significant amount of each race. When behind, try to catch up without using items whenever possible. If you are hit with many blue shells and similar items in a short amount of time, the game will take this into account and relax the above guidelines a little. If this happens, you may still be able to get a One Star ranking even if you use items to get in first, or if you don't finish in the rank or time limit normally required. If you are having trouble finishing in 1st or 2nd, play a Medium or Large character and a vehicle with good speed. If you can stay in 1st for much of the race, but you frequently hit obstacles or walls, play a Medium or Small character and a vehicle with good handling and acceleration. Before racing, you can set your drifting mode to Automatic or Manual. For best results, set it to Manual and be prepared to press the B button (and shake the Wii mote, if in use) to start drifting sideways when you notice sparks from your wheels. However, if you are using the Wii Wheel, Automatic may give better results do to increased manual drifting difficulty with that controller. . Mario Kart Wii allows you to cut down your time and dodge obstacles by doing tricks, \\"snaking,\\" \\"drifting,\\" and using the rear camera view. Find out more at this article. Many race tracks have hidden shortcuts and opportunities for creative driving techniques. Discover more of these by playing Time Trials and following the ghost driver to see what it does, or search online for videos of the race tracks you find difficult. Remember, going off-road will not hurt your ranking if you use a Mushroom or other boost item. This can save you a lot of time on some maps, such as by boosting through the Peach Garden flower patch or across the grass near the start of Bowser's Castle. What is a summary?","completion":"To achieve a One Star rating in Mario Kart Wii, players must perform well across the four tracks of the Cup, amassing at least 53 points. To increase the chances of success, minimize the number of instances leaving the road or hitting walls/obstacles, and maintain the first position for a significant portion of each race. Using an appropriate character/vehicle combination based on your strengths and weaknesses is key, as well as setting the drifting mode to optimize your performance. Finally, utilizing tricks, discovering shortcuts, and optimal use of boost items will contribute to overall success and a possible One Star rating."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue.

By doing things in a way other people don't expect you'll demonstrate that you can think on your feet. That is one way people seem to judge cleverness. For example: if your professor gives you an essay assignment, ask them if you could do a creative option. Demonstrate how your option fulfills the requirements while going above and beyond. (If you're taking a class on short stories, ask if you could try your hand at writing a short story of your own using what you've learned in class, and write a follow-up piece examining your own work.) This is also about doing the unexpected. If you always go by the rules or do things exactly as you learned them it doesn't mean you're not smart, it simply means that people aren't going to see you as clever. So, don't rely on your particular intelligence and typical ways of doing things. This step ties into not always going by the book, because a lot times you'll need to think outside the box to do that. To be clever you will need to come up with creative solutions to problems. Re-conceptualize the problem. One thing that people who use creative solutions do effectively, is to re-imagine a problem. To practice this skill, take an obvious choice (like writing a plain old essay) and re-imagine how else you might approach the essay so that you still get the same information across, but in a different, more engaging way (telling a story orally, creating a collage or painting). Daydream. It turns out that daydreaming is actually incredibly beneficial to boosting creative problem-solving. The process of daydreaming helps you to form connections and recall information. This is why a lot of your best ideas may come out during the shower or right before you go to bed. If you're having difficulty with something, take a little time out to daydream. Chances are, by relaxing and letting your brain roam free, you'll come up with something creative that works. Brainstorming is another great way to foster creativity, especially in a group. Present the problem and have people give whatever ideas come into their head without passing judgement on these ideas. Have people add to the ideas as they come. You can do this on your own too, as long as you make sure to keep judgment out of the process. Fear is one of the biggest obstacles to creative thinking, which is one big aspect of cleverness. The more creative and workable your solutions and ideas, the more people will believe in your abilities. Ask yourself things like: what happens if you lose your job? what if you lose your best customer? what if you fail your class? what if the publisher doesn't buy your book? The answer to any of these questions can either free you up from fear, or it can show where you need to work on your solutions, which in turn will open up opportunities and further ideas. When you're coming up with ideas and potential solutions, don't open them up for criticism until they're more formed. Criticism and the fear of criticism can be a big creativity killer, which can kill your cleverness, too. When you're out of the brainstorming stage and better able to evaluate the ideas, that's when you get feedback and take criticism. Having problems and opportunities that are ill-defined and super vague can make it incredibly difficult to come up with punchy or creative solutions and ideas. Even if issues and things you need to deal with come to you without parameters, set some for yourself. Setting \\"imaginary\\" or \\"pretend\\" parameters can foster your ideas. For example, if you're working on a project for work pretend that you're out of money, how do you accomplish your task without it? Pretend you can't follow the rules, written or unwritten, how would you do things different? Pretend there's a fast time limit on coming up with your solution (say a 5 minute time limit)? What can you come up with in that short period of time? For example, Dr. Seuss wrote Green Eggs and Ham because of a challenge from his editor to come up with a full book in under 50 different words. That restriction helped him come up with one of the best known Dr. Seuss books. Summary:","completion":"To demonstrate cleverness and think on your feet, it's important to think outside the box and approach tasks in unexpected ways. Start by re-conceptualizing the problem and exploring creative ways to fulfill its requirements. Daydreaming can help unlock creative problem-solving by allowing your brain to form connections and recall information. Brainstorming with others, or by yourself, can also foster creativity as long as you suspend judgment during the process. Overcoming fear and embracing opportunities can help expand your ideas and boost your cleverness. To generate more creative ideas, set parameters for yourself, even if they are imaginary. Pretend you have limited resources, time, or the inability to follow standard rules. This can inspire you to think of new and clever solutions to problems. Remember to open your ideas up to criticism only after they are more formed to prevent stifling creativity. By practicing these techniques, you can develop your cleverness and showcase your ability to think on your feet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

People are concerned that these corn plants might transfer modified genetic material to other plants. Which of the following is the best way to further modify the plants to prevent them from transferring their genetic materials to other plants? Select from the following. a). changing the plants so they do not make pollen b). changing the plants so they do not harm insects c). changing the plants so they cannot produce nutrients d). changing the plants so they cannot be easily identified","completion":"a). Changing the plants so they do not make pollen The best way to modify these genetically modified corn plants to prevent them from transferring their genetic material to other plants would be to change them so that they do not produce pollen. Pollen is an essential part of plant reproduction, as it carries the male genetic information that fertilizes the female part of a plant. By altering the plants to prevent them from making pollen, they would be rendered unable to spread their modified genetic material to other plants through natural pollination processes. This approach has several advantages over the other options: b). Changing the plants so they do not harm insects may lower the concern about transferring genetic materials, but it would not eliminate the possibility of gene flow between plants. Pollination could still occur, and the modified genetic material could still be shared with other plants. Moreover, changing the plants so they do not harm insects would defeat the purpose of genetic modification if the goal was to create a natural pesticide. c). Changing the plants so they cannot produce nutrients would make the plants unsustainable and negatively impact their growth, development, and overall health. This option would also be counterproductive, as the plants could not survive without producing the necessary nutrients they need to grow. Also, this approach would not entirely eliminate the chances of gene transfer, as there is still the possibility of pollen or other reproductive tissues transferring genetic material. d). Changing the plants so they cannot be easily identified does not address the problem of gene transfer between plants at all. While this may make it difficult for humans to differentiate between genetically modified and non-genetically modified plants, it would not stop modified genetic material from being shared with other plants, especially through cross-pollination. In conclusion, eliminating pollen production (option a) is the most effective way to prevent genetically modified corn plants from transferring their genetic material to other plants. This approach directly addresses the mechanism of gene flow by targeting the pollen production, which plays a vital role in plant reproduction, and thus could provide a reliable solution to minimize, if not altogether prevent, the spread of the modified genetic material."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The film then cuts forward in time to a small European village where a series of mysterious murders are taking place. The villagers readily assemble in mob form, with torches, at the house of Professor Kristan (Ralph Morgan) after every murder. The villagers suspect that a giant bat is to blame for the murders. Kristan gives the villagers advice on staying safe, and assures them a scientific explanation exists. However, in subsequent scenes, Kristan himself is revealed to be the murderer. He is seized by attacks (triggered by darkness) which transform him into a trance-like state of murderousness. After he commits a murder, he awakens from the trance with no memory of the deed, believing himself merely to have fainted. Kristan's obliviousness is further enabled by the intervention of his loyal hunchback Zan, the only person aware of Kristan's condition. Zan follows Kristan when he is in his trances, ensuring the professor is not discovered. An old friend of Kristan's named Dr. Bizet arrives to visit, and soon suspects what is happening.

Summarize this article: NORTH TEXAS -- Announcing the “feral hog apocalypse” is within reach, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller has approved of the first pesticide targeting wild pigs, CBS Dallas reports. The estimated 2.5 million feral hogs in Texas cost an estimated 50 million a year in damage to Texas agriculture, according to the Austin American-Statesman. In addition to the damage to crops and livestock tanks, hogs cost untold damage to suburban yards. Miller said they will use the pesticide, Kaput Feral Hog Lure, as bait food laced with warfarin which is the same drug used to kill rats. It can also be prescribed by doctors, in smaller doses, to prevent blood clots But the move has upset hunters, who’ve gathered more than 1,200 signatures in opposition within two days. “We don’t think poison is the way to go,” said Eydin Hansen, Vice President of the Texas Hog Hunters Association. He prefers hunting and trapping methods to control the invasive species. Hansen has been hunting hogs since he was 16. “It’s a way to feed your family,” he said. He worries soon he won’t want to take that risk. “If this hog is poisoned, do I want to feed it to my family? I can tell you, I don’t.” Hunters and conservationists are afraid other animals may be exposed to toxin. “If a hog dies, what eats it? Coyotes, buzzards…” said Hansen. “We’re gonna affect possibly the whole ecosystem.” The Kaput product website claims its low toxicity decreases that risk. The company has also created a bait station to disseminate it that limits access to other wildlife. Hansen remains skeptical. “I personally don’t think it’s going to work,” he said. Miller told the state, in light of the product’s approval, his department would no longer need 900,000 earmarked for feral hog control research. As a state senator, Miller authored legislation that allowed for the shooting of wild hogs from helicopters. Now, more than 27,000 wild pigs are killed that way, according to the Austin American-Statesman. ||||| Photo: AP Texas’s 2.5 million feral pigs may soon fall victim to chemical warfare. On Tuesday, the state’s Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller changed the rules of the Texas Administrative Code to permit the legal poisoning of these unsuspecting hogs. Advertisement Before feeling too bad for the poor piggies, know that feral hogs are a national problem that cost us around 1.5 billion. They wreak at least 52 million in damages to Texas agriculture each year by ruining crops and livestock tanks. According to the Austin American Statesman, these deranged creatures cause “untold damage in suburban areas, where they dig up homeowners’ yards and dine on cable and internet lines.” On solving the problem of the pigs, Miller said, “They’re so prolific, you can’t hardly keep them in check. This is going to be the hog apocalypse, if you like: If you want them gone, this will get them gone.” “This is going to be the hog apocalypse, if you like: If you want them gone, this will get them gone.” The agent of this impending apocalypse? Kaput Feral Hog Lure is a bait food laced with warfarin, a colorless and flavorless rodentcide. In smaller doses, warfarin is also used as a blood thinner in humans. Warfarin holds particular significance in world history—a study from 2003 suggests it might’ve been used to poison Stalin during his last dinner with the Politburo, and President Eisenhower was an early user of the drug, which he was given after a heart attack in 1955. Advertisement While Richard Poché, the president of the company that makes Kaput, assured Texans that the risk of using warfarin is minimal, local hunters are concerned. A petition opposing the use of warfarin has more than 12,000 signatures. Eydin Hansen, Vice President of the Texas Hog Hunters Association, told CBS News, “We don’t think poison is the way to go.” Miller argued for the safety of warfarin by pointing out that it turns the dead hog’s fat bright blue, “a dead giveaway.” But as Hansen explained, “If a hog dies, what eats it? Coyotes, buzzards… We’re gonna affect possibly the whole ecosystem.” Advertisement Sponsored Edwin Parker, a Texan hog buyer, had the same concerns as Hansen. Additionally, he told ABC 9 KTRE, “We slaughter a few pigs and give them to people in a tight situation and need something to eat. If word gets out that all the hogs are poisoned we aren’t going to want to risk making our kids sick, family sick.” Though Kaput is only allowed to be in feeders that adult hogs can access, the worry about it contaminating non-target species is legitimate. State wildlife veterinarian Jim LaCour spoke to the New Orleans Times-Picayune about his concerns with Louisiana possibly adopting warfarin to deal with its feral hog problem: Advertisement When the hogs eat, they’re going to drop crumbs on the outside, where small rodents can get them and not only intoxicate themselves but also birds of prey that eat them. Since the poison will be on the landscape for weeks on end, the chances of these birds eating multiple affected animals is pretty good. “Chemical feral hog apocalypse” joins “President Donald J. Trump” and “fried chicken shell tacos” in the list of absurd realities that, in simpler times, seemed utterly impossible. [Austin American Statesman via CBS News] ||||| Some have misgivings, but Miller says the product is safe. The man who gained fame for successfully allowing hunters to shoot hogs from helicopters is now championing another strategy to hasten what he calls “the feral hog apocalypse”: poison. Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller will announce Tuesday that he is approving a pesticide, “Kaput Feral Hog Lure,” for statewide use. He says the product, poisoned bait food, is the first specifically designed to control the feral hog population, now estimated at more than 2.5 million in Texas. Feral hogs cause at least 50 million in damage annually to Texas agriculture, destroying crops and livestock tanks, as well as causing untold damage in suburban areas, where they dig up homeowners’ yards and dine on cable and internet lines. “They’re so prolific, you can’t hardly keep them in check,” Miller told the American-Statesman. Sows have been known to produce two litters a year, typically with four to six offspring in each litter. “This is going to be the hog apocalypse, if you like: If you want them gone, this will get them gone.” As a state senator, Miller authored legislation that allowed for the aerial killing of hogs. Now, on average, 27,500 hogs are killed that way annually. Feral hogs were introduced to North America by Spanish settlers who set domestic pigs free into the woods so that they could breed freely. Overall, as many as 750,000 are harvested annually, but the problem is a growing one. Enter Kaput. The product is basically bait food laced with warfarin, used as a blood thinner for humans but apparently lethal in hogs. TEXAS POLITICS DELIVERED EVERY DAY: Sign up for our Texas Politics email Miller said licensees will be able to set out nontoxic bait food for the hogs in feeders that require the strength of an adult hog to access. Once the hogs grow accustomed to the food, licensees can replace the nontoxic bait with the toxic variety. Miller, who said he is changing state agricultural rules to allow the product’s use, said Kaput presents a “minimal risk to other animals” because it requires much higher dosages to affect other wildlife populations or livestock. He said officials at the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service support the rule change and the use of warfarin for feral hog population control, but an official at Texas A&M who oversees feral hog operations declined to comment Monday. The product was developed by Colorado-based Genesis Laboratories and will be sold by its sister company, Scimetrics. “Hogs are particularly sensitive to warfarin,” Genesis President Richard Poché said. Poché said the hog bait contains only one-fifth of the concentration found in conventional rat and mouse baits. He said that after 25 years of working with warfarin, numerous studies have found only minimal effects on wildlife, such as ferrets, magpies, alligators and birds of various species, when used at the low concentration in the bait. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department spokesman Steve Lightfoot said the agency had been consulted. “These invasive animals destroy native habitats, indirectly impacting our state’s wildlife resources that rely on these habitats, and the department strongly supports and encourages feral hog control management practices,” he said. “As for nontarget species, we can’t speculate on the impacts to wildlife species should exposure or consumption take place because dose, dose frequency, body mass and species sensitivity will likely be highly variable. Studies have shown that individual animals, such as rodents and raptors, can be affected through primary and secondary consumption of warfarin.” LIKE US ON FACEBOOK: Our Lone Star Politics page brings Capitol news to your Facebook feed Miller said hunters will be able to tell if the feral hog has consumed Kaput because the fat will be a bright blue. “It’s a dead giveaway,” said Miller, who said the product has won federal approval. The Texas Department of Agriculture got 900,000 from the Legislature in the last biennium to research feral hog control. So confident is he in Kaput, he said, that he will tell appropriators not to give his agency that money again. “I am excited to see a new tool to address the feral hog populations,” said Nick Dornak, who oversees the Caldwell County Feral Hog Task Force, which has received 80,000 in state funding over the past four years and has removed more than 10,000 hogs during that period. “My concern would be that there’s any thought of this being a magic bullet for feral hog control in the state. We need trapping, we need aerial control, and not all landowners are willing to put poison on their property.” Officials in Louisiana, where the product is also under consideration, have sounded less bullish than Miller. A Louisiana state wildlife veterinarian told the New Orleans Times-Picayune that the hogs might drop crumbs of the bait food on the ground, where other wildlife can get to it. He also raised concerned that black bears — which also live in Texas — could get to the food. |||||","completion":"Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller has approved the use of the first pesticide to target wild pigs in the state.

This conversion is made possible by solar cells. However, solar energy may not always be practical. Some areas are just too cloudy. Example Solar panels on the roof of this house generate enough electricity to supply a familys needs. Moving Water Falling water can have a lot of energy. Its energy can be converted into kinetic energy. This energy can turn a turbine and generate electricity. The water may fall naturally over a waterfall or flow through a dam. A drawback of dams is that they flood land upstream. They can also reduce water flow downstream. Either effect may harm ecosystems. Wind Wind is moving air. It has kinetic energy that can do work. Wind turbines change the kinetic energy of the wind to electrical energy. Only certain areas of the world get enough steady wind. Many people also think that wind turbines are noisy and not very nice to look at. Question: \\"What is the drawback of kinetic energy from hydro power?\\" Answer: \\"The hydro power dams are not very nice to look at\\" Is this answer correct? pick from the following. (A). no; (B). yes;...I think the answer is","completion":"(A). no The given answer, \\"The hydro power dams are not very nice to look at,\\" is incorrect. The actual drawback of kinetic energy from hydro power is that dams can flood land upstream and reduce water flow downstream, which may harm ecosystems.

ASCII is a character encoding standard (comprised of 128 characters represented by numbers) that is used widely in the computer and information systems industry to represent text for communication between computers and devices. It is based on the English alphabet and includes digits, punctuation marks, and common symbols. The IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) indeed prefers the name \\"US-ASCII,\\" but both names refer to the same character encoding system. The ASCII standard is widely used because it allows for consistency and ease of communication across different computing platforms, programming languages, and software systems. Developed in the 1960s, it was a crucial innovation for the adoption of digital technology both in the United States and internationally. As computing systems evolved, new character encoding systems, with more characters and support for a multitude of languages, were created. These systems include Unicode, which extends and supersedes ASCII, providing comprehensive support for characters, scripts, and symbols from diverse languages and historical eras. In conclusion, the statement, \\"ASCII (i/ˈæski/ ASS-kee), abbreviated from American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character-encoding scheme (the IANA prefers the name US-ASCII)\\" does accurately answer the question about what ASCII stands for.

Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) affects more than 7% of adults in the US and leads to substantial personal and economic burden. In prediabetic states insulin secretion and action—potential targets of preventive interventions—are impaired. In trials lifestyle modification (i.e. weight loss and exercise) has proven effective in preventing incident T2DM in high-risk groups, although weight loss has the greatest effect. Various medications (e.g. metformin, thiazolidinediones and acarbose) can also prevent or delay T2DM. Whether diabetes-prevention strategies also ultimately prevent the development of diabetic vascular complications is unknown, but cardiovascular risk factors are favorably affected. Preventive strategies that can be implemented in routine clinical settings have been developed and evaluated. Widespread application has, however, been limited by local financial considerations, even though cost-effectiveness might be achieved at the population level..

His pride swells along with his tattooed biceps. He's a dying breed, a blue-collar American working on a product as American as apple pie. Blue jeans. \\"This is our lifeline,\\" Wolfe says. Those jeans you squeezed into this morning? It's likely they began right here at Mount Vernon Mills, one of the last functioning cotton mills in America and the nation's No. 1 producer of denim. In a tiny enclave of northwest Georgia, Wolfe and 1,200 of his colleagues churn out enough denim per week for 800,000 pairs of blue jeans. Blame corporate greed for the selling out of","completion":"America's iconic textile industry. As globalization took hold and the search for cheap labor intensified, many American corporations shifted their manufacturing bases overseas – leaving cities like Trion and its hardworking folk to reckon with the consequences. Thousands of textile mills have closed their doors since the 1970s, but Wolfe and his tight-knit community carry on the tradition at Mount Vernon Mills, determined to prove that American-made denim can still compete on the world stage. In an age of mass-produced fast fashion, Wolfe's team stands out like a beacon of hope. These dedicated workers preserve the values of quality and craftsmanship that once defined our nation's textile heritage. Day in and day out, the hum of machinery and the scent of raw cotton fill the air as the mill weaves its magic – turning humble natural fibers into one of the most sought-after materials across the globe. Wolfe's \\"Tough As Nails, I Love America\\" ethos might seem out of place in today's profit-driven market, but it's this very spirit that has kept Mount Vernon Mills afloat amid turbulent times. These workers have endured hardships, faced stiff competition from cheap imports, and witnessed dramatic technological changes – and yet their mill continues to thrive. They have weathered the storm by staying true to their roots and doubling down on quality. But what does the future hold for this last bastion of genuine American blue-collar labor? Can Mount Vernon Mills stand firm against the tide of globalization and increased automation? These are the questions lingering in the minds of locals as they clock in for their shifts, their hands worn and calloused from decades spent crafting America's favorite fabric. Trion's leaders are also acutely aware of the challenges that lie ahead. As small-town industries falter across the country, they must adapt and innovate to attract new businesses and secure the future for their community. This means investing in infrastructure and education while providing opportunities for people like Wolfe to upskill and diversify their careers. Although the odds may seem stacked against them, Mount Vernon Mills is a testament to the grit and unyielding determination that embody the American spirit. Its workers remind us that there is value in standing by our heritage and embracing the craftsmanship that made this country great. Like Wolfe's bulging biceps, there remain pockets of unwavering strength in the face of adversity. So next time you pull on your blue jeans, take a moment to recognize the labor of love and endurance that brought them into existence. As the cotton mills grow fewer in number and the machines more advanced, it's vital to cherish the legacy of tireless American hands and the communities that foster them. For now, at least, Mount Vernon Mills remains a beacon of hope, proving that the dream of American-made denim is very much alive. It's up to the industry, consumers, and policymakers alike to decide whether this dream perseveres."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Mike was interested in the science behind polar compounds. To that end, he collected two compounds, compound A and compound B. Compound A was a polar compound, but compound B was a nonpolar compound. He then conducted two tests, case A and case B. In case A, he changed the state of a polar compound from solid to liquid. And, in case B, he changed the state of a nonpolar compound from solid to liquid. Which compound would have lower melting point, compound A or compound B? Hint: Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. The Table below compares melting and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent compounds. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Compound B would have a lower melting point. As mentioned in the hint, polar compounds generally have higher melting and boiling points due to the additional energy required to overcome the weak hydrogen bonds that exist between polar molecules. Nonpolar compounds, on the other hand, do not have these hydrogen bonds, and therefore, require less energy to change from a solid to a liquid state. In case A, Mike changed the state of a polar compound (compound A) from solid to liquid, which would typically require more energy and higher temperatures due to the hydrogen bonds presence. In case B, Mike changed the state of a nonpolar compound (compound B) from solid to liquid, which would usually require less energy and lower temperatures as there are no hydrogen bonds to overcome. Since it takes higher temperatures for changes of state to occur in polar compounds, compound B, the nonpolar compound, would have a lower melting point than compound A, the polar compound."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can you tell me the answer to who is the strait of gibraltar named after??","completion":"The Strait of Gibraltar, a narrow waterway connecting the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea, is not named after a person, but after a geographical location. The name \\"Gibraltar\\" comes from the Arabic term \\"Jebel Tariq,\\" which means \\"Mountain of Tariq\\" or \\"Rock of Tariq.\\" This refers to the Rock of Gibraltar, a prominent landmark on the European side of the strait. The Rock of Gibraltar and the surrounding region have had a long and storied history, with significance to various civilizations, and it is essential to understand the context to appreciate the origins of the name. In the year 711, a Muslim Berber general named Tariq ibn Ziyad led an invading force from North Africa across the strait into what is now modern-day Spain. He landed near the rock, which, as a result, was named after him. This invasion marked the beginning of the Umayyad conquest of Hispania, an endeavor that linked the European continent with the Muslim caliphate for the first time and initiated eight centuries of Muslim presence in the Iberian Peninsula, known as Al-Andalus. The original name, Jebel Tariq, was subsequently adapted into several languages as the region changed hands over time. In Spanish, it became \\"Gibraltar,\\" while the English extrapolated this into present-day \\"Gibraltar.\\" Through the various occupations and the shifting of power, the location retained its significance as a strategic gateway between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The Strait of Gibraltar, as a crucial and historic maritime corridor, took its name after the Rock of Gibraltar that loomed over it. This strait, approximately 9 miles (14 kilometers) wide at its narrowest point, has been a major shipping route and geopolitical focus across different civilizations due to its geographic significance. In conclusion, the Strait of Gibraltar is named after the Rock of Gibraltar which, in turn, was named after the Muslim Berber general Tariq ibn Ziyad, who landed near the rock during the Umayyad conquest of Hispania in the year 711. The strait's name reflects a rich historical past while emphasizing its strategic position connecting two major bodies of water."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The film was produced by Orion Pictures and is set in a dystopian and crime-ridden Detroit, Michigan. It stars Peter Weller as Alex J. Murphy, a police officer who is brutally murdered by a vicious gang led by crime lord Clarence Boddicker. In the storyline, the Omni Consumer Products (OCP) corporation, which has recently entered into a contract with the city to manage and improve the underfunded and struggling Detroit Police Department, uses this opportunity to revive their project to create a cyborg law enforcement officer. The project, known as \\"RoboCop,\\" utilizes Officer Murphy's body and integrates it with advanced robotic technology, creating a superhuman, crime-fighting machine. Once operational, RoboCop is programmed to follow three primary directives: serve the public trust, protect the innocent, and uphold the law. The film follows RoboCop's journey as he regains fragments of his human memories and embarks on a mission to not only bring justice to Detroit but also avenge his own brutal murder. His hunt for Clarence Boddicker leads to a larger conspiracy involving senior executives at OCP, particularly the ambitious and ruthless Vice President, Dick Jones. Through the course of the film, RoboCop's human emotions surface, enabling him to overcome his programming limitations and ultimately triumph over the corrupt forces. \\"RoboCop\\" received critical acclaim for its blending of intense action, social satire, and dark humor while exploring themes such as gentrification, corporate greed, and the privatization of public services.

Please briefly summarize this news article: The Daily Poll: How Concerned Are You About the Economy’s Impact on Tech? Today’s poll is a bit of a diversion from our usual technology focused questions, but given recent macro headlines, I figured it may be interesting. According to a USA Today-Gallup Poll published yesterday, 66% of Americans already think the US economy is in a recession, with 59% believing we could be headed for a multi-year depression. Meanwhile, it seems that companies in the Web space are moving fast to either cash out (Bebo selling to AOL) or raise new money at aggressive valuations (Meebo, and now reportedly RockYou according to Valleywag and AllThingsD) before capital dries up. Oh yea, and in case you missed it, one of the world’s largest investment banks – Bear Stearns – sold itself for 2/share to JP Morgan over the weekend. That said, a new report out today from eMarketer shows that online advertising – which the majority of companies in our space depend on – is still expected to grow strongly, to the tune of a 23% increase in 2008. The theory goes that as budgets tighten, advertisers will prefer to spend more money online, since results are more measurable. Since most of our audience works in the online space in one form or another, today’s poll asks:","completion":"The news article discusses a poll conducted by USA Today-Gallup which reveals that 66% of Americans believe the US economy is in a recession, and 59% think it could lead to a multi-year depression. This economic concern is affecting tech companies, especially those in the web space. In response, some companies are rushing to cash out, like Bebo selling to AOL, or aggressively raising new money at high valuations, such as Meebo and reportedly RockYou. This urgency arises from the fear of capital drying up in the uncertain economic climate. In contrast to the economic concerns, a report from eMarketer shows that online advertising is expected to grow significantly, with a 23% increase in 2008. The rationale behind this growth is that in times of tighter budgets, advertisers prefer spending money online due to its more measurable results. Since the majority of the article's audience works in the online industry, they are questioned about their level of concern regarding the impact of the economy on the tech sector."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this context, the speaker implies that they are offering assistance or resources to individuals who are interested in engaging with or becoming part of the Western world. This could refer to various aspects, such as adapting to the culture, integrating into the society, learning the language, or even seeking education or job opportunities. The Western world typically includes countries in Western Europe, the Americas, and Australia, which share common historical, cultural, and political ties. It is predominantly characterized by its democratic governance, capitalism, and various cultural norms and values, such as individualism, human rights, and social equality. As a result, some people from other regions of the world might perceive the Western world as an attractive destination for personal, social, or economic reasons. Supporting people in approaching the Western world may involve a wide range of activities and initiatives. For instance, organizations or individuals may provide language courses in English, French, Spanish, or other Western languages to facilitate communication. Moreover, the support can extend to offering cultural orientation and integration classes, where newcomers learn about local customs, values, and traditions. Another form of assistance could come in the shape of vocational training, internships, or job opportunities that enable individuals to build a sustainable livelihood and contribute to their host country's economy. Furthermore, educational institutions may offer scholarships or financial aid to international students, granting them access to higher education in Western countries. There may also be specialized mentorship or support programs for specific communities or groups, such as women, refugees, or people with disabilities, ensuring that everyone has equal opportunities and access to resources when approaching the Western world. By offering such support to people interested in engaging with the Western world, we can create an environment that fosters cultural exchange, understanding, and appreciation while providing individuals with valuable opportunities for growth and development."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Don't get me wrong, this movie is much less explicit (or not even) than Pretty Woman, but it (was) a new topic for Bollywood. The topic was accepted but it is far from Jism, Murder, and Julie. To tell you the truth, the topic is presented in a very clean manner. But the plot has it's number of clichés. The beginning of the movie is presented in a very \\"filmi\\" way. There are some very little plot holes. The movie picks up once Rani has her miscarriage where you feel that you are watching something other than a typical movie. Otherwise the whole family sequence felt overdone in the beginning. The acting couldn't have been any better. Salman Khan sometimes impresses, and sometimes lets you down. Over here he gave one of the best performances. On top of that his role is written so well, that you applaud every time he solves a problem. Rani Mukherjee was adequate. Throughout the movie, you feel for her character the most, but she is overshadowed by Preity Zinta. Preity Zinta is picture perfect. Out of the three, she gives everyone a run for their money. Its surprising how she can be just as convincing when she is innocent. And trust me, Madhubala is far from your girl next door. This role is one of the reasons why I rate her high. The supporting cast are like the family you see in HAHK, where they have no significance to the plot yet I found them tolerable here. The songs are pretty nice. The title song is my favorite of them all along with Dil Tera Mera Dil (Hearts). Mehndi Mehndi (Henna) and Dekhne Walon Ne (Look at the World's Sight) are two song that fit the film perfectly. Preity's cabaret number, Diwani Diwani (Crazy), could've been shortened while No. 1 Punjabi came across boring though it had good dancing. Otherwise the movie is definitely worth a watch.

With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color.

Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System (DNS). Any name registered in the DNS is a domain name. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a domain name represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to access the Internet, a server computer hosting a web site, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via the Internet. In 2015, 294 million domain names had been registered. - The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is a department of ICANN, a nonprofit private American corporation that oversees global IP address allocation, autonomous system number allocation, root zone management in the Domain Name System (DNS), media types, and other Internet Protocol-related symbols and Internet numbers. - The DNS root zone is the top-level DNS zone in the hierarchical namespace of the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet. - The European Commission (EC) is an institution of the European Union, responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, upholding the EU treaties and managing the day-to-day business of the EU. Commissioners swear an oath at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, pledging to respect the treaties and to be completely independent in carrying out their duties during their mandate. - Cybersquatting (also known as domain squatting), according to the United States federal law known as the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, is registering, trafficking in, or using an Internet domain name with bad faith intent to profit from the goodwill of a trademark belonging to someone else. The cybersquatter then offers to sell the domain to the person or company who owns a trademark contained within the name at an inflated price. - The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for the purpose of locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. By providing a worldwide, distributed directory service, the Domain Name System is an essential component of the functionality of the Internet, and has been in use since the 1980s. - EURid vzw / asbl ( European Registry for Internet Domains ) is a non-profit organisation appointed by the European Commission on 8 April 2003 as the domain name registry to operate the new . eu top - level domain .

The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. - The Internet Protocol (IP) is the principal communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for relaying datagrams across network boundaries. Its routing function enables internetworking, and essentially establishes the Internet. - A fully qualified domain name (FQDN), sometimes also referred to as an \\"absolute domain name\\", is a domain name that specifies its exact location in the tree hierarchy of the Domain Name System (DNS). It specifies all domain levels, including the top-level domain and the root zone. A fully qualified domain name is distinguished by its lack of ambiguity: it can be interpreted only in one way. - The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a nonprofit organization that is responsible for coordinating the maintenance and procedures of several databases related to the namespaces of the Internet, ensuring the network's stable and secure operation. ICANN performs the actual technical maintenance work of the central Internet address pools and DNS root zone registries pursuant to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) function contract.

The situation in Timor-Leste Translate to French","completion":"La situation au Timor-Leste Le Timor-Leste, également connu sous le nom de Timor oriental, est un petit pays d'Asie du Sud-Est situé à la pointe orientale de l'île de Timor et comprenant également certaines îles avoisinantes. Le pays a obtenu son indépendance du Portugal en 1975, mais a rapidement été envahi par l'Indonésie voisine, qui a annexé le territoire jusqu'à ce qu'il obtienne finalement son indépendance en 2002. Depuis lors, le Timor-Leste a connu une série de défis politiques, économiques et sociaux. Politiquement, le Timor-Leste possède un système parlementaire semi-présidentiel avec une histoire de transition démocratique. Cependant, la stabilité politique n'a pas toujours été garantie et des conflits et des tensions politiques ont parfois mené à la violence. Économiquement, le Timor-Leste est l'un des pays les plus pauvres d'Asie. Depuis son indépendance, le gouvernement a tenté de diversifier son économie, qui repose principalement sur les revenus des ressources naturelles, en particulier le pétrole et le gaz. Malgré ces efforts, la croissance économique reste limitée et la dépendance à l'égard de l'aide internationale est importante. Le chômage, la pauvreté et les inégalités sociales sont également d'importants défis auxquels le pays est confronté. Sur le plan social, le Timor-Leste a fait des progrès dans les domaines de la santé, de l'éducation et des droits humains, bien que de nombreux défis subsistent. Les infrastructures de base sont insuffisantes, en particulier en ce qui concerne l'accès à l'eau potable, à l'électricité et aux services de santé. De plus, la population fait face à des situations d'insécurité alimentaire et de malnutrition, qui sont particulièrement alarmantes chez les enfants. Les relations internationales du Timor-Leste sont également une question importante. Le pays entretient des relations étroites avec l'Australie, le Portugal et d'autres membres de la communauté internationale, mais trouve également un équilibre délicat avec l'Indonésie, son voisin puissant et ancien occupant. En outre, le Timor-Leste ambitionne de devenir membre à part entière de l'Association des nations de l'Asie du Sud-Est (ASEAN), ce qui pourrait contribuer à sa stabilité et à son développement. En conclusion, la situation au Timor-Leste est complexe et présente de nombreux défis politiques, économiques et sociaux. Cependant, avec le soutien de la communauté internationale et des efforts continus pour renforcer la démocratie, la stabilité politique et les opportunités économiques, le pays peut progressivement avancer vers un avenir plus prometteur."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

New York is home to many stars, but it's only four times a year that its biggest sets right between the east-west streets of Manhattan's grid and turns almost all who cross its path into a paparazzi. Manhattanhenge, sometimes referred to as the Manhattan Solstice, was scheduled to occur at 8:16 on Thursday night and a group of disappointed New Yorkers gathered to take a photo of the glistening sun. But while the sun and the grid system were perfectly aligned, the weather was not - with clouds blocking out the event. It wasn't until Friday night that onlookers were able to experience the magical moment where cosmopolitan meets cosmos at 8:19 p.m. Hundreds of people gathered all over Manhattan to witness the Manhattanhenge on Friday night. New Yorkers did everything they could to take a perfect photograph of the rare New York occurrence. The sun sat perfectly aligned behind buildings during the Manhattanhenge occurrence Friday night. The sun was radiant and in perfect view on Friday night as hundreds gathered to capture its rays. As the sun began to set completely, it did so amidst the sparking city lights that make New York 'the city that never sleeps' Some photographer attempted to take a post-modern approach to capturing the rare occurrence on Friday when the skies were clear. The term Manhattanhenge was coined in. 2002 by Neil deGrasse Tyson and is an amalgamation of Manhattan and. Stonehenge, the ancient English monument built in accordance with the. sun's path, explains Wordsense. The best. viewing on Friday night was along 14th, 23rd, 34th, 42nd and 57th streets, and along. both the Empire State and Chrysler buildings. In. a good year, Manhattan-henge lights up the city skyline with a burst of. red and orange and Friday nights spectacle was far more resilient than. the obfuscated sunset the night before. Earlier in the day on Thursday, the forecast looked. promising with clear blue skies, but as sunset drew close at 8.15pm -. and eager spectators lined the city streets - clouds obscured the sky. 'The setting sun aligns precisely with the. Manhattan street grid, creating a radiant glow of light across. Manhattan's brick and steel canyons,' Neil deGrasse Tyson, of the American Museum of Natural History, told USA Today. The spectacle lights up every cross street in Manhattan and is 'a unique urban phenomenon in the world, if not the universe', he added. Disappointed. photographers who had hoped to capture the event resorted to putting up. images of the city looking dull beneath cloudy skies. Good thing Friday night was the perfect time to view the illustrious setting sun. Sun worshipers: Crowds gather in Manhattan in the hope of watching the city light up during Manhattan-henge. Disappointment: Photographers and tourists had their hopes of seeing Manhattan-henge dashed when clouds obscured the sky. Determined: A tourist holds their camera above the crowd in the hope that the sun would break through the clouds. Fading fast: As the time of the sunset came and went, those who had gathered for Manhattan-henge realized they had missed it.

As the organist was nearing the end of the Prelude, he stepped up to the podium. \\"Please take your hymnals and turn to page 23, and let's stand and sing 'Holy, Holy, Holy.'\\" Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty! Early in the morning, our song shall rise to Thee... As Greg sang and conducted the 4/4 pattern, which he could do in his sleep, his mind began to wander. Shouldn't he feel guilty about what he was thinking last night while kissing Cynthia on the couch? His actions had been within the bounds of acceptable behavior. He had nothing to be ashamed of in that regard. But what about his thoughts? It wasn't what he did with Cynthia--it was what he wanted to do. He didn't want to dishonor her or his commitment to God. But his feelings had been only natural. God created humans and gave them sexual desire. Wasn't it okay to want to have sex, as long as you didn't actually do it? Then he remembered the passage from Matthew 5:28. But I say to you, that whosoever shall look on a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart.

Its latter name comes from Arsaces I of Parthia who, as leader of the Parni tribe, founded it in the mid-3rd century BC when he conquered the region of Parthia in Iran's northeast, then a satrapy (province) in rebellion against the Seleucid Empire. Mithridates I of Parthia (r. \\"c\\". 171138 BC) greatly expanded the empire by seizing Media and Mesopotamia from the Seleucids. At its height, the Parthian Empire stretched from the northern reaches of the Euphrates, in what is now central-eastern Turkey, to eastern Iran. The empire, located on the Silk Road trade route between the Roman Empire in the Mediterranean Basin and the Han Empire of China, became a center of trade and commerce. - The Seleucid Empire (\\"Basileía tn Seleukidn\\") was a Hellenistic state ruled by the Seleucid dynasty, which existed from 312 BC to 63 BC; it was founded by Seleucus I Nicator following the division of the Macedonian empire vastly expanded by Alexander the Great. Seleucus received Babylonia and, from there, expanded his dominions to include much of Alexander's near eastern territories. At the height of its power, it included central Anatolia, Persia, the Levant, Mesopotamia, and what is now Kuwait, Afghanistan, and parts of Pakistan and Turkmenistan.

Article: Tony Burke, Australia's environment minister, says he won't decide until next year whether the koala should be protected as an endangered species. He was expected to make his decision by the end of October. But that decision has been put off. Burke said he needed more time to go over the latest information about the koala's population. In September, an Australian Senate committee reported that there was no question the koala's population is on the decrease. \\"But they may not yet be eligible for listing as a threatened species,\\" said Senator Doug Cameron. \\"To have such a significant Australian icon included on the threatened species list would be a national shame.\\" The koala is found only in the eucalyptus forests of Australia. And its population is reported to have fallen sharply for many reasons, including the cutting down of forests to make way for human beings' development, their own illness, climate change and killings by other animals such as wild dogs. And every year many koalas are hit by cars as they are trying to cross the busy roads. Putting off the decision on protection for the koala \\"is really bad news,\\" said Debbie Pointing, the president of the Koala Action Group. \\"We've worked tirelessly for many years to gather data on the populations,\\" Pointing said. \\"That data should be enough to make a decision.\\" However, Burke pointed out that the Australian government had spent at least 6.3 million on koala conservation efforts since 1996. senators listed efforts that are already underway in Queensland - the construction of special koala bridges as well as fences along roads, to keep the animals out of harm's way. Some people say that is not enough. \\"What we're doing at the moment is likely to drive this species to extinction,\\" Queensland University zoologist Bill Ellis said. \\"Koalas are an iconic Australian animal,\\" Burke told Australians. \\"They hold a special place in the hearts of Australians.\\" But it is a fact that if more isn't done to protect the koala, they might soon hold a place only in...

Options: - broke - headaches - grief - worries - empty The answer is \\"broke\\" because A:","completion":"If there is nothing left after paying bills, you are considered \\"broke.\\" So, out of the given options - broke, headaches, grief, worries, and empty - the most accurate and appropriate term to describe your financial situation is \\"broke.\\" Being broke means that you have exhausted all of your financial resources and have no money left at the end of a specific time period (like after paying bills, for example). Being in this situation can lead to a series of challenges and hardships. When you're broke, you may find it extremely difficult to afford basic necessities like food, clothing, and shelter. Furthermore, you might have trouble maintaining other aspects of your life that might require additional monetary support, such as emergency expenses, insurance premiums, healthcare, and maintenance costs. Being broke often comes with a great deal of stress and uncertainty. When one is in this financial position, they may suffer from headaches, grief, and worries – all of which are also included in the given list. These emotional responses can be direct by-products of dealing with financial strain. For instance, someone might experience headaches as a physical manifestation of stress, or grief due to feelings of personal failure, or worries about their ability to provide for their family. The term \\"empty\\" in this context may refer to an emotional experience due to financial struggles, but it's not the most accurate term to depict someone's financial situation when there is no money left after paying bills. Being broke addresses the very core of the financial state, highlighting that one lacks funds, whereas being empty would simply refer to the emotional heaviness that accompanies such a situation. Thus, the answer is \\"broke\\" because your financial reserves have been depleted, and you are left with no money to spare after addressing your bills and other financial obligations. While the other words — headaches, grief, worries, and empty — may represent feelings or experiences in association with being broke, they don't directly describe the financial situation at hand. The term \\"broke\\" most aptly encapsulates the absence of funds, which is the root cause of those emotions and experiences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: Babies who watch TV are more likely to show late learning development and language at 14 months, especially if they are watching programs aimed at adults and older children, according to a new study, which would probably surprise those parents who leave their babies in front of a TV set. Babies who watched 60 minutes of TV daily had developmental scores a third lower at 14 months than babies who were watching less TV. Although their developmental scores were still in the normal range, the difference may have been due to the fact that when children and parents are watching TV, they are missing the talking, playing and other communications that are important to learning and development. This new study, which appeared in the Aechives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, followed 259 lower-income families in New York, most of whom spoke Spanish as their primary language at home. Other studies of higher-income families have also come to the same conclusion: TV watching is not only non-educational, but it seems to slow down babies' development. But what about \\"good\\" TV, like Sesame Street? The researchers didn't find any difference when compared to non-educational programs designed for small children, like Spongebob SquarePants. Earlier research by some of the same scientists, most of whom are at New York University School of Medicine's Bellevue Hospital Centre, has found that parents whose children watch non-educational TV programs like Spongebob SquarePants spend less time reading to their children or teaching them. At this point, parents reading this will probably be astonished. TV is so often a parent's good friend, keeping children happily occupied so that the adults can cook dinner, answer the phone, or take a shower. But, clearly, this electronic babysitter is not an educational aid. It is best to make sure the babies are fast asleep if you have to watch TV. Question: We can infer from the passage that _ .

What is a place that sells suntan lotion but not food or medicine? - mini mall - shop - grocery store - pharmacy - drugstore The best answer is Answer:","completion":"A shop dedicated to beauty, skincare, and beach products would be the best place that sells suntan lotion but not food or medicine. Let me provide you with a detailed description of this type of shop: A beauty and skincare shop primarily specializes in offering a variety of products and items directly related to the care and enhancement of skin, hair, and overall personal appearance. These shops are specially curated to meet the growing needs of consumers who are conscious about their appearance, skincare, and grooming practices. In such a shop, you can typically find a wide array of products, including but not limited to suntan lotion, sunscreens, facial care items, body care items, makeup, hair care products, and various beauty tools and accessories. These products are specifically designed and crafted to not only protect the skin from potential damage but also to enhance one's overall appearance. One of the key focuses of this type of shop is providing sun protection products, such as suntan lotion. Suntan lotion plays a crucial role in shielding our skin from harmful UV (ultraviolet) rays that can cause sunburn, premature aging, and increase the risk of skin cancer. These shops cater to diverse customer needs by offering various types of suntan lotions that vary in SPF (sun protection factor) levels, textures, and formulations suitable for different skin types. Considering these shops focus on beauty and skincare products, you will not find food or medicine in their offerings. They are different from mini malls, grocery stores, pharmacies, or drugstores, which typically offer a wide range of products, including food, medicine, and other household items alongside beauty products. To conclude, the best place to buy suntan lotion without encountering food or medicine sections is a beauty and skincare shop. These specialty shops not only provide various sun protection options but also cater to numerous other personal care needs, making them the ideal choice for purchasing suntan lotion."},{"prompt":"Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.

Replace with spent batteries and then replace the battery compartment face plate. * Remove the battery compartment face plate, then use a small flathead screwdriver to pry out the old batteries. Replace with fresh batteries and then replace the battery compartment face plate.","completion":"The better solution for the goal of replacing the batteries in a child's electronic keyboard would be: * Remove the battery compartment face plate, then use a small flathead screwdriver to pry out the old batteries. Replace with fresh batteries and then replace the battery compartment face plate. There are several reasons why this option is preferable over the alternative. 1. Battery Removal and Replacement: The key objective in this task is to remove the old batteries and replace them with new ones. In the first option, it suggests replacing the old batteries with \\"spent\\" batteries, which would indicate that they are already depleted. The second option suggests using \\"fresh\\" batteries, ensuring that the keyboard will have the power it needs to function properly. 2. Tools: Although both options mention different kinds of screwdrivers, a small flathead screwdriver is more suitable for prying out batteries gently without causing damage to the battery compartment, springs, contacts, or the batteries themselves. A Phillips screwdriver, with its pointed tip and cross-shaped blade, is specialized for tightening or loosening screws and may not be the best choice for prying batteries out. Using a Phillips screwdriver for that purpose might work, but it could also make the task more difficult, less efficient, or potentially damaging. 3. Process: Both options involve removing the battery compartment face plate, but mentioning this step is essential because it ensures access to the batteries. Not including a description of how to remove the face plate could lead to confusion or incorrect attempts to access the batteries. 4. Clarity: The second option is more clearly written, specifying the use of fresh batteries and which type of screwdriver to use for prying out the old batteries. The first option does not clearly state its intended goal of battery replacement and could lead to further issues with the child's electronic keyboard if spent batteries are used. However, it is essential to note that sometimes the battery compartment on some devices can be removed without the need for tools or, alternatively, using the right size screwdriver for disassembling the battery compartment. It would be best to refer to the specific keyboard user manual for specific instructions or get professional help if necessary. Keep in mind that while performing the task, one must ensure that safety precautions are followed, especially when handling batteries and using tools."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Stephen Gough lost an appeal against a conviction for the breach of an Asbo. He appeared from Winchester Prison where he is serving a two-and-a-half-year sentence for breaching the order banning him from being naked in public. His counsel Matthew Scott argued Gough should have been allowed to appear naked at the original trial. Lady Justice Rafferty refused Gough's appeal. Clive Coleman, the BBC's legal affairs correspondent, said Gough, 56, almost certainly made legal history by appearing in his natural state. Gough was found guilty by a jury at Winchester Crown Court of breaching the Asbo in October 2014 and sentenced to 30 months imprisonment. He had refused to put on clothes as he left Winchester Prison after being imprisoned for a previous breach. At his trial, the judge refused his requests to appear naked and he was tried in his absence. Mr Scott argued at the Court of Appeal the judge should have made arrangements to allow the trial to take place with the defendant present, but naked. On the video link, he appeared seated and naked at the prison, with his lower half obscured by a table.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose wound is disinfected happens, how will it affect more bacteria reproduces. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the perturbation of disinfecting a wound can have a direct effect on the process of bacteria reproducing and spreading, which may lead to a decrease in the likelihood of infection and disease. When a wound is disinfected, an antiseptic solution is applied to the area, which helps to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms present in the wound. This can be achieved through various mechanisms, such as the disruption of bacterial cell walls or by targeting proteins essential for their replication. By disinfecting a wound, the following effects can be observed on the process: 1. Reduction of bacteria: Disinfecting the wound with an antiseptic solution can significantly reduce the number of bacteria present in the wound, potentially preventing them from reproducing and spreading to a level that causes problems. 2. Inhibition of bacterial growth: The disinfecting agent may not only kill bacteria but also inhibit their growth, making it more difficult for the remaining bacteria to reproduce and spread. Consequently, this increases the chance that the body's immune system can effectively deal with the bacteria before it becomes a problem. 3. Reduced symptoms and faster healing: With fewer bacteria present to cause infection and inflammation, the associated symptoms such as redness, swelling, and pain may be less severe. As a result, the wound may heal more quickly, reducing the likelihood of complications. 4. Prevention of disease: By reducing the overall bacterial load in the wound and inhibiting the growth of remaining bacteria, proper disinfection can play a crucial role in ensuring that a wound does not lead to a more severe infection or disease. In conclusion, the perturbation of wound disinfection has a direct effect on the process of bacterial reproduction and spread, reducing the overall bacterial load, inhibiting bacterial growth, and ultimately assisting in the prevention of infections and diseases. This is why it is essential to thoroughly clean and disinfect wounds, especially in cases of open injuries or potential exposure to harmful bacteria."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When her invitation does not arrive, she increases her dosage from double to triple and, as a result, begins to suffer from amphetamine psychosis. Meanwhile, Sara's son Harry is young and has an adventurous life with his girlfriend Marion Silver and best friend Tyrone C. Love. He and his friends are all heroin addicts, and Harry funds his habit through petty theft, including from his own mother who turns a blind eye. Tyrone decides that to support themselves, they should enter the illegal drug trade around Coney Island. With the promised money, each addict hopes to achieve their dreams. At first, the trio's drug dealing business thrives. However, Tyrone is imprisoned after fleeing the scene of a drug-gang assassination and Harry uses most of their earned money to post bail. After the assassination, the three find it much more difficult to find heroin due to supply being restricted by the Florida-based wholesalers. Eventually, Tyrone hears that the wholesaler is making a shipment, but the price is doubled and the minimum amount is high. Harry suggests that Marion ask for the needed cash from her psychiatrist in exchange for sex, which she does begrudgingly, and at a cost to her relationship with Harry. Tyrone and Harry go to meet the wholesaler, but the rest of the local low-level dealers are also there, and tensions are running high. There is...

(September 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Hatari! is the story of a group of adventurers in East Africa, engaged in the exciting and lucrative but dangerous business of catching wild animals for delivery to zoos around the world. As \\"Momella Game Ltd.\\", they operate from a compound near the town of Arusha. The head of the group is Sean Mercer (John Wayne); the others are safari veteran Little Wolf a/k/a \\"the Indian\\" (Bruce Cabot); drivers \\"Pockets\\" (Red Buttons), a former Brooklyn taxi driver, and Kurt (Hardy KrÃ¼ger), a German auto racing driver; roper Luis (Valentin de Vargas), a former Mexican former bullfighter, and Brandy (Michele Girardon), a young woman whose late father was a member of the group; she grew up there. Their method (shown in several action sequences) is to chase the selected animal across the plains with a truck, driven by Pockets. Sean stands in the bed of the truck with a rope noose on a long pole, and snags the animal by its head. (For smaller animals, Sean rides in a seat mounted on the truck's left front fender.) A smaller, faster \\"herding car,\\" driven by Kurt, swings outside, driving the animal back toward the \\"catching truck\\". Once the animal is snagged, Luis, an expert roper, catches its legs and secures it. The animal is then moved into a travel crate and carried on a third truck, driven by Brandy. The captured animals are held in pens in the compound, tended by native workers, until they are shipped out at the end of the hunting season. Sometimes the group ranges far outside the compound for several days, accompanied by additional trucks with camp equipment. In the opening sequence, the group chases a rhinoceros, but it attacks the herding car and severely gores the Indian, who has to be transported to the Arusha hospital. While they are waiting to hear about the Indian's condition, a young Frenchman...

William Ben Hogan (August 13, 1912 - July 25, 1997) was an American professional golfer who is generally considered to be one of the greatest players in the history of the game. He was born within six months of Sam Snead and Byron Nelson, who were two other acknowledged golf greats of the 20th century. Hogan is notable for his profound influence on golf swing theory and his legendary ball-striking ability. His nine career professional major championships tie him with Gary Player for fourth all-time, trailing only Jack Nicklaus (18), Tiger Woods (14) and Walter Hagen (11). Hogan was born in Stephenville, Texas, the third and youngest child of Chester and Clara (Williams) Hogan. His father was a blacksmith and the family lived ten miles southwest in Dublin until 1921, when they moved 70 miles (112 km) northeast to Fort Worth. When Hogan was nine years old in 1922, his father Chester committed suicide with a self-inflicted gunshot at the family home. By some accounts, Chester committed suicide in front of him, which some (including Hogan biographer James Dodson) have cited as the cause of his introverted personality in later years. The family incurred financial difficulties after his father's suicide, and the children took jobs to help their seamstress mother make ends meet. Older brother Royal quit school at age 14 to deliver office supplies by bicycle, and nine-year-old Ben sold newspapers after school at the nearby train station. A tip from a friend led him to caddying at the age of 11 at Glen Garden Country Club, a nine-hole course seven miles (11 km) to the south. One of his fellow caddies at Glen Garden was Byron Nelson, later a tour rival. The two would tie for the lead at the annual Christmas caddie tournament in December 1927, when both were 15. Nelson sank a 30-foot putt to tie on the ninth and final hole. Instead of sudden death, they played another nine holes; Nelson sank another substantial putt on the final green to win by a stroke. The following spring, Nelson was granted the only junior membership offered by the members of Glen Garden. Club rules did not allow caddies age 16 and older, so after August 1928, Hogan took his game to three scrubby daily-fee courses: Katy Lake, Worth Hills, and Z-Boaz. Where did he grow up?","completion":"William Ben Hogan grew up in Texas. He was born in Stephenville, and his family later moved to Dublin and then to Fort Worth. He started caddying at Glen Garden Country Club when he was 11 years old, and played golf at other courses like Katy Lake, Worth Hills, and Z-Boaz when he was older."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Based on the premise \\"I should have to request absolute secrecy for the time being.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Secrecy is not required at any time. \\" is true?","completion":"No, we cannot conclude that the statement \\"Secrecy is not required at any time\\" is true based on the premise \\"I should have to request absolute secrecy for the time being.\\" The premise, \\"I should have to request absolute secrecy for the time being,\\" indicates that the person speaking or writing believes that secrecy is important in the current context or at this specific time. The phrase \\"for the time being\\" has temporal connotations and refers to a temporary state of affairs or a situation that is currently in place but may change in the future. This suggests that the person believes that secrecy is required under certain circumstances or during a specific period of time. On the other hand, the statement \\"Secrecy is not required at any time\\" is an absolute proposition. It implies that there is never a need or requirement for secrecy, and this is a universal condition that applies regardless of the situation or circumstances. These two statements, therefore, convey differing viewpoints on the need for secrecy. The original premise argues for the need for secrecy in certain instances or under certain conditions, while the subsequent hypothesis denies any need for secrecy at any time. So, these two statements are mutually exclusive, meaning that if the original premise is true, then the subsequent hypothesis cannot be true, and vice versa. As a result, if we accept the original premise that \\"I should have to request absolute secrecy for the time being,\\" we cannot also accept the hypothesis that \\"Secrecy is not required at any time.\\" In this respect, it's critical to recognize that the concept of \\"secrecy\\" is not always absolute but can be situational and context-specific. The need for secrecy can change based on a variety of factors such as what is at stake, who is involved, the implications of disclosure, and so forth. A more plausible scenario might be to revise the hypothesis to reflect that there may be times when secrecy is not required or relevant, but there could also be circumstances where it is needed, conforming to the premise more accurately. Instead of an unqualified \\"Secrecy is not required at any time\\", the hypothesis could say, \\"Secrecy may not be required at all times\\" which doesn't directly counter the premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ash is thrown in a pit where he kills a Deadite and regains his weapons from Arthur's Wise Man. After demanding Henry and his men be set free, as he knew it was a witch hunt, and killing a Deadite publicly, Ash is celebrated as a hero. He grows attracted to Sheila, the sister of one of Arthur's fallen knights. According to the Wise Man, the only way Ash can return to his time is through the magical Necronomicon Ex-Mortis.

Given the question: You are given a new situation: Rob is experimenting with how air pressure works. To that end, he has designed two tests. In the first test the air flow works as it would in an airplane wing. He labels it as case A. In the second test the air flow works as it would in a race car spoiler. He labels it as case B. He is surprised to see that air flow behaves differently in different situations. and a hint : Bernoulli’s law explains how the wings of both airplanes and birds create lift that allows flight (see Figure below ). The shape of the wings causes air to flow more quickly — and air pressure to be lower — above the wings than below them. This allows the wings to lift the plane or bird above the ground against the pull of gravity. A spoiler on a race car, like the one in Figure below , works in the opposite way. Its shape causes air to flow more slowly — and air pressure to be greater — above the spoiler than below it. As a result, air pressure pushes the car downward, giving its wheels better traction on the track. Please answer this question : Would case A have higher or lower air pressure above it than case B? The answer is:","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the given information. - In case A (airplane wing) air flows more quickly above the wing, resulting in lower air pressure above the wing. - In case B (race car spoiler) air flows more slowly above the spoiler, resulting in higher air pressure above it.

Aside from his work in Nine Inch Nails, Reznor has also collaborated with numerous other artists and bands and has ventured into the world of film scoring with his work on successful films such as \\"The Social Network\\" (2010), \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" (2011), and \\"Gone Girl\\" (2014), among others. This showcases that Trent Reznor's origin is the United States. Shout Out Louds, on the other hand, is an indie-pop band hailing from Stockholm, Sweden. The band was formed in 2001 and consists of Adam Olenius (vocals, guitar), Ted Malmros (bass), Carl von Arbin (guitar), Eric Edman (drums), and Bebban Stenborg (keyboards, accordion, glockenspiel, moog, vocals). Shout Out Louds gained international recognition with their debut album, \\"Howl Howl Gaff Gaff\\" (2003), which featured a unique blend of catchy melodies and thought-provoking lyrics. The band's music is often characterized by its playful, upbeat sound with strong influences from 80's and 90's indie rock groups. Shout Out Louds have continued to be active in the music scene, and released their latest album, \\"Ease My Mind\\" (2017), showcasing their consistent growth and musical evolution. As mentioned previously, the Shout Out Louds band is from Sweden. Now, considering the information presented above, we can conclude that Trent Reznor and Shout Out Louds are not from the same country. Reznor is an American musician originating from the United States, while Shout Out Louds is a Swedish band with roots firmly placed in Stockholm, Sweden. Although both artists belong to the broader spectrum of alternative rock, their backgrounds showcase the diverse range of geographical influences within the genre. This enriches the world of music and presents listeners with a wide array of various styles and cultural aspects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Summarize this article: Figures obtained by BBC Wales show South Wales Fire and Rescue Service recorded the highest number of delays - 460 - since January 2013. Reasons included access problems and being sent in the wrong direction. Firefighter David Bound told the BBC delays were \\"a daily occurrence, sometimes several times a day\\". Mid and west Wales firefighters were delayed just 11 times in three years and the north Wales service 57 times. Crews across Wales have tackled more than 9,000 fires since January 2013. The main reason for delays was access problems, with firefighters held up 364 times, and there were 114 delays due to crews not being able to find the blaze. Firefighters were sent in the wrong direction 47 times and on three occasions \\"civil disturbances\\" held up crews in south Wales. Mr Bound, watch manager at Tonypandy in Rhondda Cynon Taff, said access problems happened daily. \\"Engines are quite long and wide and some streets are so narrow, with cars parked. Once we arrive we have got to get the equipment and get out of the fire engine ourselves. \\"We understand it's difficult for people to park by their own houses but [it would help] if more people did think to acknowledge tight corners in their locality. \\"Delays because of access are a daily occurrence, sometimes several times a day.\\" Mr Bound said poor or a lack of directions can also cause problems. \\"We had a call recently for Penrhys and the only information we had was 'Penrhys estate' so the vehicle had to search through the estate for the fire. \\"We will always attend as quickly as we can, and force entry quite quickly. \\"But if there is a delay for whatever reason it delays us in our duties which could have an impact on people's lives.\\" The number of delays fell over the three years in south and north Wales, but rose in mid and west Wales. Firefighters in south Wales were delayed 187 times in 2013, 138 times in 2014 and the most recent figure for 2015 was 135. In north Wales there were 26 delays in 2013, which dropped to 14 by 2015. Mid and west Wales fighters were delayed just once in 2013 and five times in 2014 and 2015. Some parts of Wales - including Carmarthenshire - did not record any delays in three years while Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire only recorded one each. Summary:","completion":"Figures from BBC Wales reveal that the South Wales Fire and Rescue Service recorded the highest number of delays, 460, since January 2013. The main reason for the delays was access problems, with firefighters being held up 364 times. Additionally, 114 delays were due to crews unable to find the fire location, while 47 instances were caused by being sent in the wrong direction.

Article: New archaeological discovers suggest that trade between Europe and Asia along the Silk Road probably began in some form many countries earlier than once thought. The findings, _ with a widening range of scientific and historical research, could add a fascinating new page to the epic of the Silk Road. The latest and most surprising discovery is pieces of silk found in the hair of an Egyptian mummy from about 1000 BC, long before regular traffic on the Silk Road and at least one thousand years before silk was previously thought to be used in Egypt. Other research may extend human activity along this route back even further, perhaps a million years to the migration of human ancestors into eastern Asia. The official origin of East-West commerce along the road is usually placed in the late 2nd century BC when an agent of the Chinese Emperor Wu-di returned from a dangerous secret mission across the desert into the remote high country of Central Asia. The agent, Zhang Qian, travelled as far as Afghanistan and brought back knowledge of even more distant lands such as Persia, Syria and a place known as Lijien, perhaps Rome. Historians have called this one of the most important journeys in ancient times. His journey opened the way for what have been thought to be the first indirect contacts between the ancient world's two superpowers, China and Rome. Chinese silk, first traded to central Asian tribes for war horses and to the Parthians of old Persia in exchange for acrobats and ostrich eggs, was soon finding its way through a network of merchants to the luxury markets of Rome. But the new discoveries show that Chinese silk was apparently present in the West long before the Han emperor started organized trade over the Silk Road. The research could change thinking about the early history of world trade and provide insights into the mystery of just how and when Europe and the Mediterranean lands first became aware of the glorious culture at the other end of Eurasia. Question: The silk thread found in the hair of an Egyptian mummy suggests that _ . Options: A: Egyptians had probably travelled to China to buy silk B: trade along the Silk Road began earlier than once thought C: historical research often achieves fascinating results D: new light can now be thrown on ancient trading practices Answer:","completion":"B: trade along the Silk Road began earlier than once thought"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: you've never seen the great American desert Sentence 2: I saw the photos you took of the great American desert. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"Step 1: Understand the two sentences. Sentence 1 states that \\"you\\" have never seen the great American desert. Sentence 2 states that \\"I\\" (the speaker) saw the photos \\"you\\" took of the great American desert. Step 2: Analyze if the second sentence logically follows from the first sentence. The first sentence implies that the person being addressed has not personally seen the great American desert. However, this does not prevent the possibility that this person took photos of the desert without directly seeing it (perhaps using a camera mounted on a drone or relying on someone else to take the photos). The second sentence implies that the person being addressed did indeed take photos of the desert, which could be true even if they have not personally seen the desert. Conclusion: The second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence, as the information provided by the sentences is not contradictory, but also does not necessarily imply the second sentence based on the first.

They convey different information about the relationship between the river Geamărtălui and the Strâmba River in Romania. 1. In the first sentence: \\"The river Geamărtălui is a tributary of the Strâmba River in Romania.\\" This sentence suggests that the river Geamărtălui is a smaller river that flows into the larger Strâmba River. In geographical terms, a tributary refers to a river or stream that flows into a larger river, adding to its volume.

In the second sentence: \\"The Strâmba River is a tributary of the River Geamărtălui in Romania.\\" This sentence reverses the roles of the two rivers, stating that the Strâmba River is the tributary that flows into the Geamărtălui River. This means that the Strâmba River is the smaller river in this case and the Geamărtălui River is the main river. Therefore, these two sentences do not convey the same information.

When a student is attacked and seriously wounded by a serial rapist, Dr. Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin), a brilliant surgeon who has recently joined the staff of the area hospital, operates and saves her life. Money is tight, so Andy invites him to rent the third floor of their home, in order to finance the new plumbing. With his propensity to bring home sexual partners and to party late into the night, Jed quickly proves himself to be a less-than-ideal tenant. When Paula Bell (Gwyneth Paltrow), one of Andy's students, is attacked and killed by the serial rapist, Andy is the one to find her body, prompting police Detective Dana Harris (Bebe Neuwirth) to view him as a possible suspect. Harris asks Andy to come to the police station and submit a semen sample to clear his name. While at the police station, Andy learns that Tracy has been hospitalized and is being operated on by Jed. In removing one of Tracy's ovaries, which has ruptured due to a cyst, Jed discovers Tracy is pregnant, but the stress of the procedure causes the fetus to abort. Another doctor notices that Tracy's other ovary is torsed and appears necrotic. Jed consults with Andy and advises him to agree to the removal of Tracy's second ovary, rather than risk her life. Andy painfully agrees, since this will mean that Tracy can never have children. Jed overrules the protests of other doctors that the ovary might still be healthy and he removes it. After the removal, it is confirmed that the ovary was, in fact, healthy. With this knowledge, Tracy and Andy decide to sue Jed and the hospital.

Write some highlights for the following article: Scientist David O'Reilly, who works for the tobacco industry, said nicotine makes your brain work better. A scientist employed by one of the biggest cigarette manufacturers today said nicotine is good for your health. Group scientific director for British American Tobacco, which makes Benson & Hedges, Dunhill and Lucky Strikes, David O'Reilly has been branded 'irresponsible' and accused of telling just part of the story. He told the Sunday Times Magazine smoking helps a person's brain work more effectively, adding: 'It helps with cognition, stimulation and relaxes.' His controversial claim came just a week after New York University researchers warned smokers of ecigarettes could inhale more nicotine than those who smoke regular cigarettes. Mr O'Reilly said likened taking a puff from an ecigarette to drinking a cup of coffee, as he claimed the practise was safe. But the senior molecular biologist has come under fire from health experts, who have accused him of trying to help 'sell as many cigarettes as possible'. Professor John Britton, chairman of the Royal College of Physicians tobacco advisory group and professor of epidemiology at the University of Nottingham, said one hit of nicotine can have positive effects on the brain. But he warned the drug is highly addictive, leaving smokers needing to get their hit to enable their brains to function normally. 'It is true that in a single use,. nicotine probably does improve concentration and hand-eye co-ordination,. on a par with what you get from caffeine,' he said. Health expert Professor John Britton claimed Mr O'Reilly's claim was 'irresponsible' accusing him of trying to 'sell more cigarettes' 'But it is also a powerfully addictive drug, and there comes a time when you need nicotine just for your brain to function normally.' A spokesman for BAT, said the company 'absolutely' stood by Mr O'Reilly's statement. He said Mr O'Reilly had not advised the drug was good for you in the sense of keeping well hydrated. A spokeswoman for Cancer Research added: ' We don't fully understand the long-term effects of nicotine use.'

Here are the options: Pick your answer from: [I] yes; [II] it is not possible to tell; [III] no; Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"[III] No, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The premise states that you begin with a yearling colt and not three-year-olds. This implies that you are starting with horses that are one year old instead of three years old; it provides information about the initial state of the horses you are working with. It sets the stage for further discussion or context, but it does not provide explicit information about the final state of the yearling colt. The hypothesis states that you need to end with a yearling colt. This suggests that the desired outcome is to have the horse still be a yearling by the end of some process or experience. The hypothesis is focused on the final state of the horse, and it assumes that the horse needs to remain a yearling for some reason. Given the premise, we do not have enough information to determine whether the hypothesis is true or not. The premise only tells us the starting point, with one-year-old horses, rather than providing any details about how those horses are supposed to develop, be trained, or otherwise change over time. It is not possible to tell from the premise whether the horse will remain a yearling at the end of the process, as the hypothesis proposes.

Mike Glover, who has managed the bridge project for the decade since it was first approved, told the BBC its design would make it easy to maintain. The new 1.7 miles (2.7km) crossing over the river Forth will open to traffic for the first time on Wednesday. It will take most of the vehicles that currently travel over the 53-year-old Forth Road Bridge. The existing suspension bridge will be adapted to be used by lighter traffic such as cycles, pedestrians and public transport. Mr Glover told the BBC Radio Four documentary Gordon Goes Forth that despite the Forth Road Bridge being replaced because of issues about its safety and reliability, it could last another 50 years if it was properly maintained. Wednesday 30 August At about 01:00, the Queensferry Crossing will fully open to traffic in both directions. Police will put in a place a rolling roadblock to stop traffic driving across the Forth Road Bridge and will redirect them across the Queensferry Crossing. The northbound carriageway will be opened first. The southbound carriageway will be opened about 45 minutes later. The bridge will be fully open to traffic for the rest of the day and the following day. Friday 1 September At about 01:00 the Queensferry Crossing will close to all traffic. Police will redirect all vehicles back across the Forth Road Bridge. It will remain closed until the early hours of Wednesday morning Saturday 2 and Sunday 3 September About 50,000 members of the public, who were given tickets after a ballot, will get a \\"once in a lifetime\\" chance to walk over the new bridge on Saturday and Sunday. The Queen will officially open the Queensferry Crossing. She will be joined by the Duke of Edinburgh. The Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland will bless the bridge, and the Queen will cut a ribbon on the south side. Tuesday 5 September A chance for a further 10,000 local people and school children to walk the bridge. Wednesday 6 September The bridge will re-open to traffic, with no pedestrian access. The initial speed limit will be 40mph but after work has been completed to adapt the Forth Road Bridge public transport will be switched back to the old bridge and the Queensferry Crossing will become a 70 mph motorway. The current Forth Road Bridge opened in 1964 but a serious problem was found with corrosion of the wires inside its cables not long after its 40th birthday. The corrosion meant that the bridge's cables had already lost about 10% of their strength and it was forecast that it might not be able to take the heavy loads for much more than a decade. The decision to replace it was taken in 2007, with construction of the new crossing beginning in September 2011. Mr Glover, who has been the technical director of the Queensferry Crossing since 2007, calls it a \\"world class bridge\\" which will be around well into the 22nd Century. He said: \\"The length of time this bridge will be in position will be well in excess of 120 years - 150 years.\\" The civil engineer said there were two main reasons for predicting such longevity. \\"The first is that the exterior of the bridge is a continuous structure - it is a box - which means the level of maintenance that is required is very minimal, unlike the trusses on the current suspension bridge,\\" Mr Glover said. \\"The second is because the individual cables that make up the cable-stay bridge each one can be replaced without the stability of the bridge being in doubt. \\"Whereas with the suspension bridge any problem with that suspension cable means that the bridge would have to be closed.\\" Despite the problems with the existing Forth Road Bridge, Mr Glover predicted it could survive for another 50 years now that it would be carrying lighter loads. He says: \\"It does require the maintenance regime to be maintained but with modern instrumentation we will know where to look for issues.\\" The documentary Gordon goes Forth, presented by Gordon Brown, will be on BBC Radio Four at 20:00 on Monday 28 August.

It could last another 50 years with proper maintenance. The Queensferry Crossing will fully open to traffic, starting with the northbound carriageway, on August 30. However, the bridge will close from September 1 until the early hours of September 6 for various events including a public walkover, an official opening by Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh, and further walks by local people and school children. The initial speed limit on the Queensferry Crossing will be 40mph, increasing to 70mph after adjustments have been made to the Forth Road Bridge to accommodate public transport. Mike Glover, technical director of the Queensferry Crossing, believes the new bridge will remain in place for at least 120-150 years due to its structural stability and the ease of replacing individual cables of the cable-stay bridge. The Forth Road Bridge had a serious problem of cable corrosion, which led to the decision to replace it in 2007."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who was transferred to the asylum while one of his children was \\"crying as though her heart would break\\"? ? Smetana's biographers describe him as physically frail and unimpressive in appearance yet, at least in his youth, he had a joie-de-vivre that women evidently found attractive. He was also excitable, passionate and strong-willed, determined to make his career in music whatever the hardships, over the wishes of his father who wanted him to become a brewer or a civil servant. Throughout his career he stood his ground; when under the severest of criticism for the \\"Wagnerism\\" in Dalibor he responded by writing Libuše, even more firmly based on the scale and concept of Wagnerian music drama. His personal life became stressful; his marriage to Bettina was loveless, and effectively broke down altogether in the years of illness and relative poverty towards the end of his life. Little of his relationships with his children is on record, although on the day that he was transferred to the asylum, Žofie was \\"crying as though her heart would break\\". There is broad agreement among most commentators that Smetana created a canon of Czech opera where none had previously existed, and that he developed a style of music in all his compositions that equated with the emergent Czech national spirit. A modified view is presented by the music writer Michael Steen, who questions whether \\"nationalistic music\\" can in fact exist: \\"We should recognise that, whereas music is infinitely expressive, on its own it is not good at describing concrete, earthly objects or concepts.\\" He concludes that much is dependent upon what listeners are conditioned to hear.According to the musicologist John Tyrrell, Smetana's close identification with Czech nationalism and the tragic circumstances of his last years, have affected the objectivity of assessments of his work, particularly in his native land. Tyrrell argues that the almost iconic status awarded to Smetana in his homeland \\"monumentalized him into a figure where any criticism of his life or work was discouraged\\" by the Czech authorities, even as late as the last part of the 20th century.

Review: so overwrought you 'd swear he just stepped out of a buñuel retrospective Is this movie review sentence negative or positive? Choose from: [1]. negative [2]. positive The answer is:","completion":"[1]. negative This movie review sentence can be considered negative for a few reasons. The reviewer seems to provide a rather unfavorable commentary on the film based on the words and tone used. Let's break down the sentence to analyze its negativity more thoroughly. 1. \\"Overwrought\\" suggests that the movie is excessively dramatic, complicated, or emotional, to the point that it is overwhelming or exhausting. This term typically has a negative connotation, implying that the movie might not be enjoyable for viewers due to its intensity or unnecessary complexity. 2. \\"You'd swear\\" implies that the viewer would be convinced of a certain aspect of the film, which, in this case, is its exaggerated nature. This phrase suggests that the reviewer believes the film's overwrought characteristics are quite apparent, reinforcing the negative opinion expressed in the review. 3. \\"Just stepped out of a Buñuel retrospective\\" is a reference to the famous Spanish filmmaker Luis Buñuel, known for his surrealism and avant-garde works. While some cinema enthusiasts admire Buñuel and his unique style, the sentence implies that the specific film being reviewed is overly concerned with imitating Buñuel's approach. Instead of being an original, engaging work, this part of the sentence suggests that the film lacks creativity and authenticity, borrowing heavily from another filmmaker's style. Overall, the movie review sentence has a negative tone and highlights unfavorable aspects of the film, such as its overwrought nature and dependence on the influence of another director's style."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more global warming occurs happens, how will it affect LESS erosion by the ocean. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"In the case of more global warming, it would generally lead to increased erosion by the ocean due to several factors. However, to explore how it might theoretically affect LESS erosion, let's analyze the following possibilities: 1. Sea level rise: Global warming results in melting ice caps and glaciers, causing sea levels to rise. This may lead to a reduction in the energy of waves in some coastal areas due to the greater distance they need to travel to reach land, potentially reducing erosion to a small extent. However, in many cases, higher sea levels would also lead to greater inundation of coastal areas, ultimately increasing erosion. 2. Changes in ocean circulation: Global warming can cause changes in ocean currents and circulation patterns, which could alter the distribution of sand and sediment along coastlines. Depending on specific regional conditions, these changes might result in reduced coastal erosion in some locations by depositing more sand and sediment on the shores, thereby \\"protecting\\" them from erosion. This would be an indirect effect. 3. Reduced storm frequency or intensity: Global warming is generally expected to increase the frequency and intensity of storms, leading to more coastal erosion. However, if global warming resulted in fewer or less intense storms in specific regions, this could result in less erosion in those areas. Overall, global warming is likely to increase ocean erosion in most cases, but there might exist specific circumstances or locations where it could contribute to reduced erosion. The perturbation hypothesis proposed (global warming leading to less erosion) therefore has a limited direct effect on the process, and any reduction in erosion would be primarily attributed to indirect effects."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Information: - Alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the United States.

James was 35 and had been HIV positive for 20 years, and Bill, who was 54 and was not HIV positive. They booked them and let them go. and a hint : HIV , or human immunodeficiency virus, causes AIDS. AIDS stands for \\"acquired immune deficiency syndrome.\\" It is a condition that causes death and does not have a known cure. AIDS usually develops 10 to 15 years after a person is first infected with HIV. The development of AIDS can be delayed with proper medicines. The delay can be well over 20 years with the right medicines. Today, individuals who acquire HIV after 50 years of age can expect to reach an average human life span. Please answer this question : Which person had an incurable disease? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, James, the 35-year-old homeless person, has an incurable disease. He has been HIV positive for 20 years, and HIV is the virus that causes AIDS — an acquired immune deficiency syndrome that does not have a known cure. While the development of AIDS can be delayed with proper medicines, and the delay can be well over 20 years with the right medicines, James is still living with an incurable disease. It is important to note that although there is currently no known cure for AIDS, advancements in medical treatment have made it possible for people living with HIV to manage their condition and live relatively healthy lives. The availability and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), which is used to treat HIV infections, can help to suppress the viral load in an individual's body, significantly reducing the risk of transmission and delaying the progression to AIDS. Furthermore, today's medical advancements have allowed individuals who acquire HIV after 50 years of age to expect to reach an average human lifespan, which is an optimistic outlook for those who have access to and can afford proper healthcare. In comparison, Bill, the 54-year-old homeless person, is not HIV positive and thus does not have an incurable disease in the context of the information given. However, it is essential to clarify that the absence of an HIV infection does not guarantee a complete absence of any other potential health issues or incurable diseases. Homeless individuals face numerous challenges, including limited access to healthcare resources, exposure to harsh living conditions, and higher vulnerability to various communicable and non-communicable diseases. As such, it remains crucial to ensure that both James and Bill receive appropriate care, treatment, and support to improve their overall health and wellbeing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Born Florence Annie Bridgwood in Hamilton, Ontario, she was youngest of three children of George Bridgwood, an English-born carriage builder and Charlotte \\"Lotta\\" Bridgwood (nee Dunn), a vaudeville actress. Charlotte Bridgwood had emigrated to Canada from Ireland after the Great Famine with her family as a child. She was known professionally as Lotta Lawrence and was the leading lady and director of the Lawrence Dramatic Company. At the age of three, Lawrence made her debut onstage with her mother in a song and dance routine. Finding themselves \\"at liberty,\\" Lawrence and Solter in 1909 were able to join the Independent Moving Pictures Company of America (IMP). The company, founded by Carl Laemmle, the owner of a film exchange (who later absorbed IMP into Universal Pictures, which he also founded and also the president), was looking for experienced filmmakers and actors. Needing a star, he lured Lawrence away from Biograph by promising to give her a marquee. First, Laemmle organized a publicity stunt by starting a rumor that Lawrence had been killed by a street car in New York City. Then, after gaining much media attention, he placed ads in the newspapers that announced, \\"We nail a lie\\", and included a photo of Lawrence. The ad declared she is alive and well and making The Broken Oath, a new movie for his IMP Film Company to be directed by Solter. Laemmle had Lawrence make a personal appearance in St. Louis, Missouri in March 1910 with her leading man to show her fans that she was very much alive, making her one of the first performers not already famous in another medium to be identified by name by her studio. Laemmle generated attention by falsely claiming that Lawrence's St. Louis fans were so excited to learn that she had not died that they rushed her in a frenzy and tore her clothes off. Partially due to Laemmle's ingenuity, the \\"star system\\" was born and before long, Florence Lawrence became a household name. However, her fame also proved that the studio executives who had concerns over wage demands soon had their fears proved correct. Laemmle managed to lure William Ranous, one of Vitagraph's best directors, over to IMP. Ranous introduced Laemmle to Lawrence and Solter, and they began to work together. Lawrence and Solter worked for IMP for eleven months, making fifty films. After this, they went on vacation in Europe. When they returned to the United States, they joined a film company headed by Siegmund Lubin, described as the \\"wisest and most democratic film producer in history\\". She once again teamed with Arthur Johnson, and the pair made 48 films together under Lubin's direction. At the time, the film industry was controlled by the Motion Picture Patents Company (MPPC), a trust formed by the major film companies. IMP was not a member of the MPPC, and hence operated outside its distribution system. Theaters found showing IMP films lost the right to screen MPPC films. IMP, therefore, had powerful enemies in the film industry. It managed to survive largely due to Lawrence's popularity.

Le secteur de la pêche doit avant tout faire face au problème de l'inefficacité de la surveillance et de la répression de la pêche illégale, faute de patrouilles adéquates. Translate to English.","completion":"The fishing sector must first and foremost address the problem of the inefficiency of monitoring and cracking down on illegal fishing, due to a lack of adequate patrols. The fishing industry is a vital source of food and economic activity for many countries around the world. However, one of the primary challenges this sector faces is the issue of ineffective monitoring and enforcement against illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. In particular, insufficient patrol efforts have made it difficult for authorities to prevent or combat these unlawful practices. IUU fishing has wide-ranging consequences for the marine environment, as well as the communities that rely on this resource for their livelihoods. Some of the most negative impacts include: 1. Overfishing: When human intervention exceeds the biological capacity of fish populations to reproduce, this can lead to a depletion of stocks, threatening both the species and ecosystem as a whole. This can further result in the loss of food supplies, employment opportunities, and revenue for local communities. 2. Negative effects on marine ecosystems: Illegal fishing can be particularly damaging to marine environments, as it frequently employs methods that are indiscriminate and destructive, such as bottom trawling or the use of illegal fishing gear. These practices can destroy essential fish habitat, and negatively impact other marine species, including endangered ones. 3. Economic losses: IUU fishing can cause significant economic harm, as legitimate fishers face unfair competition from those who do not comply with sustainable practices and regulations. Furthermore, governments may lose out on valuable tax revenue and may be forced to allocate additional resources to combating illegal activities. 4. Undermining regulations and management efforts: IUU fishing represents a direct challenge to the rule of law and can undermine the efforts of national and international authorities to manage fisheries resources in a sustainable manner. To address these far-reaching consequences, several key measures need to be undertaken to improve the surveillance and enforcement of illegal fishing practices: 1. Enhance international cooperation: Collaboration between governments, regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs), and other stakeholders is crucial for sharing information and best practices, as well as coordinating enforcement efforts against illegal fishing operators. 2. Increase resources for monitoring and enforcement: Governments should allocate more financial and human resources to the development of patrol and surveillance capacities, including the use of modern technology such as satellite imaging, drones, and data analysis tools. 3. Improve traceability and transparency: Implementing robust, transparent, and traceable systems to track the movement of fish from capture to market can make it more difficult for IUU-caught fish to enter global supply chains, thus reducing the profitability of these illicit activities. 4. Develop stricter sanctions and penalties: Stronger legal frameworks and sufficient penalties should be put in place to deter would-be offenders. Additionally, enforcing sanctions against those who finance or facilitate illegal fishing operations can assist in combating this issue. In conclusion, improving the surveillance and enforcement efforts against illegal fishing practices is not only essential for the long-term sustainability of the fishing industry, but it also has significant benefits for the overall health of marine ecosystems, local communities, and the global economy. By taking a concerted, multi-pronged approach that involves closer cooperation, investment in monitoring infrastructure, and stronger penalties for offenders, it is possible to make significant progress in the battle against IUU fishing."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Cu toate acestea, unii agricultori din America de Sud exploatează defrișările și sunt capabili să producă în masă și să ofere prețuri mai competitive decât agricultorii europeni, ca urmare a unei reglementări mai puțin stricte. Translate this to English?","completion":"Nonetheless, some farmers in South America take advantage of deforestation and are able to produce in large quantities and offer more competitive prices than European farmers, as a result of less stringent regulations. In this statement, the author is discussing the issue of deforestation in South America and its connection to agricultural practices. The deforestation practices in the region can offer short-term benefits to farmers, as it allows them to clear vast areas of land quickly and cheaply, enabling them to produce large quantities of crops. This increased production leads to more competitive prices in comparison to European farmers, who may be subject to stricter environmental regulations and land management policies. However, while this approach might offer some economic advantages for the South American farmers, it also contributes to environmental issues such as loss of biodiversity, disruption of ecosystems, and increased carbon dioxide emissions due to forest degradation. Moreover, the long-term consequences of deforestation can be detrimental to the sustainability of agriculture in the region, as the removal of forests may result in soil erosion, loss of soil fertility, and a decrease in water quality and availability. European farmers, on the other hand, may face stricter regulations that aim to protect the environment and promote sustainable agricultural practices. These regulations may range from limitations on the use of pesticides and fertilizers, to requirements for maintaining certain levels of biodiversity and habitat conservation, among others. Although these regulations might lead to higher production costs and less competitive prices in comparison to the South American counterparts, they can contribute to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly approach to agriculture. In conclusion, the statement highlights a crucial issue in modern agriculture: the balance between increased production, competitive prices, and the potential environmental impact. It prompts us to reconsider the importance of sustainable practices in agriculture and the long-term implications of deforestation in South America, as well as the role of regulations and guidelines in protecting the environment and promoting responsible farming."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He is best friends with prince Sancho and is secretly in a romantic relationship with Jimena, the daughter of count Gormaz. Unfortunately, Gormaz disapproves, and suggests that Jimena should marry the arrogant and self-centered count OrdoÃ±ez. As the royal court receives word that the Almoravids of Zaragoza had crossed the Castilian border, Rodrigo gets the opportunity to accompany Sancho, OrdoÃ±es and Gormaz on a scouting mission. Once they set up camp, Gormaz is ambushed by Al-Mu'tamin and his warriors, but Rodrigo intervenes. Once Al-Mu'tamin gets the chance to speak, he is allowed by Sancho to accompany them back to the palace. Some time later, king Ferdinand dies, and the devious and power-hungry princess Urraca plots to have Sancho killed so that the weak-minded prince Alfonso can be crowned. Gormaz meets with Rodrigo on a balcony, on Jimenas request, where Rodrigo asks for her hand in marriage. Gormaz refuses, and instead challenges Rodrigo to a swordfight. Rodrigo is hesitant to fight, but when Gormaz insists, he draws his sword. As the two fight, Urraca sends out her lover and servant to assassinate Sancho by stabbing him in the back with a dagger. At the same time, Rodrigo accidentally kills Gormaz. When Jimena witnesses, she vows to never speak to Rodrigo ever again, and he is forced to flee the scene.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who still appealed in his images and cultural references to an elite humanist and aristocratic audience? ? Little is known for certain of the life of Hieronymus Bosch or of the commissions or influences that may have formed the basis for the iconography of his work. His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history. Although Bosch's career flourished during the High Renaissance, he lived in an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. He would have been familiar with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.José de Sigüenza is credited with the first extensive critique of The Garden of Earthly Delights, in his 1605 History of the Order of St. Jerome. He argued against dismissing the painting as either heretical or merely absurd, commenting that the panels \\"are a satirical comment on the shame and sinfulness of mankind\\". The art historian Carl Justi observed that the left and center panels are drenched in tropical and oceanic atmosphere, and concluded that Bosch was inspired by \\"the news of recently discovered Atlantis and by drawings of its tropical scenery, just as Columbus himself, when approaching terra firma, thought that the place he had found at the mouth of the Orinoco was the site of the Earthly Paradise\\".

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Which of the following is a benefit granted by the Orphan Drug Act: patents, fee waivers, or medical research?\\" Context: \\"There are special rules for certain rare diseases (\\"orphan diseases\\") in several major drug regulatory territories. For example, diseases involving fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States, or larger populations in certain circumstances are subject to the Orphan Drug Act. Because medical research and development of drugs to treat such diseases is financially disadvantageous, companies that do so are rewarded with tax reductions, fee waivers, and market exclusivity on that drug for a limited time (seven years), regardless of whether the drug is protected by patents.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The Orphan Drug Act, enacted in the United States in 1983, serves to provide incentives for pharmaceutical companies to research, develop, and market drugs for rare or \\"orphan\\" diseases. These diseases, as mentioned in the context, typically affect fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States or larger populations under certain circumstances. Given the smaller patient population, it is often financially disadvantageous for pharmaceutical companies to develop drugs for these diseases, as the return on investment can be quite limited. To address this issue, the Orphan Drug Act grants a series of benefits to companies that choose to pursue the development of drugs for orphan diseases. Among the options listed - patents, fee waivers, or medical research - the correct answer is fee waivers. This is because one of the key benefits the Orphan Drug Act provides is a reduction in regulatory fees associated with drug development and marketing approvals. In addition to fee waivers, the Orphan Drug Act offers other incentives to encourage pharmaceutical companies to develop orphan drugs. These incentives include: 1. Tax reductions: Companies can also benefit from tax credits when developing orphan drugs. These tax credits amount to nearly 50% of the qualified clinical testing expenses incurred during the development process. This financial incentive significantly reduces the overall cost associated with drug development for these rare diseases. 2. Market exclusivity: Another crucial incentive provided by the Orphan Drug Act is granting a period of market exclusivity for the approved orphan drug. This means that once the drug receives approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the company responsible for its development receives exclusive rights to market and sell the drug for a period of seven years. This exclusivity period applies regardless of whether the drug is protected by patents, ensuring that the pharmaceutical company has a guaranteed revenue stream for the period of exclusivity. 3. Grants for clinical research: The Orphan Drug Act also provides grant funding to support clinical research on orphan diseases. This financial assistance helps to offset the costs of conducting clinical trials and advances the medical understanding of these rare diseases, making it more viable for pharmaceutical companies to invest in drug development. In conclusion, the Orphan Drug Act aims to facilitate the research, development, and marketing of orphan drugs by offering pharmaceutical companies a range of financial incentives that make the process more economically viable. The benefit granted by the Orphan Drug Act mentioned in the given context is fee waivers, which reduce the regulatory fees associated with drug development. Additionally, tax reductions, market exclusivity, and clinical research grants further encourage the pharmaceutical industry to address the needs of patients suffering from rare or orphan diseases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The extent to which their lyrics are explicitly Christian varies between bands. Many bands who perform Christian rock have ties to the contemporary Christian music labels, media outlets, and festivals, while other bands are independent. - A lead single is usually the first single to be released from a studio album, by a musician or a band, before the album itself is released. - Top 40 is a music industry shorthand for the currently most-popular songs in a particular genre. When used without qualification it refers to the best-selling or most frequently broadcast popular music. The term is derived from record music charts, a few of which traditionally consist of a total of 40 songs. Top 40 is also an alternative term for the radio format of such music, also known as Contemporary hit radio. - Contemporary hit radio (also known as CHR, contemporary hits, hit list, current hits, hit music, top 40, or pop radio) is a radio format that is common in the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Singapore and South Africa that focuses on playing current and recurrent popular music as determined by the top 40 music charts. There are several subcategories, dominantly focusing on rock, pop, or urban music. Used alone, \\"CHR\\" most often refers to the CHR-pop format. The term \\"contemporary hit radio\\" was coined in the early 1980s by \\"Radio & Records\\" magazine to designate top 40 stations which continued to play hits from all musical genres as pop music splintered into adult contemporary, urban contemporary and other formats. - The Big Three television networks are the three major traditional commercial broadcast television networks in the United States: ABC, CBS and NBC.

My mother was sick when I was small, so I did a lot of the household chores, even doing the laundry, as I was the oldest, but I never worked outside with my five brothers.

Plot title: The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance Movie plot: Senator Ransom \\"Ranse\\" Stoddard (James Stewart) and his wife Hallie (Vera Miles) arrive by train in the frontier town of Shinbone, in an unnamed western state, to attend the funeral of Tom Doniphon (John Wayne). As they make their way toward the undertaker's establishment to pay their respects to the deceased, a reporter (Joseph Hoover) and his editor, Maxwell Scott (Carleton Young) approach and ask Stoddard to explain why a United States Senator would make the long journey from Washington just to attend the funeral of a local rancher. Stoddard's story flashes back 25 years to his arrival in Shinbone as a young, idealistic attorney. His stagecoach is robbed by a gang of outlaws led by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). When Stoddard takes Valance to task for robbing a widow of her heirloom, he is brutally whipped and left for dead. When Doniphon finds and brings him into town, restaurant owner Peter Ericson (John Qualen), his wife Nora (Jeanette Nolan), and employee Hallie tend to his injuries, and explain that Shinbone's townsfolk are regularly victimized by Valance. Link Appleyard (Andy Devine), the town marshal, has neither the courage nor the gunfighting skills to challenge Valance; Doniphon (who loves Hallie and plans to ask her to marry him) is the only man willing to stand up to him. When Stoddard, the naive \\"pilgrim\\" (as Doniphon dubs him), opens a law practice in town, Doniphon and many others believe him crazy for inviting retribution from Valance, who cannot abide any challenge to his \\"authority\\". Force, Doniphon explains, is the only thing Valance understands; he advises Stoddard to either flee the territory or buy a gun. Stoddard maintains he will do neither; he is an advocate for justice under the law, not brute force. He earns the town's respect by refusing to knuckle under to Valance, and by founding a school to teach reading and writing to illiterate townspeopleâincluding Hallie.

Beginning later this year, the maximum number of weeks the jobless can collect unemployment benefits will be reduced to 73 weeks. The legislation, which Congress approved Friday, calls for unemployment insurance to be reduced in two stages. States with lower jobless rates will see federal benefits trimmed starting in June. The full cut will go into effect in September. Lawmakers also revamped parts of the unemployment insurance system, by allowing drug tests of certain recipients and permitting states to use the funds to subsidize employment. The legislation also creates national job-search requirements for everyone collecting either state or federal benefits. The jobless have been able to collect up to 99 weeks of benefits since November 2009, as part of the nation's unprecedented response to the Great Recession. While long-term unemployment remains a problem, a growing chorus of experts and lawmakers have called for the easing of the safety net as the economy slowly recovers and the federal government looks to rein in spending. Republicans, in particular, had looked to reduce the number of weeks the jobless could collect benefits and tighten eligibility requirements. The unemployment section of the legislation, which also extended the payroll tax credit, costs 30 billion. Americans have collected a total of 434 billion in unemployment benefits over the past four years, with the federal government footing 185 billion of the tab. Starting in September, the jobless in states with unemployment rates below 6%, such as North Dakota and Vermont, will get a maximum of 40 weeks of checks. Now they get as much as 60 weeks. Those in the 6% range will get no more than 54 weeks, a reduction of as much as 32 weeks. Unemployed residents of states around the national average, currently 8.3%, will get a maximum of 63 weeks, which equates to a drop of as much as 36 weeks. The jobless living in states with unemployment rates above 9% will top out at 73 weeks, down 26 weeks from the current 99-week maximum. These states currently include Florida, California and Nevada. The change equates to a loss of thousands of dollars for the jobless. In Washington, for instance, where unemployment is just above the national average, a nine-month reduction in checks could total more than 13,650 if the rate is the same in September. The federal-benefits pullback follows the curtailing of some state benefits last year. At least six states reduced the number of weeks the jobless could receive state benefits from the standard 26. \\"The graduated approach will avoid the shocks to the economy and to unemployed workers that there would have been with a sharp cutoff\\" of federal benefits, said George Wentworth, senior staff attorney at the National Employment Law Project. \\"It keeps the program functioning as the effective lifeline it needs to be.\\" The legislation will also allow states to screen applicants for illegal drugs if they lost their job due to a failed or refused drug test, or if they are applying for a position that requires testing. States will also be able to apply for waivers enabling them to implement reforms, such as using unemployment insurance funds to subsidize employment. Up to 10 states will be allowed to test Georgia Works-type programs, which place the jobless in training positions while they continue to collect weekly checks. The legislation also mandates the creation of national job-search requirements for all recipients, in order to eliminate the state-by-state approach currently in existence. States will also receive 1 billion to assist with skills testing for the long-term unemployed, underemployed and self-employed. The U.S. Department of Labor already provides funding to assess the work-readiness of the unemployed, but the legislation makes it a requirement for those who have been jobless for more than 26 weeks. Republicans trumpeted the fact that these changes made it into the final bill. But President Obama had also called for several of these adjustments in his American Jobs Act proposal last September.

We have 65 candies to share, and every friend gets 13 candies each. So, to find the number of friends (j), we just divide the total candies (-65, since you gave them away) by the candies each friend gets (-13). j = (-65) / (-13). Remember that when you divide a negative number by another negative number, the result is positive, just like magic! So, j = 65/13 = 5. And there you go! You shared your candies with 5 friends.

First identified in California in 1962, enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is one of more than 100 non-polio enteroviruses. How common is EV-D68 in the United States? Small numbers of EV-D68 have been reported regularly to CDC since 1987. However, during 2014 the number of people reported with confirmed EV-D68 infection was much greater than that reported in previous years. We can’t predict whether EV-D68 will be a common type of enterovirus detected this year or in future seasons. That’s because a mix of enteroviruses circulates every year, and different types of enteroviruses can be common in different years. What time of the year are people most likely to get infected? In the United States, you are more likely to get infected with enteroviruses in the summer and fall. However, you can get infected year round. What are the symptoms of EV-D68 infection? EV-D68 can cause mild to severe respiratory illness, or no symptoms at all. Mild symptoms may include runny nose, sneezing, cough, body aches, and muscle aches. Severe symptoms may include wheezing and difficulty breathing. Anyone with respiratory illness should contact their doctor if they are having difficulty breathing or if their symptoms are getting worse. How does the virus spread? Since EV-D68 causes respiratory illness, the virus can be found in an infected person’s respiratory secretions, such as saliva, nasal mucus, or sputum (mucus-like secretions from the lungs). EV-D68 likely spreads from person to person when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or touches a surface that is then touched by others. Who is at risk? In general, infants, children, and teenagers are most likely to get infected with enteroviruses and become ill. That’s because they do not yet have immunity (protection) from previous exposures to these viruses. We believe this is also true for EV-D68. Adults can get infected with enteroviruses, but they are more likely to have no symptoms or mild symptoms. Children with asthma may have a higher risk for severe respiratory illness caused by EV-D68 infection. How is it diagnosed? Watch CDC medical epidemiologist Brian Rha explain who is at risk for EV-D68 and more in a 2-minute video on WebMDExternal . EV-D68 can only be diagnosed by doing specific lab tests on specimens from a person’s nose and throat, or blood. Many hospitals and some doctor’s offices can test ill patients to see if they have enterovirus infection. However, most cannot do specific testing to determine the type of enterovirus, like EV-D68. CDC and some state health departments can do this sort of testing using a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) lab test, which allows testing and reporting of results within a few days of receiving specimens. Health departments may contact CDC for further enterovirus typing. CDC recommends that clinicians consider testing for EV-D68 when patients present with severe respiratory illness and the cause is unclear. For more information, see Enterovirus D68 for Health Care Professionals. Top of Page What are the treatments? There is no specific treatment for people with respiratory illness caused by EV-D68. Talk to a doctor about your symptoms and the best way to control them. Some people with severe respiratory illness may need to be hospitalized and receive intensive supportive therapy. There are no antiviral medications currently available for people who become infected with EV-D68. How can I protect myself? You can help prevent yourself from getting and spreading EV-D68 by following these steps: Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds. See Handwashing: Clean Hands Save Lives. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact such as kissing, hugging, and sharing cups or eating utensils with people who are sick, and when you are sick. Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your upper shirt sleeve, not your hands. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces, such as toys and doorknobs, especially if someone is sick. Stay home when you are sick. See our infographic that shows these prevention steps. There are no vaccines for preventing EV-D68 infections. Top of Page What should people with asthma and children suffering from reactive airway disease do? Children with asthma may have a higher risk for severe symptoms from EV-D68 and other respiratory illnesses. They should follow CDC’s guidance to maintain control of their illness during enterovirus season, which occurs each year in the U.S. during summer and fall. CDC recommends the following: Discuss and update your asthma action plan with your primary care provider. Take your prescribed asthma medications as directed, especially long-term control medication(s). Be sure to keep your reliever medication with you. Get a flu vaccine when available each year. If you develop new or worsening asthma symptoms, follow the steps of your asthma action plan. If your symptoms do not go away, call your doctor right away. Parents should make sure the child’s caregiver and/or teacher is aware of his/her condition, and that they know how to help if the child experiences any symptoms related to asthma. For additional information, see “What Parents Need to Know about Enterovirus D68” in A large outbreak of EV-D68 occurred in 2014. How many people got sick? In summer and fall 2014, the United States experienced a nationwide outbreak of EV-D68 associated with severe respiratory illness. From mid-August 2014 to January 15, 2015, CDC or state public health laboratories confirmed 1,395 people in 49 states and the District of Columbia with respiratory illness caused by EV-D68. Almost all of the confirmed cases were among children, many whom had asthma or a history of wheezing. Additionally, there were likely many thousands of mild EV-D68 infections for which people did not seek medical treatment and/or get tested. This was the first documented nationwide outbreak of EV-D68. Although illness associated with EV-D68 is not notifiable, circulation of this virus occurs most often in late summer and fall, which is the typical enterovirus season. CDC received about 2,600 specimens for enterovirus testing during 2014, which was substantially more than usual. About 39% of those tested positive for EV-D68. About 40% tested positive for an enterovirus or rhinovirus other than EV-D68. Will we see another EV-D68 outbreak this year or in future years? Enteroviruses are ever-present in the community. We can’t predict whether EV-D68 will be a common type of enterovirus detected this year or in other future seasons. A mix of enteroviruses circulates every year, and different types of enteroviruses can be common in different years. Each year we expect to detect cases, but the number of cases identified in the U.S. varies from year to year. As in previous years, CDC will continue to work with states to test specimens for enteroviruses to determine virus type, support the identification and investigation of outbreaks, and monitor seasonal activity.

The children were hospitalized between August 9 and September 28 with muscle weakness in their limbs, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Something is affecting the children's motor nerves, causing weakness primarily in their shoulders, triceps, biceps and hips, says Dr. Joyce Oleszek, a pediatric rehabilitation specialist at Children's Hospital Colorado. Doctors are also seeing some weakness in the neck and facial muscles in these patients. \\"It seems to be attacking the spinal cord and brain stem,\\" Oleszek said at a press conference Monday. MRI tests spotted abnormalities in the children's spinal gray matter. Most of the children experienced a respiratory illness before being admitted to the hospital, although only two had a history of asthma. The latest case was a girl who arrived at Children's Hospital Colorado over the weekend. She and three of the other patients are still at the hospital. The rest have been discharged, said Dr. Sam Dominguez, a microbial epidemiologist at the hospital. Doctors do not know if the neurological damage will be permanent. The CDC is investigating the cause of these symptoms. Health officials do not believe that the cases were caused by polio, as at least eight of the 10 children are up to date on their polio vaccinations. \\"We don't know, at this point, if there is any association between the enterovirus EV-D68 that's circulating and the paralytic conditions some of the children in Colorado are experiencing,\\" CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said. Tests of the children's cerebrospinal fluid came back negative for enteroviruses and West Nile virus. But a test of their nasal passages found enterovirus in six out of eight patients who were tested. Of those six, four tested positive for enterovirus D68, which has been sending children across North America to the hospital with severe respiratory illnesses. The other two test results are pending. \\"It could be something else. That doesn't prove cause and effect, but it's circumstantial evidence,\\" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The cause \\"still remains a puzzle.\\" JUST WATCHED Virus sends hundreds to hospital Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Virus sends hundreds to hospital 01:40 A cluster of children with similar paralysis symptoms was identified in California last year. Samples from two of the children tested positive for enterovirus D68. Enterovirus D68 is part of the Picornaviridae family, which also includes the poliovirus, other enteroviruses and rhinoviruses. Enteroviruses are very common, especially in late summer and early fall. The CDC estimates that 10 million to 15 million infections occur in the United States each year. These viruses usually appear like the common cold; symptoms include sneezing, a runny nose and a cough. Most people recover without any treatment. But some types of enterovirus are more serious. These can cause hand, foot and mouth disease; viral meningitis; encephalitis (inflammation of the brain); an infection of the heart; and paralysis in some patients. This year, enterovirus D68 seems to be exacerbating breathing problems in children who have asthma. The virus has infected at least 277 people in 40 states, according to the CDC. Cases have also been reported in Canada. Children's Hospital Colorado has treated over 4,000 children with severe respiratory illness since August 18, said Dr. Chris Nyquist, medical director for Infection Prevention and Control. About 10% were admitted. CNN affiliate WCBS reported Friday that a New Jersey toddler died last week from a severe respiratory illness and that the CDC will be testing samples to see whether he had enterovirus D68. The CDC is asking other hospitals across the country to be on the lookout for similar cases and to send in information on any patients with these symptoms. \\"Parents shouldn't panic,\\" Nyquist says. \\"This is very, very uncommon. \\" Common-sense things, like frequent hand-washing and avoiding sick people, can help protect kids from becoming infected, she said. |||||","completion":"Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is a non-polio virus first identified in California in 1962. It can cause mild to severe respiratory illness or show no symptoms at all, and it spreads mainly through respiratory secretions, such as saliva, nasal mucus, or sputum from the lungs. Infants, children, and teenagers are the most vulnerable to enteroviruses as they have not yet developed immunity from prior exposure. Children with asthma have a higher risk for severe respiratory illness caused by EV-D68 infection. There is no specific treatment, antiviral medication, or vaccine for EV-D68 infections, so preventive measures, such as hand washing, are essential. In 2014, the U.S. experienced a nationwide outbreak of EV-D68, where 1,395 people in 49 states were confirmed to have respiratory illness caused by EV-D68.

Please briefly summarize this news article: What a school day looks like inside Children’s Hospital The school day lasts only one hour. Machines beep in the room. The teacher comes right to the student’s bed — though she might have to wear gloves and a mask. That’s what “school” can look like for children who are stuck in the hospital for days and weeks on end. Armed with clipboard, iPad, and hospital gown, Elaine Klingensmith led STAT through a typical school day one recent morning at Boston Children’s Hospital, where she works as a full-time tutor for Education Inc. The nonprofit organization aims to streamline what can be a frustrating process for parents: wrangling school officials to send the schoolwork — and money for tutors’ wages — so that sick kids don’t fall behind in school. Klingensmith and two tutors teach one-hour lessons to up to 20 children per day. Some are frequent visitors with chronic illnesses, while others are newcomers in the hospital for a surgery or transplant. Klingensmith started her morning on the ninth floor of Children’s Hospital. Caleb Hassan, a playful 8-year-old who suffers from cystic fibrosis, sat in a hospital bed in tiger-themed pajamas. Wearing a hospital gown and latex gloves to protect Caleb from infections, Klingensmith read a book with him and helped him calculate the perimeter of an 8-by-4 rectangle. Caleb yawned. “Can we do something different?” he asked. His reward for finishing was to watch a BrainPOP video about healthy eating. The animated series, with quizzes at the end, is among the tools Klingensmith keeps on hand in case she needs to supplement students’ schoolwork. Massachusetts requires public schools to pay for tutoring if a sick child is confined to home or hospital for at least 14 school days. Other states have different versions of that law. While some schools, like Caleb’s, are good about sending work, others aren’t. Founded at Children’s Hospital in 1995, Education Inc. now employs tutors in 46 health facilities in eight states. Tutors aren’t always certified. Klingensmith, who’s 27, is certified to teach only kindergarten through sixth grade, though she also tutors older students. Keeping kids on pace with their classmates can be tough. If the school doesn’t send work to the hospital, Klingensmith said, she calls the teacher to ask which concepts the class is studying. If she can’t get an answer, she resorts to asking the students what they last remember learning. “Sometimes they have no idea,” Klingensmith said. In that case, she falls back on the Common Core national standards, and a variety of work sheets and online programs. Parents often take on the extra role of ferrying schoolwork to and from the hospital. That’s what Napoleon Silva did when his two daughters, Christiana and Nicolette, who have cystic fibrosis, spent their latest stint at Children’s for antibiotic treatments to clear out their lungs. Klingensmith knocked on the sisters’ hospital room door at 10:30 a.m. “Noooooo!” cried 6-year-old Christiana, who had been watching the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse on TV. Despite her initial protest, she quickly immersed herself in a math work sheet. Nicolette, who’s 9, worked alongside her sister in the face of various distractions. As she set to work on geometry, Nicolette’s IV pump started beeping, and a nurse swooped in to fix an occluded line. Christiana kept coloring while a nurse flushed the tube through which she receives antibiotics. Studying in the hospital has other challenges: Nicolette had to skip breakfast to prepare for general anesthesia later that afternoon, which made her more easily frustrated. “I don’t get this,” she protested, staring at a math problem about parallel lines. Nicolette said she enjoys the one-on-one attention from her tutor, but she misses science — a subject that’s often omitted in the hospital — and seeing her friends. Keeping kids connected to the classroom is key to maintaining a sense of normalcy during chronic illness, research has found. Aislynn Burns, who’s 9, has used FaceTime to videochat with her classmates during long stints at Children’s for chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, said her mom, Tara Woodbury. But after spending nearly two full school years in the hospital, Aislynn had to change from a private to a public school, because it wasn’t worth continuing to pay tuition. Aislynn has done a ton of schoolwork at Children’s Hospital, including writing a biography of her favorite forefather, Benjamin Franklin. But the tutoring isn’t a replacement for school, Woodbury said: “One hour is great, believe me, but there’s six to eight hours in a school day.” Children who are hospitalized for mental health treatment face extra challenges. Hospitals often block their access to the Internet for fear of threats like cyber-bullying, so they can’t complete online assignments, said Lisa Lambert, executive director of the Parent/Professional Advocacy League, a Massachusetts-based network for families of children with emotional, behavioral, and mental health needs. And parents may not even tell the school their child is in the hospital, for fear the information will leak out, Lambert said. She said adolescents who were hospitalized after cutting themselves, for example, have returned to school to find that “everyone in the entire school knows.” Transitioning back to school after hospitalization “is always tough, not just emotionally but also academically,” she said. While younger students may be able to keep up with their classmates, high school students often can’t. Nicolette, who’s in fourth grade, is determined not to fall behind. She has already lost time: She and her sister were admitted on a Tuesday and didn’t start tutoring until the following Monday. She rattled off a list of work she has to do, including taking two tests and reading a history book. She said it was hard to focus on her lesson because her stomach hurt from skipping breakfast. “I was a little more whiny this morning,” she confessed. “[But] once you get into the work the pain starts to go away.” Summary:","completion":"In Boston Children's Hospital, there's a special school for kids who have to stay in the hospital for a long time. A teacher named Elaine helps these kids learn for one hour a day. She uses an iPad, clipboard and sometimes wears gloves and a mask. She teaches kids who have different sicknesses and need to be in the hospital. This helps the kids not to fall behind in school when they can't go to their regular class."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Sir Edward Spragge (name also written as Spragg or Sprague) (circa 1620 – 21 August 1673) was an Irish admiral of the Royal Navy. He was a fiery, brilliantly accomplished seaman who fought in many great actions after the restoration of King Charles II in 1660. Can we draw the following conclusion? Edward Spragge was an Irish captain before becoming admiral","completion":"Sir Edward Spragge (also spelled as Spragg or Sprague) was indeed an Irish naval officer who served in the Royal Navy, ultimately attaining the rank of admiral. Born around 1620, he came from a prominent Protestant and Anglo-Irish family in County Wicklow, Ireland. Spragge's naval career began in the early 1640s when he entered the navy as a low-ranking officer during the First English Civil War. He sided with the Royalists, supporting the cause of King Charles I against the Parliamentary forces. When the king was executed in 1649, and the Roundheads emerged victorious, Spragge was forced to seek refuge in Holland. Here, he would serve under the Dutch navy, where he continued to hone his maritime and military skills. With the restoration of Charles II to the English throne in 1660, Spragge returned to his homeland and resumed service in the British navy. He rapidly rose through the ranks, earning himself a series of promotions and commands of various ships, reflecting his exceptional skills as a naval officer. As a captain, he proved his prowess in several battles, including the Four Days' Battle (June 1-4, 1666) and the St James’s Day Battle (July 25-26, 1666) during the Second Anglo-Dutch War. In 1672, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, Spragge was promoted to the rank of vice-admiral and commanded a division during the Battle of Solebay, further displaying his capabilities as a brilliant tactician. The following year, in 1673, he was promoted to admiral, being assigned command of the Blue Squadron in the Royal Navy. He achieved numerous victories during various engagements against the Dutch, ultimately culminating in his heroic death during the Battle of Texel (August 11, 1673). It is, therefore, reasonable and accurate to say that Edward Spragge was an Irish captain before eventually becoming an admiral in the Royal Navy. Throughout his illustrious career, he demonstrated exceptional maritime and military skills, contributing to many significant battles and victories for the British. Spragge's rise through the ranks, from a humble officer to an esteemed admiral, is a testament to both his prowess as a seaman and the respect he earned from his superiors and peers alike. His service offers valuable insight into the challenges and successes of 17th-century naval warfare, emphasizing the importance of adaptability, bravery, and tactical genius in the tumultuous political and military landscape of the time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, it is important to keep in mind that this answer is not definitive, as there might be various interpretations of the meaning of life, depending on an individual's personal, cultural, and religious background. Many philosophical, religious, and cultural traditions have developed their own unique viewpoints on this topic. Some approaches focus on individual goals and the pursuit of happiness, while others emphasize the social responsibilities and connections that bind us together as a community. A more comprehensive answer to the question would need to delve deeper into each of these aspects and how they interact with one another. In a philosophical sense, the meaning of life can be explored through the lens of existentialism, a movement that addresses human self-awareness, choice, and personal responsibility in discovering one's own values in an indifferent universe. This stance encourages individuals to create their own purpose and find meaning by engaging with the world and with others in a meaningful way. Looking at the meaning of life through religious and spiritual perspectives, various major religions, such as Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Judaism, propose differing views on the ultimate purpose or objectives of human life. While some emphasize a connection with God or higher powers, others stress the importance of morality, love, compassion, and the pursuit of enlightenment. These diverse interpretations make it clear that the meaning of life can be highly nuanced and subjective. As for the role of ethics, values, and morality in our lives, these principles guide our actions and inform our choices on how to live in society. The way we treat others, care for the environment, and decide what is good or bad are essential aspects of our human existence and ought to be considered when trying to understand the meaning of life. In short, your proposed answer is a reasonable one, as it encapsulates many significant concepts and viewpoints that contribute to the understanding of life's meaning. However, further elaboration on these various components and a deeper exploration of contrasting perspectives can lead to a more extensive and comprehensive answer, reflecting the diversity of human thought and experience on this universal question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Late Night with Conan O'Brien is an American late-night talk show hosted by Conan O'Brien that aired 2,725 episodes on NBC between 1993 and 2009. The show featured varied comedic material, celebrity interviews, and musical and comedy performances. Late Night aired weeknights at 12:37 am Eastern/11:37 pm Central and 12:37 am Mountain in the United States. The show's house band was The Max Weinberg 7, led by drummer Max Weinberg, who also served as a sounding board for O'Brien on the show (more so after Andy Richter's departure). The other six members were Mark Pender on trumpet, Richie \\"LaBamba\\" Rosenberg on trombone, Mike Merritt on bass, Jerry Vivino on saxophone and brother Jimmy Vivino on guitar, and Scott Healy on keyboards. James Wormworth served as backup drummer when Weinberg went on tour with Bruce Springsteen. With the departure of Andy Richter, Max Weinberg assumed a bigger role as an interlocutor for O'Brien's jokes. One common running gag was Max's awkwardness on camera and his apparent lack of chemistry with Conan. Weinberg was often used in sketches as well, which usually revolved around his purported sexual deviance (mostly a penchant for bedding barely legal groupies), although long-running sketches also spoofed Max's lack of knowledge of current affairs. \\"LaBamba\\" was also used as the butt of many of Conan's jokes. These humorous sketches usually revolved around LaBamba's sizeable mustache, his poor acting skills, and his alleged inability to read written music. Mark Pender would often sing songs on the topic of a current event which ended with him screeching uncontrollably and climbing the risers into the audience. All members of the 7 had successful side careers as studio musicians. As is common in the talk show format, the Max Weinberg 7 performed the show's opening and closing themes, played bumpers into and out of commercial breaks (they actually played through the entire break for the studio audience), and a short piece during O'Brien's crossover to his desk after his monologue (except for several months beginning in April 2008, where a commercial break was inserted at that point). The show's opening theme was written by Howard Shore and John Lurie (a finalist for the job as band leader). The show's closing theme was called \\"Cornell Knowledge\\", and was lifted from Jerry and Jimmy Vivino's first album together. However, on Late Night, it was played at a much quicker tempo than the album version. The band played a wide variety of songs as bumpers--usually popular music from a variety of eras. Weinberg sometimes took extended leaves of absence to tour with Bruce Springsteen as the drummer for his E Street Band. During his absence, temporary replacement drummers were hired (most commonly James Wormworth), and the band was led by Jimmy Vivino (\\"Jimmy Vivino and the Max Weinberg 7\\"). Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What kind of music did they play?","completion":"The Max Weinberg 7, the house band for Late Night with Conan O'Brien, played a wide variety of songs as bumpers, usually consisting of popular music from a variety of eras.

Please briefly summarize this news article: California attorney general pursues new pimping charges against Backpage site California attorney general Kamala Harris said on Friday she was pursuing new pimping charges against the operators of Backpage.com – a website which advertises escort services and which she said operated “a hotbed of illicit and exploitative activity”. The new charges came two weeks after a judge threw out an earlier case. Harris, an incoming US senator, said she had charged Backpage executives Carl Ferrer, Michael Lacey and James Larkin with 13 counts of pimping and conspiracy to commit pimping. They also are charged with 26 counts of money laundering. Harris said the new charges were based on new evidence. A Sacramento County judge threw out pimping charges against the men on 9 December, citing federal free-speech laws. In the latest case, filed in Sacramento County superior court, Harris claims Backpage illegally funnelled money through multiple companies and created various websites to get around banks that refused to process transactions. She also alleged that the company used photos of women from Backpage on other sites without their permission in order to increase revenue and knowingly profited from the proceeds of prostitution. “By creating an online brothel – a hotbed of illicit and exploitative activity – Carl Ferrer, Michael Lacey, and James Larkin preyed on vulnerable victims, including children, and profited from their exploitation,” Harris said in a statement. Attorneys for the men did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Judge Michael Bowman sided with lawyers for the trio and the company in his ruling earlier this month, saying the website was engaged in free speech allowed under the federal Communications Decency Act, which protects companies from content posted by third parties. In the earlier case, Ferrer, 55, Backpage’s chief executive, was charged with pimping a minor, pimping and conspiracy to commit pimping. Lacey, 68, and Larkin, 67, both from Arizona, were charged with conspiracy to commit pimping. Lacey and Larkin, the website’s former owners, used to own alternative newspapers around the country, including the Village Voice in New York City. Harris has alleged that more than 90% of Backpage’s revenue – millions of dollars each month – comes from adult escort ads that use coded language and nearly nude photos to offer sex for money. She is doubling down on pimping charges in her final days before resigning to take her seat in the US Senate. The Democrat was among 47 state attorneys general who asked Congress in 2013 to help change a provision of the Communications Decency Act that they acknowledged protected Backpage from prosecution. Summary:","completion":"California attorney general Kamala Harris has filed new charges against Backpage.com advertising website, accusing its executives Carl Ferrer, Michael Lacey and James Larkin of 13 counts of pimping, conspiracy to commit pimping and 26 counts of money laundering.

Which country experiences a higher anthropogenic productivity? Hint: Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the biodiversity of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.[12] With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it[11][8] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation. Answer:","completion":"Nepal experiences a higher anthropogenic productivity as they have adopted a different approach to food production that focuses on nature and biodiversity, resulting in better ecosystem adaptability and overall better soil quality. In contrast, the degradation of land in Tibet has led to significant losses in biodiversity, carbon, nitrogen, and overall reduced soil quality, making it less suitable for supporting life."},{"prompt":"Information: - Kasseem Dean (born September 13, 1978), better known by his stage name Swizz Beatz, is an American hip hop recording artist and record producer from New York City, New York.

Most forms of Western music can make use of the piano. Consequently, pianists have a wide variety of repertoire and styles to choose from, including traditionally classical music, Jazz, blues and all sorts of popular music, including rock music. Most pianists can, to a certain extent, play other keyboard-related instruments such as the synthesizer, harpsichord, celesta and the organ and keyboard. Perhaps the greatest pianist of all time was Franz Liszt, whose piano mastery was described by Anton Rubinstein: \\"In comparison with Liszt, all other pianists are children\\". - Long Island is an island located just off the northeast coast of the United States and a region within the U.S. state of New York. Stretching east-northeast from New York Harbor into the Atlantic Ocean, the island comprises four counties: Kings and Queens (which comprise the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, respectively) to the west; then Nassau and Suffolk to the east. However, many people in the New York metropolitan area (even those living in Brooklyn and Queens) colloquially use the term \\"Long Island\\" (or \\"The Island\\") exclusively to refer to the NassauSuffolk county area collectively, which is mainly suburban in character. More generally, \\"Long Island\\" may also refer collectively both to the main Island as well as its nearby, surrounding outer barrier islands. North of the island is the Long Island Sound, across from which lie the states of Connecticut and a small part of Rhode Island across the Block Island Sound. Across the Sound, to the northwest, lies Westchester County on mainland New York. To the west, Long Island is separated from the Bronx and the island of Manhattan by the East River. To the extreme southwest, it is separated from the New York City borough of Staten Island and the U.S. state of New Jersey by Upper New York Bay, the Narrows, and Lower New York Bay. To the east lie Block Island and numerous smaller islands. - Arista Records, Inc. was a major American record label. It was a wholly owned unit of Sony Music Entertainment and was previously handled by Bertelsmann Music Group. The company operated under the RCA Music Group until 2011. The label was founded in 1974 by Clive Davis, who formerly worked for CBS Records (which would become Sony Music Entertainment). Until its demise in 2011, it was a major distributor and promoter of albums throughout the United States and United Kingdom. - A Grammy Award (originally called Gramophone Award), or Grammy, is an honor awarded by The Recording Academy to recognize outstanding achievement in the mainly English-language music industry. The annual presentation ceremony features performances by prominent artists, and the presentation of those awards that have a more popular interest.

You are given a new situation: John is a nuclear scientist who works at the Fermi lab. Today, in front of him he has four samples, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. Sample A is the naturally occurring uranium. Sample B is enriched uranium. Sample C is the U-238, and sample D is the U-235. He needs to figure out how to best use them. and a hint : Naturally occurring uranium is composed almost entirely of two isotopes, uranium-238 (99%) and uranium-235 (1%). It is the uranium-235 that is fissionable (will undergo fission) and therefore, this is the uranium isotope than can be used for fuel in a nuclear reactor. For uranium to be used as fuel, the percent of uranium-235 must be increased to at least 3%. Uranium in which the U-235 content is more than 1% is called enriched uranium. Somehow, the two isotopes must be separated so that enriched uranium is available for use as fuel. Separating the isotope by chemical means (chemical reactions) is not successful because the isotopes have exactly the same chemistry. The only essential difference between U-238 and U-235 is their atomic masses; as a result, the two isotopes are separated by a physical means that takes advantage of the difference in mass. Please answer this question : Which smaple would not be fissionable, sample C or sample D? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Sample C, which contains U-238, would not be fissionable. This is because U-238 is not capable of undergoing fission, whereas U-235, present in Sample D, is fissionable and can be used as fuel in a nuclear reactor."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hello I have been chased by a couple of angry dogs. I was visiting one of my clients, when, suddenly, out of the bushes, two snarling dogs attacked me. They weren’t necessarily mad, as in crazy, but they were very angry. They were large dogs, and they attacked my legs, knocking me down. I knew it was very dangerous to be down on the ground, as I was most vulnerable. I covered my genitalia, my neck and my face, as I struggled to regain my feet. Fortunately, during my fall, I saw a large tree branch on the ground near me. I grabbed it, and starting beating the dogs with it. I managed to land a few good hits. As I was hitting the dogs, their owner (my client) came outside, stood on her porch and laughed at me. When she saw me hitting her dogs with a stick, she called the dogs off of me. I asked her why her dogs attacked me, and why she laughed at me. She said that she had just given her dogs a big steak bone and they were upset when I came near and attacked me. I asked her why she would set me up in this way when she knew I was on the way over. She admitted that she wanted to see what happened, and she said that when she saw what happened she thought that it was funny. I did not keep the appointment with her. My trousers were torn, and my ankles, legs, and hands were bleeding. I told her that I would not be back, and left. Later that night, her husband called to apologize on her behalf.

What is the answer for the question: What collection did the money Gregory put in a safe deposit box come from? from the following article ? Paul Gregory, a Canadian confidence trickster operating in London, targets a wealthy Canadian woman in Britain to sell her collection of valuable coins. After meeting her at an ice hockey match, he sets about winning her confidence until she is prepared to give him legal control over the sale. He completes the deal without her knowledge, puts the money from the sale in a safe deposit box, and then deliberately waits to be caught by the police. Gregory plans on getting a five-year sentence, with time off for good behaviour, and then collecting his loot when he is released. However, the judge makes an example of the uncooperative Gregory by handing down a ten-year term. Not wishing to spend so much time in jail, Gregory pays Victor Sloane, one of his associates on the outside, to help him escape. Almost immediately, things begin to go wrong. Fearing arrest, he is unable for the moment to recover the money from the safe. Sloane also now begins to demand more money, threatening him with violence, and Gregory is forced to retaliate. Gregory tries to get help from his fellow criminals, calling upon an established code that exists between them. But when his former associate Sloane is found dead – accidentally having choked to death on the gag Gregory placed in his mouth – they refuse to offer him any assistance, as he is now too \\"hot\\". With the manhunt rapidly closing in, he tries to escape with the help of Bridget Howard, a disillusioned ex-débutante and niece of a Chief Constable. She drives Gregory to a deserted cottage near her family's home in rural Wales. While in hiding, he witnesses the police arrive to question Bridget, assumes the worst, and flees again. Attempting to steal a farmer's bicycle, he is shot in the shoulder. He drives away in a stolen truck but crashes and passes out, where he is found by another farmer. Bridget tells the police nothing.

At least that's the gist of a report released earlier this week by economists at the Hudson Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank based in Washington, D.C. Moreover, the report skewers union leaders for funding their own pension plans better than those made available to rank-and-file members. Organized labor's reaction to the report? \\"In a word, 'Yawn,'\\" says Stephen Lerner, special assistant to the president of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). \\"Because of greedy CEOs on Wall Street and at big banks, our stock market lost half its value, and pension funds--union and corporate--took a hit.\\" The Hudson report's broad comparison of funding status among different types of plans was based on 2006 data--so it's not altogether clear how the recent market turmoil might have affected the disparity between so-called Taft-Hartley (union-negotiated) pension plans and employer-sponsored private sector plans. That aside, the numbers seem to speak for themselves: 35% of non-union plans with 100 or more participants were fully funded, vs. just 17% of collectively bargained plans of the same size. Only 14% of non-union plans were less than 80% funded, vs. 41% of union plans. Just 1% of non-union plans had less than 65% funding, vs. 13% of collectively bargained plans. Heading into the recession, leaders at large unions continued to make grandiose promises to rank-and-file members regarding benefits and then sunk funds into risky investments in a bid to make up the gap between the amounts on-hand and those needed to cover their commitments, according to Hudson Institute study authors Diana Furchtgott-Roth and Andrew Brown. For example, assets at the Sheet Metal Workers National Pension Fund lagged throughout the mid-2000s as the costs of benefits climbed. By 2007, the plan had 62% of assets in equities. By the end of 2008, that equity portfolio had lost 39% of its value. Now the fund has had to cancel lump-sum payments, deny cost-of-living adjustments to new retirees and reduce early retirement benefits. Meanwhile, unions gave at least 250 million to political candidates over the course of the 2008 federal election cycle. While they can't use compulsory dues for political purposes, that hasn't stopped union leaders from strongly encouraging members to donate certain amounts each month to union campaign contribution chests, the Hudson Institute report claims. Why the current need to get so much money to Capitol Hill? To support a pending bill called the Employee Free Choice Act, Furchtgott-Roth and Brown suggest. Legislators are still hashing out the details, but one union goal in the bill is a provision that would force employers into binding arbitration with unions if a bargaining session doesn't result in a contract agreement within four months, the Hudson economists say. \\"Unions want [binding] arbitration because they believe that the threat of arbitration, followed by the arbitration itself, will force employers to offer better compensation packages in the initial bargaining,\\" the report states. \\"Employers oppose [mandatory] arbitration on the grounds that it could require them to pay excessive compensation to workers and impose upon them onerous union work rules, eventually forcing them out of business.\\" The SEIU's Lerner says his organization supports \\"the Employee Free Choice Act as a much-needed check on unbridled corporate power that continues to hurt workers.\\"","completion":"Union Pension Plans Face Funding Shortfalls: Lobbying for Relief Amid Risky Investments and Member Inequality"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Sir George Gilbert Scott (13 July 1811 27 March 1878), styled Sir Gilbert Scott, was a prolific English Gothic revival architect, chiefly associated with the design, building and renovation of churches and cathedrals, although he started his career as a leading designer of workhouses. Over 800 buildings were designed or altered by him. - The Royal Albert Hall is a concert hall on the northern edge of South Kensington, London, which holds the Proms concerts annually each summer since 1941. It has a capacity of up to 5,272 seats. The Hall is a registered charity held in trust for the nation and receives no public or government funding. - The Frieze of Parnassus is a large sculpted stone frieze encircling the podium , or base , of the Albert Memorial in London , England . The Albert Memorial was constructed in the 1860s in memory of Prince Albert , the husband of Queen Victoria . The frieze is named after Mount Parnassus , the favorite resting place in Ancient Greek mythology for the muses . It contains 169 life - size full - length sculptures , a mixture of low - relief and high - relief , of individual composers , architects , poets , painters , and sculptors from history . The depictions of earlier figures necessarily , were imaginary , although many of the figures were based on materials contained in a collection of artworks and drawings gathered for the purpose of ensuring authentic depictions , where this was possible . The total length of the frieze is approximately 210 feet . The frieze was intended to be the ' soul ' of the memorial , and the memorial 's designer , George Gilbert Scott , stated that he was inspired by the Hémicycle des Beaux Arts by Hippolyte Delaroche . The memorial was not laid out precisely to directions of the compass , however , closely enough that the sides are referred to by direction . Musicians and poets were placed on the south side , with painters on the east side , sculptors on the west side , and architects on the north side . Henry Hugh Armstead carved the figures on the south and east sides , the painters , musicians , and poets ( 80 in total ) , and grouped them by national schools . John Birnie Philip carved the figures on the west and north sides , the sculptors and architects ( 89 named figures , plus two generic figures ) , and arranged them in chronological order . The carving was executed in situ , and was said by Scott to be \`\` perhaps one of the most laborious works of sculpture ever undertaken '' . The initial contracts , agreed around 1864 , had specified that the work was to be completed in four years for £ 7,781 15s . The eventual cost , however , exceeded this by some £ 2,000 and the work... - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was established as a sovereign state on 1 January 1801 by the Acts of Union 1800, which merged the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland. The growing desire for an Irish Republic led to the Irish War of Independence, which resulted in Ireland seceding from the Union and forming the Irish Free State in 1922. Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom, and the state was consequently renamed the \\"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\\". - The Albert Memorial is situated in Kensington Gardens, London, directly to the north of the Royal Albert Hall. It was commissioned by Queen Victoria in memory of her beloved husband, Prince Albert who died of typhoid in 1861. The memorial was designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott in the Gothic Revival style. Opened in July 1872 by Queen Victoria, with the statue of Albert ceremonially \\"seated\\" in 1875, the memorial consists of an ornate canopy or pavilion, in the style of a Gothic ciborium over the high altar of a church, containing a statue of the prince facing south. The memorial is tall, took over ten years to complete, and cost £120,000 (the equivalent of about £10,000,000 in 2010). The cost was met by public subscription. - Victoria (Alexandrina Victoria; 24 May 1819 22 January 1901) was Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 20 June 1837 until her death. From 1 May 1876, she adopted the additional title of Empress of India. - Kensington Gardens, once the private gardens of Kensington Palace, are among the Royal Parks of London.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Part of being in love means being completely open to the other person. If you find yourself seeing a whole different side that the person doesn't show the public, then that may be love. For instance, if your partner is pretty serious or polite in public, but shows a more goofy and silly side when you're alone, then they are really opening up to you and loves you. If the person shares their deepest emotions with you and is comfortable with it, then that could be love. If the person is comfortable not looking perfect, tripping, or having food stuck in their teeth around you, that means they are okay if you see every side of them. This should be true even during a bad day. If your loved one has had a very bad day but lights up when they see you, then that's a sign of love. If they are in love with you, then the sight of you or the sound of your voice is guaranteed to make them feel better — if only a little bit. The next time they're grumpy or have a bad day, see how they react in your presence. Though this may be silly, check out your loved one's face the next time you see them. Do they look at you in a goofy, watery, silly and adorable way that can only be described as \\"googly-eyed\\"? You will know it when you see it. You won't get this look all the time — you can spot it in the morning, or randomly across the dinner table. You may also be able to catch the person staring at you with the same expression. Love makes people feel giddy, weightless, and like laughing for no reason at all. If you see the person acting this way in your presence, then this may be love. Does your loved one seem hyper, excited, and on the verge of laughing for almost no reason at all whenever they are around you? If so, then this may be love. If you've said something barely funny and the person cracks up, then they may be lovesick. If the person shows nervous energy or fidgets around a lot around you, then they may just be excited by your presence. If you are suffering unbelievable emotional pain or are just bummed because you have the flu, then this should rub off on the person who loves you. If they truly love you, then they'll absorb some of your negative emotions and will be very upset because they'll want you to feel better as soon as you can. Though they don't have to be as upset as you are, the person should clearly be affected by your mood because all they want is for you to be happy. Summary:","completion":"In conclusion, being in love means being completely open and vulnerable with the other person. Signs of love may include showing a different, more personal side when alone, sharing deep emotions, feeling comfortable in each other's presence regardless of imperfections, and lighting up even during bad days. A person in love may also have a \\"googly-eyed\\" expression, exhibit giddy and excited behavior, and be emotionally affected by their partner's well-being. Overall, love makes people feel connected, supportive, and invested in each other's happiness and emotional state, making it a powerful and unique human experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I attended a boarding school for badly behaved children and it had its fair share of bullies who had been expelled from mainstream schools. But this particular bully had even the teachers running scared. When he went off on one, it could take up to four teachers or members of care staff to get him under control. On my first night at boarding school, he stamped on someone’s face and left them permanently disfigured. I never saw anything that bad again but it stayed with me and I could never sleep properly in that school again. On another occasion, it blew up and there were several members of staff restraining him when he farted. To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes. He was unpredictable and he didn’t care. I once saw him swing a hammer at another pupil and throw snooker balls at another, and he used to punch as if he was throwing something, so it would result in a painful blow. Eventually, the staff couldn’t cope with him as they were just as scared as we were. He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief. Last year, I was reading an article in a newspaper when a name caught my eye. It seems he became a hopeless heroin addict at some point and had died in his flat on an overdose of prescription drugs and smack. I felt sad when I read it but I couldn’t work out why.

Michigan will lose 2 million in federal funding and 600,000 in state funding to provide legal aid to the poor in 2003, according to Deierdre L. Weir, executive director of the Legal Aid and Defender Association, Inc., the state's largest provider of legal services to the poor. Current federal funds of nearly 10.7 million from the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) will drop to 8.7 million for next year, according to Weir. She said that the reductions reflect a decline in the number of persons in the state who are living in poverty, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2000 census. LSC uses census data to determine funding across the nation, and according to the census, the state's poverty population fell from an estimated 1.2 million in 1990 to an estimated 968,000 in 2000. The state's legal aid agencies are also bracing for yet another cut in 2003 of some 600,000 of state funding. A portion of filing fees paid by litigants in the state's circuit courts, and a portion of interest on lawyers trust accounts (IOLTA) are earmarked for Michigan legal aid programs. These funds are expected to drop from currently 7.5 million in 2002 to 6.9 million when the Michigan State Bar Foundation makes distributions next year. Most of the decrease is attributed to the past year's low interest rates. \\"The irony of these funding cuts is that while there may be fewer poor people in Michigan today, the demand for service will not change because the poverty population remains so large and the legal aid funding so little that local providers will never able to serve all who need our service,\\" said Weir. \\"It's as if the poor will be victimized twice-once for being poor and again as victims of these funding cuts.\\" The U.S. Census Bureau, in spite of its best efforts, cannot locate every poor person living in a census tract, therefore the poor are also undercounted, added Weir. The brunt of these cuts will be felt most in Wayne County where according to the census some 333,000 poor people live, the largest concentration of poverty in the state. LAD will lose more than 870,000 for legal aid in Wayne County, nearly half of the state's total loss, said Weir. While difficult to measure, the loss of funds will mean that several thousand of Michigan's poor in need of legal service will not receive it, or they will receive significantly limited service. Cutbacks will include service in such civil legal matters as landlord-tenant, bankruptcy, consumer, child custody, predatory lending, mortgage foreclosure, utility shutoffs, social security, wills, and probate. \\"Local providers will have to work harder and smarter and use more technology instead of staff to provide as much service as we can with fewer dollars,\\" said Weir. \\"We will be providing more selfhelp training to clients enabling them to navigate the legal system on their own in routine matters, more assistance on the telephone, and less direct representation by attorneys in specific, high impact matters. Currently, Michigan has 13 legal aid agencies covering the state's 83 counties.

I will break down each aspect and provide an overall assessment. 1. Clarity: The clarity of this review is low since it seems to have typographical errors in the review itself. The words \\"Mon Tue Thw\\" are unclear and it is uncertain if they refer to the days of the week or are intended to convey a different meaning. The word \\"evea\\" is likely a misspelling of \\"ever.\\" Therefore, clarity is a 1 out of 5 in this review. 2. Informativeness: This review lacks informativeness. While the reviewer claims it to be the best app ever, they provide no context or reasons to support their opinion. There is no mention of the app's features, benefits, or issues they may have experienced. As a result, the informativeness of this review is also a 1 out of 5. 3. Constructiveness: A constructive review analyzes both the positive and negative aspects of the subject and provides constructive feedback for improvement. This review, unfortunately, fails to provide any specific insight or suggestions for the app. It merely states that it is the best app ever without substantiating this claim. Therefore, constructiveness receives a 1 out of 5. In conclusion, taking all these factors into account, the review would receive a rating of 1 out of 5.

What is this text about?","completion":"This text is about a baseball game between the Boston Red Sox and the Chicago White Sox. The game took place on a Friday night. The text highlights the impressive performances of three players from the Boston Red Sox: Manny Ramirez, Orlando Cabrera, and Curt Schilling. Manny Ramirez and Orlando Cabrera are mentioned as having \\"left the building,\\" which is likely a reference to them hitting home runs, a major offensive highlight in a baseball game. The phrase \\"Elvis didn't leave the building\\" might be alluding to a popular saying \\"Elvis has left the building,\\" which signifies the end of an event or performance. This analogy suggests that the game was filled with excitement, and the spectators were thoroughly entertained. Meanwhile, Curt Schilling is mentioned as having left the Chicago White Sox feeling \\"all shook up.\\" This phrase suggests that Schilling had an outstanding pitching performance that was difficult for the opposing team, the Chicago White Sox, to handle. \\"All shook up\\" is an idiomatic expression that means to be deeply affected or upset. This indicates that Schilling's pitching was a significant contributing factor in the game's outcome, causing discomfort and difficulty for the Chicago team.

Aftershocks rattle Chile after earthquake as death toll rises Chile has been shaken by dozens of aftershocks after a powerful earthquake toppled buildings, killed at least 11 people and forced the evacuation of more than 1 million people. The magnitude 8.3 tremor on Wednesday night lasted for three minutes, and caused a series of tsunami surges – some as high as 4.5 metres (15ft) – which swamped towns along the Chilean coast. Tsunami warnings were triggered in Japan, New Zealand and Russia, as well as the US states of California and Hawaii. After a night in which at least 40 aftershocks hit the region – including one at magnitude 7 and seven at magnitude 6 or above – daylight revealed scenes of wreckage and ruin for hundreds of miles along the Chilean coastline. In the port city of Coquimbo fishing boats were tossed across streets, roads were blocked by rockslides and streets were filled with piles of devastated adobe houses. In Illapel, near the epicentre, residents appeared dazed at daybreak as they wandered the streets, searching for loved ones and awaiting the restoration of electricity and other basic services. Army troops were being rushed to the scene. Many of the townspeople had been forced to sleep on the ground outside their destroyed homes. “I thought it was the end of the world and we were going to die,” Manuel Moya told the Associated Press, as he stood next to the ruins of his home. “Everything is a mess. It was a disaster, a total loss. Bottles and glasses shattered and the pipes in the bathroom and kitchen burst,” restaurant owner Melisa Piñones told Reuters. Tongoy, a fishing village popular with tourists, was also hit hard by the first tsunami waves, which made landfall just 25 minutes after the initial earthquake. Several seaside shops and restaurants were completely destroyed. In the popular tourist town of Concón, dozens of coastal restaurants were flooded and nearby surf schools destroyed by the series of waves that flooded distinct areas of the coast. Makeshift altars and lit candles marked the spots where residents had died. The Chilean president, Michelle Bachelet, began a tour of damaged areas in the town of La Serena, near Coquimbo. She had previously cancelled her participation in many of the nation’s independence day celebrations scheduled for Friday. “We’re going to have go on the ground to see what the damages are and see where help is needed,” Bachelet said. The earthquake came at the beginning of a four-day national holiday and hundreds of thousands of Chileans had already travelled to the coast. But mass evacuations were largely orderly, as Chile’s national emergency office has run repeated practice evacuations following the massive 8.8 earthquake in February 2010. That quake and the ensuing tsunami killed more than 500 people, destroyed 220,000 homes and washed away docks, riverfronts and seaside resorts. On Wednesday night, panic erupted in Coquimbo where an estimated 40,000 revelers were gathered to inaugurate the nation’s largest independence day celebration late on Wednesday evening. The quake hit just as mayor Cornelio Andrade was on the podium and set to cut the ribbon. “It felt like the earth was splitting open,” Andrade told reporters. “The women began to scream the names of their children who were playing. It was a stampede, everyone was trying to get out.” Chile’s ministry of the interior and public security said 20 people have been injured, but phone networks remain down in parts of the country so the full extent of damage and injury is not yet known. Schools have been closed in several regions. The interior ministry’s national office of emergency has urged people not to return to their homes until they are told it is safe to do so. The quake also sparked fears tsunamis could surge across the Pacific Ocean, with countries as far away Japan, New Zealand, Russia and the US states of California and Hawaii issuing warnings. A watch was issued for the California coast: “A tsunami capable of producing strong currents or waves dangerous to persons in or very near the water is expected. The first wave may not be the largest.” A tsunami advisory for Hawaii said a “major tsunami” was not expected but it warned of sea-level changes and strong currents. The New Zealand minister for civil defence, Nikki Kaye, urged east coast residents in the path of any potential tsunami to stay out of the the ocean, out of boats and off beaches. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said waves reaching one to three metres above the tide level were possible in French Polynesia, and that waves reaching 0.3 to one metre above tide level were possible for some coasts of New Zealand, Fiji, Hawaii, Mexico, Ecuador, Peru, Japan, New Caledonia, Samoa, Russia and other Pacific territories. The PTWC later downgraded its warnings for some areas, including Hawaii. “However, sea-level changes and strong currents may occur along all coasts,” it said, warning that larges swells arriving between five minutes and one hour could be ongoing. The power of the initial earthquake was such that it could be felt across swaths of South America. In the Chilean capital, Santiago, more than 230km (140 miles) from the epicentre of the quake, buildings swayed and thousands fled their homes to take refuge in the streets. Car alarms were set off in Buenos Aires – more than 1,100km (680 miles) away on the Atlantic side of the continent. Public buildings, including the campus of the University of Buenos Aires, were evacuated. High-rises in the neighbourhoods of Belgrano and Palermo swayed so much that many ran out into the streets. Other Argentinian cities including Rosario and Mendoza reported mass evacuations. Chile is one of the world’s most earthquake-prone countries. Just off the coast, the Nazca tectonic plate plunges beneath the South American plate, pushing the towering Andes cordillera to ever-higher altitudes.

Given the question: Given the background: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth: and the situation: Gary and Joe are two farmers. Joe's farm has a depleted soil, while Gary started agroforestry a few years back, and grows cover crops. Answer the following question: Which farmer didn't reduce nutrient runoff from his farm? The answer is:","completion":"Joe is the farmer who didn't reduce nutrient runoff from his farm. Given the background information provided, depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants, such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These groundcover plants help stabilize the soil, increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems, and play a crucial role in preventing erosion. Cleaner water can also be achieved through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff in agroforestry systems. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Nutrient uptake can be higher in agroforestry systems, and nutrient loss into streams can be reduced when compared to row-cropped fields. Considering the situation with the two farmers, Gary and Joe, we can infer that Joe's farm has depleted soil, which suggests he has not implemented an agroforestry system or made use of groundcover plants to protect his soil from erosion. On the other hand, Gary started agroforestry a few years back and grows cover crops, suggesting he has taken measures to stabilize his soil and reduce nutrient runoff. Thus, based on the given information, Joe is the farmer who didn't reduce nutrient runoff from his farm. This is because he has not implemented agroforestry practices that involve the use of groundcover plants, such as naturally growing grasses, which are known to help in stabilizing the soil, reducing erosion, and preventing nutrient runoff. In contrast, Gary has been proactive in adopting agroforestry systems and growing cover crops, leading to better soil health and reduced nutrient runoff on his farm."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At Friday's White House briefing, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the U.S. still wants to work with Russia. \\"Again, what we would like to see is the totality of the Russian behavior change. We want to continue having conversations and work forward to building a better relationship,\\" Sanders said. The sanctions will be imposed on seven Russian oligarchs — including Oleg Deripaska, an aluminum magnate and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin — and 12 companies they own or control. Seventeen senior Russian government officials, as well as a state-owned Russian weapons trading company and its subsidiary, a Russian bank, also will be targeted. The group includes key members of Putin's inner circle. Those sanctioned will have their assets blocked in the U.S. and people in the U.S. are barred from doing business with them. Friday, a number of U.S. lawmakers and foreign policy experts welcomed the measure, saying the sanctions are overdue.

It turned out that Mary had hemophilia while Ann didn't have any blood disease. But I can use this background: Hemophilia is the name of a group of hereditary diseases that affect the body's ability to control blood clotting. Hemophilia is caused by a lack of clotting factors in the blood. Clotting factors are normally released by platelets. Since people with hemophilia cannot produce clots, any cut can put a person at risk of bleeding to death.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options： A. die B. meat C. cuddly pet D. feel hunger E. learn how to dance A:","completion":"A. Die If an animal does not eat, it will ultimately die due to malnutrition and starvation. Let me explain the process and consequences in more detail. When an animal doesn't consume food, its body cannot supply the necessary nutrients, calories, vitamins, and minerals essential for its survival. As a result, the animal initially experiences hunger (option D), and its body will send signals to the brain, indicating that it is lacking the energy required to perform vital functions. In response to the lack of nourishment, the animal's body begins to tap into its energy reserves, breaking down stored fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. This process is an attempt to generate energy, but it is not a sustainable long-term solution. Over time, the energy reserves deplete, and the body starts to break down its tissues and organs to supply the essential nutrients for the brain and other vital organs. Malnutrition and starvation bring about a series of adverse effects on an animal's body: 1. Weakened immune system: A lack of essential nutrients makes the animal more susceptible to infections and diseases, as its immune system cannot fight off pathogens effectively. 2. Muscle atrophy: With the body breaking down its tissues to supply nourishment, muscles lose their strength and size, causing the animal's movements to become slower and weaker. 3. Organ failure: As starvation progresses, essential organs like the liver, kidneys, and heart begin to fail due to limited nutrient supply, eventually leading to multi-organ dysfunction. 4. Decreased cognitive function: The brain requires glucose to function correctly, and without it, the animal can experience disorientation and reduced mental capacity. 5. Electrolyte imbalance: Electrolytes are needed to maintain the balance of fluids in the body, facilitate nerve function, and regulate muscle contractions. Starvation can cause electrolyte imbalances, leading to irregular heart rhythms and other life-threatening complications. In conclusion, the most suitable option for answering the question \\"What will happen to the animal if it doesn't eat?\\" is option A - the animal will die. The lack of food intake results in a series of biological consequences, ultimately leading to organ failure and death due to malnutrition and starvation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: Image copyright Florida Gun Supply George Zimmerman, who shot and killed an unarmed black teenager in 2012, is selling his paintings of the Confederate battle flag \\"in honour\\" of a Florida gun store owner. The Florida Gun Supply website says he is raising legal funds for himself and the store's owner, who in July declared his business a \\"Muslim-free zone\\". The Confederate battle flag is seen as a symbol of slavery to its critics. But its supporters today say it is an important part of southern heritage. Florida Gun Supply owner Andy Hallinan said he teamed up with Mr Zimmerman, who was acquitted in 2013 of killing black teenager Trayvon Martin, to sell copies of his Confederate flag artwork. Mr Zimmerman later tweeted about his reason for painting the flag. \\"I painted the confederate flag backed by the American flag because I believe that anything can stand with the American flag behind it.\\" He added: \\"My confederate flag painting also represents the hypocrisy of political correctness that is plaguing this nation.\\" 'Splitting the proceeds' A post on the store's website said Mr Zimmerman painted it \\"in honour\\" of Mr Hallinan \\"for being a true patriot and leading the country into a better, safer America\\". Andy Hallinan courted controversy last month when he announced in a YouTube video that his Florida shooting range was closed to Muslims. Mr Zimmerman said he decided to paint the flag after hearing that the Council on American-Islamic Relations was taking legal action against Mr Hallinan. At the time, Mr Hallinan said his decision was inspired by the Chattanooga shooting, which was carried out by a man born in Kuwait who spent several years living in the US. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption George Zimmerman was acquitted of all charges in 2013 Copies of the painting are selling for 50 a piece, each signed and numbered by Mr Zimmerman. It is unclear how many copies have so far been sold. Mr Zimmerman's last painting, which features a blue American flag with the words \\"God, one nation, with liberty and justice for all\\", sold on Ebay for over 100,000. His acquittal in 2013 stirred fierce debate on racial profiling and self-defence laws in the US. It also helped spark the #BlackLivesMatter movement and continues to be a rallying cry for civil rights campaigners. There has also been a backlash over the Confederate flag in recent months, after the man charged with killing nine black people at a church in Charleston in June was pictured holding it. ||||| Buy a Print Today and You're Entered to Win George's Original Confederate Flag Painting (Which could be worth up to 100,000!) FREE SHIPPING UNTIL 8/21/2015! George Zimmerman is teaming up with Florida Gun Supply to offer signed and numbered prints of his Confederate Flag painting. This painting was painted in honor of Andy Hallinan for being a true patriot and leading the country into a better, safer America. Zimmerman's last painting sold on Ebay for over 100,000. Zimmerman's Confederate Flag FAQs: All art has a story to tell. What's George's story? George started painting an American Flag on this canvas, but heard about Andy getting sued by CAIR (the Counsel for American/Islamic Relations) while he was working on the painting. George decided to scrap the original American Flag painting and repaint it with a Confederate (Battle) Flag. ​George painted the confederate flag backed by the American flag because he believed that anything can stand with the American flag behind it. George's confederate flag painting also represents the hypocrisy of political correctness that is plaguing this nation. Politicians across the nation have demanded it's removal; however, not one leader including, but not limited to Barack Hussein Obama demanded the posters displaying a 10,000 bounty on my head, \\"dead or alive,\\" to be removed.​ What a story! On the back of the original canvas, you can still see an outline of the American Flag. Isn't the Confederate Flag racist? No way! The Confederate Flag HAS been used by a small amount of people to incite racism, however, it has not become a symbol of racism. You cannot assume everyone who flies a Confederate Flag is racist in the same way that you cannot judge every Muslim to be a terrorist, or every gun owner to be a serial killer. The media is calling you racist. Why are they calling you racist if you're not? Watch the entire video above, from start to finish. The media isn't interested in spreading the TRUTH about topics. The REAL reason George and Andy have teamed up to sell the Confederate Flag is much less important to the media than continuing to make a villain out of both George and Andy. 4 days after George was found not guilty of murder, he helped pull a family out of an overturned SUV that was on fire. The media didn't bother to report on that because it wouldn't make him look like the evil man they paint him as. Andy recently paid for and planned the entire funeral for a family involved in a road rage murder. The media didn't bother to report on that because it doesn't make Andy look like a villain either. The media will ONLY share the point of view that makes them sell more papers. That's all they're interested in. How big is the print? The print is 24\\"x18\\", which is the exact same size as the original. How long will it take to receive my print? Please allow between 4-6 weeks to receive your print. Each one is numbered and signed by George Zimmerman - which takes a bit of time. How will you choose the winner of the original print? Florida Gun Supply has been giving guns away via giveaways for 4 years. We've gotten pretty great atit. We'll take an export of all the customers who have purchased a print and then generate a nuber from www.random.org. This is a fool proof way to ensure that the winner is chosen fairly. What will you use the money for? George and Andy will be splitting the proceeds - and it will go to support their legal funds, living expenses, and advancing their mission to change the country. A percentage of the proceeds will also go directly to a charity of our choosing. We said in the video we would give a portion of the proceeds to the Boys and Girls Club, but they then told me they didn't want me to use their name in my video. We were just trying to support them! |||||","completion":"George Zimmerman, who shot an unarmed black teenager in 2012, has begun selling his paintings of the Confederate battle flag \\"in honour\\" of a Florida gun store owner who declared his business a \\"Muslim-free zone\\".

Build a movie plot around this: What subject does Mr. Hand teach? American History","completion":"Title: Mr. Hand's History Class Step 1: Introduce main characters and setting Justification: It is crucial to establish the primary characters in the story and provide some context for their background and personalities. The setting must be introduced to create an environment for the story to unfold. Plot Introduction: The story takes place at a small-town high school where Mr. Hand, a passionate American History teacher, struggles to engage his disinterested students. Our protagonist is Lucy, a bright, curious, and ambitious student who feels trapped in her mundane life and looks for a way to escape and make a meaningful impact on the world. Step 2: Develop the inciting incident Justification: An inciting incident is necessary to kick off the story and set the plot in motion. Inciting Incident: One day, Mr. Hand discovers a hidden journal in the school's library, which belonged to the town's founder, Jeremiah Watson, a Revolutionary War hero. The journal contains a code that, once deciphered, could potentially reveal significant untold secrets about American History. Mr. Hand teams up with Lucy, who is eager to unravel the mystery and prove her worth. Step 3: Introduce conflict and obstacles Justification: Conflict and obstacles create tension and keep the audience engaged, making them want to know what happens next. Conflict: As Mr. Hand and Lucy work to decipher the code, they face various challenges, including interference from the school's principal, who is more concerned with maintaining the status quo than uncovering the past. Additionally, they must compete against a greedy local historian, Dr. Vargas, who is after the secret for his personal fame and fortune. Step 4: The climax Justification: The climax is the turning point in the story, where the protagonist faces the primary conflict head-on and experiences a significant change. Climax: Just when Mr. Hand and Lucy are close to uncovering the secret, Dr. Vargas and his henchmen corner them in a hidden chamber beneath the town's historical society building. Despite being outnumbered and outmuscled, the duo cleverly outsmarts Dr. Vargas and reveals the secret: an original draft of the U.S. Constitution with additional amendments written by Jeremiah Watson, which could change the course of American History. Step 5: The resolution Justification: The resolution wraps up the story, shows the consequences of the climax, and provides closure to the main storyline and character arcs. Resolution: Once the secret is revealed, the town and the school gain national attention. The school's principal is fired for his lack of support, and Mr. Hand is promoted to a better position. Lucy's passion, intelligence, and bravery propel her to receive a scholarship for a prestigious university. In the end, Mr. Hand and Lucy's discovery brings them closer together, leaves a lasting impact on the future of their town, and shines a new light on the complexities of American History."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(C). fish tend to move towards the warm areas. (D). fish tend to move towards the colder areas. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Fish species are expected to shrink in size by up to 24% because of global warming, say scientists. The scientists argue that failure to control greenhouse gas emissions will have a greater effect on marine ecosystems than previously thought. Previous research has suggested that changing ocean temperatures would affect both the distribution and the reproductive abilities of many species of fish. This new work suggests that fish size would also be heavily affected. The researchers built a model to see how fish would react to lower levels of oxygen in the water. As ocean temperatures increase, so do the body temperatures of fish. But, according to lead author, Dr William Cheung, from the University of British Columbia, the lower level of oxygen in the water is key. Warmer waters could decrease ocean oxygen levels and greatly reduce fish body weight. On the other hand, rising temperatures directly increase the metabolic rate of the fish's body function. This leads to an increase in oxygen demand for normal body activities. So the fish will run out of oxygen for growth at a smaller body size. The research team also used its model to predict fish movements as a result of warming waters. The group believes that most fish populations will move towards the Earth's poles at a rate of up to 35km per decade. \\"So in, say, the North Sea,\\" says Dr Cheung,\\" one would expect to see more smaller-body fish from tropical waters in the future.\\" Taking these factors into consideration, the research team concludes that fish body size will shrink between 14% and 24%, with the largest decreases in the Indian and Atlantic oceans. When compared with actual observations of fish sizes, the model seems to _ what's actually happening in the seas. The researchers looked at two case studies involving North Atlantic cod and haddock. They found that recorded data on these fish showed greater decreases in body size than the models had predicted. Dr Alan Baudron, from the University of Aberdeen, UK, believes smaller-sized fish could seriously... Question: We can infer that as ocean temperatures increase _ . Answer: Answer:","completion":"We can infer that as ocean temperatures increase (C) fish tend to move towards warm areas. The article states that the research team used their model to predict fish movements as a result of warming waters, and they believe that most fish populations will move towards the Earth's poles at a rate of up to 35km per decade. This suggests that fish tend to move towards warm areas as the ocean temperatures increase. Additionally, the researchers found that fish body sizes will shrink between 14% and 24% due to the impacts of global warming, which include warmer waters decreasing ocean oxygen levels and raising fish metabolic rates, leading to a higher oxygen demand for normal body activities.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"Yes, lost hair can regrow, and the process can vary depending on the cause of hair loss and the individual's overall health. To answer this question, let's break it down step-by-step and consider possible solutions. Step 1: Understand the cause of hair loss Hair loss can result from various factors like genetics, hormonal imbalance, nutritional deficiencies, stress, and environmental factors. To promote hair regrowth, it's crucial to address the root cause of hair loss first. Step 2: Opt for a healthy lifestyle Adopting a healthy lifestyle can positively impact hair growth. Eating a well-balanced diet rich in vitamins, minerals, and proteins can provide essential nutrients for hair growth. Regular exercise, stress reduction through meditation and yoga, and quitting smoking can also contribute to hair regrowth. Step 3: Take care of your scalp Keeping your scalp clean and healthy provides a conducive environment for hair regrowth. Regularly shampoo and condition your hair, gently massage your scalp, and avoid applying heat or harsh chemicals. Step 4: Choose appropriate hair growth treatments There are FDA-approved medications such as minoxidil and finasteride that can be used to treat hair loss. They slow down hair loss and promote regrowth. These medications are available over the counter or with a doctor's prescription. Please consult with a healthcare professional before using these medications. Step 5: Consider natural remedies There are natural remedies like applying essential oils (e.g., rosemary, lavender), using aloe vera, and using onion juice that may help in promoting hair regrowth. It is essential to keep in mind that these remedies might not work for everyone and may take longer to show results. Step 6: Consult with a professional If you're experiencing severe hair loss, it's crucial to consult with a dermatologist or trichologist to determine the appropriate treatment for your specific condition. To answer your second question, \\"Can we regrow our lost hair?\\" and \\"Could lost hair regrow? If so, how?\\" can be considered the same in the context of seeking a solution for hair regrowth.

When water in the sand cannot escape, it creates a liquefied soil that loses strength and cannot support weight. Quicksand can form in standing water or in upwards flowing water (as from an artesian spring). In the case of upwards flowing water, forces oppose the force of gravity and suspend the soil particles. The saturated sediment may appear quite solid until a sudden change in pressure or shock initiates liquefaction. This causes the sand to form a suspension and lose strength. The cushioning of water gives quicksand, and other liquefied sediments, a spongy, fluid-like texture. Objects in liquefied sand sink to the level at which the weight of the object is equal to the weight of the displaced soil/water mix and the submerged object floats due to its buoyancy. Rob is competing in a cross country race. After running about a mile he reached a place with two signs, sign A and sign B. Sign A says that it's a quicksand.

Maybe we can use some new archetypes, as alternatives to the cliche symbols of a dominating culture going worldwide, but in many ways askew. As a race, we're focusing much attention on our common specific problems, but only diffusely concentrating together on needed solutions - much less so, on esoteric geometric shapes which could affect the patterns of our thinking. Make this lower case","completion":"Perhaps introducing new archetypes could encourage innovative thinking and challenge the conventional symbols of a dominating culture that is rapidly spreading across the globe. As a society, we are heavily focused on identifying and analyzing the specific issues that we face collectively, but our efforts in addressing these problems and the solutions often seem rather diffuse or fragmented. Delving into more esoteric geometric shapes and their potential effects on our thought patterns might provide us with alternative perspectives and aid in problem-solving. In our quest to develop new archetypes, we could explore concepts and ideas that have been long overshadowed by our globalized world. By reintroducing these concepts into our social and cultural fabric, we can encourage a deeper, more inclusive understanding of the diverse narratives and histories that have shaped our world. Some potential archetypal ideas to consider could include: 1. The Spiral: Representing growth, evolution, and transformation, the spiral could serve as a symbol for the ever-changing nature of our reality and the continuous process of self-improvement and collective progress. 2. The Web: As a symbol of interconnectedness and the collective network of our lives and experiences, the web could encourage us to recognize the importance of supporting each other and the value of establishing relationships based on mutual understanding and empathy. 3. The Tree: Representing strength, stability, and regeneration, the tree could reflect our need for strong roots and connection to our environment, reminding us of the importance of caring for our planet and respecting the natural world that sustains us. 4. The Labyrinth: Symbolizing the complexity of life's journey and the multiple paths we must navigate, the labyrinth could inspire introspection and a willingness to confront and learn from our internal and external challenges. 5. The Ouroboros: An ancient symbol of a serpent or dragon eating its own tail, the Ouroboros represents the eternal cycle of renewal, the interdependence of life and death, and the wisdom that can only be gained through self-awareness and reflection. By incorporating such archetypal symbols into our thoughts and conversations, we could foster a more creative and holistic approach to problem-solving. By doing so, we acknowledge the wealth of human wisdom that is found in diverse cultural and historical contexts, enabling us to craft solutions that are more adaptable and nuanced than those derived from a single dominating perspective. In conclusion, it is essential for us to challenge the traditional symbols of a dominating culture and instead explore the vast array of archetypes that exist in our collective human understanding. By embracing the esoteric, we provide alternative viewpoints and valuable insights that could greatly influence our problem-solving abilities and mold the way we approach challenges as a society.

After running several tests, the doctors determined Charlotte has no cancer, but she does have high blood pressure. Relieved at this news, Jason was now focused on battling his cancer and fighting as hard as he could to survive. and a hint : Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation. Please answer this question : Who has less abnormal cells in their body?

At the turn of the 21st century, a post-punk revival developed in British and American alternative and indie rock, which soon started appearing in other countries, as well. The earliest sign of a revival was the emergence of various underground bands in the mid-'90s.

Fact 1: Air pollution harms the respiratory and circulatory systems. Fact 2: Nitrogen oxides cause air pollution. Given the two facts above, harm to the respiratory and circulatory systems can come from ? The answer is:","completion":"Harm to the respiratory and circulatory systems can come from nitrogen oxides, as these compounds are one of the key contributors to air pollution. In order to fully understand this, it's essential to first examine how nitrogen oxides contribute to air pollution and subsequently, how air pollution impacts the respiratory and circulatory systems. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are a group of highly reactive gases that primarily consist of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitric oxide (NO). These gases are formed when nitrogen and oxygen react together under high-temperature conditions, such as during combustion processes in vehicles, industrial facilities, and power plants. In the atmosphere, nitrogen oxides can further react with other pollutants, like volatile organic compounds (VOCs), to form ground-level ozone (O3), which is a major component of smog. Air pollution, in general, has been proven to have detrimental effects on human health, particularly on the respiratory and circulatory systems. In regard to the harm caused by nitrogen oxides in particular, the following points can be made: 1. Respiratory system effects: Nitrogen oxides, particularly nitrogen dioxide, can irritate and damage the lining of the respiratory tract, making individuals more susceptible to respiratory infections. Prolonged exposure to high levels of nitrogen oxides may lead to chronic bronchitis and decreased lung function. Furthermore, nitrogen dioxide is a major contributor to the formation of ground-level ozone, which can exacerbate pre-existing respiratory conditions such as asthma, emphysema, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In severe cases, exposure to elevated levels of ozone may cause permanent lung damage. 2. Circulatory system effects: Air pollution, including nitrogen oxides, has been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks, heart failure, and strokes. These harmful effects on the circulatory system arise due to the oxidative stress and inflammation caused by high levels of pollutants in the human body. Studies have shown that nitrogen dioxide can trigger the constriction of blood vessels, leading to increased blood pressure and reduced blood flow to vital organs. 3. Indirect effects on the respiratory and circulatory systems: Nitrogen oxides not only have direct harmful effects on these systems but also contribute to secondary pollutants, including particulate matter (PM) and ground-level ozone, which further amplify the risks associated with respiratory and circulatory diseases. In summary, harm to the respiratory and circulatory systems can come from nitrogen oxides as they are significant contributors to air pollution. These compounds can cause substantial damage to the lining of the respiratory tract, increase susceptibility to infections, aggravate existing respiratory conditions, and have detrimental effects on the circulatory system, including the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, it's crucial to strive for overall air quality improvement and emission reduction measures in order to minimize the harmful health impacts of nitrogen oxides and other air pollutants."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

If you passed him on the street, you wouldn’t think anything was wrong with him. The only issue is he sometimes gets these ‘twitches’ in a random muscle in his body. It’s barely noticeable, just a slight contraction, but if I’m lying with my head on his chest or touching him in any way I can’t fall asleep. He’s not to fussed about cuddling, but I live for that stuff. My favourite thing to do in this world is snuggle with someone on a sofa watching a film after having sex.

Machines make work easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied, increasing the distance over which the force is applied, or changing the direction in which the force is applied. Contrary to popular belief, machines do not increase the amount of work that is done. They just change how the work is done. So if a machine increases the force applied, it must apply the force over a shorter distance. Similarly, if a machine increases the distance over which the force is applied, it must apply less force. Archimedes was a great scientist. He was also a great inventor of machines. He once said that if he could stand somewhere, he could move the earth with his machine. Hearing that, king of Sicily called Archimedes and his fellow scientist Ptolemy to come up with great inventions. Archimedes, as everyone expected, came up with a great machine. But Ptolemy couldn't do much in such a limited time. So, his device was not a machine. Whose device would have less distance for applied force, Archimedes or Ptolemy? Answer:","completion":"Archimedes. Step 1: Understand the problem The problem states that machines can make work easier by increasing force, distance, or changing the direction of force. Archimedes and Ptolemy were called upon by the king of Sicily to invent machines. Archimedes came up with a great machine, while Ptolemy couldn't create a significant device. Step 2: Analyze the machines Since Archimedes came up with a great machine, it can be assumed that his device made work easier by either increasing the force, increasing the distance, or changing the direction of the force. It can also be inferred that Ptolemy's device, which was not a machine, did not hold these properties. Step 3: Compare the distances for applied force The question asks whose device would have less distance for applied force. Since Archimedes' machine made work easier, it likely increased the force applied, which would subsequently decrease the distance over which the force would need to be applied. Ptolemy's device, being less effective and not a machine, would not exhibit this trade-off between force and distance. Therefore, it can be concluded that Archimedes' device would have less distance for the applied force."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Many people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common. Mark has just graduated high school and is going to visit his grandpa, Tom, over the summer for a couple days. Since Tom is retired, he often has plenty of time to go fishing, and he even has a small cabin by the lake. The two men are planning to spend several days at the cabin cooking, fishing, chopping firewood to make fires and just general outdoor activities. Is Tom's chance of getting sick while at the cabin higher or lower than Mark's? A:","completion":"Tom's chance of getting sick while at the cabin is likely higher than Mark's due to several factors related to old age. As people age, their immune system becomes less efficient, which increases the risk of serious illnesses and infections. In your given scenario, Tom is over 65 years old and thus experiences a natural decline in his immune system's performance, while Mark is young and just graduated from high school, implying that his immune system is still robust. There are multiple reasons why older people like Tom are more susceptible to getting sick: 1. Reduced immune response: With age, the immune system becomes less efficient, leading to a slower and less effective response in fighting off infections. This makes it more likely for older individuals to catch common illnesses, such as colds and flu, and can be especially dangerous if the immune system is further weakened by a pre-existing condition. 2. Chronic health conditions: Older people are more likely to have chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or respiratory problems, which can weaken the immune system and make them more susceptible to infections. 3. Decreased physical resilience: As people age, their bodies become less resilient, and their ability to recover from illnesses decreases. This means that older individuals may experience more severe and prolonged symptoms compared to younger individuals when they get sick. 4. Decline in organ function: Aging can cause a decline in the function of various organs, such as the lungs or kidneys, which can affect the body's ability to fight off infections. Despite these factors, engaging in outdoor activities and socializing can provide potential health benefits for Tom. For instance, staying active through fishing and chopping firewood may help maintain his physical strength, while spending time with his grandson could positively influence his cognitive and emotional well-being. However, it is essential for both Tom and Mark to take proper precautions while engaging in outdoor activities, such as maintaining good hygiene, getting appropriate vaccinations, and protecting themselves from environmental hazards. This will help minimize the risk of illness for both individuals. In conclusion, Tom's chance of getting sick while at the cabin is likely higher than Mark's due to the natural decline in immune system efficiency that occurs with age. However, engaging in outdoor activities with proper precautions can provide health benefits for both individuals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The pearl and diamond earrings showcase a refined and exquisite taste, perfectly complementing her sophisticated style. The necklace, with its impressive attention to detail and intricate design, adds an air of regality to the royal tour wardrobe. The remaining two sets of earrings hold their own unique charm, making each piece a beautiful addition to the Duchess's ensemble. Step 5: Consider the impact on the designers Finally, it's essential to think about how this opportunity could affect Tory & Ko's future in the jewellery and fashion industry. With their designs being worn by the Duchess of Cambridge and gaining exposure on the international stage, this could potentially open up numerous opportunities and collaborations for the designers and their brand."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: When a pregnant Elizabeth Lynch woke up at 4 a.m. today with strong contractions, she wasn’t sure there was time to make it the hospital. “She was skeptical at that point … but we gave it a shot, and obviously we didn’t make it,” said her husband, Dan Lynch. Instead Lynch, a captain with the Evanston Fire Department, pulled off of the Edens Expressway and assisted as his wife gave birth to their fifth child, Mary Margaret Lynch, in their car. Daniel and Elizabeth Lynch with their new daughter, Mary Margaret. NorthShore University HealthSystem NorthShore University HealthSystem Dan Lynch said his wife had started feeling strong contractions Thursday night and he had called his mother to come look after their other four children in their Edison Park home. But then the contractions subsided, he said, so Elizabeth decided to rest for a while. When she woke up and said she thought the baby was coming soon, the couple headed for the hospital but only got as far as the Touhy Avenue exit on the expressway. Dan Lynch called 911 and pulled over onto the shoulder. “That was pretty much it. That baby was ready to go there,” said Dan Lynch, 32. “I opened the door for some light because it was pretty dark out. It was a good catch.” He has never delivered a baby before but has had some training on it. “I just focused on what I had to do, I guess,” he said. Baby and mother were taken to Evanston NorthShore Hospital. “Me and my wife got very lucky, but everybody’s doing fine,” Lynch added. “It’s not the most ideal circumstances, but it turned out great. I’m glad to have my fifth child healthy. I have five healthy children now and we’ve decided not to have any more.

One of the many things Daniel Lynch learned while training to be a firefighter and paramedic was how to deliver a baby, but the closest he ever came was watching a doctor in a hospital perform the job.That all changed in dramatic fashion Friday. In a minivan on the side of an expressway, Lynch unexpectedly brought a newborn into the world – his own.\\"It's the first time I did it myself,\\" he told PEOPLE. In fact, apart from his other four children, he said he's never even seen a baby being born.It's not exactly how Lynch, 32, a captain with the Evanston, Illinois, fire department, and his wife, Elizabeth, 32, planned to welcome their new daughter.They knew the time was approaching, though, when Elizabeth, who was three days past her due date, started feeling intense contractions about midnight at their Chicago home. But the contractions suddenly stopped and she was able to fall asleep for a few hours.At about 4:25 a.m., though, she awoke with very intense contractions and she and her husband decided to get into their Honda Odyssey and head for Evanston Hospital, about 15 minutes away, leaving the other kids home with his mother.Elizabeth called ahead to her midwife and planned to meet her at the hospital, but just as Lynch got onto the Edens Expressway a few minutes from their home, Elizabeth knew she wouldn't make it.\\"I told him to pull over,\\" she told PEOPLE from her hospital bed.Lynch called 911, then ran to the passenger side and helped guide his new baby girl into the world. \\"The baby's head was already halfway out,\\" he said. \\"I said, 'Push.' \\"A few minutes later, Mary Margaret Lynch made her debut, at 4:45 a.m., before police or firefighters had a chance to get there.

I just trusted Dan though.\\"Lynch wrapped his new bundle of joy in a blanket, then drove his wife and newborn the rest of the way to the hospital.In his eight years as a firefighter and paramedic, Lynch has been more used to fighting fires, tending patients experiencing chest pain, shortness of breath and trauma, saving people trapped in cars and helping out with water rescues from Lake Michigan. \\"You really really don't expect to deliver children,\\" he said.Still, he and his fellow paramedics did learn a thing or two about delivering babies in class. \\"We paid attention,\\" he said.Mary Margaret joins siblings Madeline, 6, Tommy, 5, Hank, 3 and Charlie, 18 months, who all were born in more traditional fashion in the hospital.\\"It's our fifth,\\" said the proud papa. \\"And last.\\"Elizabeth agreed. \\"We went out,\\" she said, \\"with a bang.\\" |||||","completion":"Pregnant Elizabeth Lynch started experiencing strong contractions in the early hours and was unsure if there was time to make it to the hospital.

What is the difference between a serf and a slave? What is the difference between serfs and slaves? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"The terms \\"serf\\" and \\"slave\\" are indeed related in that they both describe a condition of unfreedom and servitude. However, there are significant and notable differences in the social, economic, and legal aspects of each type of servitude. In this detailed answer, we will explore the main differences between a serf and a slave alongside the distinctions between the two questions presented. 1. Historical context: Serfdom and slavery have distinct historical contexts. Serfdom was most prominent in the European Middle Ages, particularly in the feudal systems of Western and Eastern Europe. Slavery, on the other hand, has a more global historical context, as it has been practiced since ancient times in various societies, such as ancient Rome, Greece, Egypt, and the Americas during the colonization and transatlantic slave trade era. 2. Legal and social status: Serfs were legally tied to the land they worked on for a lord or noble. As part of the feudal system, they were considered part of the estate and had limited personal freedom. While they were not considered full property like slaves, they could not leave the land without the lord's permission. They were also subject to certain obligations, such as providing labor, goods, and military service to the lord. However, they were afforded some legal protections and certain rights, such as access to common land resources and the right to marry and raise a family. Slaves, in contrast, were considered legal property and were completely at the mercy of their masters, who could sell, trade, or even kill them without facing any legal repercussions. Slaves did not have any rights or legal protections, and they lacked access to social mobility. 3. Economic implications: Serfs typically had a more secure form of livelihood than slaves. They were allowed to cultivate certain plots of land allotted to them by their lords in return for their labor and obligations. They could produce food for their families and sell the surplus in the market, if there was any, for additional income. However, the lord still held considerable control over their economic lives, as he could raise demands or reduce the serfs' share of production as he saw fit. The serfs' economic status, although modest, was more secure compared to that of slaves. In contrast, slaves were often required to work in hard labor jobs without any compensation or control over their working conditions. They did not have any claim to land or the means to earn an independent livelihood. Moreover, the economic opportunities available to slaves could be limited and highly dependent on the whims of their masters. To address the second part of the question, the two submitted questions are nearly identical in meaning, with just slight variations in the wording. Both questions are focused on identifying the difference between serfs and slaves. While the first question uses \\"a serf and a slave\\" and the second question uses \\"serfs and slaves\\", they essentially convey the same request for information about the distinctions between these two forms of servitude."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Question: \\"__ has been occupied continuously for 14,000 years.\\" Context: \\"The Anglo-Saxons formed a new, larger, settlement across the Itchen centred on what is now the St Mary's area of the city. The settlement was known as Hamwic, which evolved into Hamtun and then Hampton. Archaeological excavations of this site have uncovered one of the best collections of Saxon artefacts in Europe. It is from this town that the county of Hampshire gets its name.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The city mentioned in the context, which has been occupied continuously for 14,000 years, is Southampton. Located on the southern coast of England, Southampton has a rich history that dates back thousands of years. Its strategic location near the confluence of the River Itchen and River Test, along with its natural harbor, has made it an ideal location for settlements throughout history. This ancient city was initially settled by various tribes and peoples, such as the Celts and the Romans, before becoming the home of the Anglo-Saxons who formed a new, larger settlement centered around what is now the St Mary's area of the city. This settlement was known as Hamwic, which later evolved into Hamtun and then Hampton. Hamwic was a thriving Anglo-Saxon community, and the archaeological excavations of this site have uncovered one of the best collections of Saxon artefacts in Europe. This rich history has revealed not only how the early Anglo-Saxon settlements were structured and their way of life but also their trade links with other European countries during that period. The county of Hampshire, in which Southampton is located, gets its name from the settlement of Hampton. The name evolved over time, and the county is now synonymous with a long and storied history that encompasses a wide variety of cultures and historical landmarks, such as the famed Winchester Cathedral, the New Forest, and the historic naval port of Portsmouth. Throughout its history, Southampton has endured numerous changes, such as the Norman Conquest and the Industrial Revolution, which have shaped its development. Its port has played a crucial role in its growth, with Southampton being a key departure point for the famous Mayflower, which carried the Pilgrims to America in 1620. In more recent times, Southampton has continued to be an important city in the United Kingdom, being known for its maritime and cultural heritage as well as being a hub for trade, tourism, and education. The city is steeped in history and is home to museums, galleries, and historic sites that celebrate its rich past and showcase its ongoing development. In conclusion, Southampton is the city that has been occupied continuously for 14,000 years. Its fascinating history and valuable archaeological findings have shed light on the lives and cultures that have shaped this region over millennia, making it an important location for the study of ancient civilizations. The city's historical significance extends beyond its Saxon roots, encompassing many different eras and cultures, which have all contributed to the diverse and thriving city it is today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: this composer was known for ballet symphonic works and american nationalism?","completion":"The composer known for his ballet symphonic works and infusing elements of American nationalism in his music was Aaron Copland. Copland was an American composer, conductor, and teacher, born on November 14, 1900, in Brooklyn, New York, United States. Apart from the blend of Americanism in his compositions, Copland is famed for the incorporation of folk and ballet into classical music. He is often referred to as \\"the Dean of American Composers,\\" a title reflecting his significant influence on 20th-century American music. Some of Copland's most distinguished works are his ballet scores. These include \\"Billy the Kid\\" (1938), \\"Rodeo\\" (1942), and \\"Appalachian Spring\\" (1944), the last of which won him the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1945. These works are recognized for their vividness and visual evocations. Many of Copland's ballet scores have strong American themes and feature elements of folk music, embodying the spirit of American nationalism. \\"Billy the Kid\\" is a ballet composed that embodies the spirit of the wild west, and is punctuated by famous cowboy tunes, which gives it an air of rugged authenticity. \\"Rodeo\\" is another ballet filled with cowboy-like American popular melodies. The most famous section, \\"Hoe-Down,\\" has become synonymous with cowboy culture in the United States. \\"Appalachian Spring,\\" is arguably Copland's most well-known ballet composition. It resonates with the simplicity of rural America by using Shaker melodies, particularly the famous \\"Simple Gifts.\\" The score conjures up images of the pioneer landscape and is seen as quintessentially American. Apart from these ballet scores, Copland’s orchestral works, including \\"Fanfare for the Common Man\\" and \\"Lincoln Portrait\\", are also celebrated for their strong nationalist sentiment. He was one of the first composers to attempt to create an identifiable American sound. Copland was not only well-versed in music composition, but he was also deeply involved in teaching and promoting understanding of music. Across his career, he lectured, wrote, and taught extensively, making the understanding of music accessible to a larger audience. In summary, Aaron Copland's innovative blend of popular forms such as folk and ballet, alongside classical techniques and his distinct American touch in symphonic compositions left an indelible mark on 20th-century classical music. His work substantially contributed to shaping American classical music and instilling in it a sense of nationalism."},{"prompt":"Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: In our life,we may meet people with different personalities .What is your personality type ?Read about the following and find out!

On the surface Mr. & Mrs. Feinstone seem to have a nice life, a beautiful home in Los Angeles & he has a successful career with responsibility but beneath things are very wrong. Alan discovers that Brooke is having an affair with Matt (Michael Stadvec) the swimming pool cleaner, to add to his humiliation Alan then discovers that Matt is also having sex with Paula Roberts (Lise Simms) one of his next door neighbours & to top it all off he owes the IRS, who are breathing down his neck, a shed load of money. Alan starts to lose his mind, he convinces himself that everything is decayed & rotten, just like his patient's teeth, & it's up to him to fix it. That morning at work he begins to take his frustrations & anger out on his patients, first he injures a young boy named Jody (Brian McLaughlin), he sexual assault's a patient named April Reign (Christa Sauls) after he hallucinates that she is his wife & deliberately performs an unnecessary & painful procedure on another. Alan also begins to take drugs as he completely loses it & goes homicidal starting with his adulterous wife & pool cleaner... Directed by Brian Yuzna I thought The Dentist was a good film & tried something a bit different. The script by Dennis Paoli, Stuart Gordon & Charles Finch is more of a psycho thriller than straight slasher which came as a surprise to me as I was expecting the latter, it would have been easy to make a teenage slasher film like Friday the 13th (1980) with a high body count & a wise cracking dentist villain but what The Dentist actually turned out to be is very different. The Dentist is at heart a character study of one mans descent into madness & it does a fine job although having said that I'm not sure what he goes through is enough justification for his subsequent murderous actions. It moves along at a nice pace, has a nice narrative in which I liked the constant connection Alan makes between the decay he sees in his patients & the decay he sees in the world around him & is an entertaining way to pass 90 odd minutes. It goes without saying that anyone with a phobia about the dentist probably should give this one a miss or you'll never go again! I liked the ending too where the tables are turned, I'll say no more... Director Yuzna does his usual fine job here, in fact I don't think I've seen a Yuzna film that I didn't enjoy to some extent, he obviously & predictably takes the opportunity to play on our fear of the dentist with some nice dental torture set pieces including pulling people's teeth out, sexually molesting them, performing operations on drugs & torturing people with the dreaded dentist's drill. There are some other gore scenes as well, a dead dog, someone gorily slashed with a knife & cut out tongues. Yuzna gives the film a certain style on what was probably a low budget, he likes to tilt his camera which make for some nice angles & I liked the shot where the camera is above someone being knifed & huge sprays of blood splatter on the floor in a nice wide overhead angle. Technically The Dentist is fine, decent cinematography, music & production values although some of the special make-up effects look a little unconvincing. The acting is pretty strong from everyone involved with Corbin putting in a good crackpot performance. The ever cool & genre favourite Ken Foree turns up as Detective Gibbs one of Los Angeles finest. The Dentist didn't turn out like I had expected & all the better for it, if your a horror fan & perhaps want something a bit different then this is well worth checking out.

Background: Camille Pissarro (French: [kamij pisaRo]; 10 July 1830 - 13 November 1903) was a Danish-French Impressionist and Neo-Impressionist painter born on the island of St Thomas (now in the US Virgin Islands, but then in the Danish West Indies). His importance resides in his contributions to both Impressionism and Post-Impressionism. Pissarro studied from great forerunners, including Gustave Courbet and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot. He later studied and worked alongside Georges Seurat and Paul Signac when he took on the Neo-Impressionist style at the age of 54. Context: Jacob Abraham Camille Pissarro was born on 10 July 1830 on the island of St. Thomas to Frederick and Rachel Manzano de Pissarro. His father was of Portuguese Jewish descent and held French nationality. His mother was from a French-Jewish family from the island of St. Thomas. His father was a merchant who came to the island from France to deal with the hardware store of a deceased uncle and married his widow. The marriage caused a stir within St. Thomas' small Jewish community because she was previously married to Frederick's uncle and according to Jewish law a man is forbidden from marrying his aunt. In subsequent years his four children were forced to attend the all-black primary school. Upon his death, his will specified that his estate be split equally between the synagogue and St. Thomas' Protestant church. When Camille was twelve his father sent him to boarding school in France. He studied at the Savary Academy in Passy near Paris. While a young student, he developed an early appreciation of the French art masters. Monsieur Savary himself gave him a strong grounding in drawing and painting and suggested he draw from nature when he returned to St. Thomas, which he did when he was seventeen. However, his father preferred he work in his business, giving him a job working as a cargo clerk. He took every opportunity during those next five years at the job to practise drawing during breaks and after work. When Pissarro turned twenty-one, Danish artist Fritz Melbye, then living on St. Thomas, inspired him to take on painting as a full-time profession, becoming his teacher and friend. Pissarro then chose to leave his family and job and live in Venezuela, where he and Melbye spent the next two years working as artists in Caracas and La Guaira. He drew everything he could, including landscapes, village scenes, and numerous sketches, enough to fill up multiple sketchbooks. In 1855 he moved back to Paris where he began working as assistant to Anton Melbye, Fritz Melbye's brother. Question: Did he do well at the acadamey?.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Fears of Renewed Instability as Fed Ends Stimulus Program After a nearly uninterrupted five-year rally in stocks and bonds, some investors seem to be getting nervous. On July 31, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 317 points, wiping out the year’s gains. Last week, junk bond funds experienced record withdrawals and junk bond interest rates spiked. Such gyrations may be healthy, a reminder that there are risks and that markets go down as well as up. But they could also be the harbinger of something more worrisome, which would be renewed financial instability as the Federal Reserve brings to an end its extraordinary easy money policy. The Federal Reserve has said it expects to raise interest rates in 2015 for the first time since the financial crisis. “There’s no real precedent for ending anything of this magnitude,” said Jeremy Stein, who left the Fed’s Board of Governors at the end of May to return to Harvard’s economics department, where I caught up with him last month on the day of the Dow’s big drop. As the Fed feels its way, he said, investors may have to prepare for greater volatility. James B. Stewart of The New York Times discusses market volatility on CNBC. While at the Fed, Mr. Stein was viewed as the chief advocate for financial stability on the seven-member board, where he pondered the possible unintended consequences of the Fed’s stimulus policies. Mr. Stein said his differences with his fellow board members, and especially the chairwoman, Janet Yellen, had been exaggerated and were more a matter of nuance. “I certainly felt we were courting some risks” with the Fed’s last round of quantitative easing, he acknowledged. “But then again, given the level of the unemployment rate at the time, some risk-taking was warranted.” In April, in his last speech as a Fed board member, Mr. Stein warned that monetary policy should be “less aggressive” when credit risk premiums were extremely low, as they were then, and they’ve gotten even lower since. “To be clear, we are not necessarily talking about once-in-a-generation financial crises here, with major financial institutions teetering on the brink of failure,” he said in a speech to the International Monetary Fund. “Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that even more modest capital market disruptions may have consequences that are large enough to warrant consideration when formulating monetary policy.” Mr. Stein’s concerns have been gaining traction. They’re expected to be a major topic at next week’s annual gathering of Fed officials, policy makers and economists at Jackson Hole, Wyo. This week, former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Martin Feldstein, a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and a Harvard professor, sounded similar themes in an op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal, warning that the Fed-induced low rates “have led to reaching for yield in many ways and in very large magnitudes.” They added, “The risk of excesses and the consequent instability have increased substantially.” Mr. Stein’s analysis has also influenced Ms. Yellen, although she puts a higher priority than he does on full employment. Ms. Yellen devoted an entire speech to the subject of financial stability last month at the I.M.F., where she said the Fed had devoted “substantially increased resources” to monitoring stability and acknowledged that the Fed’s low-interest rate policy had spurred “households and businesses to take on the risk of potentially productive investments.” But, she went on, “Such risk-taking can go too far, thereby contributing to fragility in the financial system.” She even explored a previously taboo subject, which is whether the Fed contributed to the post-2000 housing bubble by keeping rates too low. While conceding the low rates may have been a factor, she warned that raising rates was “a very blunt tool” that would probably have had worse consequences than rising housing prices. While she said she saw no need now for tighter monetary policy than the Fed had charted, she did identify “pockets” of excess and added, “some investors may underappreciate the potential for losses and volatility going forward.” While some critics took Ms. Yellen to the woodshed for purporting to identify bubbles, comparing her comments to then Fed chairman Alan Greenspan’s ill-timed reference in 1996 to the stock market’s “irrational exuberance,” Mr. Stein called Ms. Yellen’s speech “admirable.” The Fed chairwoman “was being forthright,” he said. “She’s struggling with this issue in an honest way, which is progress. I don’t think anyone has yet figured out the right answer about how to deal with this.” Ms. Yellen is hardly alone in worrying that some asset prices are at unsustainable levels, especially in parts of the bond market. The activist investor Carl Icahn weighed in this week on Tumblr, saying, “Yellen’s comments suggest, and I agree, that we are in an asset bubble.” It’s dubious that Ms. Yellen would go that far, but persistently high prices, especially in the bond market, have puzzled many economists. After a brief spike last year after the Fed announced that it would taper its bond purchases, interest rates have fallen this year — the opposite of what many economists and investors expected. (Bond prices fall as interest rates rise, and vice versa.) “You can only explain about 20 percent of the variability in asset prices based on fundamentals,” Mr. Stein said. “We don’t understand the other 80 percent. All the Fed can hope to do is to be slow and deliberate” and communicate its intentions. The Princeton economist Markus K. Brunnermeier, an expert on asset bubbles and crashes, has identified what he calls “synchronization risk,” a phenomenon in which investors ride a wave of price increases even if they realize the assets are overpriced. “It’s what economists call a lack of common knowledge,” he said. “We may all know an asset price is too high, but we don’t know that others know it, too. Timing is everything. The danger is if you move too early and the market doesn’t follow up. So everyone waits on the sidelines watching and listening,” as long as asset prices keep rising. The danger comes when they all try to get out at the same time. This seems especially true of many fund managers, who don’t want to underperform their rivals and obsessively follow one another’s moves. Professor Brunnermeier attributes the sudden spike in interest rates last year partly to a fund stampede once bond prices showed signs of cracking. “I very much think that stability is a major issue, and the Fed has to take it into account,” Professor Brunnermeier said. “Ideally, you want to see markets correct early rather than late in one big crash.” How to achieve that remains elusive. “Speaking only for myself, you don’t want to raise rates too aggressively now,” Mr. Stein said. “It may be too late for that. Financial markets are fairly fragile.” Current official forecasts are for the federal funds rate to rise to 2.5 percent in 2016 from the current rate of 0.25 percent, and Mr. Stein said he was “comfortable” that a rise of that magnitude made sense if the economy stayed on its current course. Still, he says the Fed should stick to its guns even if markets gyrate. “This is subtle, but I’d try to indicate a little more willingness to stay the course if financial markets fluctuate one way or the other,” he said. “Markets seem to sense an element of a Fed put, and that complacency can be a source of risk in itself, so you have to push back on that a bit.” (A put is an option that protects investors if prices decline.) In other words, investors shouldn’t expect the Fed to come to the rescue just because stock or bond markets falter. No one wants another crash, but a garden-variety correction may be just what’s needed to avoid one in the future.","completion":"The article discusses fears of renewed financial instability, as the Federal Reserve brings to an end its easy money policy. After a nearly uninterrupted five-year rally in stocks and bonds, some investors were getting nervous, and the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 317 points in July 2014, wiping out the year's gains. Junk bond funds experienced record withdrawals and junk bond interest rates spiked during that time. The concerns over economic instability are mainly due to the fact that there is no real precedent for ending a stimulus program of this magnitude. As the Federal Reserve felt its way, investors were encouraged to prepare for greater volatility. The concerns about potential instability were expected to be a major topic at the annual gathering of Fed officials, policy makers, and economists, held in August 2014. The article highlights that while some critics are more concerned with asset prices reaching unsustainable levels, especially in parts of the bond market, others argue that the unpredictable nature of asset prices is largely due to varying fundamentals and that all the Fed can hope for is to be slow and deliberate in its actions, with clear communication of its intentions. Overall, the article emphasizes that the real challenge lies in finding ways to prevent or mitigate the potential risks associated with ending the stimulus program, while maintaining overall economic stability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: What Russian institutions were removed in the decade following Estonia's reclaim of independence? A: This was a result of the migration policies essential to the Soviet Nationalisation Programme aiming to russify Estonia – administrative and military immigration of non-Estonians from the USSR coupled with the deportation of Estonians to the USSR. Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"After Estonia regained its independence in 1991 following the collapse of the USSR, various Russian institutions and organizations were either removed, restructured, or had their influence significantly reduced during the following decade (1991-2001). The main reasons for this shift were Estonia's need to assert its distinct cultural and political identity and to break away from Soviet-era policies that had promoted Russification. 1. Military bases and installations: The presence of the Russian military in Estonia was a major concern for the newly independent nation. Between 1991 and 1994, a series of negotiations and agreements took place between Russia and Estonia that resulted in the withdrawal of Russian troops and the closure of military bases and installations in the country. 2. KGB presence: The KGB was the Soviet Union's main security agency, with considerable influence in Estonia during Soviet times. In the years following Estonia's independence, the organization's presence was eliminated, with former KGB operatives and informants being prosecuted or expelled from the country. 3. Political institutions: The Estonian Communist Party (EKP) had significant power under Soviet rule. After Estonia's independence, the EKP was disbanded and its properties and assets nationalized. In addition, the political landscape was reshaped through free and fair elections, which allowed for the formation of new political parties independent of direct Russian influence. 4. Russian-language schools: Under the Soviet Nationalisation Programme, Estonian schools were compelled to teach in Russian, effectively promoting Russification. In the 1990s, Estonia reformed its educational system, gradually reintroducing the Estonian language as the primary medium of instruction and reducing the presence of Russian-specific schools. 5. State administration and bureaucracy: During the Soviet era, positions in the Estonian state administration were frequently staffed by ethnic Russians or native Estonians loyal to the USSR. Following independence, strict citizenship and language requirements were implemented to reduce the influence of people with Soviet-era ties, resulting in a significant decrease in Russian presence within the Estonian bureaucracy. 6. State-owned enterprises: After Estonia's independence, the government began a process of privatization, selling off businesses that were previously owned and managed by the Soviet government. This eliminated Russian control over key sectors of the Estonian economy and encouraged investment from other nations. 7. Cultural institutions: Many cultural institutions heavily influenced by Russian policies and norms were either closed down or restructured after Estonia's independence. The government aimed to promote Estonian culture and history, reversing decades of Soviet-imposed Russification. In summary, the decade following Estonia's reclaim of independence was marked by a concerted effort to reduce or eliminate Russian institutions and influences that had permeated the country during Soviet rule. This included the removal of Russian military presence, the restructuring of political and educational systems, and the promotion of Estonian culture and language at the expense of Russification."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jack Straw is a male, as evidenced by the masculine first name \\"Jack.\\" The use of the pronoun \\"his\\" further validates this assumption. 2. The position of Foreign Secretary is a high-ranking government role, responsible for representing their country in relations with foreign governments and handling international diplomacy. In this context, it is clear that Jack Straw holds the position of Foreign Secretary for the United Kingdom (as he is mentioned to be the \\"British Foreign Secretary\\"). 3. The paragraph also mentions a meeting between Jack Straw and Celso Amorim, who is identified as the Brazilian counterpart. This implies that Celso Amorim holds a similar position in the Brazilian government, likely as Brazil's Foreign Minister. Therefore, considering the provided information in the paragraph, it is clear that the British Foreign Secretary is a man, specifically referring to Jack Straw."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

TABOR requirement asks voters to decide whether the state gets to keep 66.1 million in taxes they already have approved Colorado voters Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a statewide ballot measure that gives state lawmakers permission, once again, to spend 66.1 million in taxes collected from the sale of recreational marijuana. The outcome came as no surprise given its bipartisan backing, and election returns as of 9:40 p.m. showed Proposition BB receiving about 69 percent support, well above the majority-vote threshold, according to returns from counties. The secretary of state website incorrectly reported the first returns — getting the results backward, officials confirmed. The measure sends the first 40 million to school construction and 12 million designated for youth and substance-abuse programs. The remaining 14.1 million goes to discretionary accounts controlled by lawmakers. The ballot question was the third time in four years that voters considered how to spend pot taxes, after approving Amendment 64 in 2012 to legalize marijuana and Proposition AA in 2013 to levy sales and excises taxes. In both prior ballot questions, voters sanctioned sending 40 million toward school construction. \\"These election results shouldn't surprise anyone,\\" said Sen. Pat Steadman, the Denver Democrat who authored the measure. \\"Voters have twice indicated they wanted marijuana to be taxed, and the vote just reaffirms that for a third time.\\" Tuesday's vote became necessary after fiscal analysts underestimated how much revenue the state would collect without the new tax in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015. The projection is required in the tax's first year by the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights, and the mistake mandated a refund unless lawmakers won voter approval to spend it. If the measure failed, taxpayers would have received a 25 million rebate — ranging from 6 to 16 per person, depending on income level — and another 41 million would return to marijuana growers and recreational users through tax breaks. The question generated little attention in the off-year election, reflecting the limited controversy on the measure in the General Assembly earlier this year. Only 23 of 100 lawmakers voted against the bill, all Republicans. \\"We are just fulfilling the promises that were made when Amendment 64 was passed,\\" said state Rep. Polly Lawrence, R-Douglas County, in a recent interview. The \\"Vote Yes on Prop BB\\" campaign anticipated raising about 14,000 but didn't spend any money on advertisements or mass mailers. The \\"No on Prop BB/No on Excess Government\\" committee didn't collect any money. But critics — including Americans for Tax Reform, a Washington, D.C.-based group — sought to label the question as a \\"tax increase,\\" adding a political tint to the issue. The Independence Institute, a limited government advocacy organization based in Denver, also raised questions about how the money would be spent, suggesting it could be unsustainable. \\"The original proponents of Amendment 64 were very clever ... to tie pot taxes to school construction, even though the two have zero to do with each other,\\" said Mike Krause at the Independence Institute. \\"It made it an easy choice for a lot of voters.\\" However, Krause said the vote \\"shows a degree of inconsistency on how people feel about TABOR, because most TABOR overrides, at least statewide, don't do well.\\" John Frank: 303-954-2409, jfrank@denverpost.com or @ByJohnFrank ||||| × Marijuana tax to pay for college scholarships NEW YORK — Starting in 2017, high school graduates in one Colorado county will be able to turn to a college scholarship funded by marijuana tax. On Tuesday, 60% of voters in Pueblo County approved a measure that will phase in an increase in taxes — 5% by 2020 — on marijuana growers to fund college scholarships and other community projects. The county is expected to raise 3.5 million with this tax increase, and at least half the revenue will go toward funding scholarships for high school graduates in Pueblo to attend local colleges. Depending on revenue, the program might be expanded in future years. “The whole point of the scholarship program was to make higher education a reality for families who can’t afford to send their kids to school because of debt,” said Paris Carmichael, a spokesperson for Pueblo County. According to Carmichael, this type of scholarship, funded by a marijuana tax, appears to be the first of its kind. The challenge for the county will be “how well Pueblo can manage educating minors in staying away from recreational marijuana and encourage the growth and development of that industry [at the same time],” said Tyler Henson, the president of the Colorado Cannabis Chamber of Commerce. The money not used by the college scholarship program will be dedicated to a long list of community projects that includes enhancing a playground at an elementary school, funding a study about extending an Amtrak route to the county and replacing golf carts at a local golf course. ||||| DENVERStudents attending college in a southern Colorado county will soon have a chance to tap into the state's lucrative legal marijuana industry after voters approved a tax on local cannabis growing operations to fund scholarships for higher education. Voters in Pueblo County approved by a 60 percent to 40 percent margin a measure that imposes a 5 percent excise tax on cultivators who supply Colorado's medical and recreational marijuana industries, the county clerk's office said on Wednesday. Beginning in 2017, any high school graduate in the county will be eligible to apply for the scholarship, the Board of Pueblo County Commissioners said in a statement. The three-member board referred the measure to voters as a way to provide more opportunities for local students to advance their educations at either Colorado State University-Pueblo or Pueblo Community College. \\"It's due time that we make college affordable for everyone in our community,\\" Commissioner Sal Pace said. The money will be available to prospective students in any field of study and county officials believe the program is the first of its kind in the nation. \\"There are some scholarships that come out of the legal marijuana industry but our preliminary research showed that this is the first to come from tax revenue,\\" said Pueblo County spokeswoman Paris Carmichael. Colorado is among four states and the District of Columbia where voters have approved recreational cannabis use by adults. About two dozen states allow cannabis use for medical purposes. Under the plan, each year at least 50 percent of the revenue derived from the pot tax will be set aside in a cash fund for the scholarships. The tax will be phased in over five years, and the county estimates the fund will reach 5 million when it is fully implemented by 2020, according to the ballot question's language. The remaining receipts from the tax will go toward medical marijuana research, road and hiking trail upgrades, refurbishing a historic courthouse and other public improvement projects, officials said. Carmichael could not provide the number of marijuana cultivation sites in the county but she said the majority are outdoor growing operations. The climate in the area is warmer than other parts of Colorado and the 160,000-resident county has long been known for agriculture. Pueblo is home to the annual Colorado State Fair & Rodeo.

Plot title: Wonder Boys Movie plot: Professor Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) is a novelist who teaches creative writing at an unnamed Pittsburgh university (the movie was shot chiefly in and around Carnegie Mellon). He is having an affair with the university chancellor, Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand), whose husband, Walter (Richard Thomas), is the chairman of the English department in which Grady is a professor. Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier. He continues to labor on a second novel, but the more he tries to finish it the less able he finds himself to invent a satisfactory ending. The book runs to over two and a half thousand pages and is still far from finished. He spends his free time smoking marijuana. Grady's students include James Leer (Tobey Maguire) and Hannah Green (Katie Holmes). Hannah and James are friends and both very good writers. Hannah, who rents a room in Grady's large house, is attracted to Grady, but he does not reciprocate. James is enigmatic, quiet, dark and enjoys writing fiction more than he first lets on. During a party at the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is pregnant with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays. However, the gun turns out to be very real, as James shoots the Gaskells' dog when he finds it attacking Grady. James also steals a very valuable piece of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia from the house. Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal.

Q:The answer to the question: What is the name of the work Hindemith's attempted period reconstruction of, was followed in 1955 by an edition from August Wenzinger? is inside the article: After the publication of the L'Orfeo score in 1609, the same publisher (Ricciardo Amadino of Venice) brought it out again in 1615. Facsimiles of these editions were printed in 1927 and 1972 respectively. Since Eitner's first \\"modern\\" edition of L'Orfeo in 1884, and d'Indy's performing edition 20 years later—both of which were abridged and adapted versions of the 1609 score—there have been many attempts to edit and present the work, not all of them published. Most of the editions that followed d'Indy up to the time of the Second World War were arrangements, usually heavily truncated, that provided a basis for performances in the modern opera idiom. Many of these were the work of composers, including Carl Orff (1923 and 1939) and Ottorino Respighi in 1935. Orff's 1923 score, using a German text, included some period instrumentation, an experiment he abandoned when producing his later version.In the post-war period, editions have moved increasingly to reflect the performance conventions of Monteverdi's day. This tendency was initiated by two earlier editions, that of Jack Westrup used in the 1925 Oxford performances, and Gian Francesco Malipiero's 1930 complete edition which sticks closely to Monteverdi's 1609 original. After the war, Hindemith's attempted period reconstruction of the work was followed in 1955 by an edition from August Wenzinger that remained in use for many years. The next 30 years saw numerous editions, mostly prepared by scholar-performers rather than by composers, generally aiming towards authenticity if not always the complete re-creation of the original instrumentation. These included versions by Raymond Leppard (1965), Denis Stevens (1967), Nikolaus Harnoncourt (1969), Jane Glover (1975), Roger Norrington (1976) and John Eliot Gardiner. Only the composers Valentino Bucchi (1967), Bruno Maderna (1967) and Luciano Berio (1984) produced editions based on the convention of a large modern orchestra.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process in a dishwasher is to fill the dishwasher with water. This is done by connecting the dishwasher to a water supply source, such as a faucet or a dedicated water connection. When the dishwasher is turned on, water flows into the appliance through its inlet valve, which regulates the amount and pressure of the water coming in. Once the dishwasher is filled with an adequate amount of water, the heating element heats the water to the desired temperature, typically between 130°F to 160°F (54°C to 71°C). The higher temperature helps to effectively remove grease and sanitize the dishes. At the same time, dishwasher detergent is added to the water, either manually or through an automatic dispenser system, to help break down food particles and stains. After the water is heated and detergent is mixed in, the dishwasher's pump forces the water up into the pipes connected to spinning paddles or spray arms located inside the appliance. The pressure from the pump makes the paddles or spray arms spin like a sprinkler, spraying water at high pressure onto the dishes, pots, pans, and flatware loaded in the dishwasher racks. The small holes in the paddles or spray arms allow the water to come out in multiple directions, ensuring that all the dishes are adequately cleaned. Throughout the wash cycle, the dishwasher continuously recirculates the water, filtering out food particles and debris to be sure the dishes are washed effectively. When the wash cycle is complete, the used water is drained from the dishwasher through a filter that captures any remaining food particles to prevent them from entering the plumbing system. The heating element is then activated again to heat the air inside the dishwasher, causing the remaining moisture on the dishes to evaporate and dry them. In summary, the first step of the dishwasher process is filling the appliance with water from a water supply source, setting the stage for the subsequent steps of heating the water, adding detergent, pumping the water through the spinning paddles, and spraying the dishes to clean and sanitize them thoroughly."},{"prompt":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: When early colonial settlers went to America, they took many forms of dance to _ . Square dancing, one of the oldest forms of American folk dancing, developed from several different Old World group dances, mainly English country dances, and the French quadrille . In the American version of square dancing, four couples form a square and dance to music. An American addition to square dancing is the caller. What do you think a caller does? The callers---someone who calls out the dance steps in time to the music--- was a completely American invention. At first dancers memorized all the steps for a particular dance, but eventually the dances became so complicated that it was necessary to have someone call out cues so that dancers didn't have to remember so many steps. The caller didn't just call out \\"do-se-do your partner\\"; a good caller also came up with colorful sayings or witty lines that he said in between the cues such as \\"Don't be shy and don't be afraid. Swing on the corner in a waltz promenade .\\" A caller might also come up with new dance steps and routines. Although popular for years, square dancing seemed to be going out of style and fading away until the early 1930s, when Henry Ford helped revive interest in it. Ford, the automobile manufacturer, used to vacation at the Wayside Inn in Massachusetts, where he enjoyed the dance programme run by a man named Benjamin Lovett. Ford asked Lovett to come to Detroit and teach dances, but Lovett said he couldn't because he had a contract with the inn. Ford solved that problem by buying the inn and Lovett's contract. He took Lovett back to Detroit, where together they established a programme for teaching squares and rounds. Square dancing was updated and groups began forming all over the country. Question: Why did the caller call out the steps for the dancers? Answer: A:","completion":"The caller called out the steps for the dancers because the dances eventually became so complicated that it was necessary to have someone call out cues, making it easier for dancers to perform without having to memorize and remember numerous steps."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Rosa is a woman of strict moral principles.'' If she knows I'm in here she's probably hovering outside the door right now. Sentence: he's in here","completion":"Based on the given text, it appears that the sentence \\"he's in here\\" is true. The speaker is making a statement about their current presence in a particular location, and claiming that Rosa, a woman of strict moral principles, likely knows about it and is hovering outside the door. The text gives us no reason to doubt the speaker's claim that he's in the mentioned location. To elaborate, the text primarily revolves around the concern of being adequately chaperoned, suggesting that the speaker may be in a situation where they feel somewhat confined, perhaps at an event where there is concern about behavior or appearances. The presence of a chaperone, Rosa, who is characterized as a woman of strict moral principles, implies that the location might be one where she would be expected to ensure appropriate conduct or supervision. The speaker seems to be reassuring someone, possibly themselves, that there is no need to worry as they are in a situation where they are properly chaperoned. By stating \\"If she knows I'm in here,\\" the speaker implies that they are aware of Rosa's potential understanding of their presence in this location. Additionally, the statement \\"she's probably hovering outside the door right now\\" suggests that the speaker expects Rosa to be vigilant in her role as a chaperone. This further implies the importance of the presence of a chaperone in the current situation and reinforces the notion that the speaker is indeed \\"in here\\" at the specified location. Therefore, considering the context provided by the text, it seems accurate to conclude that the sentence \\"he's in here\\" is true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write an article based on this summary: Kenya's government has extended by six month the deadline to close the world's largest refugee camp.","completion":"Title: Kenya Grants a Six-Month Extension to Closure Deadline of World's Largest Refugee Camp Introduction The Kenyan government has recently announced a six-month extension to the deadline for closing Dadaab, the world's largest refugee camp, providing temporary relief to the hundreds of thousands of refugees who call the camp home. The closure of the refugee camp has long been a contentious issue, with a variety of humanitarian, economic, and security challenges associated with it. This extension provides additional time for more comprehensive discussions to take place, with the hope of finding a viable solution for the long-term well-being of refugees residing in the camp. Background on Dadaab Established in 1991 during the Somali Civil War, the Dadaab refugee camp is located in eastern Kenya, near the border of Somalia. Over the years, it has housed well over half a million refugees, primarily those fleeing violence in Somalia, but also individuals seeking refuge from other conflict-ridden countries. As of early 2021, the camp is estimated to be hosting approximately 224,000 refugees. Dadaab was never intended to be a permanent home for refugees; however, ongoing conflicts and unsafe conditions in their native countries have forced the inhabitants to remain there for years – for many, all their lives. The camp is a sprawling makeshift city with its own economy, infrastructure, and social fabric, but living conditions remain dire and informal, lacking basic amenities and resources. Reasons behind the proposed closure of Dadaab The Kenyan government first announced plans to close Dadaab refugee camp in 2016, citing national security concerns in the wake of terror attacks linked to Somali extremist group Al-Shabaab and the need to maintain control over its borders. However, repatriation efforts have been slow, and there are widespread concerns about the human rights implications and the lack of solutions available to displaced individuals attempting to return to Somalia or rebuild their lives in a third country. Challenges associated with the extended deadline The extension to the closure deadline of Dadaab raises a number of challenges to be addressed by the Kenyan government, humanitarian organizations, and the international community. 1. Providing adequate resources: The additional six months will require the allocation of resources to ensure the continued operation of the camp. Food, water, healthcare, education, and security are among the needs that must be met in the sprawling camp. 2. Ensuring security: The ongoing presence of Dadaab poses security challenges for Kenya, as extremist groups such as Al-Shabaab may continue to exploit the precarious situation to recruit new members or carry out attacks in the region. 3. Addressing human rights concerns: Camp inhabitants face a range of human rights issues, particularly as they relate to the potential forced return of refugees to Somalia and the need for durable solutions like resettlement or integration into Kenyan society. 4. Navigating international pressure: The closure of Dadaab is highly politically charged, with various international stakeholders urging the Kenyan government to prioritize the protection of the refugees' rights and seek lasting solutions to the crisis. Conclusion The extended deadline for the closure of Dadaab offers a chance for the Kenyan government, humanitarian groups, and international stakeholders to collaborate on developing comprehensive, sustainable solutions to the plight of the refugees. This includes addressing the root causes of displacement, ensuring refugees have access to basic services, and finding durable solutions such as voluntary repatriation, resettlement, or local integration. The decision to close Dadaab refugee camp, however, remains a dilemma that must be balanced between concerns for national security, human rights, and the need for refugees to find lasting solutions to their displacement. The outcome of the additional six months will be critical in determining if the world's largest refugee camp can indeed be closed responsibly and humanely, allowing those who have endured years of uncertainty and hardship to finally rebuild their lives in safety and dignity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now, Matthew has a high paying job that not only provides him with financial stability but also the satisfaction of knowing that his efforts in college were not in vain. He is succeeding in his chosen career field and is continually growing in his profession. On the other hand, Brett, after having spent his college years getting drunk and not taking his studies seriously, struggles to find a stable job. He's unable to secure anything that pays well, and his lack of effort in college has left him in a precarious situation. In conclusion, Matthew's dedication to his studies and commitment to his long-term goals enabled him to secure a high paying job today. Brett, however, who chose to prioritize partying and drinking during college, is now facing the consequences of his decisions as he struggles to find stability in his career. So, while in the short term, Brett seemed to be having more fun, it was Matthew's hard work and persistence that led to long-term success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A sheriff's office in Lousiana is under fire from gay rights advocates for targeting men using an outdated law from the early 1800s. According to a report published Sunday in The Advocate, the East Baton Rouge Parish sheriff's office has been conducting sting operations to arrest gay men looking for sex in public parks. Over the past two years the Special Community Anti-Crime Team has arrested at least 12 men under an unenforceable 'crime against nature' law deemed invalid by the U.S. Supreme Court a decade ago. Outdated: A report published in The Advocate Sunday revealed a two-year long series of sting operations in East Baton Rouge that seemed to target homosexuals in the community. Undercover officers would meet men in the park and get them to agree to have sex, and that was enough basis to arrest them under the 'crime against nature' law - R.S. 14:89 - which was put on the records book back in 1805. The statue includes language which bans 'the unnatural canal copulation by a human being with another of the same sex or opposite sex.' The Supreme Court struck down that part in a 2003 ruling with a similar law in Texas. Because of the Supreme Court precedent, the courts would be unable to prosecute anyone charged today with that crime. However, according to sheriff's office spokesman Casey Hicks, since the law is on the books police still have the right to enforce it. She also said the men were not targeted for their sexual orientation, but because the office had been receiving complaints about people using the parks to have public sex. Apologize: Metro councilmen John Delgado called for a public apology from Sheriff Sid Gatreaux. 'The issue here is not the nature of the relationship but the location,' Ms Hicks said. 'These are not bars. These are parks. These are family environments.' However, according to District Attorney Hillar Moore III, since the law was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2003 there would be no way of prosecuting any of the men charged with the crime. 'For the Sheriff's Office to be setting up these kinds of sting operations up is a waste of time because they can't prosecute these things,' said Tommy Damico who is defending one of the men arrested last month under the archaic law. Advocates in the gay rights community expressed their outrage over the series of sting operations. 'It is frustrating that people are using their resources to pursue issues like this and arrest people for attempting to pick someone up and go home with them,' said Bruce Parker of Equality Louisiana. 'It's perfectly legal, and we would have to close down every bar in Baton Rouge if that weren't the case.' Civil rights attorney Andrea Ritchie also found the operation unsettling. 'It's really unfortunate that police are continuing to single out, target, falsely arrest and essentially ruin the lives of gay men in Baton Rouge who are engaged in no illegal conduct,' Ms Ritchie said. Metro Councilman John Delgado called for an apology from Sheriff Sid Gatreaux to the men arrested in the operations and the rest of the parish. The Sheriff's Office seemed to partially apologize for the arrests, issuing a statement to The Advocate Sunday saying they 'should have taken a different approach' when dealing with inappropriate behaviour in the park.

Question: Jeremy has found that his tricycle moves faster on the sidewalk than the grass. This is because the sidewalk has (A) more resistance (B) less resistance A:","completion":"Jeremy's tricycle moves faster on the sidewalk than the grass because the sidewalk has B) less resistance. To understand why this is the case, let us explore the factors that contribute to the difference in resistance between these two surfaces. 1. Surface texture: The sidewalk is a smooth, hard surface while grass is a softer, uneven surface. The smoothness of the sidewalk reduces the contact surface area between the tricycle's tires and the ground, resulting in a lower rolling resistance. Rolling resistance is the force that resists the motion of the tricycle when it rolls across a surface. Grass, on the other hand, has an uneven surface with more contact area, leading to an increased rolling resistance that slows down the tricycle. 2. Deformation: When the tricycle moves over the grass, the soft nature of the grass causes it to compress under the tricycle's weight. This compression creates additional resistance as the grass tries to return to its original shape and pushes back against the tricycle's wheels. On the sidewalk, very little deformation occurs due to the rigid nature of the surface, resulting in less resistance against the tricycle’s motion. 3. Friction: The friction between the tricycle's wheels and the surface it's moving on affects the overall resistance experienced by the tricycle. The sidewalk has a lower coefficient of friction compared to grass, meaning the wheels roll more easily with less energy loss due to friction. Grass, being a more irregular and soft surface, has a higher coefficient of friction which increases the energy required to move the tricycle and causes it to move slower. 4. Stability: The grass surface can be unpredictable, with patches of soil, rocks, or uneven terrain hidden beneath the blades of grass. These hidden obstructions can cause the wheels of the tricycle to lose contact with the ground or change the direction of motion suddenly, adding resistance to its movement. The sidewalk's consistent and stable surface minimizes these unexpected changes in direction and allows for more efficient movement. 5. Traction: The tricycle's wheel traction also plays a role in the difference in speed on these two surfaces. On the sidewalk, the wheels maintain good traction due to the smooth, flat surface, resulting in less energy being lost to slippage. Grass has variable traction, as the wheels may slip more on wet grass or loose soil, increasing resistance and slowing down the tricycle. In conclusion, Jeremy's tricycle moves faster on the sidewalk because of the reduced resistance provided by the smoother, harder surface, as opposed to the grass which has a higher rolling resistance, more deformation, increased friction, less stability, and variable traction. All these factors contribute to the sidewalk having less resistance (B), making it easier and faster for the tricycle to travel on it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Gabriel's operation begins by killing the hackers he hired. This involves using a virus he has implanted that detonates wired explosives attached to the hackers' computers when they press the delete key, and commencing the initial stages of a computer attack on US government networks.Meanwhile, a young couple is making out in a car at Rutgers University in New Jersey. New York City Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) breaks it up; the girl turns out to be his estranged daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). She leaves in a huff, refusing to acknowledge her father's last name but calling herself instead by her mother's maiden name, Gennero. Simultaneously, the FBI command center's computers are momentarily interrupted, leading Deputy Director Bowman (Cliff Curtis) to order a roundup of all the hackers who could conceivably have been involved. McClane is sent to pick up Farrell in Camden, and his arrival interrupts the hacker just before he performs the operation which would detonate his computer. Gabriel's assassins, who had the apartment under surveillance to confirm Farrell's death, open fire. McClane kills several thugs who enter the apartment. Debris from the shootout sets off the explosion of Farrell's computer, destroying the apartment.

Alexis-Charles-Henri Clerel de Tocqueville (French: [aleksi SaRl aRi kleRel d@ tokvil]; 29 July 1805 - 16 April 1859) was a French political thinker and historian best known for his works Democracy in America (appearing in two volumes: 1835 and 1840) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856). In both of these, he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals, as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. Democracy in America was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States, and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science. Tocqueville was active in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830-1848) and then during the Second Republic (1849-1851) which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napoleon Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup, and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution. He argued that the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV. The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals. Tocqueville was a classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government, but was skeptical of the extremes of democracy.

He liked to think and write about how people lived and how countries were run. He visited a big place called the United States and wrote a book called Democracy in America, talking about how people lived there. He also wrote another book about an important event in France called the French Revolution. He wanted countries to be run well, with people working together to make decisions, but he was careful about not letting everyone have too much power."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Though he lay there helpless, still she found him an awesome figure, like a fallen cathedral tower. Only two other men are as tall, she thought. Amalric and Orlando. She felt a pang of guilt. How could she be thinking about the troubadour here where her royal master lay slowly dying? She fixed her eyes on Louis, and on the ivory and wood crucifix that rose and fell on his chest with his labored breathing. Nicolette felt as if she, too, could hardly breathe. Across the crowded room a fire roared in a huge stone-lined fireplace. The air was stifling. She resented all that made it so, down to the woolen draperies and wall hangings and the thick carpets that sealed in the heat. But she knew that this northern chateau, Pontoise-les-Noyons, a day's ride from Paris, had had to be built to withstand cold, its walls thick and its windows tiny ? so totally unlike the bright, airy Languedoc manor she had grown up in. Sweat trickled down her brow and stung her eyes. Her breath was coming in little gasps. She felt as if she would faint if she couldn't go outside soon. Dozens of people, the King's family and courtiers, had packed themselves uselessly into the room, making it even more suffocating. Their whispers, like the buzzing of mosquitoes, irritated Nicolette. Almost all of them, she was sure, worried more about their own welfare than about the King's.

Answer:","completion":"The last step of the process is the occurrence of photosynthesis in the chloroplasts of the plant's leaf cells. Here's a detailed explanation of the whole process: 1. Carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air passes through small pores called stomata present in the leaves. 2. Water (H2O) is absorbed by the roots from the soil and transported through vessels (xylem) in the stem to the leaves. 3. In the leaves, both CO2 and H2O reach mesophyll cells that contain specialized organelles called chloroplasts. 4. Inside the chloroplasts, photosynthesis takes place. This process involves capturing sunlight energy with the help of a green pigment called chlorophyll. 5. The sunlight energy is then used to convert CO2 and H2O into glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2) through a series of chemical reactions. The glucose is used as an energy source and building material for the plant's growth, while the oxygen produced is released back into the environment through the stomata. In summary, the last step of the process is photosynthesis, where sunlight energy is harnessed to convert CO2 and H2O into glucose and oxygen within the chloroplasts of the leaf cells."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What type of mills were grinding 14.1% of the nation's grain in Minnesota? Answer the above question based on the context below: Saint Anthony Falls, the only waterfall of its height on the Mississippi, played an important part in the development of Minneapolis. The power of the waterfall first fueled sawmills, but later it was tapped to serve flour mills. In 1870, only a small number of flour mills were in the Minneapolis area, but by 1900 Minnesota mills were grinding 14.1% of the nation's grain. Advances in transportation, milling technology, and water power combined to give Minneapolis a dominance in the milling industry. Spring wheat could be sown in the spring and harvested in late summer, but it posed special problems for milling. To get around these problems, Minneapolis millers made use of new technology. They invented the middlings purifier, a device that used jets of air to remove the husks from the flour early in the milling process. They also started using roller mills, as opposed to grindstones. A series of rollers gradually broke down the kernels and integrated the gluten with the starch. These improvements led to the production of \\"patent\\" flour, which commanded almost double the price of \\"bakers\\" or \\"clear\\" flour, which it replaced. Pillsbury and the Washburn-Crosby Company (a forerunner of General Mills) became the leaders in the Minneapolis milling industry. This leadership in milling later declined as milling was no longer dependent on water power, but the dominance of the mills contributed greatly to the economy of Minneapolis and Minnesota, attracting people and money to the region. The answer to this question is:","completion":"flour mills. Based on the provided context, the mills that were grinding 14.1% of the nation's grain in Minnesota were flour mills.

Archeologist Betty Meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea, as described in her book Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise. She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52/sq mi) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population. However, recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated. Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at Marajó, and inland dwellers. By 1900 the population had fallen to 1 million and by the early 1980s it was less than 200,000.

Even though he is part of a genre that has been largely defined by the urban environments of cities like New York City or Los Angeles, Forrest's roots are from a city known more for its agricultural contributions than its musical ones. However, these origins did not prevent him from becoming a successful solo singer in the hip hop genre, which shows the power music has to transcend geographical boundaries. Forrest grew up with music as a big part of his life. His interest in rhythm, rhymes, and storytelling led him to hip hop, a genre that is known for its powerful lyrics and strong messages. He was immediately captivated by the way that hip hop artists could use their words to paint vivid pictures and express deep emotions. This resonated with him, and he knew that this was the pathway he wanted to pursue. Living in the heart of Dixie might seem at odds with a genre that has heavily grown out of New York's Bronx borough and Los Angeles' Compton neighborhood. However, Forrest was determined to put Alabama on the map in the hip hop world, and he did exactly that. Starting as a solo artist, he quickly made a name for himself, not only in his birth place of Dothan but also across the United States. Forrest's background as a solo singer put him in a unique position within the hip hop genre. Instead of being part of a group or crew, which is often common in hip hop, Forrest struck out on his own. This allowed him more artistic control over his music and lyrics, making sure that every song was a true representation of him, his experiences, and his views. Furthermore, his unique background provided him a different perspective to many of his peers. Coming from Dothan, Alabama has not only influenced his lyrical content, providing an authentic Southern viewpoint, but it also influenced his instrumentals, with his music often reflecting a certain Southern flair that sets him apart in the hip hop genre. To summarize, Allen Forrest is a solo singer from Dothan, Alabama who has made significant contributions to the hip hop music genre. His unique background and place of origin have shaped his career and the music he creates, truly making him a standout artist in the hip hop music landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The commission has been in dispute with the crofters in Mangersta and Upper Coll about how they manage their common grazings committees. The commission dismissed both committees, whose members are crofters, earlier this year and appointed officials to run the grazings, which are shared areas of land for raising livestock. Western Isles Council - Comhairle nan Eilean Siar - and commission chiefs have met to discuss the matter. MSP Rhoda Grant has tabled a question in the Scottish Parliament asking the Scottish government if it would establish an inquiry into the Crofting Commission handling of the situation.

Write an article based on this \\"Consider the cooking time. Check the baking tray or sheet. Review your storage methods.\\"","completion":"Title: Mastering Cooking Time, Baking Tray Maintenance, and Storage Methods for Perfect Meals Introduction: Cooking a delectable meal is part art and part science. It is a delicate blend of accurately estimated cooking time, well-maintained baking trays, and clever storage methods. Whether you're a seasoned home chef or a culinary newbie, these three crucial factors will go a long way in improving the quality and taste of your kitchen creations. This article will provide an in-depth exploration of these essential aspects of the culinary process. Part 1: Considering the Cooking Time 1.1 Importance of accurate cooking times: Cooking time is critical in determining the outcome of any recipe. Properly cooked food not only tastes better but also retains its nutritional value. Overcooking can result in loss of nutrients, reduced flavors, and unfavorable texture. On the other hand, undercooked food might pose health risks due to the presence of harmful bacteria. 1.2 Factors affecting cooking time: Various factors affect cooking time, including ingredients, cooking method, and kitchen appliances. When recipe developers create a recipe, they take into account the standard size, thickness, and shape of the ingredients. Therefore, you should be mindful of any discrepancies between your ingredients and those mentioned in the recipe, as this might affect the cooking time. 1.3 Adjusting cooking time: To achieve the ideal cooking time for a particular recipe, it's useful to invest in a kitchen timer and monitor the cooking process closely. Adjustments, when necessary, can be essential in producing the desired outcome. When in doubt, utilize internal temperature guidelines for certain types of foods, such as meats, to ensure thorough cooking. Part 2: Checking and Maintaining the Baking Tray or Sheet 2.1 Selection of baking trays: Baking trays and sheets come in various materials, sizes, and shapes, with each type serving specific purposes. Choose heavy-gauge, light-colored aluminum or steel trays to promote even heat distribution and prevent overbrowning. Non-stick surfaces may require less oil, but they may not always produce the desired browning effect. 2.2 Regular inspection: Before and after each use, inspect the baking tray or sheet for signs of wear, warping, or damage. Uneven heat distribution, sticking, and potential chemical reactions due to a damaged tray could ruin your culinary creations. 2.3 Proper maintenance: To prolong the life of your baking trays and sheets, hand-wash them using mild dish soap and a non-abrasive sponge. Avoid scrubbing with steel wool or sharp objects that might scratch the surface. Dry the trays thoroughly to prevent any rust formation. Part 3: Reviewing Storage Methods for Optimal Food Quality 3.1 Correct storage methods: Proper storage methods extend the shelf life of your ingredients and maintain their quality, which in turn enhances the taste and appeal of your cooked dishes. Store perishable items such as meats and dairy products in the refrigerator, while dry ingredients like flour and sugar should be kept in airtight containers in a cool, dark pantry. 3.2 Organization strategies: Organize your pantry and refrigerator shelves to group similar items together, ensuring that the oldest items are used first. This system minimizes food wastage resulting from expired products. 3.3 Storage containers: Choose containers made of glass or BPA-free plastic to reduce the risk of potential chemical leaching. Store cooked meals in separate containers to avoid cross-contamination, and label them with their contents and the date. Conclusion: By understanding the importance of cooking time, checking and maintaining your baking trays, and reviewing food storage methods, you can consistently create mouth-watering dishes that satisfy both your taste buds and your health. Implementing these tips in your culinary routine will propel your skills and elevate your meals to new heights."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Released on September 27, 2005, the film's main plot point concerns Stewie Griffin trying to find who he thinks is his real father after seeing the man on TV. He travels to San Francisco, only to find that the man is him from the future. When the Griffins go swimming at the Quahog Community Pool, Peter tries teaching Stewie to swim and attempts to toss him into the pool, despite Stewie begging to be put down. Lois takes Stewie to swimming lessons, where Stewie meets Brad, a child about his age who is the \\"Star Swimmer.\\" In jealousy, Stewie does everything he can to steal Brad's glory. As a last resort he tries to kill him by rigging a lifeguard chair with dynamite and luring Brad beneath it with marzipan; however, Stewie's detonator malfunctions, blowing up the legs of chair and causing it to fall on Stewie himself. He ends up in hell with Steve Allen. When Stewie is revived by Lois, he believes it is a sign for him to be a good boy. After Peter learns that the new video store will not let him rent pornography, he vents his frustration in front of newscaster Tom Tucker, who gives him a job at Quahog 5 hosting a segment called \\"What Really Grinds My Gears,\\" in which he rants about things that bother him. Peter becomes extremely popular, overshadowing Tucker, who is fired after attempting to distract Peter during filming. Stewie attempts to be a good boy by smothering Brian with affection. Brian finally goads Stewie into reverting to his old, violent ways by crushing a spider web and eating the spider. Stewie starts drinking heavily, following Brian's way of coping. Brian attempts to cure Stewie of his alcoholism by taking him out for a night of drinking at the Drunken Clam. While drunk, Stewie crashes Brian's car through the wall of the bar. Knowing Stewie is Peter's son, Tom takes advantage of the situation and presents footage of the accident at the news station. Peter is fired and Tom is rehired as the anchor. The next morning, Stewie has a hangover and realizes his lonely existence in the world, wishing that there were someone else to whom he could relate.

A. store B. office C. cuba D. photographs E. pond The best answer is A:","completion":"The best answer is not A: store. The appropriate answer to the question \\"Where do you find jellyfish?\\" is not among the given options. However, if we were to choose the most correct one out of these, the closest answer would be E: pond, although it is not entirely accurate. Jellyfish are aquatic creatures primarily found in the ocean, but they can occasionally be found in brackish water, such as estuaries or coastal ponds where a mix of freshwater and saltwater is present. They have a diverse range of habitats, from shallow coastal waters to the deep sea. Jellyfish belong to the phylum Cnidaria – a group of animals that include corals and sea anemones. There are several types of jellyfish, and their specific habitats can vary. Some prefer warmer waters, while others can thrive in colder climates. Most jellyfish are free-swimming, and some live in symbiotic relationships with other marine organisms. The main habitat for jellyfish is the open ocean, where they can be found in the surface layer called the epipelagic zone. This zone contains sunlight, allowing some jellyfish to benefit from photosynthetic algae, which form a symbiotic relationship by living within their tissues. Down in the mesopelagic zone, which is in the midwater, bioluminescent jellyfish can be found. These creatures create their light through a chemical reaction. While it is not common to find live jellyfish in a store, you can find preserved specimens in certain specialty shops, museums, or scientific institutions. Likewise, jellyfish do not naturally inhabit offices or photographs, as these are man-made environments. Cuba, as a geographic location surrounded by the ocean, may have jellyfish populations in its nearshore waters, but it is not a specific habitat for them. In some ponds, particularly those with an input of saltwater, you might find one of the few species that can tolerate low salinity. The most famous example is the \\"golden jellyfish\\" found in Jellyfish Lake on Eil Malk Island in Palau, a unique marine environment. To summarize, jellyfish are predominantly found in the ocean and have diverse habitats that range from shallow waters to the deep sea. While you might occasionally find them in brackish or coastal ponds, the options you provided don't precisely pinpoint their natural habitat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Actually, he has given us clues all along. The story of Steve Jobs boils down to this: Don't go with the flow. If Mr. Jobs saw something that could be made better, smarter or more beautiful, nothing else mattered. Apple has attained its current astonishing levels of influence and success because it is sensitive. It is incredibly focused. It has had amazingly few failures.

Traveling by train is slower than by plane, but you can see the places you are traveling through. Modern trains have comfortable seats and dining-cars. _ even make the longest journey enjoyable . Some people prefer to travel by sea. You can visit many other countries or different parts of your country. Ships are not so fast as trains or planes, but traveling by sea is a very pleasant way to spend a holiday. Many people like to travel by car. You can make your own timetable. You can travel three or four hundred miles or only fifty or one hundred miles a day, just as you like. You can stop if there is something interesting, for example, at a good restaurant where you can enjoy a good meal, or at a hotel to spend the night. That's why traveling by car is popular for pleasure trips, while people usually take a train or a plane when they travel on business. When people travel on business, they usually take _ . A) a plane or a car B) a car or a boat C) a boat or a train D) a train or a plane Answer:","completion":"D) a train or a plane Modern life is indeed impossible without traveling. As the world becomes more interconnected, it is essential for people to move from one place to another for various reasons such as work, education, or leisure. Different modes of transportation offer distinct advantages, depending on the traveler's needs, time constraints, and preferences. Air travel is widely considered the fastest mode of transportation. Modern airplanes are not only efficient but also widely available, making them a popular choice for those who need to cover long distances in a short amount of time. This ability to traverse vast distances within a single day allows for greater opportunities for intercultural exchange, business dealings, and global collaboration. Trains, though slower than planes, offer a unique perspective on the landscape. Passengers can witness the changing scenery as they move from one destination to another, taking in the beauty of the environment and the culture of the locations they pass through. Moreover, many modern trains are equipped with comfortable seating, dining-cars, and entertainment options that can make a long journey highly enjoyable. Sea travel, while not as rapid as planes or trains, can provide an incredibly scenic and relaxing experience. Ships enable passengers to visit multiple destinations, both within one's country and abroad, and often house various amenities that encourage rest and recreation during the journey. However, due to the slower speeds of ships, this mode of transportation may not be ideal for time-sensitive or urgent travel. Car travel affords a great deal of flexibility and autonomy. Being in control of one's schedule allows for spontaneous stops at appealing locations, including restaurants and hotels, and ensures a personalized travel experience. This freedom makes traveling by car especially popular for pleasure trips and vacations. When it comes to business travel, efficiency and speed are often paramount, as professionals need to attend meetings, conferences, or events in various locations. Due to the fast and reliable transportation provided by both trains and planes, the answer to the question is D) a train or a plane. These modes of transportation enable business travelers to reach their destinations quickly, ensuring that they can meet their professional obligations in a timely manner.

The XFL filed for bankruptcy and did not restart in 2021. Barrett did not participate in the truncated 2020 XFL season, and his professional football career remains uncertain. While the future is not clear for Barrett in professional football, it is important to recognize his accomplishments during his college career at Ohio State. He was a three-time team captain and broke several school and conference records, including career total touchdowns and passing yards. He led the Buckeyes to a national championship in the 2014 season as well as Big Ten titles in 2014, 2017, and several appearances in other premier bowl games. Despite his success at the collegiate level, J.T. Barrett has not found a consistent role in the NFL. His status and any future signings or potential opportunities will be contingent on roster needs, openings, and his performance during workouts and training camps."},{"prompt":"If clearing land can make a river wider, then what makes a river wider?

Last month, Mrs Huckabee's husband expressed his support for the Duggars during an interview with People, in which he described the family as 'wholesome and wonderful'. Josh and Anna, who married in September 2008, announced that they are expecting on her Twitter page last December. Best kept secret: Josh and Anna shared their happy news in a video released by TLC. They admitted that they had waited until after Josh's sister Jessa's wedding to Ben Seewald to tell their family. Proud parents: The couple are parents to a five-year-old daughter Mackynzie and sons Michael , 3, and Marcus, 1.

Simplify the equation: 0 = -212 * o - 12167 - 5330 + 537 First, we need to combine like terms, that is, the constants (-12167, -5330 and 537). -12167 - 5330 + 537 = -12167 - 5330 + 537 = -17497 + 537 = -16960 So now, our equation becomes: 0 = -212 * o - 16960 2. Isolate 'o' term: To solve for 'o', we need to add 16960 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 16960 = -212 * o - 16960 + 16960 16960 = -212 * o 3. Divide by the coefficient of 'o': Now, we need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of 'o', which is -212: 16960 / -212 = (-212 * o) / -212 -80 = o Therefore, the solution for the equation is: o = -80"},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who is vicious towards Louis? The Creed family—Louis, Rachel, and their children Ellie and Gage—move from Chicago to rural Ludlow, Maine, after Louis is offered a job as a doctor with the University of Maine. They befriend their elderly neighbor Jud Crandall, who takes them to an isolated pet cemetery (misspelled \\"sematary\\") in the forest behind the Creed's new home. On his first day at work, Louis encounters Victor Pascow, a jogger who has been mortally injured after being hit by a truck. He warns Louis about the pet cemetery before he dies, calling Louis by name despite the fact they have not previously met. That night, Pascow comes to Louis as a ghost and leads him to the Pet Sematary, warning him not to cross the barrier because the ground beyond is \\"sour\\". Louis awakens, assuming it was a dream, but notices his feet are covered in dirt. During Thanksgiving while the family is gone, Ellie's cat, Church, is run down on the highway. Realizing that Ellie will be devastated, Jud takes Louis beyond the cemetery and deep into the woods, where they reach an ancient Micmac burial ground. Jud instructs Louis to bury the cat and warns him not to tell anyone else about what they have done. The next day a reanimated Church returns to the house, a shell of what he was before; he stinks, moves sluggishly, and is vicious towards Louis. Jud explains that as a boy he himself revived his beloved pet dog in the Micmac ground, and that although the cat might be different, it will save Ellie the grief of losing her favorite pet. Sometime later, the young Gage is killed by a truck along the same highway. The family is devastated, and Jud anticipates that Louis is considering burying his son in the Micmac ground, although Louis denies it. Jud believes that introducing Louis to the ritual ground aroused the malevolent forces present there, which caused Gage's death.

Letters of introduction from Paris proved effective; on 27 April 1764, four days after their arrival, the children were playing before King George III and his 19-year-old German queen, Charlotte Sophia. A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel.

Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as \\"a way to earn the love of this very special nation\\".

Without doubt the best of the novels of John Le Carre, exquisitely transformed into a classic film. Performances by Peter Egan (Magnus Pym, The Perfect Spy), Rudiger Weigang (Axel, real name Alexander Hampel, Magnus' Czech Intelligence controller), Ray McAnally (Magnus' con-man father) and Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, Magnus' mentor, believer and British controller), together with the rest of the characters, are so perfect and natural, the person responsible for casting them should have been given an award. Even the small parts, such as Major Membury, are performed to perfection.

FILE - In this Dec. 12, 2012 file photo released by Korean Central News Agency, North Korea's Unha-3 rocket lifts off from the Sohae launch pad in Tongchang-ri, North Korea. The Cold War still rages in... (Associated Press) U.S. Ambassador to China Gary Locke, center, is mobbed by journalists as he attends the opening session of the annual National People's Congress at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing Tuesday, March... (Associated Press) Without elaborating, the Korean People's Army Supreme Command warned of \\"surgical strikes\\" meant to unify the divided Korean Peninsula and of an indigenous, \\"precision nuclear striking tool.\\" The statement came amid reports that Washington and North Korean ally Beijing have approved a draft of a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for sanctions in response to North Korea's Feb. 12 nuclear test. The draft is expected to be circulated at the U.N. this week. Such heated military rhetoric and threats are common from North Korea as tensions rise on the Korean Peninsula, and Pyongyang's recent nuclear test and rocket launches, and the push for U.N. punishment that have followed, have increased already high animosity between the North and Washington and ally Seoul. The United States and others worry that North Korea's third nuclear test pushes it a step closer toward its goal of having nuclear-armed missiles that can reach America, and condemn its nuclear and missile efforts as threats to regional security and a drain on the resources that could go to North Korea's largely destitute people. North Korea says its nuclear program is a response to U.S. hostility that dates back to the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty, leaving the Korean Peninsula still technically in a state of war. North Korea warned it will cancel the armistice agreement on March 11 because of ongoing U.S.-South Korean military drills that began March 1 which the statement called a \\"dangerous nuclear war targeted at us.\\" North Korea said Washington and others are going beyond mere economic sanctions and expanding into blunt aggression and military acts. North Korea also warned that it will block a communications line between it and the United States at the border village separating the two Koreas. \\"We aim to launch surgical strikes at any time and any target without being bounded by the armistice accord and advance our long-cherished wish for national unification,\\" the statement said. North Korea lays the blame for its much-condemned nuclear weapons programs on the United States. A rich vein of North Korean propaganda fueled by decades-old American threats holds that the North remains at risk of an unprovoked nuclear attack. Washington and others say brinksmanship is the North's true motive for the nuclear push. ___ Associated Press writer Hyung-jin Kim contributed to this report. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"North Korea vowed on Tuesday to cancel the 1953 cease-fire that ended the Korean War in response to a U.S.-led push for punishing U.N. sanctions over its recent nuclear test and ongoing U.S.-South Korean joint military drills.

Keene and Alexandra Kaczenski of the Getty Museum’s Manuscripts Department have spent the last few years preparing for an exhibition and publication titled Sacred Landscapes: Nature in Renaissance Manuscripts that aims to examine representations of “green spaces” such as gardens, vistas, and their relation to the divine. In particular, Bryan and Alexandra focus on the ways in which artists during the European Middle Ages and Renaissance embedded the pages of illuminated manuscripts with depictions of the natural world so that nature could guide prayer, chant, and meditation. For Bryan, this project represents a continuation of his interest in sacred gardens that began with his graduate work on the garden imagery that influenced Botticelli’s Agony in the Garden painting. In 2013 he curated the exhibition and authored the accompanying book Gardens of the Renaissance. For Alexandra, interest in this subject stems from her scholarly focus on Flemish manuscripts and their relation to Flemish landscape paintings. She brought to the project a complementary interest in issues of environmental and landscape destruction, which also were themes of the exhibition and publication. Though floral and nature studies of the Renaissance and Early Modern periods have been extensively investigated—the scientific notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, for example, are well documented—this exhibition turns its focus on landscape and the divine. Curatorial research has shed new light on subjects such as the seemingly “scattered” floral arrangements represented within the pages of these books and their relationship to humoral theory and religion. Bryan adds, “The tension that we find in these borders is, on the one hand, intricately rendered leaf and petal structures of plants or flowers, and on the other, hidden whimsical elements, all of which combine to create a rich tapestry of meaning, both symbolic and scientific.

Let's analyze the passage in detail to understand the reason behind this answer. The passage states the following: \\"I'm doing this over my lunch break\\" and \\"Because I will NEVER BE DONE EVER!\\" These statements imply that there is a heavy workload, which does not allow the person to wait until they are done with work, as they believe that their work is never-ending. This supports option I, meaning that the person has too much work. In addition to the heavy workload, the passage starts with an apology for the potential hurried and incoherent nature of the post, indicating that the person is aware that they need to rush themselves to write the post during their limited time (lunch break). This supports option II, highlighting the need to rush to write the post. Option III, stating the desire to write this before the end of the day, cannot be considered a valid deduction based on the available evidence in the passage. The passage does not mention any deadline or end-of-day constraint explicitly. Since option IV suggests none of the above choices, it would be incorrect, given the evidence supporting options I and II.

Orphaned as a child, she inherited the County of Burgundy and became one of the most desirable heiresses in France. She then became the second wife of Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, and as such Holy Roman Empress, at the age of about 12. Beatrice was active at the Hohenstaufen court, encouraging literary works and chivalric ideals. She accompanied her husband on his travels and campaigns across his kingdom, and he was known to be under Beatrice's influence.

What is the best way to: How do I make peanut butter and jelly cookie","completion":"To make peanut butter and jelly cookies, follow these step-by-step instructions to ensure you get the best possible results. 1. Gather the ingredients: - 1 cup all-purpose flour - 1/2 teaspoon baking soda - 1/4 teaspoon salt - 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened - 1/2 cup granulated sugar - 1/2 cup packed brown sugar - 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter - 1 large egg - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract - 1 1/2 cups rolled oats - 1/2 cup of your favorite jelly or jam 2. Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). This will ensure that the cookies bake evenly and are ready when you're done preparing the dough. 3. Prepare baking sheets: Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. This will prevent the cookies from sticking to the sheets and make it easy to remove them once they're baked. 4. Combine dry ingredients: In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. This will ensure that the baking soda is evenly distributed in the cookie dough and help the cookies rise properly. 5. Cream butter and sugars: In a large bowl, using a hand mixer or stand mixer, cream together the softened unsalted butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Creaming the butter and sugars ensures that air is incorporated into the mixture, giving the cookies a lighter, more delicate texture. 6. Add peanut butter, egg, and vanilla: Add the creamy peanut butter, large egg, and vanilla extract to the creamed butter mixture. Mix until fully combined, ensuring all ingredients are evenly distributed in the dough. 7. Gradually add dry ingredients: Slowly add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to tough cookies. 8. Stir in rolled oats: Using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, gently stir in the rolled oats, once again being careful not to overmix. 9. Create cookie mounds: Scoop out a heaping tablespoon of cookie dough and, using your hands roll it into a ball. Then, flatten the ball slightly into a thick disc shape. Repeat for the remaining cookie dough, spacing the cookies about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. 10. Create indentations for jelly: Using your thumb or the back of a spoon, gently press down in the center of each cookie to create a small indentation. This is where you'll add the jelly later. 11. Fill indentations with jelly: Using a teaspoon, fill each cookie indentation with your favorite jelly or jam, being careful not to overfill. 12. Bake: Place the baking sheets in the preheated oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges of the cookies are lightly golden. Rotate the baking sheets halfway through to ensure even baking. 13. Cool: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for about 5 minutes before transferring them to wire cooling racks to cool completely. Cooling the cookies on the baking sheets helps them to set and maintain their shape. 14. Serve and enjoy: Once completely cooled, enjoy your homemade peanut butter and jelly cookies! Store any leftovers in an airtight container to maintain freshness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Write a title for this article: At first, I thought it was my imagination. Around the time the iPhone 5S and 5C were released, in September, I noticed that my sad old iPhone 4 was becoming a lot more sluggish. The battery was starting to run down much faster, too. But the same thing seemed to be happening to a lot of people who, like me, swear by their Apple products. When I called tech analysts, they said that the new operating system (iOS 7) being pushed out to existing users was making older models unbearably slow. Apple phone batteries, which have a finite number of charges in them to begin with, were drained by the new software. So I could pay Apple 79 to replace the battery, or perhaps spend 20 bucks more for an iPhone 5C. It seemed like Apple was sending me a not-so-subtle message to upgrade. 1. Apple may be coordinating the obsolescence of its products. 2. Which is annoying for consumers. 3. But possibly worse for the company. Of course, there are more benign explanations. The new software and recent app updates offer fancy new features that existing users want; maybe the battery is sealed with tiny five-point screws for aesthetic considerations. Perhaps, but this isnât the first time that tech analysts and random crazies on the Internet have noted that breakdowns in older Apple products can often coincide with when upgrades come onto the market. Many have taken this as evidence of âplanned obsolescence,â a term that dates to the Great Depression, when a real estate broker suggested that the government should stimulate the economy by placing artificial expiration dates on consumer products so people would buy more. To conspiracy-theory-hungry observers (and some of the rest of us), it might make sense that Apple would employ this business strategy. The tech giant, after all, has reached near-saturation levels in the U.S. smartphone market. If iPhones work forever, people who already own the devicesÂ­ wonât buy new ones. Furthermore, selling products with finite life spans can be good for consumers, depending on their tastes and how informed they are. The fashion industry, whose entire mission is to essentially render products obsolete long before they cease to be functional, does this regularly. I buy clothes from H&M and other low-cost, trend-driven stores knowing full well that the pieces might fall apart after a yearâs worth of washes. And if the clothes wonât be fashionable next year anyway, who cares? Improving the durability â and thereby cost â of the clothes would probably just drive away price-sensitive shoppers like me. Apple has similar considerations. Would the additional longevity of the battery be valuable enough to its core consumers to justify the inevitable higher price? Economists have theories about market conditions that encourage planned obsolescence. A company has strong incentives to degrade product durability when it has a lot of market power and when consumers donât have good substitute products to choose from. (Thatâs what happened with the international light-bulb cartel of the early 20th century, which penalized its members for manufacturing bulbs that lasted more than 1,000 hours.) When Apple started making the iPhone in 2007, its product was so innovative that it could have deliberately degraded durability without fear. But in the last couple years, the company has faced stiffer competition from Samsung and HTC, among others, which should deincentivize planned obsolescence. âBuyers are smart, and if they start figuring out that one of the costs of buying Appleâs products is that theyâre constantly nickel-and-diming you, theyâll switch,â said Austan Goolsbee, an economics professor at the University of Chicagoâs Booth School of Business. Well, maybe. A company could still be encouraged to engage in planned obsolescence if consumers perceive large âswitching costsâ associated with going to a new brand. There are plenty of economics textbooks to choose from, for instance, and yet publishers still artificially make their old editions unusable by changing pagination or scrambling homework questions because they know teachers donât want to deal with learning a whole new book. Similarly, iPhone users have probably purchased complementary products, like apps, that wonât transfer to Android phones. They also probably have a network of iPhone-using friends with whom they can chat free using Appleâs Messages app (instead of paying for text messages). These switching costs increase Appleâs incentives to force its existing customers to upgrade by making older models gradually become more dysfunctional. There is, however, a simple way to effectively render an old product obsolete without fleecing your existing customers. Instead of degrading the old model, companies can offer innovations in the new model that make upgrading irresistible. Apple succeeded at doing this for a while, offering new iPhones that included major improvements. In the past, consumers were so excited about the cool new features, like Siri, the voice-activated interface, that they may not have minded (or even noticed) if their old phones started to deteriorate; they planned on upgrading anyway. This time around, thatâs less true. The iPhone 5S and 5C offer fewer quantum improvements. Consumers are more likely to want their old phones to continue working at peak condition in perpetuity, and to feel cheated when they donât. When major innovations remain out of reach, and degrading durability threatens to tick off loyal customers, companies like Apple can still take a cue from the fashion industry. If you can brainwash consumers into developing new tastes that make the old stuff look uncool for aesthetic rather than functional reasons, you still have a shot at harvesting more sales from your existing customer base. But it seems Apple may have already figured this out too. Just check out the wait times for the iPhone 5S in that shiny new gold color. Catherine Rampell is an economics reporter at The Times.

The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council.

Due to Eugene's work schedule, Dominick is alone a lot of the time and tends to make questionable judgment calls.

The situation in Mexico is undoubtedly concerning, but it is crucial to remember that the United States faces its own set of challenges, such as political division, racial injustice, and a tenuous economy among others. Focusing on the violent drug war in Mexico and labeling the country as a failed state may disseminate a sense of panic and urgency that prevents Americans from addressing critical domestic issues. When attention is shifted to external crises, it becomes easy to forget the need to allocate resources and time to local concerns. Moreover, the debate on whether or not Mexico is a failed state should be framed in the context of bilateral relations between the two countries. Collaborative and cooperative efforts are needed to address the shared issues, such as the drug trade and border security. Instead of giving in to doomsday talk and distancing ourselves from the situation, the United States should take steps to understand the complex social, political, and economic factors driving the violence in Mexico. This way, both nations can work together to develop effective strategies and policies to mitigate the impacts of the drug war and foster stability in the region. By reframing the conversation, policymakers and citizens alike can shift their focus to more productive discussions about the shared challenges faced by both the United States and Mexico. Rather than fanning the flames of sensationalism, we should promote a more compassionate and cooperative approach to the issues at hand. In conclusion, the speculation about Mexico being on the verge of becoming a failed state due to the drug war is not only an inaccurate portrayal of the situation but also a dangerous distraction for the United States. It is essential for both countries to acknowledge and address their respective problems while maintaining open lines of communication in order to promote mutual understanding, collaboration, and long-term stability in the region."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What's the full name of the person posing as a milkman?

At the school my two eldest children go to they have a unique form of parental torture surely invented purely to make my life a misery once a year. ‘Open Homework’: these two words do not belong together do they? Like ‘sugar’ and ‘free’ or ‘drink’ and ‘moderation’ they should never be in the same sentence. So, what, exactly is ‘Open Homework’? Well, it’s just like normal homework — only worse. Lorraine has recently come into contact with 'Open Homework' which has seen her attempt various dubious tasks including knitting in order to encourage her daughter's creative thinking. It’s the kind of homework the tyrannical teacher from Matilda would set; Miss Trunchbull homework. The idea behind Open Homework is to encourage creative free-thinking in a young mind (a dangerous concept to start with for my rebellious pre-teen girls). What happens is a subject is given and you can do whatever you want with it: build a sculpture, write an essay, set it to music, turn it into performance art, make an omelette; anything as long as you can explain the mental acrobatics which helped you come up with your idea in the first place. Lorraine says that working full-time and Open Homework does not mix. Past themes of this annual working-mum-stress-increaser have included ‘flight’ and ‘black and white’. I marvel at some of the pupils’ resulting creations, really I do. Even though parents are forbidden from helping, some of the work is so magnificent it looks like it has been handed in by architect Zaha Hadid or crafted by Professor Brian Cox. Ours, however, tend to end up looking like they’ve been made in the craft room at a lunatic asylum by an inmate with questionable motor skills. This is because I really do try not to help, despite Open Homework sucking up most of my evenings and once waking me up in the middle of the night with a nightmare about the toddler getting hold of the wood glue and sticking a rug to the floor. This project throws me into a week-long Sunday-night-gloom, looming large in the lengthy daily to-do list because my children enthusiastically throw everything they have got at it. When I suggest a little editing of their ideas, some focus perhaps, or possibly a less ambitious ‘build’, as Kevin from Grand Designs would say, I am shushed. I am sent out with a shopping list that once included ‘something that looks like a bug’s eye’. We’ve made board games, built aeroplanes and once Gracie asked me to construct a life-size model of a Friesian cow. Even Blue Peter couldn’t do that, I say, but she replies: ‘Maybe we could knit one and stuff it.’ In a busy household of four children aged three to 12, this kind of project takes over. Bits of the different creations are to be found drying/setting/cooking everywhere. On Sunday I heard Gracie describing Open Homework to her grandma on the phone: ‘It’s this fun thing we do that Mum hates,’ she said. ‘Mum sort of comes up with an idea and then we do it for her.’ I feel the meaning of the mission has been lost. This year we have the number ‘100’ as the theme — no doubt inspired by the centenary of the war. Of course Gracie does not want to do something so obvious as this anniversary. ‘God mum, everyone will do that,’ she says. And so begins the fraught discussion of ideas. She will have ten, develop five into an embryonic project for which all manner of empty jam jars, egg boxes, candles and silver paint will be required. By day three of Open Homework I will feel like lying down in the middle of the road clutching a sign saying ‘do not resuscitate’ as she narrows down her choice to one idea. The girls approach this with far more enthusiasm than any other homework. Perhaps because of my antipathy they love it as much as I fear it. Maybe if I didn’t work I would have more time and enjoy taking part? Maybe not. I find normal homework, especially maths, gruelling but this no-rules homework pains me more. And we never have enough glue. We have now come up with an idea after hours of discussion. Does anyone know where I can get something that looks like a small marsupial?

The movie begins as Lolita desperately seeks information about her mother, Sarah, fueled by her own questions about her past. Unknown to Lolita, her father and her grandmother have kept a dark secret for years – that her mother was actually murdered in the house while attempting to protect Lolita from an unknown assailant when she was just a baby. As her family continues to hide the truth, Lolita befriends strange and reclusive Adrian, a local writer and fellow mystery enthusiast. Together, they set out on a journey, uncovering long-buried secrets, lies, and dark connections of the past. As the plot thickens and secrets accidentally pile on more secrets, Lolita starts to realize that things are not what they seem with her new friend, Adrian. They eventually discover that Adrian is actually the brother of Sarah, Lolita's mother. The siblings were separated during their tumultuous childhood, and now Adrian has returned to town to uncover the mystery surrounding his sister's death and bring justice to Sarah's memory. As Lolita gets closer to the truth about her mother's death and the connection between her father, grandmother, and Adrian's family, the movie reaches a turning point. Clues lead Lolita to ultimately confront Amelia, her grandmother, who is forced to unveil her tragic involvement in Sarah's death, driven by misguided love and a desperate attempt to protect the family. The climax of the movie is emotionally powerful, as Amelia reveals that she was inadvertently responsible for Sarah's murder when she mistook her for an intruder in the midst of a panic-stricken, fateful night. Grief-stricken, Amelia had conspired with Richard to cover up this dark secret and shield Lolita from the devastating truth. The movie concludes with a cathartic release as Lolita confronts her internal struggles and the lies that have shaped her life. Through forgiveness and acceptance, she works to rebuild the relationship with her father, and she finally begins her journey of understanding and coming to terms with her mother's tragic death. They make peace with Amelia, who finally finds solace in the knowledge that both Adrian and Lolita understand her actions even if they cannot completely forgive her. The three, learning to grieve together, slowly piece their lives back together, walking toward a future with the truth - both devastating and liberating - by their side."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I found the following answer on Google: This really means that you don't have to pay both Sales Tax as well as Use Tax on one transaction. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer is:","completion":"No, the provided answer does not accurately explain what use taxes are. Use taxes are a type of tax that applies to tangible personal property, services, or certain products purchased from a seller who does not collect sales tax due to being located out-of-state or country. Essentially, use tax ensures that consumers pay a comparable amount of tax, regardless of whether they purchase items from in-state or out-of-state sellers. It is a complementary tax to sales tax and usually has similar rates. Sales tax, on the other hand, applies to items purchased within the state from businesses that are registered to collect and remit taxes. When you purchase an item from a seller located in your state, they typically collect the applicable sales tax at the point of sale. In summary, sales tax and use tax serve the same purpose, ensuring that the state collects tax revenue on all taxable transactions. However, they apply to different types of transactions, and you typically do not have to pay both taxes on one transaction. If sales tax is properly collected at the time of purchase, use tax does not apply. Conversely, if sales tax is not collected, then you may be responsible for reporting and paying use tax."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

I absolutely love summer. I love the hot weather, the skimpy clothes, the summer fruits and the party seasons. I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over. In an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky. Two coats, completely opaque and streak free. If you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States. Formaldehyde is one of the biggest nasties that I make a real effort to avoid. I did my PhD in Forensics and spent a lot of time watching autopsies. Once the body parts have been harvested, they are stored in Formaldehyde to be preserved. The Formaldehyde alters the proteins in the tissue to stop them breaking down - fine for the dead, not something I want to use whilst I am alive. It is nasty, nasty stuff.

Sentence:","completion":"Bakso is a popular Indonesian dish that originates from the region of Indonesia, a culturally rich and diverse country located in Southeast Asia. This beloved dish is made with an assortment of ingredients that come together to create a savory and flavorful experience for the consumer. The main ingredients in Bakso include ground beef, tapioca, noodles, rice vermicelli, beef broth, kailan (a type of Chinese broccoli), celery, salted vegetables, and fried shallots. The base of Bakso consists of ground beef, which is essential in providing the dish with its meaty and satisfying taste. The ground beef is combined with tapioca, a starchy ingredient derived from the cassava plant, which serves as a binder and gives the meatballs a unique texture. Tapioca also adds some nutritional value to the dish, as it is an excellent source of carbohydrates and essential minerals like iron and calcium. Another key component of Bakso is noodles, which can vary depending on regional preferences and personal tastes. Rice vermicelli, a type of thin rice noodle, is commonly used in Bakso. It contributes a delicate texture, making the dish more enjoyable and filling. Besides, rice vermicelli is a healthier alternative to many other types of noodles, as it is gluten-free and has a low glycemic index, hence suitable for those watching their carbohydrate intake. To create a rich and flavorful broth that complements and enhances the taste of the meatballs and noodles, beef broth is used as the foundation. Known for its deep, savory flavor and abundance of essential nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and amino acids, beef broth not only adds delectable taste to the dish but is also beneficial for maintaining overall health. Incorporating various vegetables into Bakso enhances its nutritional value and provides an array of flavors and textures for a more balanced and satisfying meal. Kailan is a type of Chinese broccoli commonly used in Bakso for its tender yet crunchy texture and signature earthy flavor. Celery lends a refreshing and crisp taste to the dish, while salted vegetables provide a pleasant, briny contrast to the rich and savory flavors of the meat and broth. Finally, fried shallots serve as a garnish and aromatic ingredient for Bakso, offering a delightful crunch and a subtle yet rich onion-like taste. The aroma from the fried shallots adds an additional layer of depth and complexity to the dish, making it even more inviting and enjoyable for all to savor. In conclusion, Bakso is a beloved Indonesian dish that showcases the depth of flavors and culinary ingenuity of the region. Its unique combination of ingredients, such as ground beef, tapioca, rice vermicelli, beef broth, kailan, celery, salted vegetables, and fried shallots, creates a sumptuous and comforting meal, rich in both taste and nutrition, which has become a staple in Indonesian cuisine and continues to be celebrated and relished by food lovers alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Edward Hanson is the prime suspect, accused of killing Andy due to his constantly strained relationship. But as Detective Samantha Walker, an outsider with a keen eye for detail, starts puzzling the pieces together, she discovers that each of the Hanson sons had deeply-rooted reasons to kill their brother. As the town gets swept up in the whirlwind of speculations, no one notices that Ethan is secretly orchestrating revenge against his family for abandoning him during his prison sentence. As Detective Walker digs deeper, Edward's seemingly unshakable loyalty to his family begins to crumble, leading her to question whether he would kill his own son in the name of preserving the Hanson legacy.

Q: The U.S. has long had the unenviable distinction of holding the world's largest prison population, in part because of tough-on-crime policies enacted in the 1990s. But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading... According to the above context, answer the following question. The senior research associate probably feels: A:","completion":"Based on the context provided, we can infer that Jacob Kang-Brown, the senior research associate at the Vera Institute for Justice, likely has complex feelings about the situation. He acknowledges the significant decline in the U.S. prison population, likely viewing it as a positive development, credited to the federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. However, he also expresses a degree of caution, indicating that it's unclear whether this decrease in prison populations will continue. His remark implies a sense of guarded optimism, or perhaps uncertainty or concern about the sustainability of the trend. Kang-Brown also seems to perceive this reduction in population as a form of 'relief' for communities, which suggests a level of empathy towards those who are affected by incarceration, including the prisoners themselves, their families and their respective communities. Moreover, his admonition to \\"continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change\\" suggests that he views an ongoing, persistent effort as a crucial component of ensuring further reduction and lasting change. This sentiment conveys a sense of commitment, responsibility and active involvement in the reform work. It is plausible to hypothesize that he experiences some frustration at the challenges they face in maintaining this momentum, but this is not explicitly mentioned. He does not directly reference President Trump's proposals for helping former inmates reintegrate into society, but given his clear engagement with the issue of criminal justice reform, it is likely that he has thoughts on this initiative as well. Whether he views it positively or negatively, though, would be pure speculation without more context. In summary, it seems probable that the senior research associate embodies a mix of emotions- optimism at the progress already made, caution about the future, empathy for those affected, commitment to the cause, and potentially frustration at pervasive challenges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Question: \\"Before leaving Warsaw when did Chopin first become immortalized in art?\\" Context: \\"In 1827, soon after the death of Chopin's youngest sister Emilia, the family moved from the Warsaw University building, adjacent to the Kazimierz Palace, to lodgings just across the street from the university, in the south annex of the Krasiński Palace on Krakowskie Przedmieście,[n 5] where Chopin lived until he left Warsaw in 1830.[n 6] Here his parents continued running their boarding house for male students; the Chopin Family Parlour (Salonik Chopinów) became a museum in the 20th century. In 1829 the artist Ambroży Mieroszewski executed a set of portraits of Chopin family members, including the first known portrait of the composer.[n 7]\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Before leaving Warsaw, Chopin first became immortalized in art in 1829. This significant milestone in his life occurred when the artist Ambroży Mieroszewski executed a set of portraits of Chopin family members. Among these portraits, the first known portrait of the composer, Frédéric Chopin, was created. Chopin's early life was shaped by his family's dedication to music, which became evident when they moved to lodgings across the street from the university in the south annex of the Krasiński Palace on Krakowskie Przedmieście in 1827. Previously, the Chopin family resided in the Warsaw University building, adjacent to the Kazimierz Palace. The reason for the move was due to the untimely death of Chopin's youngest sister, Emilia, which led the family to seek a change in scenery. In their new residence, Chopin's parents continued to run their boarding house, predominantly catering to male students. This place, known as the Chopin Family Parlour (Salonik Chopinów), later became a museum in the 20th century, showcasing the family's significant impact on Polish culture and the artistic development of young Chopin. As a rising composer and pianist, Chopin had already built a solid reputation within Warsaw's artistic circles by the time Mieroszewski painted his portrait. Capturing the essence of Chopin's connection to music, the portrait not only highlights his talent but also serves as a historical record of a young composer on the cusp of international acclaim. The portrait's creation in 1829 marked the beginning of Chopin's immortalization in the world of art, shedding light on his early life and family. It serves as a testament to the supportive environment in which he was raised and the impact it would have on his career. Just a year after the portrait was painted, in 1830, Chopin left Warsaw to embark on a journey that would further cement his status as one of the most renowned composers and pianists in history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The Karate Kid Context: Twelve-year-old Dre Parker and his mother Sherry Parker move from Detroit to Beijing after Sherry gets a job transfer at her car factory. After a day in a Chinese park, Dre develops a crush on a young violinist, Meiying, who reciprocates his attention, but Cheng, a rebellious kung fu prodigy whose family is close to Meiying's, attempts to keep the two young ones apart by violently attacking Dre, and later bullies him at school, as Dre is too weak to stand up for himself. During an attack one day, the maintenance man, Mr. Han, comes to Dre's aid, revealing himself as an ancient kung fu master. After Han mends Dre's injuries using fire cupping, Dre asks if Mr. Han could teach him kung fu to get revenge on his attackers. Han refuses, but meets Cheng's teacher, Master Li, to make peace. Li, who teaches his students to show no mercy to their enemies, challenges Dre to a fight with Cheng. Seeing a poster for an open martial arts tournament, Han instead proposes that Dre compete against Li's students there. He also requests that the stronger students that Li teaches leave Dre alone to train in time for the tournament, in hopes Dre will no longer be bullied. Li accepts the offer, but tells Han that if Dre does not show up, there will trouble for both Han and Dre. Han promises to teach Dre \\"real\\" kung fu and begins to train Dre by emphasizing movements that apply to life in general, and that serenity and maturity, not punches and power, are the true keys to mastering the martial art. He teaches this by having Dre go through various actions with his jacket, which teaches Dre muscle memory moves. Han then takes Dre to a divine temple in the Wudang Mountains where he trained with his father hundreds of years ago, and Dre witnesses a woman making a king cobra reflect her movements, and Dre and drinks the water from a secret, ancient Chinese well for good luck. As Dre's relationship with Meiying continues, he persuades her to cut school for a day of fun, but when she is nearly late for her violin audition which was brought... A:","completion":"In the movie \\"The Karate Kid,\\" Dre Parker, the protagonist, severely hurts his leg. The injury occurs during the martial arts tournament when he goes up against Cheng, the kung fu prodigy who has been bullying him throughout the film. This climactic battle is significant for Dre as it tests his resolve and determination in the face of adversity. Dre's leg injury happens when Cheng lands a kick on it, causing Dre to fall and struggle to stand up. Despite his obvious pain, Dre manages to find the strength to continue fighting, relying on the kung fu teachings of Mr. Han, who has trained him not just in self-defense but also in self-discipline, and the importance of serenity and maturity in martial arts. Mr. Han, who has been a father figure to Dre throughout the story, treats his injuries after each encounter with Cheng and his gang. With the leg injury during the tournament, Dre demonstrates that he is no longer the weak and defenseless boy he was before and that he has learned from Mr. Han's training. The tournament serves as a turning point for Dre, as the previously bullied and fearful child is now confident and courageous in the face of adversity. Dre's success in the tournament also helps to change Cheng's attitude toward him, as Cheng finally respects Dre's abilities and demonstrates sportsmanship by handing him the trophy. In addition to Dre's leg injury, the training he undergoes with Mr. Han helps him to develop character, learn valuable life lessons, and understand that true martial art mastery is not just about physical prowess, but also mental and emotional maturity. This shift in Dre's perspective ultimately enables him to find inner strength and face his fears, resulting in personal growth and the ability to foster healthier relationships with others, including Meiying, the girl he has been pursuing throughout the film. As evidenced in \\"The Karate Kid,\\" the injuries Dre sustains aren't just physical; they also serve as an important catalyst for his personal transformation, allowing him to evolve from a vulnerable, bullied child into a determined and wise martial artist."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But this is an event that does what it says on the tin. It is \\"open\\" to the lower echelons who have earned their chance to rub shoulders with the big boys at Erin Hills this week. From the 8,979 professional and amateur golfers who teed it up in local qualifying, 525 progressed to be part of the 902 who competed at the sectional stage, which in turn yielded 72 with a golden ticket to the second major of the year. These include 22-year-old Aaron Rai from Wolverhampton, who won the European sectional tournament at Walton Heath. It was this qualifier that produced the eventual champion, Michael Campbell, in 2005. Scotland's Richie Ramsay, Bradley Dredge of Wales and Englishmen Andrew 'Beef' Johnston, Matt Wallace and Eddie Pepperell were also among the 15 who progressed from the 36-hole tournament. Of those British qualifiers, Pepperell's is perhaps the most heart-warming story. The 26-year-old, who was prominent on the 2015 Open leaderboard at St Andrews, is emerging from a torrid spell in which he was forced to return to Tour School to retain his European Tour card. \\"The last year has been a bit of a struggle and I lost a lot of confidence,\\" Pepperell told BBC Sport. After finishing eighth in last year's Irish Open, he missed 16 cuts in 21 tournaments, tumbling from a career-high of 80th in the world to outside the top 500. \\"There have been times where I've gone home quite stressed and, yeah, feeling a bit low,\\" said Pepperell. \\"And you have some alcohol or whatever just to get away from it, and I've experienced what it's like to live under a bit of stress. \\"It's all part and parcel of life and makes the good times all the more enjoyable.\\" At Walton Heath, Pepperell carded rounds of 67 and 66 to book his place in Wisconsin, before continuing his fine form with a top-10 finish at the Nordea Masters later that week. \\"Qualifying for the US Open, having my dad and family there and seeing them smiling, knowing they'll come over to America and have a great time, it was really nice. We are going to enjoy it,\\" he said. The Oxfordshire pro credits a change of clubs and ball as the main reasons for his return to form. \\"Modern equipment is just designed to go further, through a higher launch angle with less spin off the tee and that's never really been my game,\\" Pepperell said. \\"I'm a natural, feely kind of player and I've learned that I actually need some backspin on my driver so I know when I'm on the tee and not feeling very comfortable I can tee it down low and squeeze one out there and get it in play.\\" Anyone who reads Pepperell's regular and honest blogs knows the former British amateur international sees more to life than bashing balls and holing putts. But coping with the demands of the toughest of the majors will be uppermost in his mind this week in what will be his second US Open, having qualified for Merion in 2013. Erin Hills is a monster that can play anything up to 7,800 yards. It is the first par-72 course to stage America's national championship since Pebble Beach in 1992. \\"The way I see it, every tee shot is hard, every approach shot is hard, the whole week is hard,\\" Pepperell said. \\"There's just constant pressure, a constant need to hit really good golf shots. In many ways I think it brings the best out of you because you know what you have to do. \\"The way you react is the key. You either become afraid or think 'you know what? I've got nothing to lose here'. \\"I'm just going to try and make great swings for four days and let's see what happens. \\"In my two American majors so far I have putted really poorly, so most of my preparation will be around long-range and short-range putting. You are going to have to hole those six-footers.\\" This will be the mantra for much of the field, regardless of their background. Johnson's length off the tee and outstanding form since breaking his major duck 12 months ago make him a justifiable favourite. But defending champions rarely fare well. Tiger Woods (tied sixth in 2009) is the only one to make the top 10 since Curtis Strange retained his title in 1989. Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy has played only 72 competitive holes since the Masters following the recurrence of his rib problems and will do well not to be undercooked. Having said that, he has had plenty of opportunity to work on his short game, which will be such a vital component. With four par-fives at Erin Hills, the other key areas are driving distance, and approach play from 100 yards and in. Looking at statistics covering these areas, a shortlist of leading exponents includes Americans Justin Thomas, Rickie Fowler, Jordan Spieth and Brendan Steele, and Spain's Masters winner Sergio Garcia. McIlroy and Johnson also show up well statistically, and if Jason Day can find his touch on the greens, this looks an ideal test for the Australian, who has yet to fire this season. But the penal nature of the US Open makes patience an important virtue and this is an undoubted strength of 2013 winner Justin Rose. As he prepares for his fourth major, Pepperell insists he will not be daunted by the strength in depth at the top of the game. \\"I don't really care whether I'm chipping next to Rory McIlroy or my dad to be honest,\\" he said, laughing. \\"It's just one of them is better at golf than the other. \\"For me it's not the players, it's the crowds, the atmosphere, the hum, the whole environment. It's completely different to what we are used to. \\"In Europe I played an event and I was third and there were two people watching and I was thinking, 'well this isn't very inspiring', and this week I could have 2,000 people watching me on the first tee.\\" The same applies to all those who have earned their crack at a week of genuinely big-time golf - no matter how tortuous their route to get there. A summary of the above article is?","completion":"The article talks about a big golf tournament where the best golf players in the world and some not-so-famous players will be competing together. One of them is a young man named Eddie Pepperell, who has worked hard to improve his game and is now playing with the top golfers. Eddie is excited to play in the tournament and enjoy the experience with his family. The tournament will be challenging, and all the players will have to do their best to win."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

However, the given hypothesis \\"Concerts are held fortnightly, except during winters, and all weekend evenings during festivals\\" contains more specific details that the premise doesn't directly address. Based on the premise, we can deduce the following facts: 1. The Ross Open Air Bandstand is situated at the center of some gardens. 2. It hosts free concerts throughout the year. 3. The number of concerts held tends to increase during the festival season. While we can infer that concerts are organized at the bandstand throughout the year, and the frequency of these concerts likely increases during festival times, we don't have enough information to determine if the concerts follow the specific pattern described in the hypothesis (fortnightly schedule, the exclusion of winter season, and weekend evenings according to festival timetables). We also cannot determine from the premise if the concert scheduling aligns with the details of the hypothesis or if the venue is closed for all concerts during winters. Consequently, the hypothesis that \\"concerts are held fortnightly, except during winters, and all weekend evenings during festivals\\" might be accurate or merely speculative. To confirm or refute the hypothesis, further information would be needed, such as historical data or a direct inquiry with the organization responsible for scheduling the concerts at Ross Open Air Bandstand. Only with more conclusive evidence or documentation can we determine whether the details provided in the hypothesis are entirely consistent with the concert scheduling and organization.

What does an arenophile collect????","completion":"An arenophile is a person who has a keen interest in and collects sand from various locations, particularly beaches, deserts, dunes, and riverbanks. This unique hobby, also known as psammophile or sand collecting, often involves gathering sand samples from different parts of the world, documenting their origins and characteristics, and ideally preserving them in a well-organized manner. Arenophiles appreciate the intricate beauty, texture, color, and composition of sand, which can vary widely from one location to another. They may also study sand's geological, biological, and cultural significance. An arenophile's collection may showcase a wide range of sand samples, each with distinctive features, such as: 1. Color: The color of sand can differ vastly depending on its mineral composition, organic materials, and geological history. It can range from white, cream, beige, and various shades of brown to striking hues like pink, red, green, black, or even purple. 2. Grain size: Sand grains can vary from very fine to coarse, which affects the sand's overall texture. The grain size typically results from processes like erosion, sediment transport, and deposition. 3. Composition: The mineral content of sand varies depending on the source rocks and geological processes. Most sands primarily consist of quartz, while some might contain minerals like feldspar, olivine, and magnetite, or even shell fragments and coral. 4. Shape: The shape of sand grains can provide valuable clues about their origin and transport history. For example, angular grains may indicate a relatively young and nearby source, while well-rounded grains suggest long-distance transport and a more extended history of erosion and abrasion. Arenophiles often employ specific methods and materials to preserve and showcase their collection. A common method is to store the sand samples in small, transparent containers or vials and label them accordingly. These containers may be stored in boxes, on shelves, or displayed in an exhibit. Many arenophiles also maintain a catalog or database that includes the sand's origin, collection date, physical and geological properties, and any anecdotal or historical information related to the sample. Some arenophiles may take their passion for sand collecting a step further by participating in online forums, social media groups, or clubs dedicated to the hobby. These platforms allow sand collectors to exchange samples, share collecting tips and experiences, and discuss the unique properties and fascinating stories behind different sand samples. In summary, an arenophile is an individual who collects sand samples from various locations. They appreciate the myriad properties of these geological materials, such as color, grain size, composition, and shape. Arenophiles meticulously preserve, organize, and document their sand collections and may engage with other collectors to share their knowledge, experiences, and samples. This captivating hobby allows arenophiles to explore the diverse and beautiful world of sand and gain a deeper appreciation for the incredible geological and biological processes that shape our planet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. Nov. 16, 2015, 9:10 PM GMT / Updated Nov. 16, 2015, 10:29 PM GMT By Maggie Fox Researchers have found even more evidence that coffee can be good for you. People who drink regular, moderate amounts of coffee are less likely to die from a range of diseases, from diabetes to heart disease. The cutoff seems to be around five cups a day, and even decaf coffee helps, the team at Harvard University’s school of public health found. But even heavy coffee drinking doesn’t appear to offset the damage caused by smoking, they report in the journal Circulation. “The main message is that regular consumption, meaning three to five cups of coffee a day, is associated with lower risk in total mortality and mortality from several causes like diabetes, cardiovascular disease and suicide,” Frank Hu, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology who helped lead the study, told NBC News. “In previous studies on that issue, most of the coffee was caffeinated coffee. In our study, both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee showed a lower mortality risk but there is no final conclusion yet.” \\"In our study, both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee showed a lower mortality risk.\\" Hu and colleagues looked at two giant sources of information: surveys of more than 200,000 doctors and nurses who have regularly updated researchers on their eating and other lifestyle habits and details about their health for more than 20 years. Coffee drinkers overall were less likely to die over the decades than non-drinkers. The effects were even stronger and clearer when the team discounted smokers. Non-smokers who drank coffee were between 8 and 15 percent less likely to die, depending on how much they drank. “This is good news for people who drink coffee because the evidence is strong. Drinking coffee may be good for health outcome,” Hu said. It’s not a clear correlation. People who drink more coffee also are more likely to smoke, drink, and to eat red meat. Other lifestyle habits may also go along with heavy coffee drinking, and the researchers didn’t report on whether people drank their coffee black, with cream, with sugar, or as giant frothy drinks from coffee store chains. “We are not advocating coffee as a strategy for prevention of the chronic diseases because coffee drinking is individual behavior and there are other factors in the diet that have a bigger effect. People should also be aware of the amount of added sugar to coffee drinks which can become a problem,” Hu said. What could coffee be doing for health? The dark drink is the No. 1 source in the American diet of antioxidants – those chemical compounds that fight the damage to your DNA caused by day-to-day living. “The main message is that people who enjoy drinking coffee should not worry about it being harmful for their health.\\" Other research has found evidence that coffee can help people recover from colon cancer, lower diabetes risk and reduce the inflammation associated with diabetes and heart disease. Advisers to the U.S. government say new dietary proposals should mention the benefits of coffee, which include protection against diabetes, Parkinson's and liver cancer. “The chlorogenic acid, lignans, quinides, trigonelline, and magnesium in coffee reduce insulin resistance and systematic inflammation,” the researchers wrote. “This is probably the best study we are going to get because of the very large numbers, the inclusion of men and women, and the decades of follow-up,” said cardiologist Dr. Sharonne Hayes of the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, who wasn’t involved in the study. “The main message is that people who enjoy drinking coffee should not worry about it being harmful for their health,” Hayes told NBC News. “Coffee may actually be beneficial to their health.” ||||| Drink To Your Health: Study Links Daily Coffee Habit To Longevity Enlarge this image toggle caption iStockphoto iStockphoto If you have a daily coffee habit, here's something to buzz about: A new study finds those cups of joe may help boost longevity. \\"In our study, we found people who drank three to five cups of coffee per day had about a 15 percent lower [risk of premature] mortality compared to people who didn't drink coffee,\\" says one of the study authors, nutrition researcher Walter Willett of the Harvard School of Public Health. Decaf drinkers also saw benefits. The findings, published in the journal Circulation, build on a body of evidence linking a coffee habit to potential health benefits. As we've reported, previous research has pointed to a decreased risk of stroke. And, there's some evidence that a coffee habit cuts the risk of Type 2 diabetes, too. Now, of course, it's possible to overdo it with caffeine. Research has shown that consuming more than 400 milligrams of caffeine can interfere with sleep and create feelings of unease. And some of us are even more sensitive. (I feel jittery if I have more than one strong cup!) One study found that 200 milligrams of caffeine (the equivalent of about two cups of coffee) is an optimal amount to enhance cognitive function and mood among sleep-deprived people. But we don't all metabolize caffeine the same way. As we've reported, the caffeine amounts in coffee vary wildly. One analysis, conducted by Bruce Goldberger, found a 16-ounce cup of caffeinated coffee from Starbucks could contain anywhere from 250 milligrams to more than 500 milligrams of caffeine. \\"Not everyone reacts to coffee in the same way,\\" says Andrew Maynard, who studies risk assessment at Arizona State University. He summarizes the benefits documented in this study as \\"small.\\" He says this study does not prove cause and effect between drinking coffee and living longer. Rather, it points to an association. \\"There are a lot of unknowns as to what [may explain] the increase in life expectancy,\\" Maynard says. Got more questions? So did we. Here's our conversation about the findings with study co-author Walter Willett, edited for length and clarity. So, what do you think might explain this association? In the study, you point to compounds in coffee — such as lignans, quinides and magnesium — that may help reduce insulin resistance and inflammation. Prior studies have pointed to these as well. We're not sure exactly how coffee is [linked] to all these benefits. The coffee bean itself is loaded with many different nutrients and phytochemicals. And my guess is that they're working together to have some of these benefits. We [see] similar benefits from caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee. That's important, because it suggests that caffeine is not responsible for [the benefit]. So this may be welcome news to people who drink decaf? Yes, because too much [caffeinated] coffee can cause insomnia and loss of sleep, and that's not a good thing! The reduced risk of death was not seen among the coffee drinkers in your study who were smokers or former smokers. Definitely. It's extremely important to disentangle the effects of coffee from the effects of cigarette smoking. So, what's the take-home here? Is it that coffee can be part of a healthy lifestyle? I think if people like coffee, it's fine to include it [as part of your daily habit]. So, certainly, [people] should not feel guilty about moderate coffee consumption. It definitely can be part of a healthy lifestyle. I wouldn't suggest that someone who doesn't like coffee go out and drink it. Are you a coffee drinker? Are these findings likely to influence your own behaviors? Well, I really like a good cup of coffee. But if I have more than two cups a day, I really don't sleep as well. So, I've been switching more toward decaf or half decaf/half regular. In this study, you also analyzed how coffee influenced the risk of specific diseases — or categories of diseases. What did you find? We went beyond total mortality and looked at specific causes of death. And we found that people who drink moderate amounts of coffee have lower risk of [death] from cardiovascular disease, diabetes, neurologic disease [such as Parkinson's] and suicide. Your findings come from data from two Nurses' Health Studies, which included about 167,000 women. And it also looked at the 40,000 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. As you point out, the participants in these studies are about 95 percent white, largely middle-class and well-educated. Can you extrapolate to other populations? Yes, I'm quite sure these findings would apply to other populations. This is a biological relationship. And we basically have a common biology. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"A new study by Harvard University's School of Public Health has found that people who drink regular, moderate amounts of coffee are less likely to die from a range of diseases, including diabetes and heart disease, with the optimum amount being around five cups a day for both caffeinated and decaffeinated drinkers.

It was still early in the morning as the sun had just begun to spread its golden rays across the sky, casting a warm glow upon the room. The curtains swayed gently, allowing a cool, refreshing breeze to flow in. She rubbed her sleepy eyes and sat up slowly, her thoughts still drifting through the remnants of her dreams. She had never believed that Winston would leave her side, especially not in the dead of the night. However, there was always that nagging fear that maybe, just maybe, it could happen. They had been through so much together – the abandoned puppy that had stolen her heart, the long walks in the park, and the countless hours of laughter and play. But over the years, Winston had grown from a clumsy, playful pup into a wise, reliable companion. He had proven time and time again to be her most trustworthy ally, never one to desert her. She could remember the dark days, when life had thrown one too many curveballs her way, and Winston had been there to provide a steady, comforting presence, letting her know that she was never truly alone. As she swept the covers aside and stepped onto the cold floor, she began to wonder if perhaps her dream had just felt all too real. She could still feel the unsettling sense of dread that had enveloped her as she awoke, moments ago. Shaking away the last tendrils of her nightmare, she descended the stairs towards the kitchen, following the scent of freshly brewed coffee. And there he was, sprawled across the kitchen floor, tail wagging, tongue hanging out in an all-too-familiar grin. Winston had not left her side, after all. But why then, had he not been at the foot of her bed, like he always was? As she approached the kitchen, she noticed that the back door was wide open. A sense of relief surged through her as she realized that her doting companion had simply gone out for his morning routine. She could see the path he had taken through the dew-kissed garden, a small trail of paw prints leading the way. The sight of Winston, alive and well, lying there with a joyous expression, brought a smile to her face. She lowered herself to the ground, running her fingers gently through his soft fur. He looked up at her lovingly, and for a moment, everything seemed right in the world. She realized that, even though they had shared years of cherished moments and memories, the thought of Winston leaving her side had managed to seep into her subconscious and nest itself amidst the dark and unwarranted fears we all carry within us. In a way, it was a reminder of the fragility of life, and that nothing was ever entirely certain. With a newfound appreciation for the bond they shared, she vowed to treasure each and every moment spent with Winston, knowing that their time together, no matter how long, would always be an irreplaceable gift. As they exchanged loving glances, she knew, in her heart of hearts, that Winston would always stay true to his unwavering loyalty. She laughed at herself for ever entertaining the thought that Winston would leave her. With her faithful pup by her side, they enjoyed breakfast and prepared for their daily walk, setting off happily through the sunlit streets, confident that the bond they shared would see them through whatever life chose to throw their way."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the following context: After graduation, Shostakovich initially embarked on a dual career as concert pianist and composer, but his dry style of playing was often unappreciated (his American biographer, Laurel Fay, comments on his \\"emotional restraint\\" and \\"riveting rhythmic drive\\"). He nevertheless won an \\"honorable mention\\" at the First International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1927. He attributed the disappointment at the competition to suffering from appendicitis and the jury being all-Polish. He had his appendix removed in April 1927. After the competition Shostakovich met the conductor Bruno Walter, who was so impressed by the composer's First Symphony that he conducted it at its Berlin premiere later that year. Leopold Stokowski was equally impressed and gave the work its U.S. premiere the following year in Philadelphia and also made the work's first recording. Shostakovich concentrated on composition thereafter and soon limited his performances primarily to those of his own works. In 1927 he wrote his Second Symphony (subtitled To October), a patriotic piece with a great pro-Soviet choral finale. Owing to its experimental nature, as with the subsequent Third Symphony, it was not critically acclaimed with the enthusiasm given to the First. 1927 also marked the beginning of Shostakovich's relationship with Ivan Sollertinsky, who remained his closest friend until the latter's death in 1944. Sollertinsky introduced the composer to the music of Mahler, which had a strong influence on his music from the Fourth Symphony onwards. While writing the Second Symphony, Shostakovich also began work on his satirical opera The Nose, based on the story by Nikolai Gogol. In June 1929, against the composer's own wishes, the opera was given a concert performance; it was ferociously attacked by the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM). Its stage premiere on 18 January 1930 opened to generally poor reviews and widespread incomprehension among musicians.In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Shostakovich worked at TRAM, a... answer the following question: What is the name of the person who had his appendix removed in April 1927?

The reviewer experiences several issues with the Clip On Bed Lamp, which indicate that the product is not durable or well-built. The reviewer bought two of these lamps, and each one had different problems that rendered them less useful or completely unusable. The first issue the reviewer encountered was with the clamp spring of one lamp. It jumped out of position, and the reviewer found it impossible to put it back in place. This indicates that the construction of the lamp is defective or poorly designed, as a crucial component (the clamp spring) did not function as it should, and it was not easy for the reviewer to fix the problem themselves. The second issue the reviewer faced was with the swivel action on the other lamp. The swivel action is an important feature of this type of product for adjusting the direction of the light according to the user's preference or need. However, in this case, the swivel action ceased to function properly after a short period, leaving the lamp stuck in one position. This further indicates that the product might not be built with high-quality materials or proper construction techniques, leading to its failure in providing the functionality required by the user. The reviewer concludes their review by saying that the Clip On Bed Lamp had a good concept, but the poor construction makes it a disappointing purchase.

First, he took a chemical system that was at equilibrium. He labeled it as case E. Then he changed the temperature of the system. He labeled that experiment as case T. Finally, he observed two more experiments, case A and case B. In case A forward reaction was favored, and in case B reverse reaction was favored. In which case the reactants concentration would decrease, case A or case B? Hint: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase. Answer:","completion":"In case A, the forward reaction is favored.

Can we infer the following? Hinckley Jr. liked to shoot guns.","completion":"While it may be tempting to make quick inferences from the limited information available, it is essential to dig deeper into the context surrounding John Hinckley Jr.'s attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan on March 30, 1981, before drawing definitive conclusions about Hinckley's motivations or preferences. John Hinckley Jr. fired six shots at President Reagan and members of his entourage, injuring the president and three others outside the Washington Hilton Hotel. To understand the reasoning behind Hinckley's actions, we must address his mental health, the influence of popular culture, and his obsession with a particular individual, rather than merely focusing on an apparent affinity for firearms. Hinckley, diagnosed with depression, schizophrenia, and narcissistic personality disorder, had a deep obsession with actress Jodie Foster. This fascination began after he watched the film \\"Taxi Driver,\\" in which the main character, Travis Bickle, played by Robert De Niro, attempts to assassinate a presidential candidate. Foster portrayed a young prostitute named Iris in the film. Hinckley believed that by emulating Bickle's actions, he would achieve notoriety and impress Foster, thereby winning her affection. Hinckley's mental instability and warped perceptions of reality played a major role in the attempted assassination. Rather than a genuine interest in firearms, it was the distorted ideas fueled by his mental health issues and an unrelenting obsession with Foster that drove him to employ the use of a gun in an attempt to gain her attention. Nevertheless, it is clear that Hinckley had some proficiency in using guns, as evident from his ability to fire multiple shots in quick succession during the assassination attempt. However, this proficiency does not necessarily suggest that he had a genuine fondness for using firearms. To infer that John Hinckley Jr. liked to shoot guns based on this single event would be a hasty conclusion. The incident should be considered in light of the available information about Hinckley's mental health issues, his obsession with Foster, and his motivation to replicate the actions of a fictitious character. It is crucial to achieve a holistic understanding of the situation before drawing definitive conclusions about Hinckley's preferences or motivations."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: - Plants start growing on or near the rocks - The roots of the growing plants start to break up the rock - The plant acids dissolve the rock - The rock is broken down into smaller pieces What might be the last step of the process?

The Capital-Journal claimed the question that prompted his remarks came from the audience during a question-and-answer session at the Pizza Ranch in Jefferson, Iowa -- but on Twitter, Rolling Stone's Matt Taibbi confessed to having asked it: [embedtweet id=\\"626891046408990720\\"] [embedtweet id=\\"626891133931499520\\"] Huckabee acknowledged that the decision to invade an abortion clinic -- or a state in which they were legal -- would be controversial, but that he would \\"invoke the 5th and 14th Amendments for the protection of every human being.\\" He noted that scientific advancements in the decades since Roe v. Wade prove that fetuses are, in fact, unborn babies and as such have human rights. \\"I will not pretend there is nothing we can do to stop this,\\" he said. \\"All American citizens should be protected,\\" and explained that many other presidents have defied Supreme Court rulings on the basis of their conscience, citing Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln. The issue of abortion is beginning to dominate conversations on the right because of the hoax being perpetrated on it by the Center for Medical Progress.

Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms. - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo. - Stian Aarstad is a Norwegian pianist and keyboard player best known for his five - year ( 1992 -- 97 ) stint with the black metal band Dimmu Borgir during which he played keyboards and synthesizers while engendering criticism and controversy for appearing onstage and performing in a top - hat - and - cape outfit reminiscent of Jack the Ripper , while wearing minimal corpse makeup and not moving or showing any emotion . Upon joining Dimmu Borgir , he did n't listen to metal music , preferring only to listen to classical . In 1998 to 1999 , he produced a demo - EP for the unblack metal band Vaakevandring . In the 2000s , Aarstad had been the pianist for the band Enthral , but left his regular position during the recording of the band 's third album . - Dimmu Borgir (or or ) is a Norwegian symphonic black metal band from Oslo, Norway, formed in 1993. The name is derived from Dimmuborgir, a volcanic formation in Iceland, the name of which means \\"dark cities\\" or \\"dark castles/fortresses\\" in Icelandic, Faroese and Old Norse. The band has been through numerous lineup changes over the years; guitarist Silenoz and vocalist Shagrath are the only original members who still remain with guitarist Galder being a longstanding member. - Jack the Ripper is the best known name given to an unidentified serial killer generally believed to have been active in the largely impoverished areas in and around the Whitechapel district of London in 1888. The name \\"Jack the Ripper\\" originated in a letter written by someone claiming to be the murderer that was disseminated in the media. The letter is widely believed to have been a hoax and may have been written by journalists in an attempt to heighten interest in the story and increase their newspapers' circulation. The killer was called \\"the Whitechapel Murderer\\" as well as \\"Leather Apron\\" within the crime case files, as well as in contemporary journalistic accounts. - Whitechapel is a district in the East End of London, England, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Dimmuborgir (\\"dimmu\\" \\"dark\\", \\"borgir\\" \\"cities\\" or \\"forts\\", \\"castles\\"); pronounced ) is a large area of unusually shaped lava fields east of Mývatn in Iceland.

Race track: While a race track may have dirt, it usually doesn't have a gutter built into it to carry away water, and the term 'gutter' seems less likely in the context of a race track. 2. Bed: A bed neither has a gutter nor has rubber hitting it regularly, so this option can be eliminated. 3. Ground: The ground is a very general term and it could encompass various surfaces, including both streets and race tracks. However, since it is not specific enough and doesn't necessarily imply the presence of a gutter, it can be considered less suitable. 4. Street: A street typically has gutters built into it to carry away rainwater and other waste. Additionally, rubber in the form of car tires regularly hits the surface of a street. This option seems to be the most fitting in terms of meeting both the gutter and rubber-hitting requirements. 5. Subway: A subway is an underground transportation system, and although it could have gutters for water drainage, the rubber hitting it regularly is less likely as most subway systems use steel wheels, not rubber tires.

Article: (Reuters) - Florida lawmakers, spurred by last month’s deadly high school shooting, gave final passage on Wednesday to a bill to raise the legal age for buying rifles, impose a three-day waiting period on all gun sales and allow the arming of some school employees. Swift action in the Republican-controlled statehouse, where the National Rifle Association (NRA) has long held sway, was propelled in large part by the extraordinary lobbying efforts of young survivors from the massacre three weeks ago at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. But the legislation, while containing a number of provisions student activists and their parents from Parkland, Florida, had embraced, left out one of their chief demands - a ban on assault-style weapons like the one used in the Feb. 14 rampage. The bill overcame strenuous objections to provisions permitting school staff to carry guns on the job. Critics say that will pose a particular risk to minority students, who they say are more likely to be shot in the heat of a disciplinary situation or if mistaken as an intruder. Still, a group of families of victims and survivors of the shooting applauded the legislation’s passage in a message posted on Twitter by parent Ryan Petty, whose daughter was among those killed, and urged Republican Governor Rick Scott to sign it. The measure will automatically become law within 15 days unless vetoed by Scott, who said on Wednesday prior to the vote that he had not yet decided whether to support the bill. The bill’s passage signaled a possible turning point in the national debate between gun control advocates and proponents of firearms rights enshrined in the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Related Coverage Factbox: Main provisions of Florida gun safety bill The measure narrowly cleared the state Senate on Monday before passing in the House of Representatives on Wednesday in a 67-50 vote. Ten House Democrats joined 57 Republicans in supporting the bill, while 19 Republicans and 31 Democrats voted against it. As legislators debated in Tallahassee, U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos visited Stoneman Douglas on the first full day of classes since the shooting, while the accused gunman, Nikolas Cruz, was indicted on 17 counts of murder. SCHOOLHOUSE “GUARDIANS” The action by Florida’s lawmakers represented both a break with the NRA on gun sale restrictions and a partial acceptance of its proposition that the best defense against armed criminals is the presence of “good guys with guns.” The bill would create a program allowing local sheriffs to deputize school staff as volunteer armed “guardians,” subject to special training, mental health and drug screening and a license to carry a concealed weapon. Each school district would decide whether to opt in. Nearly all classroom teachers are expressly excluded from participating in a compromise aimed at winning support from some Democrats and Scott, a staunch NRA ally who nevertheless is opposed to arming teachers. Otherwise, only non-teacher personnel are eligible, such as administrators, guidance counselors, librarians and coaches. Florida would join at least six other states - Georgia, Kansas, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Wyoming - with laws allowing school employees to carry firearms in public schools, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

REUTERS/Colin Hackley/File Photo President Donald Trump has voiced support for arming teachers as a deterrent to school gun violence, though many parents, law enforcement officials and policymakers in both parties reject the idea. “The thought of even one student being gunned down by the person responsible for educating and caring for them is just too much,” Representative Amy Mercado, a Democrat from Orlando, said during the House floor debate. She and critics decried the lack of an assault weapons ban in the bill, though supporters noted that most school shootings in the United States are committed with handguns. The online statement Petty posted on behalf of victims’ loved ones said: “We know that when it comes to preventing future acts of school violence, today’s vote is just the beginning of our journey.” Scott told reporters he would “review the bill line by line” and consult with victims’ families before deciding his position. Besides his objections to arming teachers, Scott is on record as opposed to extending Florida’s existing three-day waiting period for handgun sales to purchases of all firearms. The bill would also raise the legal age for all gun purchases to 21. The minimum age for handguns nationally is 21, but a person as young as 18 can buy a rifle in Florida. Cruz was 18 years old when he legally purchased the semiautomatic AR-15 assault-style rifle used in the Stoneman Douglas massacre, according to authorities. Slideshow (5 Images) The measure also allows police to temporarily seize guns from anyone been taken into custody for an involuntary mental examination and to seek a court order barring a person from possessing firearms if that individual is deemed dangerous because of a mental illness or violent behavior. Cruz had a history of mental issues, numerous encounters with police and was expelled from Stoneman Douglas last year for disciplinary problems, according to authorities. ||||| CLOSE The Florida Senate passed a 400 million security package that will impose longer waiting periods for gun purchases and allow some teachers and staff to carry guns in the classroom. USA TODAY House stands and applause Rep Jared Moskowitz when he asks them to stand with the Parkland families (Photo: James Call/Democrat) TALLAHASSEE — The Florida House sent the state’s first gun control measures in 22 years to Gov. Rick Scott on a 67-50 vote Wednesday. The measure that also creates a school marshal program to arm classroom teachers comes three weeks after 17 were slain at a Parkland high school. The shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School was Florida’s third mass shooting since 2016. Added to the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando in June 2016 and the Fort Lauderdale airport shooting in January 2017, 71 people have died in mass shootings. Scott said he will read the bill and talk with family members of those killed before he decides whether to sign or veto the measure. “I’m going to take the time to read the bill,” said Scott. “I have been clear. I don’t believe we should be arming teachers.” Scott wants more school resource officers instead of teachers with guns. He proposed one sucg officer under control of the local sheriff for every 1,000 students. It includes a three-day waiting period for most gun purchases, raises the minimum age to 21 to purchase a gun and gives police more authority to confiscate weapons. The Legislature lined up behind a first-in-the-nation school marshal plan that would arm teachers after a teenager used a semi-automatic rifle to hunt down 17 students and teachers at a Parkland high school three weeks ago.

Staff members could volunteer for the program, but classroom teachers who exclusively perform instruction would be blocked from the program. While Parkland parents got behind the bill, educators and teachers' unions voiced opposition to the plan. “The Leon Classroom Teachers Association does not want anyone in the schools with a weapon who is not a sworn law enforcement officer,” said Scott Mazur, LCTA President. \\"There's good and bad in this bill. I guess it comes down to morals.\\" The marshal program, which was renamed the \\"guardian program,\\" was one of three objections opponents used to try to kill the bill. Another was the House’s refusal to ban assault weapons. Others wanted to reject new restrictions on access to guns. They said they saw no need to punish law-abiding citizens for the act of a madman. Through two days of debate, the opposition refused to stand down and Wednesday some pushed for a special session to deal with school safety and guns. Democrats huddled in the morning and voted 21-9 to vote no as a caucus. Democratic Leader Janet Cruz advised the group to vote in their constituents' best interests. \\"We live in America. You are allowed to voice your opinion without political prosecution,\\" Cruz told the nine breaking from the pack. \\"No one should be bullied for their decision or their vote,\\" said Cruz.

George Moriatis, R-Fort Lauderdale. “There is always next year, members.” While the House debated the proposal, parents who lost children at Stoneman Douglas lobbied the governor, lawmakers and the media to approve the bill saying, \\"there is enough good in the middle of this bill that everyone can agree on.” More: Parkland student band performs at Carnegie Hall three weeks after shooting More: Hero student in Florida shooting rampage to sue school system “We have different opinions, different backgrounds,” said Ryan Petty, one of the 17 Stoneman Douglas families, and signed a letter backing the proposal. “(But) We came together and are united behind this legislation and our ask is the Florida House come together as the families have done and pass this bill,’’ said Petty, whose 14-year old daughter was killed in the shooting. The Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act provides: • 400 million for mental health and school safety programs • 98 million to make schools more physically secured • 87 million to establish a Safe Schools program • 69 million for mental health assistance • 25 million to replace the classroom building where the massacre occurred • 18.3 million for mobile crisis teams • 500,000 for mental health first aid training The measure also contains new gun regulations: • a minimum age of 21 to purchase a gun • a three-day waiting period for most gun purchases • easier confiscation of firearms by law enforcement in cases of threats against individuals and public safety. Throughout the day Republican supporters worked opponents on both sides of the aisle to not derail the proposal over Second Amendment concerns. “It does not infringe on your constitutional rights,” said Rep. Rick Roth, R-Loxahatchee, in a rare floor speech by the first-term legislator. “It’s better to vote yes today for something that is certain and in your hands right now,” he advised the Second Amendment advocates. “If we totally fail this year, then next year we could get something worse for you, my conservative friends, than what we have today.” More: Oregon governor signs 'boyfriend loophole' gun bill More: Florida students say hero teacher was really a 'coward' who left them to die Incoming House Speaker Jose Oliva, R-Miami, said he does not think the Legislature is done with guns and violence. “It will continue into years to come,” said Oliva Tuesday night. “This is a conversation that just started and I think you will see it spill into future sessions.” For now, all eyes are on Scott. Reporters pressed him after Wednesday’s Cabinet meeting while the debate raged in the House chambers on whether he will sign a bill that allows some teachers to carry a firearm into the classroom. In a 3-minute, 30-second exchange with reporters, Scott repeated nine times: \\"...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Today in Washington, some politicians like to suggest that the many challenges we face as a nation mean we shouldn't tackle health care reform. Nothing could be further from the truth. With more and more of America's families, businesses, and local, state and federal governments struggling with the crushing costs of health care, health care reform has never been more important. As President Obama has often said, you can't fix the economy without fixing health care. Unless we fix what is broken in our current system, everyone's health care will be in jeopardy. Health care reform is not a luxury. It is a necessity. It's important to look at the size of the problem we face and where we stand. Today, we have by far the most expensive health system in the world. We spend 50 percent more per person on health care than the average developed country, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. We spend more on health care than housing or food, the McKinsey Global Institute reported. Nearly 46 million Americans are uninsured, millions more are underinsured, and they aren't the only ones who are suffering. The high cost of care is hurting all of us. A recent study by Families USA estimates that insured families pay a hidden health tax of more than 1,000 every year. The hidden tax is the amount businesses and families with insurance have to pay in insurance premiums, taxes and donations to help cover the cost of treating uninsured Americans. Health insurance premiums for families that are covered through a job at a small business have increased 85 percent since 2000, and more small businesses are thinking about dropping health insurance benefits. Nationwide, health care costs consume 18 percent of our gross domestic product. If we continue on our current path, health care costs will consume 34 percent of our GDP by 2040, and the number of uninsured Americans will rise to 72 million, according to the Council of Economic Advisers. Even though we spend more than any other nation on health care, we aren't healthier. Only three developed countries have higher infant mortality rates. Our nation ranks 24th in life expectancy among developed countries. More than one-third of Americans are obese. These statistics are the signs of a system that is both unacceptable and unsustainable. They also show us the high cost of doing nothing. If we choose the status quo, more Americans will be uninsured, costs will continue to rise, and every American's health care will be at risk. Inaction is not an option, and reform is long overdue. The Obama administration is working to enact reform that will reduce costs for families, businesses and government; protect people's choice of doctors, hospitals and health plans; and assure affordable, quality health care for all Americans. We are guided by a simple principle: Protect what works about health care and fix what's broken, and do it in a way that does not add to the deficit. The president has already introduced proposals that will provide 950 billion over 10 years in savings to finance health care reform. Much of these resources come from wringing waste out of the current system and aggressively prosecuting fraud and abuse. We will continue to work with Congress as it explores other financing options, and the president is open to ideas about how we finance health care reform. But we are not open to deficit spending. Health care reform will be paid for, and it will be deficit-neutral over 10 years. Working together, we can pass real health care reform that gives Americans the choices they deserve and the affordable, quality coverage they need. And we know they do not want us to wait. Too many people have suffered without basic medical care or paid too much for it. For years, the American people have called on Washington to meet this challenge. They have waited long enough. The time for reform is now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kathleen Sebelius. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"Let me simplify this for you, kiddo! This article is saying that fixing health care, which means making sure everyone can afford to see a doctor and get medicine if they're sick, is a very important job. Some people in Washington, where big decisions are made, don't want to do this job because it's a really big one. But this article explains that if we don't do it, many people won't be able to afford to get better when they're sick, which could altogether make us even more sick. We already spend a lot of money on health care - more than what we spend on things like houses or food. But even though we spend so much, many people still don't have health insurance, that's like a special pass that helps you pay less when you're sick. And not having this pass means these people may not get the help they need when they're sick. Also, even the people who do have this pass are paying more money to help cover the cost for those who don't have it - this is called a hidden health tax. So, the article is saying that we need changes. People's health is super important and we should protect it. President Obama and his team are trying to make these changes to make sure everyone can have access to good health care without spending too much money. In a nutshell, this article is saying that fixing the health care system is really important because it will help ensure everyone can get medical help when they are sick, without having to worry about it costing too much.
