It is situated towards the end of a narrow strip of Italian territory lying between the Adriatic Sea and Slovenia, which lies almost immediately south and east of the city. It is also located near Croatia some further south. Trieste is located at the head of the Gulf of Trieste and throughout history it has been influenced by its location at the crossroads of Latin, Slavic, and Germanic cultures. In 2009, it had a population of about 205,000 and it is the capital of the autonomous region Friuli-Venezia Giulia and the Province of Trieste. - Croatia, officially the Republic of Croatia, is a sovereign state between Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean. Its capital city is Zagreb, which forms one of the country's primary subdivisions, along with its twenty counties. Croatia covers and has diverse, mostly continental and Mediterranean climates. Croatia's Adriatic Sea coast contains more than a thousand islands. The country's population is 4.28 million, most of whom are Croats, with the most common religious denomination being Roman Catholicism. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe.

Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate. - Winnetou is a fictional Native American hero of several novels written in German by Karl May (18421912), one of the best-selling German writers of all time with about 200 million copies worldwide, including the \\"Winnetou\\"-trilogy. - Friuli-Venezia Giulia is one of the 20 regions of Italy, and one of five autonomous regions with special statute.

A natural opening to the sea for many Central European countries, the region is traversed by the major transport routes between the east and west of southern Europe. It encompasses the historical-geographical region of Friuli and a small portion of the historical region of Venezia Giulia (known in English also as Julian March), each with its own distinct history, traditions and identity. The name of the region was spelled FriuliVenezia Giulia until 2001, when, in connection with a modification of article nr. 116 of the Italian constitution, the official spelling \\"Friuli Venezia Giulia\\" was adopted. - Friuli is an area of Northeast Italy with its own particular cultural and historical identity. It comprises the major part of the autonomous region Friuli-Venezia Giulia, i.e. the administrative provinces of Udine, Pordenone, and Gorizia, excluding Trieste. - Emona or Aemona (short for ) was a Roman castrum, settled by colonists from the northern part of Roman Italy. Emona itself was the region's easternmost city, although it was assumed formerly that it was part of the Pannonia or Illyricum, but archaeological findings from 2008 proved otherwise. It was located in the area where the navigable Ljubljanica came closest to Castle Hill. The river played an important role as a transport route for the trade between the city and the rest of Roman empire. From the late 4th to the late 6th century, Emona was the seat of a bishopric that had intensive contacts with the ecclesiastical circle of Milan, reflected in the architecture of the early Christian complex along Erjavec Street in present-day Ljubljana. - The Gulf of Trieste (, ) is a very shallow bay of the Adriatic Sea, in the extreme northern part of the Adriatic Sea. It is part of the Gulf of Venice and is shared by Italy, Slovenia and Croatia.

News article: Celebrity Justice Cuts Both Ways for Paris Hilton “She’s a pawn in a turf fight right now,” said Laurie Levenson, a law professor at Loyola Law School Los Angeles. “It backfired against her because she’s a celebrity. She got a harsher sentence because she was a celebrity. And then when her lawyer found a way out of jail, there was too much public attention for it to sit well with the court.” The struggle between the judge and the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department, which runs the jail, incited indignation far beyond the attention normally paid to a minor criminal matter. Judicial and police officials here said they were inundated with calls from outraged residents and curious news media outlets from around the country and beyond. The Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights activist, decried Ms. Hilton’s release as an example of “double standards,” saying consideration was given to a pampered rich girl that would never have been accorded an average inmate. Even the presidential candidate John Edwards found himself drawn into the debate. When asked about Ms. Hilton’s release on Thursday he said, “Without regard to Paris Hilton, we have two Americas and I think what’s important is, it’s obvious that the problem exists.” California has been struggling to comply with a federal order to ease crowding in its jails and prisons, and Sheriff Lee Baca of Los Angeles County has carried out a program of early release. But that has frustrated prosecutors who believe that early release undermines their efforts to punish those found to have broken the law. At a news conference on Friday, Sheriff Baca said: “The special treatment appears to be her celebrity status. She got more time in jail.” Under the normal terms of the early release program, he said, Ms. Hilton would not have served “any time in our jail.” The city attorney whose office prosecuted Ms. Hilton’s case, Rocky Delgadillo, said preferential treatment had led to her being sent home with an ankle bracelet. In the original order sentencing Ms. Hilton to jail, the judge had stated that Ms. Hilton would not be allowed a work furlough, work release or an electronic monitoring device in lieu of jail time. “We cannot tolerate a two-tiered jail system where the rich and powerful receive special treatment,” Mr. Delgadillo said after learning of the release. In a news conference on Friday, Mr. Baca said Ms. Hilton “had a serious medical condition,” though he declined to say what it was. In a scene that seemed a parody of O. J. Simpson’s low-speed chase more than a decade ago, news cameras on Friday followed a police cruiser containing a sobbing Ms. Hilton as it drove slowly down the Los Angeles highway to Superior Court from her home. The issue became nonstop fodder for channels like CNN and Fox News, as legal experts debated how rare the decision was to release her, and whether doing so neutralized, negated or otherwise neutered the judge’s original order. Amid the debate over serious questions of equal justice under the law came speculation over the nature of Ms. Hilton’s “medical situation,” which Mr. Baca cited as the reason for her release. On television, commentators questioned whether she was a suicide risk or if she was eating properly in jail. Judge Sauer had ordered the hearing for 9 a.m. When Ms. Hilton did not appear, apparently believing that she could participate by telephone, he sent sheriff’s deputies to escort her from her home. When she arrived and the hearing began, the judge said he had received a call on Wednesday from an undersheriff informing him that Ms. Hilton had a medical condition and that the sheriff’s office would submit papers to the judge to consider releasing her early. The judge said the papers describing a “psychological” problem had not arrived, and he interrupted Friday’s court session every few minutes to state the time and note that the papers had still not shown up. In ordering her return to jail, Judge Sauer said there were adequate medical facilities within the system to deal with Ms. Hilton’s problems. Ms. Hilton was not the only high-profile defendant whose celebrity prompted a raised eyebrow from a judge this week. Also on Friday, the judge who sentenced I. Lewis Libby Jr. to prison this week issued an order dripping with sarcasm after receiving a supporting brief from a dozen prominent legal scholars, including Alan M. Dershowitz of Harvard and Robert H. Bork, the former Supreme Court nominee. The judge, Reggie B. Walton of Federal District Court in Washington, said he would be pleased to see similar efforts for defendants less famous than Mr. Libby, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney. “The court trusts,” Judge Walton wrote, in a footnote longer than the order itself, that the brief for Mr. Libby “is a reflection of these eminent academics’ willingness in the future to step up to the plate and provide like assistance in cases involving any of the numerous litigants, both in this court and throughout the courts of our nation, who lack the financial means to fully and properly articulate the merits of their legal positions.” “The court,” he added, “will certainly not hesitate to call for such assistance from these luminaries.” Adam Liptak and Maria Newman contributed reporting from New York, and Ana Facio Contreras from Los Angeles.

There was a disagreement between the judge and the people who run the jail about whether she should be released early from jail due to a medical issue. When she was let out early, a lot of people were upset and thought it wasn't fair because regular people don't get that kind of special treatment. Eventually, the judge ordered her to go back to jail, saying that the jail could take care of her medical problem.

Vice President Cheney called Crown Prince Abdullah on July 5, 2001, to seek Saudi help in preventing threatened attacks on American facilities in the Kingdom. Secretary of State Powell met with the crown prince twice before 9/11. They discussed topics like Iraq, not al Qaeda.U.S.-Saudi relations in the summer of 2001 were marked by sometimes heated disagreements about ongoing Israeli- Palestinian violence, not about Bin Laden. The confirmation of the Pentagon's new leadership was a lengthy process. Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz was confirmed in March 2001 and Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith in July. Though the new officials were briefed about terrorism and some of the earlier planning, including that for Operation Infinite Resolve, they were focused, as Secretary Rumsfeld told us, on creating a twenty-first-century military. At the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton did not recall much interest by the new administration in military options against al Qaeda in Afghanistan. He could not recall any specific guidance on the topic from the secretary. Brian Sheridan-the outgoing assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict (SOLIC), the key counterterrorism policy office in the Pentagon-never briefed Rumsfeld. He departed on January 20; he had not been replaced by 9/11. Rumsfeld noted to us his own interest in terrorism, which came up often in his regular meetings with Tenet. He thought that the Defense Department, before 9/11, was not organized adequately or prepared to deal with new threats like terrorism. But his time was consumed with getting new officials in place and working on the foundation documents of a new defense policy, the quadrennial defense review, the defense planning guidance, and the existing contingency plans. He did not recall any particular counterterrorism issue that engaged his attention before 9/11, other than the development of the Predator unmanned aircraft system. The commander of Central Command, General Franks, told us that he did not regard the existing plans as serious. To him a real military plan to address al Qaeda would need to go all the way, following through the details of a full campaign (including the political-military issues of where operations would be based) and securing the rights to fly over neighboring countries. The draft presidential directive circulated in June 2001 began its discussion of the military by reiterating the Defense Department's lead role in protecting its forces abroad.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. Before embarking on an explaining menstruation, make a conscious effort to keep things neutral or positive. It’s important that both boys and girls see menstruation as a normal and healthy process, not something that people should be embarrassed about or feel guilt or shame from. Avoid derogatory language that makes menstruation sound negative, dirty, or unpleasant. Boys may think that the bleeding may be painful, like from a cut. Assure them that the bleeding does not hurt and is not painful. You can explain that some women experience cramps, which are muscle cramps in the body, but the pain does not come from bleeding. When talking about menstruation, communicate that menstruation is a healthy and normal part of growing up for girls. Just like boys develop facial hair and their voices change, girls start to physically change, too. Say, “Before her blood comes for the first time, a girl does not have access to her power to create a baby. When it does come, it signals her that her body is ready to have a baby. It’s exciting to have this ability. Now, whether she is ready for a baby is something else!” For young children, you can talk about how the body cleans itself. Say, “Girls’ bodies are different than boys’ bodies. A major part of the body is cleaning from the inside out, like when you go pee or poo, or when you blow your nose. When girls get older, their body starts cleaning in a new way. Sometimes girls use special things to help their bodies be clean.” Girls have different body parts than boys. You may want to define terms like “uterus,” “vagina,” or “pregnancy.” Say, “These are all body parts that girls have that boys do not have. Uterus is a big word that means where a baby grows. Vagina is a word that tells us where babies leave the body, or where blood leaves if there is no baby. Pregnancy is what happens when a baby is growing inside a woman.” You can say, “Women and girls have different body parts than boys. This is because women can grow babies in their bodies and men cannot. These are the things that women have that men don’t.” With older boys, you may want to introduce common terminology related to women’s cycles. Clearly explain any newly introduced terminology. Some things you may want to explain include the words “period,” “menstruation,” or “cycle.” You may also want to include slang terms, like “time of the month,” “Aunt Flo,” or “moon/moon cycle,” as these terms may come up at school or within the boy’s social network. Keep your answers simple. If explaining the word period, say, “A period is something at the end of a sentence. But it can also mean the time each month when a woman’s body cleans itself from the inside out. It’s a word that sums up a process that happens in a woman’s body.” Clearly communicate that there is nothing “wrong” with menstruation blood. It is not embarrassing, gross, or shameful. It doesn’t make a girl “dirty.” If your boys know that a girl is menstruating, tell them to treat her with respect and not to tease her or make her feel bad. Say, “If you notice a girl has her period or has blood on her clothes, it’s important to treat her with respect. It’s not okay to tease her or make fun of her. Don’t say anything hurtful to her or anyone else. Remember that it’s normal to have a period.” Make sure they know that menstruation is totally normal and healthy.

Article: Many health experts in the US and Australia recommend avoiding this method, since harmful bacteria on the shell could get in contact with the egg. The risk of contamination is much lower in the EU, which has a very effective anti-salmonella program. If you're concerned about the risk, use one of the other methods instead. Cooking yolks or whites until firm makes them much safer. If you plan to serve the eggs runny or raw, consider another separation method. Room temperature eggs have runnier whites, which can make this method messy and difficult. Work with eggs straight from the fridge instead. This is where you want to make the cleanest crack you can manage. The key with this method is to crack the egg evenly, so you can easily transfer the yolk between the two halves. Tap the center of the egg gently against a hard object, so a crack forms across about half of the egg. The edge of a bowl is a good surface for getting two equal halves. The edge can also break off shell fragments into your white, though, so a flat counter might be better if your eggs have thin shells. Hold the egg over a bowl in both hands with the crack facing upward and the wide end tilted down. Slowly pull apart the two halves with your thumbs, until the egg breaks into two halves. Because the egg is tilted, the yolk should fall into the lower half. \\"Pour\\" the intact yolk back and forth between the two halves of the shell. Repeat this about three times, while the white drips over the side of the shell and into the bowl below. Drop the yolk in another bowl once there are only tiny bits of white stuck to it. If you have more eggs to separate, consider using a third bowl, so a messy crack doesn't drop shell shards or broken yolk into your whites. Separate each egg over this third bowl, then empty the bowl into the other whites bowl before you move on to the next.

This bank was like a giant money box, where people could keep their money safe, borrow money, and get help making more money. Now, you see, making and managing people's money is not an easy job. Sometimes a bank has to figure out that it needs to become even better at helping its customers. So one day, Deutsche Bank decided they wanted to make some changes in the way they did things. Deutsche Bank realized they wanted to focus on two very important things: wealth management and investment banking. Wealth management is like being a money doctor. It helps people take care of their money, make it grow, and plan for their future, like building a house or going to school. Investment banking is like being a money scientist. It helps businesses grow by finding creative ways to get them the money they need and giving them advice. To make these changes, Deutsche Bank made a plan. They wanted to be one of the top money doctors and money scientists in the world. So they started working very hard, like you do when you practice your sports or hobbies, to become better and better at wealth management and investment banking every day. They also wanted to make sure that when they helped people, they did it in a way that was good for everybody. So they made a promise to themselves, that when they helped people, they would also think about things like taking care of the earth, being kind to animals, and helping people who don't have much money. And so, little by little, Deutsche Bank started to change. They got really focused on becoming a great money doctor and money scientist. They even hired some new people who were very good at these jobs and let some others go who were not as good. Now, because they were so focused, people started to notice. The customers of Deutsche Bank were happy with the changes and trust them even more to help them with their money. The people in the bank were excited because they were becoming better at their jobs. And the big boss of the bank, called the CEO, was very proud of all the hard work everyone was doing. And so, as Deutsche Bank keeps working hard, they hope to continue to get better and better at helping people with their money in a way that is good for everyone.

Review: How can we believe any of the material we read in this book when the author does not even know the proper name for the PERSIAN Gulf in the map of Mesopotamia!!!! Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","completion":"The product review in question does convey a negative sentiment towards the book. The reviewer expresses their frustration and disbelief regarding the accuracy and credibility of the content in the book, primarily due to the author's alleged mistake in the naming of the Persian Gulf in a map of Mesopotamia. As a result, the reviewer casts doubt on the overall reliability of the book and implies that this error may be indicative of deeper inaccuracies or flaws in the research and presentation of information. To analyze the review further, two primary areas of concern can be identified that contribute to the negative sentiment: 1. Doubt on the reliability of the content: The reviewer raises the question, \\"How can we believe any of the material we read in this book when the author does not even know the proper name for the PERSIAN Gulf in the map of Mesopotamia?\\" This rhetorical question suggests the reader's disappointment and skepticism regarding the book's content. The presence of errors, such as the incorrect naming of geographical entities, could diminish the reader's trust in the information and, consequently, the quality of the book. 2. The implication that this error may signify larger problems: By pointing out a specific error in the book, the reviewer implies that there may be other mistakes as well. This creates an overarching sense of doubt and suspicion about the research and presentation of information throughout the book. Readers are left with the impression that if the author failed to correctly convey fundamental details, it is possible that other points or statements may be similarly false or misleading. In conclusion, the product review exhibits a negative sentiment by expressing concerns about the credibility and reliability of the book. The reviewer's critique stems from their frustration with a particular error, which subsequently casts doubt on the entirety of the book. This skepticism undermines the overall quality and trustworthiness of the information contained within its pages, resulting in a negative opinion of the book by the reviewer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this case, the tweet is positive because it talks about a beautiful sunny day, feeling happy, and being grateful. These words and feelings are all good and happy things. The other option, negative, would have been a tweet that had bad or unhappy feelings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Step 1: Sunlight hits chloroplasts in the plant - This is the initial step where the plant captures energy from sunlight which is required for photosynthesis. Step 2: The energy from the sunlight causes an enzyme in the plant to break apart the water - Light energy is used to break water molecules into its components - oxygen, hydrogen, and electrons. This process is called photolysis. Step 3: The water breaks into oxygen, hydrogen, and electrons - As a result of photolysis, water molecules break down into oxygen gas, which is released as a byproduct, and hydrogen ions and electrons which will be used in the next steps of the process. Step 4: Hydrogen, along with electrons energized by light, converts NADP into NADPH - The hydrogen ions and energized electrons from the previous step are used to convert NADP+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) into NADPH (reduced form of NADP+). NADPH stores energy and will be used in the next steps of photosynthesis. Final step: Production of glucose and oxygen through the Calvin cycle - The generated NADPH, along with another molecule called ATP (adenosine triphosphate) produced in the photosynthesis process, are used in the Calvin cycle to fix carbon dioxide into glucose. The glucose can then be used by the plant for energy and growth, while oxygen is released as a byproduct. In conclusion, the final step of this process is the Calvin cycle, which results in the production of glucose and oxygen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When you are in a dark environment like a movie theater, your eyes need to adjust to the low light conditions. This happens through a few key steps: Step 1: Pupil dilation To adapt to the low light levels, the pupils of your eyes dilate (widen) to allow more light to enter. This helps you see better in the dark. Step 2: Activation of rods The retina contains two types of photoreceptor cells, rods and cones. Rods are responsible for vision in low light conditions. During the time spent in the dark theater, rods become more active, further enhancing your ability to see in the darkness. Step 3: Regeneration of rhodopsin Rhodopsin, also known as visual purple, is a light-sensitive pigment found in the rods. In dark conditions, rhodopsin levels increase, aiding in night vision. When you exit the movie theater into bright sunlight, your eyes need to readjust to the higher light levels. This process also involves several steps: Step 1: Pupil constriction As the intense light hits your eyes, the pupils constrict (narrow) to limit the amount of light entering the eyes. This constriction happens quickly, but it takes a few moments to reach its peak. Step 2: Deactivation of rods The cones, which are responsible for color vision and work best in bright light, become more active as they are better suited to detect higher light levels. The rods, being more sensitive to dim light, decrease their activity. Step 3: Rhodopsin breakdown The bright light causes the rhodopsin in the rods to break down, reducing their sensitivity to light. This results in the feeling of being momentarily \\"blinded\\" or overwhelmed by the brightness. Step 4: Adjustment period As your eyes adapt to the bright light, the temporary sensation of being blinded subsides. The adjustment period varies depending on the individual and the difference in light levels, but it usually takes a few minutes for your eyes to fully adapt. In conclusion, when you exit a dark film theater, the world appears too bright initially because your eyes have become more sensitive to darkness and need to readjust to the sudden increase in light levels through a series of physiological changes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Not a little bigger. Not even a lot bigger. They have _ gigantically, scientists now conclude. Their new finding lends support for something known as \\"Cope's rule.\\" It holds that animals tend to evolve into species that are much larger than their distant ancestors. This hypothesis takes its name from the 19thcentury paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope. While studying fossils , he was the first to notice this trend. Noel Heim is a paleontologist at Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif. He also is a co-author of the new study. His team compared the body size of animals between the Cambrian Period and modern times. This was a span of 542 million years. The animals studied included species from more than 17,000 genera. They ranged from ancient trilobites, plesiosaurs (extinct reptiles with a long neck and flippers) and many less familiar creatures to today's whales and clams. Ocean animals today are an average of 150 times larger than they were during the Cambrian, Heim's group reports. The smallest animals alive today -- tiny crustaceans called ostracods -- are only about one-tenth the size of the Cambrian's tiniest animals. But today's largest ocean animals -- whales -- are more than 100,000 times bigger than the biggest in the Cambrian. \\"Classes of animals that were already big ... tended to live longer,\\" Heim says. They also tended to change more than classes of animals that were small did. The size gains in ocean animals are much larger than would be expected by chance, saysJonathan Payne. He's a co-author who also works at Stanford. The scientists don't know what drives the trend. One possibility is an arms race between predators and prey. The idea here is that larger animals are less likely to become some other animals' meal. Another possibility has to do with oxygen. Land animals evolved from species that started in the ocean. Some of these land animals eventually returned to the ocean. And they kept the ability to breathe... The ocean animals' change in size _ .

Michael Pearson, who will stay as chief executive until a replacement is found, said Valeant was still a \\"strong and resilient company\\". However, Valeant's former finance chief has declined to resign as a director. Shares in Valeant jumped 11% in early trading after heavy losses last week, driven by fears of a default. Valeant chairman Robert Ingram said: \\"While the past few months have been difficult, Valeant has a collection of leading brands, valuable franchises and great people, and I am confident that the company will be able to rebuild its reputation and thrive under new leadership.\\" Activist investor Bill Ackman, who has a 9% stake in Valeant, has been appointed to the board. Former chief financial officer Howard Schiller declined a request to step down from the board, meaning Katharine Stevenson voluntarily resigned instead to make space for Mr Ackman, the company said. Valeant added that Mr Schiller had contributed to the \\"mis-statement\\" of company results in 2014 and early 2015. However, Mr Schiller said: \\"As a result of the fact that I did not engage in any improper conduct regarding this proposed restatement [of results], I have respectfully declined the request from the company's board to resign from the board.\\" Bill Ackman, 48, the newest member of Valeant's board, is one of the world's most well-known activist hedge fund managers, and has been an outspoken supporter throughout the company's turmoil. Mr Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square owns 9% of Valeant shares, making it the company's second largest investor. Last week, when the possibility that Valeant would default on its bonds was raised, Mr Ackman wasted no time reassuring Pershing Square investors that the drug company was still a good bet. In a letter he wrote that it was \\"highly likely\\" that banks would grant Valeant a waiver for missing the deadline to file financial information. Without that waiver Valeant could have entered a default on its loans. \\"[Mr Ackman] has put his credibility on the line and it could make or break him,\\" Aswath Damodaran a professor of finance at New York University, told the BBC. \\"The markets are going to decide [Valeant's] value- his words could initially stem the problem, but they don't mean as much now,\\" said Mr Damodaran. Mr Ackman's support for Valeant is not new. He teamed up with the drug maker in 2014 to make a bid for Botox-maker Allergan. In a controversial move Mr Ackman bought shares in both companies in an attempt to arrange the tie-up. He agreed to pay Valeant 15% of any profit made if Allergan was bought by a third party- which it eventually was. Allergan's board rejected several offers by Valeant and was eventually purchased by Actavis for 66bn (Â£46bn). Mr Ackman is no stranger to public corporate disputes. He has spent 1bn betting against nutritional supplement brand Herbalife, and encouraged regulators to investigate its board. Mr Ackman has not reserved his insults for the company. He verbally spared with activist investors Carl Icahn and Daniel Lobe over Herbalife. During a televised interview on CNBC Mr Ackman said Mr Icahn was being dishonest with investors, while Mr Icahn accused Mr Ackman of being a \\"cry-baby in the schoolyard\\". The two had a public reconciliation in 2014. Valeant shares more than halved last week after it lowered revenue forecasts and said that delays in filing its annual results could result in a notice of default. The firm is also facing an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into its relationship with pharmacy Philidor, and an investigation by the US Congress into its drug pricing.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Hine ( or Hinay or \`\` Hineih '' ) Mah Tov is a Jewish hymn traditionally sung at Shabbat feasts . - Sabbath is a day set aside for rest and worship. According to the Sabbath is commanded by God to be kept as a holy day of rest, as God rested from creation. It is observed differently among the Abrahamic religions and informs a similar occasion in several other practices. Although many viewpoints and definitions have arisen over the millennia, most originate in the same textual tradition of: \\"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy\\". - Judaism (from , derived from Greek , originally from Hebrew , \\"Yehudah\\", \\"Judah\\"; in Hebrew: , \\"Yahadut\\", the distinctive characteristics of the Judean ethnos) encompasses the religion, philosophy, culture and way of life of the Jewish people. Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion, with the Torah as its foundational text (part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible), and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenantal relationship that God established with the Children of Israel. With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide, Judaism is the tenth-largest religion in the world. - The Exodus (from Greek \\"exodos\\", \\"going out\\") is the founding, or etiological, myth of Israel; its message is that the Israelites were delivered from slavery by Yahweh and therefore belong to him through the Mosaic covenant. It tells of the enslavement of the Israelites in Egypt following the death of Joseph, their departure under the leadership of Moses, the revelations at Sinai (including the Ten Commandments), and their wanderings in the wilderness up to the borders of Canaan. The exodus story is told in the books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, and their overall intent was to demonstrate God's actions in history, to recall Israel's bondage and salvation, and to demonstrate the fulfillment of Israel's covenant. - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\". - Shabbat (\\"rest\\" or \\"cessation\\") or Shabbos or the Sabbath is Judaism's day of rest and seventh day of the week, on which religious Jews and certain Christians (such as Seventh-day Adventists and Seventh Day Baptists) remember the Biblical creation of the heavens and the earth in six days and the Exodus of the Hebrews, and look forward to a future Messianic Age. Shabbat observance entails refraining from work activities, often with great rigor, and engaging in restful activities to honor the day. Judaism's traditional position is that unbroken seventh-day Shabbat originated among the Jewish people, as their first and most sacred institution, though some suggest other origins. Variations upon Shabbat are widespread in Judaism and, with adaptations, throughout the Abrahamic and many other religions. - The Messianic Age is a theological term referring to a future time of universal peace and brotherhood on the earth, without crime, war and poverty. Many Abrahamic religions believe that there will be such an age; some refer to it as the consummate \\"kingdom of God\\", \\"paradise\\", Peaceable Kingdom, or the \\"world to come\\".

Information: - A reciprocating engine, also often known as a piston engine, is a heat engine (usually, although there are also pneumatic and hydraulic reciprocating engines) that uses one or more reciprocating pistons to convert pressure into a rotating motion. This article describes the common features of all types. The main types are: the internal combustion engine, used extensively in motor vehicles; the steam engine, the mainstay of the Industrial Revolution; and the niche application Stirling engine. Internal Combustion engines are further classified in two ways: either a spark-ignition (SI) engine, where the spark plug initiates the combustion; or a compression-ignition (CI) engine, where the air within the cylinder is compressed, thus heating it, so that the heated air ignites fuel that is injected then or earlier. - A V engine, or Vee engine is a common configuration for an internal combustion engine. The cylinders and pistons are aligned, in two separate planes or 'banks', so that they appear to be in a \\"V\\" when viewed along the axis of the crankshaft. The Vee configuration generally reduces the overall engine length, height and weight compared to an equivalent inline configuration. - A V8 engine is an eight-cylinder V configuration engine with the cylinders mounted on the crankcase in two sets (or banks) of four, with all eight pistons driving a common crankshaft. Most banks are set at a right angle (90°) to each other, some at a narrower angle, with 45°, 60°, and 72° most common. - A W8 engine is an eight - cylinder piston internal combustion engine in a W configuration . The W8 can be imagined as flat plane crank V8 engine combining two narrow - angle ( 15 degree ) VR4 engine blocks , mounted juxtaposed at 72 degrees to each other and coupled to one crankshaft . Nearly square external dimensions mean the large eight - cylinder engine will fit in the space typically taken by a V6 engine . - Front-wheel drive (FWD) is a form of engine and transmission layout used in motor vehicles, where the engine drives the front wheels only. Most modern front-wheel-drive vehicles feature a transverse engine, rather than the conventional longitudinal engine arrangement generally found in rear-wheel-drive and four-wheel drive vehicles. - A V6 engine is a V engine with six cylinders mounted on the crankshaft in two banks of three cylinders, usually set at either a 60 or 90 degree angle to each other. The V6 is one of the most compact engine configurations, usually ranging from 2.0 L to 4.3 L displacement (however, much larger examples have been produced for use in trucks), shorter than the inline 4 and more compact than the V8 engine. Because of its short length, the V6 fits well in the widely used transverse engine front-wheel drive layout. It is becoming more common as the space allowed for engines in modern cars is reduced at the same time as power requirements increase, and has largely replaced the inline 6, which is nearly twice as long - too long to fit in many modern engine compartments - and the V8, which is larger, more expensive, and has poorer fuel economy. The V6 engine has become widely adopted for medium-sized cars, often as an optional engine where an inline 4 is standard, or as a standard engine where a V8 is a higher-cost performance option. - In a reciprocating engine, the crankpins, also known as crank journals are the journals of the big end bearings, at the ends of the connecting rods opposite to the pistons. - A crankshaftrelated to \\"crank\\"is a mechanical part able to perform a conversion between reciprocating motion and rotational motion. In a reciprocating engine, it translates reciprocating motion of the piston into rotational motion; whereas in a reciprocating compressor, it converts the rotational motion into reciprocating motion. In order to do the conversion between two motions, the crankshaft has \\"crank throws\\" or \\"crankpins\\", additional bearing surfaces whose axis is offset from that of the crank, to which the \\"big ends\\" of the connecting rods from each cylinder attach. - A transverse engine is an engine mounted in a vehicle so that the engine's crankshaft axis is perpendicular to the long axis of the vehicle. Many modern front wheel drive vehicles use this engine mounting configuration. (Most rear wheel drive vehicles use a longitudinal engine configuration, where the engine's crankshaft axis is parallel to the long axis of the vehicle, except for some rear-mid engine vehicles, which use a transverse engine and transaxle mounted in the rear instead of the front.) - In an internal combustion engine of the reciprocating type, the crankcase is the housing for the crankshaft. The enclosure forms the largest cavity in the engine and is located below the cylinder(s), which in a multicylinder engine is usually integrated into one or several cylinder blocks. Crankcases have often been discrete parts, but more often they are integral with the cylinder bank(s), forming an engine block. Nevertheless, the area around the crankshaft is still usually called the crankcase. Crankcases and other basic engine structural components (e.g., cylinders, cylinder blocks, cylinder heads, and integrated combinations thereof) are typically made of cast iron or cast aluminium via sand casting. Today the foundry processes are usually highly automated, with a few skilled workers to manage the casting of thousands of parts. - A piston is a component of reciprocating engines, reciprocating pumps, gas compressors and pneumatic cylinders, among other similar mechanisms. It is the moving component that is contained by a cylinder and is made gas-tight by piston rings. In an engine, its purpose is to transfer force from expanding gas in the cylinder to the crankshaft via a piston rod and/or connecting rod. In a pump, the function is reversed and force is transferred from the crankshaft to the piston for the purpose of compressing or ejecting the fluid in the cylinder. In some engines, the piston also acts as a valve by covering and uncovering ports in the cylinder wall. The petrol enters inside the cylinder and the piston moves upwards and the spark plug produces spark and the petrol is set on fire and it produces an energy that pushes the piston downwards. - In a reciprocating piston engine, the connecting rod or conrod connects the piston to the crank or crankshaft. Together with the crank, they form a simple mechanism that converts reciprocating motion into rotating motion. - Reciprocating motion, also called reciprocation, is a repetitive up-and-down or back-and-forth linear motion. It is found in a wide range of mechanisms, including reciprocating engines and pumps. The two opposite motions that comprise a single reciprocation cycle are called strokes.

Process: - The nuclei of some atoms have too few or too many neutrons - The atoms become unstable - The atoms split - In alpha decay, two protons and two neutrons are released from the atom - In beta decay, a neutron changes into a proton and an electron - The proton joins the nucleus of the atom - The electron is released - Question: suppose the atoms are more stable happens, how will it affect LESS radioactive decay occurring. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"To answer this question, we'll first summarize the information given and then analyze the influence of more stable atoms on radioactive decay and the second effect mentioned (beta decay). 1. Some atoms have unstable nuclei due to an improper number of neutrons. 2. These unstable atoms can undergo radioactive decay through processes like alpha decay and beta decay. 3. Alpha decay involves the release of two protons and two neutrons from the atom. 4. Beta decay involves a neutron changing into a proton and an electron, where the proton joins the nucleus of the atom and the electron is released. Now, let's examine the situation where the atoms become more stable. If the atoms are more stable, this means that their nuclei are less likely to decay due to having more stable neutron to proton ratios. Therefore, this would result in less radioactive decay occurring. As for the second effect mentioned (beta decay), since the atoms are more stable, there will be fewer instances where a neutron needs to change into a proton and emit an electron for the atom's nucleus to become stable. This would lead to less beta decay occurring as well. The answer to this question is: less."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Article: High in the sky, a group of birds fly past. The 5-foot-tall creatures are whooping cranes, the tallest birds in North America noted for its loud call. The wild animals appear to be following much larger birds. But those aren't birds at all. They are three-wheeled aircraft called trikes , and the pilots flying them are wearing white helmets and white gowns. That plan might sound like a stupid idea, but it's not. The pilots are from an organization called Operation Migration. They are helping the whooping cranes learn to migrate, or move from one area to another when the seasons change. The cranes are endangered. In 1941,the species had dwindled to roughly 20 birds because of hunting and habitat loss. US wildlife officials counted 149 whooping cranes in November 1995,the most since the American government began taking censuses in the 1930s.Today,about 380 remain. In the fall, whooping cranes are supposed to migrate south. However, many of them don't know how. \\"With so few birds left, young whooping cranes typically don't have parents around to teach them,\\" explains pilot Joe Duff. That's where the trikes come in. Each October, pilots dress up as whooping cranes and take to the skies in Wisconsin. The young birds follow them because they think the trikes are big whooping cranes. It takes about three months to reach south--with plenty of rest stops on the way. The pilots lead the cranes to refuges, or protected areas, in Florida. This spring, the birds will migrate north by themselves--no trikes needed! \\"It's nice because you know the birds are going to make it,\\" Duff told WR News.

Literary career During the war Camus joined the French Resistance cell Combat, which published an underground newspaper of the same name. This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the nom de guerre Beauchard. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, The Flies, in June 1943. When the Ailies liberated Paris in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. He resigned from Combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned left, politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre. In 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published The Rebel, a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays. Camus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in The Myth of Sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works, such as The Stranger and The Plague.

Nigella Lawson was effectively put on trial without a lawyer, her furious brother claims today. The TV cook was falsely portrayed as 'permanently drug-dazed' and 'addled by narcotics', Dominic Lawson says. The court did not let her present evidence to defend herself, treating her instead as an 'object to be paraded and tormented during ten hours of cross-examination as a key prosecution witness. Bond: Nigella Lawson and brother Dominic Lawson arriving at Isleworth Crown Court, west London. Writing in today's Daily Mail, Mr Lawson likens her treatment to the burning of heretics in the Spanish Inquisition and warns that the 'vicious' treatment of prosecution witnesses is a threat to British justice because it could deter future witnesses from giving evidence. He says his sister was 'heroic' in the face of such treatment but that the circus surrounding the fraud trial of her former aides has left the public under the impression she was the defendant. Yesterday defence minister Anna Soubry told the BBC it was 'disgraceful' that the allegations and the collapse of Miss Lawson's marriage to advertising guru Charles Saatchi were played out in a courtroom. 'Nigella Lawson quite properly complains that she feels that she's on trial,' said the Tory MP. 'I just find it utterly appalling.' Lawyers for Miss Lawson's former housekeepers Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo questioned the 53-year-old about her drug use in an attempt to show she sanctioned the sisters' £685,000 spending in return for their silence. Miss Lawson admitted taking cocaine seven times. She admitted she had also smoked cannabis during the collapse of her 'doomed' marriage but insisted she was not a long-term or habitual user. She said she had been drug free since leaving the relationship. Sisters Elisabetta (left) and Francesca Grillo, the two former personal assistants cleared of defrauding Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi. Giving evidence at Isleworth Crown Court in West London, Miss Lawson said she had faced 'a long summer of bullying and abuse' which she said had been 'dedicated to salvaging Mr Saatchi's reputation and savaging mine'. As her two former housekeepers were acquitted of a £685,000 card fraud, Miss Lawson said she had been 'vilified' by the court process despite having done all she could to alert the Crown Prosecution Service to a 'sustained background campaign deliberately designed to destroy my reputation'. She said she had been made to feel she was on trial without any legal protection or representation, adding: 'I did my civic duty, only to be maliciously vilified without the right to respond.' 'On trial': Nigella Lawson arriving at Isleworth Crown Court in London where she gave evidence in the trial of two former personal assistants who worked for her and Charles Saatchi. Charles Saatchi being protected by security at Isleworth Crown Court. Her brother says she was given no advice or support by the CPS and – as a witness and not a defendant – was not entitled to a lawyer to represent her. Mr Lawson writes: 'I would say that her conduct in the witness box was heroic. It was especially heroic given the way what was meant to be a formal examination of transactions by two employees had turned into a media circus – or rather an auto da fe – with this prosecution witness as the object to be paraded and tormented.' He adds: 'The process of justice is seriously damaged if the system makes testifying intolerable for prosecution witnesses.' Mr Lawson's warning follows several high-profile trials which have raised questions about the treatment of prosecution witnesses, including violinist Frances Andrade who committed suicide after giving evidence against a teacher who sexually abused her as a child. The parents of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler also faced detailed questions about their private lives from a lawyer representing her killer Levi Bellfield during his trial. Miss Soubry said it was 'disgraceful' that the collapse of a marriage should have played out in a courtroom and took aim at Charles Saatchi, saying the saga began with the 'Throttlegate' photographs of him grabbing Miss Lawson by the throat at a Mayfair restaurant. 'The whole thing is disgraceful. I think we're beginning to lose the plot in this country,' she said. 'This started with an unfortunate divorce. It started with a photograph of her being assaulted by her husband. So out in public was played what should have been a very private and very distressing moment. 'As a result of that they became divorced. These criminal proceedings had already begun, back in 2012.' Highlights:","completion":"1.

This river is next to Hilda's farm that she has lived on for decades. Ever since she was a child, she was taught that it's important to dump excess fertilizer into the river. So, that's what she does whenever she has leftover fertilizer she isn't going to use. The Dundrin Ocean is connected to many rivers. However, these rivers are located primarily in uninhabited and natural areas of the world. There is one farm near the Dundrin, though, which is owned by Luke. Luke never disposes of any of his garbage in the ocean or rivers near his farm, and he chooses instead to store excess fertilizer for the future or properly dispose of his trash. Who is causing more marine pollution? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Hilda is causing more marine pollution. Hilda disposes of her excess fertilizer into the river that is connected to the Malegese Ocean. When excess fertilizers are dumped into a body of water, they can cause nutrient pollution. These nutrients can create an excess of algae that sucks up oxygen in the water and creates dead zones where marine life cannot survive, harming aquatic habitats and ecosystems. The result is marine pollution. On the other hand, Luke, who owns a farm near the Dundrin Ocean, does not dispose of his garbage in the ocean or rivers. Instead, he stores excess fertilizer for future use or disposes of his trash properly. This suggests that he is not contributing to marine pollution to the same degree as Hilda.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The Crusader army under Goffredo is laying siege to Jerusalem, where the Saracen king Argante is confined with his troops. With Goffredo are his brother Eustazio, his daughter Almirena, and the knight Rinaldo. As Goffredo sings of the coming victory, Rinaldo declares his love for Almirena, and Goffredo confirms that she will be Rinaldo's bride when Jerusalem falls. Almirena urges Rinaldo to fight boldly and assure victory. As she departs, a herald announces the approach of Argante from the city. Eustazio surmises that the king fears defeat; this seems to be confirmed when Argante, after a grandiose entrance, requests a three-day truce to which Goffredo graciously assents. After Goffredo leaves, Argante ponders his love for Armida, the Queen of Damascus who is also a powerful sorceress, and considers the help her powers might bring him. As he muses, Armida arrives from the sky in a fiery chariot. She has divined that the Saracens' only chance of victory lies in vanquishing Rinaldo, and has the power, she claims, to achieve this. The scene changes to a garden, with fountains and birds, where Rinaldo and Almirena are celebrating their love. They are interrupted as Armida appears, and wrests Almirena from Rinaldo's embrace. Rinaldo draws his sword to defend his lover, but a black cloud descends to envelop Armida and Almirena, and they are borne away. Rinaldo mourns the loss of his loved one.

(CNN) -- Declaring 2010 \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history,\\" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf.

Complete the next sentence: How to efficiently heat a room Replace old or damaged weatherstripping on the doors and windows. Buy a new roll of weatherstripping at your local hardware store. Install it in the gaps around any doors and windows in the room to prevent heat from escaping and cold air from coming in. Pick from: (I) Just pull off the old or damaged weatherstripping and apply the new roll using the adhesive that comes on the strips. Raise the door thresholds if they're adjustable.; (II) Continue to install weatherstripping in the spaces under window coverings, to help prevent heat from escaping. Replace any parts that are missing or forgotten during the heating process.; (III) Install heaters on the ceiling and along the walls. Heat can flow from deeper and colder places, so buy a power source for heating a room without heaters before you place it in and on your windows.; (IV) Leave it on during one to two days of heating, then take it off and replace it in the morning when the temperature is between 70 and 80 degrees fahrenheit (16-27 degrees celsius). Use rubber gaskets around windows and windows when installing weatherstripping.; The answer is:","completion":"(I) Just pull off the old or damaged weatherstripping and apply the new roll using the adhesive that comes on the strips. Raise the door thresholds if they're adjustable. To efficiently heat a room, it's crucial to maintain the existing warmth and prevent any further heat loss. One essential way to do this is by replacing the old or damaged weatherstripping around your doors and windows. You can easily buy a new roll of weatherstripping at your local hardware store and install it yourself. Here's how: - First, pull off the old or damaged weatherstripping. Over time, weatherstripping can become worn down or damaged, reducing its efficiency in keeping out drafts. Therefore, removal of the old material is a necessary first step. - Next, apply the new weatherstripping. Most types of weatherstripping come with adhesive on one side, which makes the application process easy. Simply cut a piece of weatherstripping to match the length of the gap, remove the backing paper from the adhesive side, and apply it to the gap. Press firmly to make sure the weatherstripping adheres properly. - It would also be helpful to raise the door thresholds if they're adjustable. Gaps under doors can act as conduits for cold air to seep into your room and for warm air to escape. By raising the thresholds under your doors, you can minimize these drafts, contributing to a warmer room. Completing these simple steps can help to efficiently heat a room by minimizing heat loss. Remember, every little step that reduces drafts and insulates your room can make a big difference to the overall warmth of the room and the efficiency of your heating system. Contrary to option (III), installing heaters on the ceiling and along the walls as a primary method of heating a room isn't usually the most efficient solution. While heaters can help to directly add heat to a room, they can be costly to run and don't address the root issue of heat loss through gaps and poor insulation. Moreover, options (II) and (IV) also might not be the best added steps in this context. Under window coverings are typically not the main culprit for heat loss in a room unless they are poorly fitted, so focusing on that might divert the attention from effective solutions. Also, using heating equipment intermittently or applying weatherstripping when the temperature is specific is not as effective as using these properly on a regular basis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this case, the context provides information about the location of Capriole Goat Cheese, stating that it is in Greenville, Indiana. Step 2: Determine whether the context supports the hypothesis. Justification: Now that we know the location of Capriole Goat Cheese, we can evaluate whether the hypothesis aligns with the context. The hypothesis claims that Capriole is the oldest and most award-winning cheese producer in the UK. However, the context states that Capriole is in the United States, not the UK. Step 3: Reject the hypothesis due to discrepancies between the hypothesis and the context. Justification: Since the context does not support the hypothesis because of the location discrepancy, we must reject the hypothesis that Capriole is the oldest and most award-winning cheese producer in the UK. Instead, we can form a new hypothesis based on the context: Capriole is one of the oldest and most award-winning goat cheese producers in the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Vicar and choir enter the Church for evening prayer and song, during which time the love of Dr. Jekyll for Alice, the Vicar's daughter, is presented in a pathetic manner. Then comes the transformation of the moral and physical character of Dr. Jekyll from the admirable gentleman and scholar to the ferocious brute of a maniac known as Mr. Hyde. He is irresistibly addicted to a drink of his own mixture, one of his medical discoveries. It sets him wild and his other self reigns supreme. This change is remarkably characterized and displayed with a dramatic ability almost beyond conception. He attacks his sweetheart. her father, the Vicar of the Church, approaches and interferes. With fiendish glee and demon strength, Hyde kills the Vicar, disappears, and the next moment is seen as Dr. Jekyll. Act II. In the office of Mr. Utterson, a lawyer in Chancery Lane. Although counsel for Dr. Jekyll, Utterson's suspicions are aroused as to his guilt. Dr. Jekyll visits the lawyer's office.

Question: Does Obree ever hold a world record? Movie title: The Flying Scotsman Movie plot: The film starts with Graeme Obree (Miller), who suffers from crippling bipolar disorder, cycling into a wood where he prepares to hang himself. A flashback to Obree's (Sean Brown) childhood depicts him being physically attacked at school by other pupils, leaving severe psychological scars. One day Obree is given a bicycle by his parents and we see Obree evading the bullies on his bike. The adult Obree is married with a child. While competing in local races, he runs a failing cycle shop and has to supplement his income as a bicycle courier. Baxter (Cox), a boatyard owner who is (unbeknownst to Obree) a minister, befriends the atheist Obree. Obree decides to try and beat the hour record. He has neither the funding nor the quality of bicycle required. Determined to succeed, he constructs \\"Old Faithful\\", a revolutionary bicycle designed by Obree for maximum efficiency, made up from scrap metal and components from a washing machine. With help from his friend and manager Malky McGovern (Boyd), Obree plans to break the world record in Norway. His first attempt is a failure, but he tries again the following morning and succeeds. His victory is short-lived, and his record is broken by Chris Boardman (Adrian Grove (credited as Adrian Smith)) a week later. The Union Cycliste Internationale changes the rules to discourage Obree from using his experimental bicycle. Obree is severely depressed the night following his record-making ride. This is exacerbated when Boardman breaks the record. When Obree is confronted in a pub by the four bullies who had victimised him years earlier at school, he becomes completely withdrawn and rarely leaves his house. Baxter attempts to counsel him, but Obree feels betrayed when he discovers that Baxter is the pastor of a local church. He recovers enough to compete in the Individual Pursuit World Championship in 1993, in which he uses his bicycle design again. The UCI officials begin rigorously enforcing the new ruling, penalizing him for riding in the stance that his bicycle design is... Answer:","completion":"Yes, Graeme Obree, the protagonist in the movie \\"The Flying Scotsman,\\" does hold world records during his cycling career. The film is based on the true story of Obree, a Scottish cyclist known for his innovative approach to the sport and his struggles with bipolar disorder. In the movie, Obree constructs a revolutionary bicycle called \\"Old Faithful\\" using scrap metal and components from a washing machine. With this bicycle, he attempts to break the hour record, which is a measure of how far a cyclist can travel in one hour. His first attempt in Norway is unsuccessful, but he manages to break the record the following morning. However, Chris Boardman, another cyclist, breaks Obree's record just a week later. The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) changes the rules to discourage Obree from using his experimental bicycle, but despite these setbacks and his struggles with mental health, Obree is able to compete in the Individual Pursuit World Championship in 1993. He continues to use his innovative bicycle design and riding stance, which leads the UCI to rigorously enforce new rulings against him. In real life, Graeme Obree set two world hour records. His first record-setting achievement came in 1993 when he covered 51.596 kilometers (32.034 miles). He later broke his own record in 1994 with a distance of 52.713 kilometers (32.753 miles). Obree also became the World Champion in the 4,000-meter individual pursuit in both 1993 and 1995. Despite the challenges and adversities he faced throughout his career, Obree's remarkable accomplishments, perseverance, and innovation cemented his place in cycling history. In deciding whether to invest in the film proposal for \\"The Flying Scotsman,\\" it's essential to consider the inspiring true story of Graeme Obree, his unique approach to cycling, and his incredible achievements in the face of numerous obstacles. The movie presents an intriguing and powerful story that showcases the resilience and determination of an exceptional athlete."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lionel Messi achieved yet another milestone in his glittering career on Saturday night when he surpassed 400 career goals for club and country. The Argentinian wizard scored twice in Barcelona's 6-0 thumping of Granada to take his overall goal tally to 401 - comprised of 359 for his club and 42 for his country. 'I never imagined I could achieve anything like this in my career,' the humble Messi wrote on his Facebook page afterwards. 'I'll continue working hard to reach more targets.' Lionel Messi scored his 400th career goal in Barcelona's 6-0 win over Granada at the weekend and now has his sights set on breaking more records in both La Liga and the Champions League Messi has 67 in the competition, four shy of OPTIONS: - Argentina. - Argentinian. - Barcelona. - Champions League. - Cristiano Ronaldo. - Facebook. - Granada. - La Liga. - Lionel Messi. - Messi. - Raul.","completion":"Messi has 67 in the competition, four shy of Raul's record. The remarkable achievement adds to Messi's ever-growing legacy as one of football's all-time greats. He is now within striking distance of Raul's record of 71 goals in the Champions League, a milestone that many believe the Barcelona star will soon surpass. Despite fierce competition from Cristiano Ronaldo, who currently stands at 68 Champions League goals, Messi remains determined to break more records both in La Liga and Europe's most prestigious club competition. Rivalry between these two footballing giants has intensified over the years, with each of them pushing the other to greater heights as they battle for both individual and team honors. The Argentinian superstar's impressive goal-scoring record extends to various domestic and international tournaments. In La Liga alone, Messi has netted 271 times, making him the current all-time top scorer of the Spanish league. This record was previously held by Telmo Zara, whose 251 goals stood atop the La Liga scoring charts for more than 60 years. Messi's achievements on the international stage are equally noteworthy. With 42 goals to his name, he holds the record as Argentina's top goalscorer, a title he claimed in 2016 after netting a stunning free-kick against the United States during the Copa America Centenario. The four-time Ballon d'Or winner was instrumental in leading his national team to three consecutive finals between 2014 and 2016, including the World Cup and two Copa America tournaments. Despite facing criticism from some quarters for his inability to win a major international title with Argentina, Messi's seemingly limitless talent and genuine passion for the game continue to endear him to fans across the globe. His humble response to reaching the 400 goal milestone, shared via Facebook, is a testament to his grounded personality and focus on striving for even greater accomplishments in the future. It remains to be seen how many more records Messi will break in his extraordinary career. However, one thing is for certain: the Argentinian maestro will continue to dazzle football lovers around the world with his mesmerizing skills and unmatched goal-scoring prowess. With his sights now firmly set on surpassing Raul's Champions League record and extending his already-impressive La Liga tally, Lionel Messi's journey towards cementing his place as one of the greatest footballers in history is far from over."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Three Colors: Blue Movie plot: Julie (Juliette Binoche), wife of the famous composer Patrice de Courcy, must cope with the death of her husband and daughter in an automobile accident she herself survives. While recovering in hospital, Julie attempts suicide by overdose, but cannot swallow the pills. After being released from hospital, Julie, who it is suggested wrote (or helped to write) much of her husband's famous pieces, destroys what is left behind of them. Calling Olivier (BenoÃ®t RÃ©gent), an unmarried collaborator of her husband's who has always admired her, she spends a night with him and says goodbye. Emptying the family house and putting it up for sale, she takes an apartment in Paris without telling anyone, her only memento being a mobile of blue beads that the viewer assumes belonged to her daughter. Julie disassociates herself from all past memories and distances herself from former friendships, even being no longer recognised by her mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. She also reclaims and destroys the unfinished score for her late husband's last commissioned workâa piece celebrating European unity following the end of the Cold War. Snatches of its music, however, haunt her throughout the film. Despite her desire to live anonymously and alone, life in Paris forces Julie to confront elements of her past that she would rather not face. A boy who saw the accident seeks her out to give her a Christian cross he found by the car and to repeat her husband's last words, the punchline of an indelicate joke. She reluctantly befriends an exotic dancer named Lucille (Charlotte VÃ©ry) who is having an affair with one of the neighbors and helps her when she needs moral support.

The thalidomide disaster of the early 1960s left thousands of babies with deformed limbs because their mothers innocently took a sleeping pill thought to be safe during pregnancy, In its well-publicized wake, countless pregnant women avoided all medications, fearing that any drug they took could jeopardize their babies’ development. I was terrified in December 1968 when, during the first weeks of my pregnancy, I developed double pneumonia and was treated with antibiotics and codeine. Before swallowing a single dose, I called my obstetrician, who told me to take what was prescribed, “reassuring” me that if I died of pneumonia I wouldn’t have a baby at all. In the decades that followed, pregnancy-related hazards were linked to many medicinal substances: prescription and over-the-counter drugs and herbal remedies, as well as abused drugs and even some vitamins. Now, however, the latest findings about drug use during pregnancy have ignited new concerns among experts who monitor the effects of medications on the developing fetus and pregnancy itself. During the last 30 years, use of prescription drugs during the first trimester of pregnancy, when fetal organs are forming, has grown by more than 60 percent. About 90 percent of pregnant women take at least one medication, and 70 percent take at least one prescription drug, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since the late 1970s, the proportion of pregnant women taking four or more medications has more than doubled. Nearly one woman in 10 takes an herbal remedy during the first trimester. A growing number of pregnant women, naïvely assuming safety, self-medicate with over-the-counter drugs that were once sold only by prescription. While many commonly taken medications are considered safe for unborn babies, the Food and Drug Administration estimates that 10 percent or more of birth defects result from medications taken during pregnancy. “We seem to have forgotten as a society that drugs pose risks,” Dr. Allen A. Mitchell, professor of epidemiology and pediatrics at Boston University Schools of Public Health and Medicine, said in an interview. “Many over-the-counter drugs were grandfathered in with no studies of their possible effects during pregnancy.” Medical progress has contributed to the rising use of medications during pregnancy, Dr. Mitchell said. Various conditions, like depression, are now recognized as diseases that warrant treatment; drugs have been developed to treat conditions for which no treatment was previously available, and some conditions, like Type 2 diabetes and hypertension, have become more prevalent. Now a new concern has surfaced: Bypassing their doctors, more and more women are using the Internet to determine whether the medication they are taking or are about to take is safe for an unborn baby. A study, published online last month in Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety, of so-called “safe lists for medications in pregnancy” found at 25 Web sites revealed glaring inconsistencies and sometimes false reassurances or alarms based on “inadequate evidence.” The report was prepared by Cheryl S. Broussard of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with co-authors from Emory, Georgia State University, the University of British Columbia and the Food and Drug Administration. “Among medications approved for use in the U.S.A. from 2000 to 2010, over 79% had no published human data on which to assess teratogenic risk (potential to cause birth defects), and 98% had insufficient published data to characterize such risk,” the authors wrote. But that did not stop the 25 Web sites from characterizing 245 medications as “safe” for use by pregnant women, which “might encourage use of medications during pregnancy even when they are not necessary,” the authors suggested. Furthermore, the information found online was sometimes contradictory. “Twenty-two of the products listed as safe by one or more sites were stated not to be safe by one or more of the other sites,” the study found. The question of timing was often ignored. A drug that could interfere with fetal organ development might be safe to take later in pregnancy. Or one (for example, ibuprofen) that is safe early in pregnancy could become a hazard later if it raises the risk of excessive bleeding or premature delivery. Fewer than half the sites advised taking medication only when necessary, and only 13 sites encouraged pregnant women to consult their doctors before stopping or starting a medication. Doctors, too, are often poorly informed about pregnancy-related hazards of various medications, the authors noted. One woman I know was advised to wean off an antidepressant before she became pregnant, but another was told to continue taking the same drug throughout her pregnancy. “In many instances the best bet is for mom to stay on her medication,” said Dr. Siobhan M. Dolan, an obstetrician and geneticist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. She said that if a woman is depressed during pregnancy, her risk of postpartum depression is greater and she may have difficulty bonding with her baby. Dr. Dolan, who is author, with Alice Lesch Kelly, of the March of Dimes’ newest book, “Healthy Mom Healthy Baby,” emphasized the importance of weighing benefits and risks in deciding whether to take medication during pregnancy and which drugs to take. “In anticipation of pregnancy, a woman taking more than one drug to treat her condition should try to get down to a single agent,” Dr. Dolan said in an interview. “Of the various medications available to treat a condition, is there a best choice — one least likely to cause a problem for either the baby or the mother?” She cautioned against sharing medications prescribed for someone else and assuming that a remedy labeled “natural” or “herbal” is safe. Virtually none have been tested for safety in pregnancy. Among medications a woman should be certain to avoid, in some cases starting three months before becoming pregnant, are isotretinoin (Accutane and others) for acne; valproic acid for seizure disorders; lithium for bipolar disorder; tetracycline for infections, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists for hypertension, Dr. Dolan said. “Many medications that are not recommended during pregnancy can be replaced with low-risk alternatives,” she wrote. Dr. Broussard, who did the “safe lists” study, said in an interview, “We’ve heard about women seeing medications on these lists and deciding on their own that it’s O.K. to take them. “Women who are pregnant or even thinking about getting pregnant should talk directly to their doctors before taking anything. They should be sure they’re taking only what’s necessary for their health condition.” A reliable online resource for both women and their doctors, Dr. Mitchell said, are fact sheets prepared by OTIS, the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists, which are continually updated as new facts become available: http://www.otispregnancy.org.

The significant increase in the use of prescription drugs during the first trimester of pregnancy over the past 30 years, raising concerns among experts about potential long-term effects on the developing fetus and pregnancy. 2.

The estimate by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that 10% or more of birth defects result from medications taken during pregnancy. 4. The rise in the trend where pregnant women self-medicate and use the internet to determine the safety of medications for their unborn babies, often leading to alarming or false reassurances. 5.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Thor Heyerdahl (Norwegian pronunciation: [tu:r 'haei@da:l]; October 6, 1914 - April 18, 2002) was a Norwegian adventurer and ethnographer with a background in zoology, botany, and geography. He became notable for his Kon-Tiki expedition in 1947, in which he sailed 8,000 km (5,000 mi) across the Pacific Ocean in a hand-built raft from South America to the Tuamotu Islands. The expedition was designed to demonstrate that ancient people could have made long sea voyages, creating contacts between separate cultures. This was linked to a diffusionist model of cultural development. Context: In 1947, Heyerdahl and five fellow adventurers sailed from Peru to the Tuamotu Islands, French Polynesia in a pae-pae raft that they had constructed from balsa wood and other native materials, christened the Kon-Tiki. The Kon-Tiki expedition was inspired by old reports and drawings made by the Spanish Conquistadors of Inca rafts, and by native legends and archaeological evidence suggesting contact between South America and Polynesia. The Kon-Tiki smashed into the reef at Raroia in the Tuamotus on August 7, 1947, after a 101-day, 4,300-nautical-mile (5,000-mile or 8,000 km) journey across the Pacific Ocean. Heyerdahl had nearly drowned at least twice in childhood and did not take easily to water; he said later that there were times in each of his raft voyages when he feared for his life. Kon-Tiki demonstrated that it was possible for a primitive raft to sail the Pacific with relative ease and safety, especially to the west (with the trade winds). The raft proved to be highly manoeuvrable, and fish congregated between the nine balsa logs in such numbers that ancient sailors could have possibly relied on fish for hydration in the absence of other sources of fresh water. Other rafts have repeated the voyage, inspired by Kon-Tiki. Heyerdahl's book about The Kon-Tiki Expedition: By Raft Across the South Seas has been translated into 70 languages. The documentary film of the expedition entitled Kon-Tiki won an Academy Award in 1951. A dramatised version was released in 2012, also called Kon-Tiki, and was nominated for both the Best Foreign Language Oscar at the 85th Academy Awards and a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 70th Golden Globe Awards. It was the first time that a Norwegian film was nominated for both an Oscar and a Golden Globe. Anthropologists continue to believe that Polynesia was settled from west to east, based on linguistic, physical, and genetic evidence, migration having begun from the Asian mainland. There are controversial indications, though, of some sort of South American/Polynesian contact, most notably in the fact that the South American sweet potato is served as a dietary staple throughout much of Polynesia. Blood samples taken in 1971 and 2008 from Easter Islanders without any European or other external descent were analysed in a 2011 study, which concluded that the evidence supported some aspects of Heyerdahl's hypothesis. This result has been questioned because of the possibility of contamination by South Americans after European contact with the islands. However, more recent DNA work (after Heyerdahl's death) contradicts the post-European-contact contamination hypothesis, finding the South American DNA sequences to be far older than that. Heyerdahl had attempted to counter the linguistic argument with the analogy that he would prefer to believe that African-Americans came from Africa, judging from their skin colour, and not from England, judging from their speech.

Article: My grandmother Adele loved culture and was generous with its gifts. When I was a child, she took me to museums, restaurants, dances. She showered me with gifts from her travels around the world. But I can only remember her giving me one book--a book that, to this day, I have not read. She presented me with her own favorite childhood book: Hans Brinker. My grandmother was happy to share this book with me. She even decorated the title page with her proud writing. I tried to read it. I adored reading, and would dive into a new pile of books from the library all at once. But something about Hans Brinker just wouldn't let me in. The story was set in Holland, a long time ago. It felt dull and unfamiliar--even though I was a fan of classics of other times and places. I simply read the first pages over and over. I could not progress. Standing on a bookshelf in our living room, the book was like something I avoided. It scolded me for not being interested, for not trying hard enough, for disappointing my grandmother. The book started to fit in, almost forgotten, until Adele asked. Had I read it? Did I like it? Always determined, she wanted to know the answer. I would make some kind of excuse, feel bad, and open it again, hoping for a new reaction. _ . Years passed and finally Adele and I both accepted that I would never read Hans Brinker. Eventually I cleared the book from the shelf. The Hans Brinker experience led me to set a rule that I've lived by ever since: Do not ask about a book given as a gift. Don't ask, despite your desire to discuss it to grow closer. The desire for such connection is what gives book-giving with special meaning--and increases the owner's possibility to be a letdown. Guilt is basically the same as for all gifts, though. If the giver doesn't have the pleasure of seeing or hearing about the gift being enjoyed, and asks whether it is, then the owner--unless she can truthfully say \\"yes\\"--either has to admit to not liking the present, or else lie on the spot. Neither is pleasant. So, don't ask. Question: What does the author think about the book his grandmother gave him? Answer: Select from: A. Boring.. B. Interesting.. C. Puzzling.. D.

Pebbles, which are small stones or rock fragments, can naturally be found in or near these settings as they are common elements in the outdoor environment. Due to the regular foot traffic in a playground, it is likely that these pebbles may have been walked on by people visiting the area. Other options, like lakes and ponds, can also have pebbles, but they might not have the same level of consistent human interaction as a playground, making it a more sensible answer. Aquariums are less likely since they are primarily indoor environments for displaying marine life, and stucco is a building material, making it an inappropriate choice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Pope: The Pope wears a white zucchetto, which is made of watered silk, as a symbol of purity and to emphasize his higher position in the Church. The use of a white zucchetto is unique to the Pope and cannot be worn by any other clergy member. 2. Cardinals: Members of the College of Cardinals, often referred to as \\"princes of the church,\\" wear a scarlet or red zucchetto. This color symbolizes their willingness to shed their blood in defense of the faith. 3. Bishops: Bishops, including archbishops and patriarchs, wear a purple or amaranth zucchetto. The purple color signifies their royalty in the spiritual realm, as they are considered the successors of the Apostles. 4. Priests, deacons, and other lower-ranking clergy: These clergy members wear a black zucchetto. Black symbolizes their humility and simplicity, as they act as servants to their congregation and the Church as a whole. In some cases, an abbot or a religious superior may also wear a zucchetto, usually in the same color as the rest of their religious order's attire.

A. negative; B. positive; What would be an example of an A. review?","completion":"A negative review is a critique or evaluation of a product, service, entertainment, or any subject matter that highlights its shortcomings, flaws, or unsatisfactory elements. A negative review can help inform potential consumers or users about possible issues they may encounter and give businesses the opportunity to improve on the aspects that provoke customer dissatisfaction or frustration. An example of a negative review for a hotel or accommodation might look like the following: Title: Terrible Experience at XYZ Hotel Rating: 1/5 Stayed: June 11-15, 2022 I regret to say that my recent stay at XYZ Hotel was nothing short of a disaster, and I strongly discourage others from booking a room here. My dissatisfaction with the hotel can be summarized across three main points: cleanliness, service, and noise pollution. On arrival, I found that my assigned room was far from clean. I discovered several apparent stains on the bedsheets, as well as a considerable amount of dust on top of the nightstand and wall lamp. Furthermore, the bathroom appeared to have gone uncleaned, with soap scum on the sink, hairs in the shower, and a generally unpleasant smell permeating the entire room. Regarding the service at XYZ Hotel, I encountered multiple issues that only served to worsen my experience. When I went to the front desk to report the unclean state of my room, I was met with an unapologetic and seemingly disinterested receptionist who simply offered to send housekeeping later. After waiting for hours, no one ever arrived to address the issue. I also had a negative encounter with the bartender at the hotel's bar, who was impolite and inattentive. The noise pollution at the hotel was insufferable. Starting early in the morning and lasting well into the night, there was heavy construction work occurring just outside the hotel's premises. This constant disruption made it nearly impossible to get a good night's sleep, which was highly frustrating as I had book the hotel on a business trip. Although I understand that the hotel cannot control all external factors, the management should have made an effort to inform guests and possibly offer temporary solutions such as noise-canceling headphones, earplugs, or even discounted rates. Overall, my stay at XYZ Hotel was an overwhelmingly negative experience, leaving me with no choice but to advise others against staying here. The combination of poor cleanliness, inadequate service, and unacceptable noise levels created an environment that made it difficult to work, rest, or enjoy my trip in any way. I will not be returning to this establishment, and I encourage others to consider alternative accommodations to avoid a similarly disappointing experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Oprah, if you're reading this, for goodness sake return this woman's calls. Ask your assistants if there's a box of yellowing fax messages lying around somewhere in Harpo Studios -- she sent you one daily for a while. Track down the ton of letters asking -- pleading -- for your help starting a Winfrey-style talk show in Africa. Because this isn't just another eager fan. Her name is Mosunmola Abudu, and in the last eight years she's done it -- and then some. With no TV experience whatsoever, Abudu has become the \\"Oprah of Africa\\" -- it's impossible not to read an interview with the glamorous 49-year-old without the moniker cropping up. And with good reason. \\"When I started my journey into television, there was nothing that I didn't try, to reach this woman,\\" says Abudu about her early attempts to contact Ms","completion":"Winfrey. \\"I was relentless in my pursuit, believing that she could see the potential in my vision for a talk show in Africa.

Her tenacity and ambition have proven that she didn't need anyone's validation to achieve her dreams. So, Oprah, if you ever find those faxes and letters, know that you missed out on something extraordinary – but perhaps it was for the best. After all, it's not every day that two powerhouse women, each creating their own talk show legacy, can proudly stand side by side – one in America, the other in Africa – and demonstrate that dreams do come true, no matter where you are or who you are."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Это было не так плохо, как в советское время, когда мы поддерживали страны третьего мира, как против Америки, так и против Европы, но все же такая позиция не отвечала долгосрочным интересам России. Translate this to English?","completion":"The statement translates to English as: \\"It was not as bad as in the Soviet times when we supported third-world countries against both America and Europe, but still, such a position did not correspond to the long-term interests of Russia.\\" Delving deeper into the context of this statement, it appears to be a commentary on USSR's foreign policy. During the Soviet era, the USSR was known for its aid and support to third-world countries as part of their strategic geopolitical calculations during the Cold War. The primary goal was to extend their sphere of influence around the globe and counter the Western powers – predominantly the United States and Europe. The aid and support to the third-world countries was not entirely altruistic. It was often an exertion of soft power - a form of sway, which not only involved the provision of financial aid, but also support in the form of military training, provision of arms and ammunition, technical knowledge, personnel training, infrastructure development, among others. These were strategies applied not just by the Soviet Union, but also by Western powers to assert geopolitical influence on a global scale. The second part of the statement regarding how this approach didn't align with Russia's long-term interests might refer to the aftermath of Soviet collapse. The financial burden of supporting other economies, maintaining military presence in various parts of the world, along with the internal economic difficulties, contributed to the collapse of the Soviet economy. With the fall of the USSR and the emergence of the Russian Federation, policies and strategies underwent considerable amendments to navigate the newly globalized world. This change in geopolitical environment required a strategic approach that prioritized Russia’s national interests above the ideologically driven internationalism of Soviet times."},{"prompt":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: The thing issues twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States is one of various whats? Context: As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research, Beyond Politics, made its debut.","completion":"The thing that issues twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States is one of various student-run media outlets at Notre Dame University."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I don't believe there has ever been a more evil or wicked television program to air in the United States as The 700 Club. They are today's equivalent to the Ku Klux Klan of the 20th century. Their hatred of all that is good and sweet and human and pure is beyond all ability to understand. Their daily constant attacks upon millions and millions of Americans, as well as billions of humans the world over, who don't happen to share their bigoted, cruel, monstrous, and utterly insane view of humanity is beyond anything television has ever seen. The lies they spout and the ridiculous lies they try to pass off as truth, such as the idea of \\"life after death\\" or \\"god\\" or \\"sin\\" or \\"the devil\\" is so preposterous that they actually seem mentally ill, so lost are they in their fantasy. Sane people know that religion is a drug and shouldn't let themselves get addicted to that type of fantasy. However, The 700 Club is in a class by itself. They are truly a cult. While I believe in freedom of speech, they way they spread hatred, lies, disinformation, and such fantastic ideas is beyond all limits. I hope that one day the American Psychiatric Association will finally take up the study of those people who delude themselves in this way, people who let themselves sink so deeply into the fantasy land of religion that they no longer have any real concept of reality at all. Treatment for such afflicted individuals is sorely needed in this country, as so many people have completely lost their minds to the fantasy of religion. The 700 Club though, is even more horrible as it rises to the legal definition of 'cult' but due to The 700 Club's vast wealth (conned daily from the millions of Americans locked in their deceitful grip) they are above the law in this country. For those of you who have seen the movie \\"The Matrix\\" you know that movie was a metaphor for religion on earth: the evil ones who are at the top of each of the religions who drain the ones they have trapped and cruelly abuse for their own selfish purposes, and those millions who are held in a death sleep and slowly being drained of their life force represent those many people who belong to religions and who have lost all ability to perceive what is really going on around them. In less civil times, the good townsfolk would have run such monsters as those associated with The 700 Club out of town with torches and pitchforks. But in today's world where people have lost all choice in their choices of television that is presented to them, we have no way to rid ourselves of the 700 Club plague. The television ratings system and the \\"V\\" chip on TV's should also have a rating called \\"R\\" for religion, so that rational people and concerned parents could easily screen such vile intellectual and brutal emotional rape, such as presented by The 700 Club every day all over our country, from themselves and their children.

Samantha seems to always have a liquor bottle in their hand while Patricia didn't, so","completion":"it was clear that their approaches to handling life's challenges and social situations were quite different. While Samantha found solace and camaraderie in her liquid courage, Patricia preferred to face everything head-on without any artificial enhancements. Samantha's reliance on alcohol dates back to her college days when she experienced considerable pressure from friends and classmates to unwind, relax, and fit in. It started innocently enough with her joining a group of friends at parties and social gatherings where alcohol flowed freely. Unfortunately, over time, Samantha began to develop a dependence on it, causing her to turn to her trusted companion - the liquor bottle - whenever she needed a boost of confidence or a way to numb the pain. On the other hand, Patricia had faced her fair share of adversity over the years, but she managed to cope without the use of alcohol as a crutch. She was raised in a strict household with parents who encouraged open communication and healthy coping strategies to deal with stress or setbacks. In addition to that, her personal experiences with friends who struggled with addiction had instilled in her a sense of responsibility and caution when it came to substance use. This led Patricia to take stock of her own mental and emotional well-being more seriously, and she cultivated healthier habits such as regular exercise, journaling, and meditation to navigate through life's turbulence. As time passed, the contrast between both women became more and more apparent. Samantha's reliance on alcohol interfered with her ability to maintain stable relationships and make sound decisions. She often found herself stumbling and grappling with the consequences, struggling to keep her head above water. Her circle of friends began to diminish, and she became increasingly isolated. Patricia, on the other hand, took pride in her steadfast resilience in the face of life's obstacles. Her approach enabled her to have a level head and clear mind, resulting in being able to form deep connections with those around her. People were drawn to her unwavering strength and genuine compassion, and she ultimately became a beacon of hope and stability for those who needed guidance. In spite of their differences, Samantha and Patricia managed to maintain a sense of mutual respect for each other, as they recognized the contrasting ways each chose to cope with life's struggles. They would meet occasionally to catch up with one another, and their conversations would often revolve around their shared experiences and the ways they attempted to navigate the complexities of life. Though Patricia was aware of Samantha's dependence on alcohol, she never judged her harshly. Instead, she remained a supportive friend, respecting Samantha's autonomy to make her own choices. However, with time and growing concern for her friend's well-being, Patricia began to gently suggest alternative coping mechanisms to Samantha, sharing her own experiences with healthy habits and stress management techniques. Although resistant to these suggestions at first, Samantha gradually took note of her friend's unwavering commitment to her own personal growth and began to question her own dependency on the all-too-familiar liquor bottle. As they continued to learn and grow together, Samantha and Patricia's friendship transcended their differences, and they emerged as a testament to the power of personal resilience and the infinite capacity for change."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Just after he bought the house with his ill gotten gains from his band's over-hyped, over-marketed, and over-bought sophomore Disc, he drove me out to see it in his beautiful but nauseating '70 Datsun 240 Z. All the smog combined with the pinball effects of winding up the hill at teeth-numbing speeds had me puking for an hour after we got there. I took the last turn at the top of the hill and watched the rising sun crest over the black blocks of the city, her angel wings soiled and cheapened with the soot of 12 million get-away drivers. Rick's house came into view out of the fog, its large glass panes sparkling like the last clean surface of an oversized ashtray. I parked between a blue hatchback and Rick's favorite toy: a 350 horsepower Impreza he had smuggled here from Japan. All his more expensive rides were in the garage, collecting dust and gaining vintage resale value. I rang the bell. I waited and watched a couple of squirrels fight over a small treasure in the bushes. The door opened. \\"Dingo.\\" \\"Hey, Luna.\\" Her job as Rick's assistant was to take care of his place while he was out being a rock star. She made sure all his bills were paid, his animals were fed, and that the subsequent fallout from any parties she might have in his absence didn't leave any lasting damage. She was pretty by most standards, gorgeous by others. Short with a tight schoolgirl body and raven hair that teased her avian shoulders. But by whatever standard, her beauty was like a rare and exotic bird she kept caged behind the bars of her perfect teeth. As soon as she opened her mouth it flew away. What did Dingo think of Luna? - He thought she was pretty - He thought she was quite rude - not enough information - He thought she was an exotic bird Answer:","completion":"He thought she was pretty"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"I asked the young man with some curiosity what he had done with the photograph.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"I asked the man what was on the photograph after asking where it is.\\" true?","completion":"No, the hypothesis \\"I asked the man what was on the photograph after asking where it is\\" cannot be verified to be true based on the provided premise. The premise states, \\"I asked the young man with some curiosity what he had done with the photograph.\\" This statement communicates only one specific action — the speaker asked the young man about what he did with the photograph. There's no mention of asking about the content of the photograph (what was on it) or any previous query about the location of the photograph (where it is). The hypothesis suggested, which states that the speaker asked about the content of the photograph after asking about its location, introduces new information that is not present or implied in the original premise. For this hypothesis to be confirmed as true, the premise would need to include instances of the speaker asking about the whereabouts of the photograph and then following up with a question about its content. Therefore, based on the available premise, the specified hypothesis cannot be confirmed as true. It's important to remember when reading, interpreting, or analyzing texts that a hypothesis needs to be directly supported by the given information in the premise to be classified as accurate or true. Simply put, based on the provided premise, we can't substantiate whether any previous conversation about the location or the content of the photograph has occurred.

A:","completion":"Title: The Haunting of Blackwood Hall Genre: Mystery, Thriller --- Plot: Act 1: Helen Warwick, a young successful entrepreneur and philanthropist, receives a letter notifying her of an unexpected inheritance left to her by her late great-aunt. This inheritance turns out to be Blackwood Hall - a grand, centuries-old mansion steeped in history and surrounded by luscious gardens. Helen, who never knew of her great-aunt's existence, is intrigued and excited by this mysterious family connection and decides to visit the mansion. Helen's closest friends, Laura and Daniel, join her as they dream about the potential of renovating and reopening Blackwood Hall as a luxury boutique hotel. Upon arrival, they are met with an eerie feeling. The housekeeper, Mrs. Jenkins, who has worked for the family for decades, informs them of the dark past and series of unexplained events that have befallen the previous inhabitants of Blackwood Hall. Act 2: Ignoring the ominous warnings, Helen and her friends decide to spend their first night in the mansion. As they explore the halls, discussing their plans and dreams for the estate, they uncover a hidden room - a study that belonged to Helen's great-aunt. Inside, they find a collection of books and journals about the supernatural and a letter addressed to Helen from her great-aunt, warning her about a malevolent force residing within the mansion. During dinner, Helen and her friends share stories of hauntings, laughing off the warnings they discovered earlier. As night falls, each member experiences unsettling, and terrifying occurrences that can only be specters of the supernatural. Helen, unfazed by these encounters, confronts the force in the study. The ghostly presence reveals itself to be of her great-aunt, warning Helen that she is in grave danger. Act 3: Frightened by the supernatural encounters, Laura and Daniel make the decision to leave Blackwood Hall. Helen, however, feels compelled to stay and uncover the truth behind her great-aunt's message and the mansion's hauntings. As she investigates, she learns of a series of tragic deaths that occurred within the mansion's walls over the centuries. Convinced that her great-aunt's spirit is trying to protect her, Helen searches for a way to break the curse and free her family from the malevolent force. Unfortunately, she becomes consumed by the need to solve the mystery, unaware that her own life hangs in balance. On their last night at the mansion, Helen stays up late, completely absorbed in researching the supernatural events. Suddenly, a powerful storm rolls in and surrounds the mansion with lightning and darkness, as Helen finally uncovers the truth. The malevolent presence is, in fact, a vengeful spirit that feeds on human suffering – particularly that of Helen’s bloodline. Act 4: The storm reaches its peak as Helen races to free her great-aunt's spirit and break the curse of the mansion once and for all. However, in a cruel twist of fate, Helen's efforts only serve to make the vengeful spirit stronger. With a heavy heart, Helen's great-aunt appears once more, revealing that the only way to break the curse is for Helen to willingly sacrifice herself, freeing her family from the torment of the vengeful spirit forever. As the spirit's power intensifies, Helen makes her decision. Throwing open the doors of Blackwood Hall, she allows the storm to envelop her and take her life in a brilliant display of light and darkness. As she breathes her last breath, Helen's great-aunt watches over her, ensuring that her sacrifice is not in vain. With Helen's death, the curse is broken, and the vengeful spirit is vanquished. Blackwood Hall remains abandoned, a monument to Helen's sacrifice. Years later, as Laura and Daniel revisit the estate, they still remember and cherish the love and bravery of their friend Helen who made the ultimate sacrifice to protect them and generations to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Many of songs tell about the lives of famers . They talk about love, crops or death. The life of the countryside can be hard, so the words in country music are often sad. At first, people played the music only at family parties. But it became more popular later. In the 1920s,people played country songs on the radio, and they made them into records. When people in the countryside moved to towns and cities to look for work, they took their music with them. Country music continued to change and became popular across America.

It was clear that the letter was too big to fit into the small, standard-sized envelope we were given. I considered my options and justified my decision step by step. Step 1: Assessing the situation The letter was simply too large and thick to be forced into the small envelope, so I knew I couldn't proceed without making a change. Step 2: Identify possible solutions I thought about two possible solutions: finding a larger envelope or folding the letter so that it would fit into the current envelope. Step 3: Evaluate the options I weighed the pros and cons of each option. A larger envelope would accommodate the letter without any alterations. However, I didn't have an appropriately sized envelope readily available and might need to visit the store to purchase one. On the other hand, folding the letter could cause damage to the paper and potentially make it more challenging to read. But it would enable me to use the envelope I already had. Step 4: Choose a course of action Considering the urgency of posting the letter, I decided that folding the letter would be the best option, as it would save time and complete the task on hand. I acknowledged the possibility of creases, but I believed the recipient would understand the situation and not mind a slightly wrinkled letter. Step 5: Implement the decision Carefully, I found the strategic points to fold the letter, trying my best to minimize any impact on the document's readability. After a few delicate folds, the letter finally fit into the envelope. Step 6: Monitor the results With the letter now securely inside the envelope, I sealed it shut and addressed it to the recipient.

It was snowing And it was going to snow. Washington DC ||||| Comey Fesses Up, Claims Ownership Of Suspected Twitter Account Enlarge this image toggle caption Alex Brandon/AP Alex Brandon/AP Update at 3:05 p.m. ET: The Des Moines Register reports Comey was in Iowa for a family party. Look who's talking. Former FBI Director James Comey, who has cultivated a low public profile since his surprise firing last May, confirmed Monday that he is the author of a Twitter account that was previously anonymous — and signaled that he is going to rejoin the national conversation. Comey tweeted an image of himself standing alone, along the roadside in Iowa, writing, \\"On the road home. Gotta get back to writing. Will try to tweet in useful ways.\\" Earlier this year, a reporter for Gizmodo traced the Twitter account to Comey, after doing what she described as \\"four hours of sleuthing.\\" The account, under the pseudonym \\"Reinhold Niebuhr,\\" takes the name of a well-known theologian about whom Comey wrote an undergraduate thesis at the College of William & Mary. Another clue: The account is now called @FormerBu, for former, um, bureau. Last week, the account posted two public tweets — an image of a kayaker at West Point, and a photo from Little Round Top, in Gettysburg, Pa., with the line, \\"Good place to think about leadership and values.\\" Until Monday, however, Comey had not formally acknowledged he was the man behind the account. True to form, the more creative minds on Twitter took things farther afield. \\"Darth,\\" a prominent and playful figure on the social media site, noted his presence in Iowa — wearing running shoes — and added a Nike swoosh and the words, \\"he's running.\\" A lot of political reporters took notice of those facts, too. Comey served as the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, deputy U.S. attorney general, and the top lawyer at Lockheed Martin before being named to run the FBI by President Barack Obama. He was abruptly fired by President Trump in May, who said he was thinking about the Russia investigation when he made his decision. He has never occupied elected office, although many of his friends and former colleagues are pushing the idea. Other Twitter users replied to Comey with their own special requests. ||||| CLOSE James Comey has a book deal. Nathan Rousseau Smith (@fantasticmrnate) reveals what we know.

Internal employee surveys show that fired Comey was highly respected and trusted within the bureau during his nearly four-year tenure.

He’s turned away from the camera, but sure looks like Comey. Minutes after the tweet was posted, Benjamin Wittes, a legal analyst who’s known to be a friend of Comey, tweeted confirmation that the account does indeed belong to the former director and, by extension, that he was indeed in Iowa this week. Ok, in light of this latest tweet, I will confirm that @FormerBu is, in fact, James Comey himself. https://t.co/6QbhOG7Qzp — Benjamin Wittes (@benjaminwittes) October 23, 2017 So we’ve established he was here. But why? Well, Comey is married to Patrice Failor, an Iowa native whose brother is Ed Failor Jr., a top staffer for the Republican caucus in the Iowa Senate. Ed Failor's Facebook page happens to note that his father, Ed Failor Sr., celebrated his 90th birthday over the weekend, just the kind of family celebration an out-of-state daughter and son-in-law would come back for. The Des Moines Register learned that celebration included a birthday dinner at 801 Chophouse in downtown Des Moines, the venerable steakhouse long popular among visiting politicos. 801 general manager Damon Murphy confirmed to the Register that Comey attended the Failor party at the restaurant on Saturday. \\"They enjoyed themselves in a semi-private room, just a quick little dinner, in and out,\\" Murphy said. Ed Failor Jr. declined to confirm that Comey was in the state — but he didn’t deny it either. In his tweets, Comey seems to hint at a new public role for himself after several months out of the spotlight after his high-profile firing. “Gotta get back to writing” he said in the final Iowa tweet. “Will try to tweet in useful ways.” Read or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/2yDWogI ||||| Summary:","completion":"Former FBI Director, James Comey, confirmed he was the author of a previously anonymous Twitter account on Monday.

Explanation: The translation of \\"I'm starting to see a real little man there\\" to Czech is \\"Začínám tam vidět opravdu malého muže.\\" Here's a breakdown of the translation: - \\"I'm starting to see\\" is translated to \\"Začínám vidět.\\" In Czech, verb and subject pronouns are often combined into one conjugated verb form. In this case, \\"začínám\\" (I am starting) comes from the verb \\"začít\\" (to start), and it implicitly contains the pronoun \\"I.\\" - \\"a\\" is translated to \\"jednoho\\" when referring to a masculine object in an accusative case like the one we have here; however, in this specific context, it would sound unnatural in Czech, and it's perfectly fine to drop the \\"jednoho\\". - \\"real\\" is translated to \\"opravdu.\\" In this context, \\"opravdu\\" is an adverb that means \\"really\\" or \\"truly,\\" emphasizing the genuineness of the little man. - \\"little man\\" is translated to \\"malého muže,\\" which is in the accusative case.

Solve this instance: The ocular microenvironment is both immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory in nature. Pigment epithelial (PE) cells isolated from the eye possess the ability to suppress the T cell receptor-dependent activation of T cells and the induction of regulatory T cells in vitro. This property is dependent on the cells’ capacity to produce cell-surface and soluble inhibitory molecules, for example CD86 (B7-2), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, thrombospondin-1, programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1/B7-H1), and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 2α. Cultured ocular PE cells from the iris, ciliary body, and retina can individually suppress T-cell activation via mechanisms that partially overlap. Moreover, PE-derived regulatory T cells acquire functions that play a role in establishing immune regulation in the eye. Multiple strategies are employed within the eye to control immune-mediated inflammation. This phenomenon is known as immune privilege and is instrumental in helping to prevent extensive damage to bystander cells that would otherwise lead to blindness.

With just a few simple steps in layering and choosing the right combination, anyone can look effortlessly cool and chic with minimal effort. In this article, we will discuss the benefits of wearing a jacket with a black T-shirt with a white collar and short sleeves, and why it might be your new favorite go-to outfit. So, let's get started. Step 1: Choosing the Right Jacket A jacket can elevate any casual look and provide added warmth and protection against the elements. There is a multitude of jacket styles to choose from, such as bombers, denim jackets, or blazers, depending on the occasion and desired aesthetic. When pairing with a black T-shirt, consider a jacket in a complementary color or neutral tones like navy, olive, or tan. Step 2: A Black T-Shirt with a Twist Selecting a black T-shirt with a white collar and short sleeves makes for an eye-catching and modern look that instantly adds style points to your outfit. The monochrome design lends itself to easy matching, while the white collar creates a subtle statement and sense of sophistication. Ensure the shirt has a comfortable fit for easy layering under a jacket. Step 3: Keeping the Layers Balanced Layering can be a tricky game, and it's essential to find the right balance. A correctly layered outfit should be comfortable to wear, and the layers should harmoniously come together. Ensure the black T-shirt's sleeves and collar don't become bunched up or hidden beneath your chosen jacket. If needed, adjust the jacket to showcase the T-shirt's contrasting white collar - creating that perfect balance. Step 4: Accessorizing and Completing the Look With the base of your outfit established, you can put the finishing touches with suitable accessories and complementary wardrobe staples. Complete the look with a pair of well-fitting jeans or trousers in a neutral color. Depending on the occasion, accessorize the outfit with a hat, belt, or jewelry for added elegance. Conclusion With the right choice of jacket and a black T-shirt with a contrasting white collar, you can create a striking and effortlessly stylish ensemble. This outfit offers countless possibilities for accessorizing and can easily be adapted to various settings, from casual day-to-day wear to a more sophisticated evening look.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Q: Small crustaceans exchange gases across thin areas of the cuticle; larger species have what to accomplish this? A:","completion":"Larger species of small crustaceans have developed specialized, efficient respiratory structures called gills in order to accomplish gas exchange across thin areas of the cuticle. Unlike small species that rely on direct diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide through their cuticle, larger crustaceans have complex respiratory systems capable of supporting their increased size and metabolic requirements. Gills are thin-walled, flat, or filamental-like extensions of the body surface that provide a large surface area for the exchange of gases. They are typically located on the sides of the body, on the appendages, or in specialized chambers. In larger crustaceans, such as lobsters, crabs, and crayfish, gills are usually found within gill chambers located on either side of the cephalothorax, which is the fused head and thorax region. These gill chambers are covered by a bony plate called the carapace that protects the delicate structures within and helps to keep water flowing over the gills. As water flows over the gills, oxygen dissolved in water diffuses across the thin walls of the gill filaments and enters the crustacean's circulatory system, where it binds to respiratory pigments like hemocyanin. Simultaneously, as oxygen is taken up into the blood, carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration, diffuses out of the blood and into the water, which is then carried away as the water continues to flow over the gills. Having specialized respiratory structures like gills is essential for larger crustaceans to meet their metabolic demands and support their larger body size. The increased surface area provided by gills allows for more efficient gas exchange and better adaptation to different aquatic environments – from freshwater to saltwater and from shallow to deep waters. The development of gills highlights the evolutionary adaptability of crustaceans and their ability to thrive in diverse ecological niches."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When he wins a lot of money cheating at craps, he has to be rescued from a robbery attempt by a complete stranger, Ballin Mundson (George Macready). Mundson tells him about an illegal high-class casino, but warns him not to practice his skills there. Farrell ignores his advice, cheats at blackjack, and is taken by two men to see the casino's owner, who turns out to be Mundson. Farrell talks Mundson into hiring him and quickly gains his confidence. However, the unimpressed washroom attendant, Uncle Pio (Steven Geray), keeps calling him \\"Mr. Peasant\\". One day, Mundson returns from a trip with a beautiful and spirited new wife, Gilda (Rita Hayworth). It is immediately apparent that Johnny and Gilda have a history together, though both deny it when Mundson questions them. Johnny visits Gilda alone in the bedroom she shares with her husband, and the two have an explosive confrontation that elucidates both their past romantic relationship, which ended badly, and their loveâhate dynamic. While it is unclear just how much Mundson knows of Gilda and Johnny's past relationship, he appears to be in ignorance when he assigns Farrell to keep an eye on Gilda. Johnny and Gilda are both consumed with their hatred of each other, as Gilda cavorts with men at all hours in increasingly more blatant efforts to enrage Johnny, and he grows more abusive and spiteful in his treatment of her. Mundson is visited by two German businessmen. Their secret organization had financed a tungsten cartel, with everything put in Mundson's name to hide their connection to it.

Question: suppose More salt will drip inside the fresh water pot. happens, how will it affect MORE salt being removed from the water. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"B: less Step 1: Place the water in a pot Reason: To begin the process of separating salt from water, the water needs to be heated, and a pot is a common vessel for this purpose. Step 2: Cover the pot with a slightly too large cover Reason: To help collect the evaporated water (water vapor), a cover that extends over the sides of the pot will assist in catching and directing the water vapor to the second pot. Step 3: Place a larger pot under the first Reason: The larger pot is placed underneath to collect the dripping fresh water, which results from the condensation of water vapor on the cover. Step 4: Heat water to evaporation Reason: Heating the water to the point of evaporation allows the water vapor to separate from the salt that cannot evaporate, allowing for the extraction of fresh water. Step 5: Water vapor will collect on the lid Reason: As the water vapor rises and comes into contact with the cooler lid, it will condense into droplets. Step 6: Drip into the second pot as fresh water Reason: The fresh water droplets collected on the lid will then drip into the larger pot underneath, resulting in a collection of fresh water separate from the salt. Step 7: Salt is left behind in the original pot Reason: As the water evaporates, the salt does not, remaining in the original pot. However, if more salt drips into the fresh water pot, it will result in less salt being removed from the water (Answer B) because the salt will be mixed back into the collected fresh water, defeating the purpose of the evaporation process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: As a foreigner,I don' t know the situation in the US well. Seeing all kinds of recent shooting incidents,I think it should be controlled more strictly than now. Somebody said that the person who has it in mind to kill another can do it without a gun,so the causes of murders are not guns but the trend of despising life in the US. And they also insist that there is no clear evidence that the increasing number of murders is connected with possession of guns,so the personal rights should not be restricted by the reason that there is not enough evidence. Several months ago,I agreed with that partly. But as we know,the private groups like NRA have used the public opinion and persuaded the government to protect their profit. Other weapons such as knives,razors ,bats are made for their own usage. But guns are made for only one reason--to kill someone. Of course,there are people who have guns to protect themselves from the criminals. But crime is getting more cruel and severe nowadays,so actually even if someone has a gun,it is impossible to guard himself completely. As a substitute ,I think,if the possession of guns is controlled more strictly,people can live safer lives than now. There are other reasons to oppose the gun control (e.g.the possession of guns is historical inheritance and represents that people's resistance will be against tyrannical government),but none of them can justify and explain today's serious situation in the US.

The movie failed to meet them. I don't mind stories that stretch credulity - remember Reign of Fire? - but I do expect them to be internally consistent. This film leapt from howler to howler without pausing for breath, all interspersed with special effects that lagged far behind the likes of LOTR or even Godzilla. A shape-shifting mystic warrior from Korea, curiously metamorphosed into a Caucasian antique dealer and popping up like deus ex machina to get the hapless protagonists out of their latest mess. A special agent from the FBI who seems to be completely boned up on ancient Korean folklore because of the Fed's excellent \\"paranormal division\\" - which has gone unremarked up to this point. Lovers kissing on deserted beaches where one exclaims \\"I never meant for this to happen.\\" A reincarnated pair of long dead Koreans who \\"died like star-crossed lovers.\\" Mystic pendants, faceless hordes of robotic soldiers (that owe a lot to Peter Jackson's orcs) and a serpent who wastes so much time roaring that every time its chosen prey is within reach something comes along to distract it. The dialogue is appalling, the acting wooden and the effect of the whole was, to be honest, tedious. However, for me the crowning moment was at the end, after the finale, when the music for the closing credits was - Arirang! This is rather like Akira Kurosawa closing \\"Ran\\" with a karaoke rendition of My Way - and let me be clear that I am in no way comparing director Shim to Kurosawa. In short, a self indulgent, lackluster collection of clichés and narrative non-sequituurs which may appeal to the sense of the melodramatic so prevalent in Koran popular culture but should not be worth the price of the ticket to any serious movie goer - or even a not so-serious movie goer.

Please briefly summarize this news article: De Blasio and New York: Promises Now, Payments Later For nearly his last five years as mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg and the United Federation of Teachers failed to agree on a contract for the city’s public schoolteachers. By the time Bill de Blasio took office as mayor in January, the teachers were demanding billions in retroactive pay increases for the years they didn’t have a contract and therefore didn’t get base pay increases. Mr. de Blasio, a liberal who ran with strong support from unions, wanted to provide retroactive pay, but the city is not exactly flush with cash to hand out. So his solution was to promise retroactive pay now and pay it later. The contract he recently negotiated with the teachers’ union includes payouts equivalent to 4 percent pay increases for 2009 and 2010, but teachers won’t start getting the money until 2015. They won’t get it all until 2020, by which time the new teachers’ contract will have been expired for two years. Nicole Gelinas, my former colleague from the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, argues that this means the city’s budget is not balanced. Effectively, the city is borrowing money from its teachers: The teachers are providing labor now, on the expectation that the city will pay them later. Mr. de Blasio hardly invented the idea of “balancing” a budget by paying in promises instead of cash. The teachers’ union notes that the city has executed contracts with deferred pay at least twice before, in 1976 and 1991. And it extends far beyond New York: The requirement to balance budgets annually, funding current expenses from current revenues, pushes governments to find ways to promise payment later, and not count that payment as a current expense. This can help governments get through periods of fiscal stress without cutting services too deeply or raising taxes too sharply, but it can also get lawmakers into a lot of trouble, when they fail to understand the true costs of the promises they’re making. Retirement benefits are a common vehicle for backdoor borrowing. State and local governments routinely promise public employees health benefits in retirement, but almost none consistently set aside enough cash in advance to cover those costs. Cash pensions are ordinarily pre-funded, but states and cities use all sorts of gimmicks to reduce the amount of cash they have to set aside for pensions. For example, pension funds “smooth” pension investment returns in a way that gives the government credit for assets that don’t exist. Funds in several jurisdictions, including Los Angeles and Detroit, reacted to the stock market declines of 2008 and 2009 by extending the number of years over which they smooth asset declines, which allowed them to reduce their pension systems’ annual cash demands — without actually reducing the cost of the pension benefits promised. Sometimes, the methods of borrowing are even more crass. Today, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey announced that, because of a revenue shortfall, he would pay 60 percent less into the state’s pension funds than was prescribed under a 2011 law he signed. He described this as “doing what I need to do to fulfill my constitutional obligation to balance a budget,” but because taxpayers will eventually have to repay the missed pension contributions with interest, that’s not really balancing; it’s borrowing. Illinois routinely “balances” its budget by delaying payments to people owed money by the state, including medical providers who participate in Medicaid. The Illinois comptroller, Judy Baar Topinka, noted in a 2013 report that “Illinois ended 2013 with an overall bill backlog that was 1.4 billion smaller than the same time last year.” That still left the state with 6.1 billion in overdue bills to its counterparties. In some cases, governments hide the cost of business subsidies by providing loan guarantees instead of direct cash payments. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey provided a bond guarantee to support the private construction of 4 World Trade Center and is discussing providing one for 3 World Trade Center. Those loan guarantees are valuable and they reduce the developer Larry Silverstein’s cost to build, but they won’t show up as a budgetary cost to the Port Authority unless he actually defaults on his debts. That’s an error: Simply providing the guarantee and taking on the risk of payment is costly, as demonstrated by the fact that buying a similar guarantee in the private markets would be expensive. Those contingent liabilities can become a big deal when they turn into actual liabilities. Rhode Island learned this the hard way in 2012, when it used bond guarantees as a strategy for economic development and job creation, and then ended up on the hook for 75 million plus interest when 38 Studios, a video game company founded by the ex-Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling, went bankrupt. This is a good example of how paying in promises instead of in cash can get lawmakers in trouble. The 38 Studios deal would have probably looked less appealing to Rhode Island legislators had they needed to put up cash upfront to get someone else to take on the risk of a 38 Studios failure. It can even be argued that part of the regular pay increases that Mr. de Blasio negotiated with the teachers constitutes borrowing. The contract contemplates low base salary increases of just 1 percent for the years 2013 through 2015, rising to 3 percent by 2018. Is a higher promised wage increase in later years a reflection of an expectation that overall wage growth will be stronger in the future? Or is it an inducement to get the union to accept a smaller wage increase now — and therefore a form of borrowing? Some tactics, like Illinois’s practice of just not paying bills, are obvious forms of backdoor borrowing. But sometimes, as with a labor contract that includes low wage increases now and higher ones in the future, it’s ambiguous; that ambiguity can make it hard to say whether a government’s budget is balanced or not. After a skirmish with Scott Stringer, the city comptroller, Mr. de Blasio amended his budget to reclassify 725 million in promised payouts to teachers who may retire soon as spending in this year’s budget, reducing the amount of implicit borrowing. The logic is that the promises are being made now and should be counted now, even if the cash goes out the door in a later year. But billions more in promised retroactive pay to teachers who are not eligible to retire soon will still be counted in later budgets — in the case of payments due in 2020, in a budget that could come as Mr. de Blasio is in his second and last term as mayor. Let’s hope the city has plenty of money then to pay off the implicit loan we’re taking out from teachers today.","completion":"Mayor Bill de Blasio negotiated a contract with New York City's teachers' union that includes retroactive pay increases, which have been criticized as a form of backdoor borrowing.

Plot title: Executive Action Movie plot: A narrator states that when President Lyndon Johnson was asked about the Kennedy Assassination and the Warren Commission report, he said he doubted the findings of the Commission. The narration ends with the mention that the segment did not run on television and was cut from a program about Johnson, at his own request. At a gathering in June 1963, shadowy industrial, political and former US intelligence figures discuss their growing dissatisfaction with the Kennedy administration. In the plush surroundings of lead conspirator Robert Foster (Robert Ryan), he and the others try to persuade Harold Ferguson (Will Geer), a powerful oil magnate dressed in white, to back their plans for an assassination of Kennedy. He remains unconvinced, saying, \\"I don't like such schemes. They're only tolerable when necessary, and only permissible when they work.\\" James Farrington (Burt Lancaster), a black ops specialist, is also among the group: He shows Ferguson and others that a careful assassination of a U.S. President can be done under certain conditions, and refers to the murders of Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, and William McKinley as examples, and includes assassination attempts of others including Roosevelt in 1933. He calls this \\"executive action\\". The film cuts to a desert, where a shooting team is doing target practice at a moving object. One of the shooters says they can only guarantee the operation's success by slowing down the target to 15Â miles per hour. The lead conspirators, Farrington and Foster, discuss preparations for the assassination. Obtaining Ferguson's approval is crucial to the conspirators, although Farrington proceeds to organize two shooting teams in anticipation that Ferguson will change his mind. Ferguson, meanwhile, watches news reports and becomes highly concerned at Kennedy's increasingly \\"liberal\\" direction: action on civil rights, Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, nuclear disarmament.

Which language is this?","completion":"This sentence is in Czech, a West Slavic language spoken primarily in the Czech Republic. The Czech language is closely related to Slovak and has similarities to other Slavic languages such as Polish and Russian. It uses the Latin alphabet with several additional diacritic marks for specific Czech sounds, such as č, š, and ž, which are called háček (hook); á, é, í, and other vowels with an acute accent; and ů, which is a ring above the letter u. The sentence \\"Chvíli mu trvalo, než to skousnul\\" can be translated to English as \\"It took him a while to swallow it\\" or \\"It took him a moment to come to terms with it.\\" The phrase suggests that someone had difficulty accepting or dealing with something, either physically, as in swallowing food or a pill, or metaphorically, adjusting to new information or a significant change. Czech is an inflected language, which means that the endings of nouns, adjectives, and verbs change according to their function in a sentence. This characteristic allows Czech speakers to use different and relatively flexible sentence structures, which can result in a variety of word orders based on emphasis or style. This flexibility, however, can be challenging for non-native speakers learning the language. Czech is spoken by around 10 million native speakers and is one of the 24 official languages of the European Union. In both the Czech Republic and abroad, there are communities of people who speak it as their first language.

Lastly, you top it with another saltine to make a cracker sandwich, or crackerwich! Option B is a bit sillier. Instead of using a cracker, you're spreading peanut butter on a big piece of meat called a tomahawk steak. You still add strawberry slices and drizzle honey on top.

Rage Against the Machine broke up as a result of de la Rocha's departure, but the remaining three members of the band—Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk—decided to stay together and announced plans to continue with a new vocalist. Several vocalists jammed with the three, including B-Real of Cypress Hill, but they did not want another rapper or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha. Contrary to popular belief, Layne Staley of Alice in Chains neither auditioned nor was asked to join the new project. Tom Morello denied this claim on his Twitter account in 2015. Music producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they play with Chris Cornell, the ex-frontman of Soundgarden. Rubin also persuaded the three of them to go into group therapy with performance coach Phil Towle after the breakup. Rubin was confident that with the right new voice, Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band; he believed \\"it could turn into a Yardbirds-into-Led Zeppelin scenario.\\" Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together. He called him \\"the angel at the crossroads\\" because \\"if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here today.\\"The chemistry between Cornell and the other three was immediately apparent; as Morello described: \\"He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it. It didn't just sound good. It didn't sound great. It sounded transcendent.

Please answer the following question: When I was fourteen, I earned money in the summer by cutting lawns , and within a few weeks I had built up a body of customers. I got to know people by the flowers they planted that I had to remember not to cut down, by the things they lost in the grass or struck in the ground on purpose. I reached the point with most of them when I knew in advance what complaint was about to be spoken, which request was most important. And I learned something about the measure of my neighbors by their preferred method of payment: by the job, by the month--or not at all. Mr. Ballou fell into the last category, and he always had a reason why. On one day, he had no change for a fifty, on another he was flat out of checks, on another, he was simply out when I knocked on his door. Still, except for the money apart, he was a nice enough guy, always waving or tipping his hat when he'd seen me from a distance. I figured him for a thin retirement check, maybe a work-related injury that kept him from doing his own yard work. Sure, I kept track of the total, but I didn't worry about the amount too much. Grass was grass, and the little that Mr. Ballou's property comprised didn't take long to trim . Then, one late afternoon in mid-July, the hottest time of the year, I was walking by his house and he opened the door, mentioned me to come inside. The hall was cool, shaded, and it took my eyes a minute to adjust to the dim light. \\"I owe you,\\" Mr Ballou said, \\"but...\\" I thought I'd save him the trouble of thinking of a new excuse. \\"No problem. Don't worry about it.\\" \\"The bank made a mistake in my account,\\" he continued, ignoring my words. \\"It will be cleared up in a day or two. But in the meantime I thought perhaps you could choose one or two volumes for a down payment. He gestured toward the walls and I saw that books were stacked everywhere.

However, after Mr. Ballou invited him into his house, which was filled with books, the author was encouraged by Mr. Ballou to choose one or two volumes as a form of down payment for the lawn cutting services.

Answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: What is required to be good at playing tennis? Possible A: tennis racket, skill, competition, tennis court, legs Why is \\"skill\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"Skill is an answer aligned with human common sense because, to be good at playing tennis, one must possess the knowledge, ability, and talent to play the sport effectively. Mastery of various essential techniques, such as serving, forehand and backhand strokes, footwork, and tactics, are critical to perform well in tennis. This encompasses both physical and mental skills required for the game. While other factors like a tennis racket, competition, tennis court, and legs also contribute to playing tennis, the skill factor is the most indicative of how successful a player will be. For instance, a tennis racket is necessary to play, but without skill, a person cannot effectively utilize the racket. A tennis court is obviously important to have a proper surface for the game, but merely having access to a court does not make one a good player. Similarly, legs are essential for mobility and agility during the game; however, strong legs alone do not guarantee success. Lastly, competition helps gauge one's skill level and improve through challenges, but it is the player's skill that ultimately determines their performance. In summary, skill is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is the most crucial factor in determining a player's performance and success in tennis. Without the necessary skills, even with all the equipment and opportunities, an individual would not perform well in the game."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Empty roads giving you a weird feeling. We had all possible difficulties finding our airbnb accommodation as its address was like Marida, Caucel, Avenida 68, Puerta Sisal, Calle 31, Avenida Caucel 68, Calle 3/2419 B. After much asking around, as we don't have a navigation system here, and consulting our paltry maps, we gave up and phoned our host who navigated us to the house, which turned out to be located in a semi-fenced residential area outside the city. Quite a pretty and comfy place for that and entirely for us alone. William: William: So we finally had a goodnight's sleep, did some sightseeing in the capital of Yucatan today and are looking forward to reconnoiter the area tomorrow. William: Hobbs: Hi there! Many thanks for the details. Caucel rings a bell with me. Is it to the west of the city itself? A fairly new development? William: That's it. Brand new and still being developed. Following a wide and brand new avenida today, we ended up with this. And dense vegetation beyond! Hobbs: Looks like Mexico to me. But they'll pick up the continuation once they needed it. Practically minded as they are. And how did you like the city itself? William: We got stuck on the Plaza Mayor, this being Sunday. It was turned into a market square with stalls offering local food, craftsmanship products and household goods, surprising un-touristy. In front of Palacio del Gobierno, a supreme show of dancing in local costumes. William: Hobbs: Did you manage to get to the balcony of the Palacio on the first floor and get some photos from there? William: But of course! William: William: Theresa tried to prevent me from trespassing but you know me. Even managed to get to the loo there! Hobbs: Good boy! And how about the cathedral? Casa de Montejo? Is it still accessible or is it only a bank? William: Both, and Theresa intends to visit the cathedral again to take some more photos. I didn't find it that impressive, apart from the west facade of course. A small part of Casa de Montejo on the ground floor is a museum now, interiors with period furniture plus a small modern art gallery, quite pleasant though over-airconditioned, but the rest is a bank, I think. Hobbs: If I remember correctly they bought the building some time ago and financed its restoration. To have a good overview of the city, you should try a ride on an open double-decker bus. William: Planned for a day to come. Tomorrow we want to go to Sisal and drive along the coast to Progresso.

Now, analyzing both sentences together, there is no direct connection between the two statements. Sentence 1 discusses the potential for economic improvement, while Sentence 2 focuses on the intent of an individual or a group to give their best effort. If we wanted to make a connection between the two sentences, we would need to know if the individuals or the group mentioned in Sentence 2 are involved in the economic circumstances talked about in Sentence 1. If the people mentioned in Sentence 2 were, for instance, policymakers or business leaders, you could make a connection between their \\"best efforts\\" and the potential for economic improvement suggested in Sentence 1. In that case, if the first sentence is true, the second sentence could also be true if these individuals or groups indeed wanted to do their best to improve the economy. However, based on the information provided, there is no direct link between the truth of Sentence 1 and the truth of Sentence 2. The first sentence refers to the potential for economic improvement, while the second sentence refers to the intent of individuals or groups to do their best. As such, without any additional context, it cannot be determined that if the first sentence is true, the second would also be true. Both sentences can be true or false independently of each other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

As a result of the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885, the Congo Basin is claimed by King Leopold II of the Belgians, who rules the Congo Free State in personal union with the Kingdom of Belgium. The country is on the verge of bankruptcy, Leopold having borrowed huge sums of money to finance the construction of railways and other infrastructure projects.

He is the central figure of the Hindu epic Ramayana, which is the principal narration of the events connected to his incarnation on Earth, his ideals and his greatness. Rama is one of the many deities in Hinduism and especially of the various Vaishnava sects. Religious texts and scriptures based on his life have been a formative component in numerous cultures of South and Southeast Asia. Along with Krishna, Rama is considered to be one of the most important avatars of Vishnu. In Rama-centric sects, he is considered the Supreme Being, rather than an avatar. - Rendezvous with Rama is a science fiction novel by Arthur C. Clarke first published in 1973. Set in the 2130s, the story involves a cylindrical alien starship that enters Earth's solar system. The story is told from the point of view of a group of human explorers who intercept the ship in an attempt to unlock its mysteries. This novel won both the Hugo and Nebula awards upon its release, and it is regarded as one of the cornerstones in Clarke's bibliography. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - Bert Gentry Lee (born 1942) is the chief engineer for the Planetary Flight Systems Directorate at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and also a science fiction writer.

In Rome the first persons to be called cardinals were the deacons of the seven regions of the city at the beginning of the 6th century, when the word began to mean “principal,” “eminent,” or \\"superior.\\" The name was also given to the senior priest in each of the \\"title\\" churches (the parish churches) of Rome and to the bishops of the seven sees surrounding the city. By the 8th century the Roman cardinals constituted a privileged class among the Roman clergy. They took part in the administration of the church of Rome and in the papal liturgy. By decree of a synod of 769, only a cardinal was eligible to become pope. In 1059, during the pontificate of Nicholas II, cardinals were given the right to elect the pope under the Papal Bull In nomine Domini. For a time this power was assigned exclusively to the cardinal bishops, but the Third Lateran Council in 1179 gave back the right to the whole body of cardinals.

First, let's rewrite the equation to make it easier to understand: 794 * j = -3205 * j - 51559 + 287500 Our job is to find out the number that j represents. To do this, we need to get all the terms with j on one side, and all the numbers without j on the other side. Here's what we'll do: 1. Add 3205 * j to both sides of the equation to move the -3205 * j from the right side: (794 * j) + (3205 * j) = -51559 + 287500 2. Combine the j terms: (794 + 3205) * j = -51559 + 287500 3. Calculate the sum of 794 and 3205: 3999 * j = -51559 + 287500 4. Now, calculate the sum of -51559 and 287500: 3999 * j = 235941 Alright, we're almost done! Now, we need to find the number for j. We'll do this by dividing the number on the right side by the number next to j (which is 3999): j = 235941 / 3999 5. Let's do the division: j = 59 So, j represents the number 59 in this problem.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"Preparing rocks for painting involves a series of steps to ensure they are properly cleaned, smoothed, and primed for the best possible results. Here is a detailed guide on how to prepare rocks for painting which makes the most sense to accomplish this goal: 1. Collecting or purchasing rocks: The first step is to either collect rocks from nature or purchase them at a gardening or crafts store. Look for rocks with a smooth surface, relatively flat, and free from cracks or deep fissures. The size and shape of the rock can vary, depending on your painting project and design requirements. 2. Washing rocks: Once you have your rocks, it is essential to thoroughly wash them to remove dirt, dust, and debris. You can use a brush with soft bristles, running water, and mild dish soap to gently scrub the rocks. Make sure to rinse them well to remove any soap residue. 3. Soaking rocks: After washing, let the rocks soak in a bucket or sink filled with water for about 30 minutes. This step helps to release any remaining dirt or debris, particularly from small crevices. 4. Drying rocks: Drain the water and let the rocks air dry in a sunny or well-ventilated area. This step might take a few hours, or up to one day, depending on the size and the type of rock. Ensure the rocks are completely dry before moving forward, as moisture might interfere with the painting process. 5. Sanding rocks (optional): Some rocks might have rough spots that require smoothing before painting. Use sandpaper (120 grit is a good starting point) to gently smooth the surface of the rock. Make sure to do this in a well-ventilated area and wear a mask to avoid inhaling rock dust. Wipe the rock with a damp cloth to remove any dust from sanding and allow it to dry. 6. Applying primer/base coat (optional): To enhance the durability and aesthetics of your painted rock, apply a coat of white paint or gesso as a base. This step is optional, but it can help make the colors more vibrant and provide better adhesion of the acrylic paint. Make sure to use a primer that's designed for multi-surface use, is waterproof and non-toxic. Allow the primer to dry according to the manufacturer's instructions. 7. Painting the rocks: Use acrylic paints to create your designs on the rocks. Acrylic paint is water-resistant when dry, and it adheres well to rock surfaces. Prefer using non-toxic paints and brushes of varying sizes to achieve different levels of detail. 8. Drying the painted rocks: Let the painted rocks dry completely before moving on to the next step. This process can take anywhere from an hour to overnight, depending on the thickness of the paint applied. 9. Applying a protective sealant: To protect your painted rocks from the elements and increase their longevity, apply a clear, waterproof sealant. Choose a sealant specifically designed for outdoor use and compatible with acrylic paints, such as Mod Podge Outdoor or a spray-on varnish. Apply the sealant according to the manufacturer's instructions and let it dry completely. 10. Displaying your painted rocks: Once the rocks are dry and sealed, they are ready to be displayed, hidden, or given as gifts. Painted rocks are a unique and creative way to decorate gardens, home interiors, or to simply brighten someone's day with a fun and unexpected artistic find. By following these steps, you can prepare rocks for painting in a way that makes the most sense and ensures a high-quality, long-lasting, and aesthetically-pleasing finished product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries. With presidential support, the Justice Department in recent years has directed prosecutors to rein in the use of harsh mandatory minimums. Eggleston once again called on...

Choices: - these twos are incorrect answers - bed - basement - floor - store The rationale to choose \\"basement\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the question and choices The question asks where Sam's parents might put the boxes of toys after packing them up for long term storage. The choices provided are: bed, basement, floor, and store. Step 2: Eliminate the incorrect choices \\"These twos are incorrect answers\\" indicates that two choices should be disregarded, but does not specifically point out which ones. Therefore, we need to examine each choice on its own merit. - Bed: This is not a suitable location for long term storage of toys, as the bed is a place for sleeping and it wouldn't be practical to store items there for a long time. - Basement: This is a possible storage location, as basements are often used for storing items long term. - Floor: This is not an ideal location for long term storage, as it could create clutter and hinder movement within the house. - Store: This choice is ambiguous, as it could mean a storage facility or a retail store. However, the context suggests that the toys are being kept within the family, which eliminates the possibility of a retail store. So, we can rule out \\"store\\" as an option. Step 3: Choose the most appropriate answer based on the remaining options With \\"bed\\" and \\"floor\\" eliminated as unsuitable options, we are left with \\"basement\\" as the most appropriate choice. Rationale for choosing \\"basement\\" as the answer: Basements are commonly used for long term storage of items that are no longer needed on a daily basis, but are still important to keep within the family, such as memorabilia, seasonal items, or in this case, Sam's old toys. Storing the boxes in the basement keeps them out of the way, yet still accessible, and allows for easy organization without cluttering up the living space."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who named his eldest daughter after Jane? Movie title: Becoming Jane Movie plot: Jane Austen is the younger daughter of Reverend George Austen and his wife and has yet to find a suitable husband. She aspires to be a writer, to the dismay of her mother and proud delight of her father. Thomas Lefroy is a promising lawyer with a bad reputation, which he describes as \\"typical\\" for people in the profession. Tom makes a terrible first impression upon meeting Jane, when he nearly falls asleep while she gives a reading of her work for the company. Overhearing his subsequent criticism, Jane cannot stand the arrogant Irishman. Meanwhile, she turns down the affections of other men, including Mr. Wisley, the nephew and heir of the wealthy Lady Gresham. Wisley proposes but Jane ultimately rejects him due to lack of affection. The mischievous Tom encounters Jane again; they argue but increasingly take interest in each other and Tom demonstrates that he takes Jane's literary aspirations seriously. In time they fall in love. Tom, Jane, her brother Henry and Jane's rich widowed cousin, Eliza, Comtesse de Feullide, conspire to receive an invitation from Tom's uncle and benefactor, the Lord Chief Judge Langlois of London, for the rich \\"Madame La Comtesse\\" and her friends. This visit is meant to be a short break in their journey to see Jane's brother, Edward. This would allow Judge Langlois to get to know Jane before and give a blessing for their marriage. Full of hope, Jane cannot sleep during the night at the Judge's place. In a flow of inspiration, she then begins the writing of First Impressions, the manuscript that will become Pride and Prejudice. However, Judge Langlois receives a letter informing him of the genteel poverty of Jane's family and he refuses to give Tom his blessing, declaring that he would wish Tom to be the whoremonger he had been rather than allow him to live in poverty because of a bad marriage.

The Miss USA beauty pageant aired on CBS from 1963 to 2002; during a large portion of that period, the telecast was often emceed by the host of one of the networks game shows. John Charles Daly hosted the show from 1963 to 1966, succeeded by Bob Barker from 1967 to 1987 (at which point Barker, an animal rights activist who eventually convinced producers of The Price Is Right to cease offering fur coats as prizes on the program, quit in a dispute over their use), Alan Thicke in 1988, Dick Clark from 1989 to 1993, and Bob Goen from 1994 to 1996. The pageants highest viewership was recorded in the early 1980s, when it regularly topped the Nielsen ratings on the week of its broadcast. Viewership dropped sharply throughout the 1990s and 2000s, from an estimated viewership of 20 million to an average of 7 million from 2000 to 2001. In 2002, Donald Trump (owner of the Miss USA pageants governing body, the Miss Universe Organization) brokered a new deal with NBC, giving it half-ownership of the Miss USA, Miss Universe and Miss Teen USA pageants and moving them to that network as part of an initial five-year contract, which began in 2003 and ended in 2015 after 12 years amid Trumps controversial remarks about Mexican immigrants during the launch of his Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016.

On the opening kickoff, Patriots linebacker Vince Redd forced a fumble of Carey Davis at the Steelers' 20-yard line that Davis eventually recovered; an unnecessary roughness penalty by the Steelers' Keyaron Fox meant the Steelers would begin their first drive from their own 10-yard line. Four plays in, Vrabel intercepted Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and returned it 5 yards to give the Patriots the ball at the Steelers' 14-yard line. After a Welker reception moved the ball to the Steelers' 2-yard line, Morris ran in for a 2-yard touchdown to give the Patriots a 7-0 lead. The Steelers' ensuing possession went three-and-out, but a holding penalty by Aiken on the punt moved the Patriots back to the Steelers' 20-yard line. A 27-yard Moss catch on the next play would help the Patriots reach midfield, but a third-down sack of Cassel set up a Patriots punt, which was returned by the Steelers' Santonio Holmes for 29 yards. Following a 21-yard reception by tight end Heath Miller to begin the drive, the Steelers moved further into Patriots territory on two Nate Washington catches of 15 and 16 yards, both on third down. The Steelers then failed to score from the Patriots' 2-yard line on third down, setting up a 20-yard Jeff Reed field goal to cut the Patriots' lead to 7-3. Three plays into the Patriots' next drive, Moss dropped a pass after he beat his defender inside the Steelers' 35-yard line, eventually setting up another Patriots punt on the final play of the quarter. An exchange of three three-and-outs began the second quarter, leading to Patriots drive that began from their own 40-yard line. A fourth down conversion put the Patriots in the Steelers' red zone, but the Patriots were unable to reach the end zone and settled for a 29-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended their lead to 10-3. Following a 31-yard Gary Russell kick return that gave the Steelers the ball at their own 37-yard line, the Steelers moved 63 yards on 9 plays, capping their drive with a 19-yard Holmes touchdown catch to tie the game at 10 with just under two minutes left in the half. Two plays later, the Patriots found themselves in Steelers' territory again following a 41-yard Faulk run; 35 seconds remained in the first half by the time the Patriots reached the Steelers' 9-yard line on a first down. The Patriots' next three plays would be Cassel pass attempts to Moss; the second of which was dropped by a leaping Moss in the back of the end zone. On fourth down, Gostkowski's 27-yard field goal attempt was no good to keep the game tied at 10 going into halftime. Following a 23-yard defensive pass interference penalty on Steelers cornerback Ike Taylor to begin the second half, the Patriots moved into Steelers' territory, but another sack of Cassel forced a Patriots punt. Starting from their own 14-yard line, the Steelers responded by embarking on a 14-play, 79-drive that reached the Patriots' 7-yard line on a second down but no further; a 25-yard Reed field goal gave the Steelers their first lead of the game, 13-10. With Hobbs, the usual kick returner, on the sidelines vomiting and suffering from cramps, Slater took the ensuing kickoff; the rookie muffed the catch and the fumble was recovered by Fox at the Patriots' 8-yard line. Two plays later, Roethlisberger hit wide receiver Hines Ward for an 11-yard touchdown reception to extend the Steelers' lead to 20-10. Faulk stepped in as kick returner for the next kickoff, which he returned to the Patriots' 29-yard line. However, on the next play, Cassel was strip-sacked by Steelers linebacker James Harrison; the fumble was recovered by linebacker LaMarr Woodley at the Patriots' 26-yard line. Despite a 19-yard Miller catch to begin the Steelers' possession, the Patriots forced the Steelers to kick a field goal; Reed's 20-yard kick gave the Steelers a 23-10 lead. Hobbs came back to return the next kickoff, which began the Patriots' drive from their own 35-yard line. Three plays in, Welker was hit from behind by Steelers safety Ryan Clark after a Cassel pass attempt was tipped; Clark was called for a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty to move the Patriots in Steelers' territory. On 3rd-and-11 from the Steelers' 48-yard line, Cassel was again strip-sacked by Harrison; this time linebacker James Farrior recovered the fumble at the Patriots' 47-yard line. The Steelers next drive began on the final play of the third quarter and reached as far as the Patriots' 22-yard line, where Reed missed a 40-yard field goal to give the Patriots the ball back at their own 30-yard line. The Patriots proceeded to move into Steelers' territory, but on 3rd-and-13 from the Steelers' 43-yard line, a Cassel pass intended for Watson was intercepted by safety Troy Polamalu at the Steelers' 11-yard line and returned for 23 yards in the Patriots' fourth turnover of the second half. Three plays later, a 31-yard Willie Parker moved the Steelers to the Patriots' 28-yard line; they would get as far as the Patriots' 22-yard line before Reed kicked a 45-yard field goal to extend the Steelers' lead to 26-10. With less than six minutes remaining in the game, the Patriots began their next series from their own 44-yard line after Reed's kick was returned from the Patriots' 30-yard line. On the first play of the drive, Cassel found Gaffney open inside the Steelers' 25-yard line, but the wide receiver dropped the pass; Taylor threw the ball back toward Gaffney after the play, drawing a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty that moved the Patriots into Steelers' territory. Seven plays later, on a first down from the Steelers' 14-yard line, Cassel was intercepted by linebacker Lawrence Timmons, who returned it 89 yards before being tackled at the Patriots' 1-yard line by Watson. Two plays later, Russell ran in for a 1-yard touchdown that gave the Steelers a 33-10 lead with less than three minutes to go in the game. The Patriots could not score on their next possession, ending the game and dropping the Patriots' record to 7-5. Question: How many field goals were missed in the game?

This report appears to be concerning the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), which is a fund established by the European Union to support workers who have lost their jobs as a result of globalisation-induced changes and structural shifts in world trade. In this specific case, it seems that the report discusses the mobilization of this fund with respect to several EU member countries - specifically, Sweden, Austria, and the Netherlands. The mentioning of the companies or regions (Volvo in Sweden, Steiermark in Austria, and Heijmans in the Netherlands) implies that the workers from these entities or regions might have been significantly affected by global changes and are hence, targeted beneficiaries of the EGF. The reference to \\"C7-0254/2009\\" would appear to be a specific document or case number related to this issue, likely representing the official proposal to mobilize the EGF for the workers from Volvo, Austria (Steiermark), and Heijmans. Reimer Böge, who is mentioned as having drawn up the report, was likely the one tasked with the investigation and documentation of this issue for the consideration of the Committee on Budgets, which is the body in charge of handling budgetary matters within the European Union. This item on the agenda underlines the fact that even in a globalised world, there are mechanisms in place at a supranational level such as the EGF to try to cushion the adverse effects globalisation might bring about, especially concerning job losses.

Options: - bedsores - sleep in - well rested - aren't ready when arrives - lay down Answer:","completion":"bedsores Step-by-step justification: 1. Analyze the question and options given: The question asks about the consequences of staying in bed too long, so we need to find a negative outcome associated with this behavior among the options. 2. Evaluate each option: a. bedsores - Bedsores are a result of prolonged pressure on the skin, which can happen when someone stays in bed for too long. b. sleep in - This option could be the result if someone oversleeps, but it doesn't necessarily describe a consequence of staying in bed too long. c. well rested - This option seems more positive than negative and might be the result if someone gets enough sleep, but doesn't imply staying in bed for too long. d. aren't ready when arrives - This option is somewhat unclear and doesn't specifically link to the scenario of staying in bed too long. e. lay down - This option is not a consequence but an action someone would perform to be in bed in the first place. 3.

Write a title for this article: After announcing on Instagram in May that part two of his successful 20/20 Experience album would arrive Sept. 20, Justin Timberlake delivered that project's first single on Friday. Dubbed \\"Take Back the Night,\\" the song continues JT's unpredictable string of musical announcements this year — often presented through strategic digital marketing pushes. Until this year, Timberlake hadn't released new music since 2006, and part two of the 20/20 Experience will come out just six months after part one debuted. \\"Why wait? #The2020Experience continues,\\" Timberlake said in a tweet on Friday. \\"Right now! Ladies & Gents, roll your windows down & play it loud!\\" His re-emergence began in January, when Timberlake posted a cryptic tweet on Twitter. The message teased his comeback. He also unleashed interactive art for The 20/20 Experience on image-tagging startup Stipple's site. He used Myspace to promote the album's lead single, \\"Suit & Tie.\\" (Note: Timberlake invests in Stipple and has ownership stake in Myspace.)The online blitz helped spark Timberlake's comeback into a commercial success. \\"Suit & Tie\\" featuring Jay-Z broke airplay records and globally topped iTunes' singles rankings by sales in its debut week. Meanwhile, The 20/20 Experience ranked number one on the Billboard 200 albums chart in its first week. The album's second single, \\"Mirrors,\\" has performed well. It peaked at number one on the Billboard's UK singles chart and number two on the U.S. chart. Timberlake will also embark on the \\"Legends of the Summer\\" tour with Jay-Z starting this month.

I read this Thornton Wilder play last year in eighth grade. I was also forced to sit through this weak translation of it on screen. Let me tell you, it's not a terrific play, it is easily surpassed, but man it deserves a much better shot. The acting was really lacking, the scenery-honest to God-looked like it was designed out of cardboard by a group of three-year-olds. As if it couldn't get worse, the sound quality is lousy...there is this mind-numbing 'buzz' whenever an actor speaks...and I also couldn't help but notice that the chemistry between George and Emily, well, is non-existant. The actors all seem very uncomfortable to be there. There is no music. It is in black and white, which would be OK but it brings out the cheesiness of it all the more. In any case I think that if you're going to make a point of seeing this movie, which I don't really reccomend, then don't aim your hopes to high. The play, as stalwart as it is, is probably better.

For Halloween this year Victoria bought a costume at store but Katrina made their own as","completion":"For Halloween this year, Victoria bought a costume at the store, but Katrina made their own, as they always enjoyed DIY projects and showing off their creative side. Step by step, Katrina crafted a one-of-a-kind outfit that would make a lasting impression at this year's festivities. Step 1: Idea Selection Katrina wanted to create something unique and fun, so they brainstormed different ideas for the costume. After considering various options, such as a mythical creature, a popular movie character, and a historical figure, they finally decided to dress up as a steampunk pirate. Step 2: Gathering Materials Once the idea was finalized, Katrina made a list of materials and props needed to create the steampunk pirate costume. This included a white blouse, a brown waistcoat, a long skirt, leather belts, goggles, pirate hat, various gears and cogs for decoration, gold and bronze spray paint, and a toy gun to modify with steampunk elements. Step 3: Modifying and Creating Pieces To create the steampunk pirate look, Katrina started by modifying the white blouse and skirt. They distressed the fabric and added patches of brown material to give it a worn-out appearance. They then painted the gears and cogs with gold and bronze spray paint and attached them to the brown waistcoat and other parts of the costume. Step 4: Assembling Accessories Katrina put together a set of goggles with gears and cogs on the sides, using a pair of old swimming goggles they found in the garage. They also customized the toy gun by painting it bronze and attaching gears, turning it into a makeshift steampunk weapon. Step 5: The Finishing Touches The costume was almost complete, but it needed some finishing touches. Katrina attached a leather belt around their waist and draped several chains with gears hanging from them. They also found a pirate hat and gave it a steampunk twist by attaching a few more gears and cogs onto the brim. With the steampunk pirate costume complete, Katrina was excited to reveal their creation at the Halloween party. Victoria, who had bought a pre-made witch costume, was amazed by the level of detail and effort Katrina had put into their outfit. Though their costumes were different, the friends had a great time together, marveling at Katrina's impressive ensemble and enjoying the Halloween festivities."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Information: - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León. - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea. - The North American Plate is a tectonic plate covering most of North America, Greenland, Cuba, the Bahamas, extreme northeastern Russia, and parts of Iceland and the Azores. It extends eastward to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and westward to the Chersky Range in eastern Siberia. The plate includes both continental and oceanic crust. The interior of the main continental landmass includes an extensive granitic core called a craton. Along most of the edges of this craton are fragments of crustal material called terranes, accreted to the craton by tectonic actions over the long span of geologic time. It is thought that much of North America west of the Rocky Mountains is composed of such terranes. - The Kula Plate was an oceanic tectonic plate under the northern Pacific Ocean south of the Near Islands segment of the Aleutian Islands. It is subducted under the North American Plate at the Aleutian Trench and is surrounded by the Pacific Plate. - The Arctic Ocean is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five major oceans. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea or simply the Arctic Sea, classifying it a mediterranean sea or an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean. Alternatively, the Arctic Ocean can be seen as the northernmost part of the all-encompassing World Ocean. - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt \\"(Eje Volcánico Transversal)\\", also known as the Transvolcanic Belt and locally as the Sierra Nevada (\\"Snowy Mountain Range\\"), is a volcanic belt that covers central-southern Mexico. Several of its highest peaks have snow all year long, and during clear weather, they are visible to a large percentage of those who live on the many high plateaus from which these volcanoes rise. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - The Mediterranean Sea (pronounced ) is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, and on the east by the Levant. The sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean, although it is usually identified as a separate body of water. - The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface). It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica. It is named after the country of India. The Indian Ocean is known as \\"Ratnkara\\", \\"\\"the mine of gems\\"\\" in ancient Sanskrit literature, and as \\"Hind Mahsgar\\", \\"\\"the great Indian sea\\"\\", in Hindi. - The Eastern Hemisphere is a geographical term for the half of the earth that is east of the prime meridian (which crosses Greenwich, England) and west of the antimeridian. It is also used to refer to Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, in contrast with the Western Hemisphere, which includes North and South America. This hemisphere may also be called the \\"Oriental Hemisphere\\". In addition, it may be used in a cultural or geopolitical sense as a synonym for the \\"Old World\\". - The Okhotsk - Chukotka Volcanic Belt ( OCVB ) is a Cretaceous volcanic belt in northeastern Eurasia . It is one of the largest subduction - zone related volcanic provinces in the world , stretching some 3200 km and comprising about 2 million km3 of volcanic and plutonic material . The volcanism within the volcanic belt was related to the subduction of the ancient Kula Plate , which moved in a northward direction about 55 million years ago . - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - A volcanic belt is a large volcanically active region. Other terms are used for smaller areas of activity, such as volcanic fields. Volcanic belts are found above zones of unusually high temperature (700-1400 °C) where magma is created by partial melting of solid material in the Earth's crust and upper mantle. These areas usually form along tectonic plate boundaries at depths of 1050 km. For example, volcanoes in Mexico and western North America are mostly in volcanic belts, such as the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt that extends 900 km from west to east across central-southern Mexico and the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province in western Canada. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".

Summarize the following: If you’re calling her or approaching her in person, you need to introduce yourself. While she might remember you, there is a good chance she might not remember your name. Take the opportunity to briefly introduce yourself. In addition, remind her of how you know each other. Say something like “Hey, Ann! I’m John – we know each other through Andy.” Don’t be offended if she doesn’t know your name or forgets it later. Whatever way you decide to contact her, you should consider using humor. Humor will make a potentially awkward situation funny, and help remind her of your virtues. There are many ways you can do this: Start with a light-hearted joke about something you might think is funny. For example, if you remember she really likes Oreo cookies, you can joke about those. Joke about fashion. For instance, say “I was just in the mall and saw someone that looks exactly like you wearing crocs.” Use self-deprecating humor. For example, say, “Hey, do you remember me? The guy who wears the absurd cowboy boots.” Contact her and start up a conversation about how she’s doing in life. If you’re interested in a romantic relationship with her, this is a good way to find out if she is available. In addition, this is a very honest and straightforward way of reinitiating contact. Generally, you can say something like “It’s been a while since we spoke. How are you doing?” If you knew her from work, and one of you has moved on, ask her “So, what’s going on with work these days?” In the case you knew each other through a mutual friend, you could simply ask about whether she’s spoken to that person recently. While it may seem disingenuous, send her a text in which you’re talking to someone else, like a friend or a romantic interest. Make sure the text is simple, but somewhat intriguing. She may respond telling you that you’re texting the wrong person, or she might pretend to be the person you’re supposed to be texting. Whatever happens, use it as an opportunity to talk to her. You should eventually let her know that you knew that it was her you were texting or calling. Chances are, though, she will already know.","completion":"When trying to reinitiate contact with someone, introduce yourself and remind her of your connection.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1 and Question 2 are not asking the exact same thing; however, they are related, as both questions are seeking to understand the advantages of using Quora over Google for answers. The difference in the two questions is that Question 1 asks for a comparison between the two platforms, while Question 2 assumes Quora is better and wants an explanation of its advantages. To provide a detailed and long answer addressing both questions, we will first compare Quora and Google for answers and then, if Quora has advantages, point out how it is better than Google. Quora is a platform where individuals can ask questions and receive answers from other users who have knowledge or experience in the subject matter. It serves as a community-driven platform that enables users to actively engage with each other to obtain specific answers or insights into various topics. On the other hand, Google is a search engine that allows users to search for information from a vast array of online sources including websites, blogs, forums, and more. Now, let's discuss some of the ways Quora may be considered better than Google for certain kinds of answers: 1. Personalized answers - With Quora, users can ask specific questions and receive customized answers from people with expertise in that area. Google, being a search engine, directs users to existing content from various sources that may not always cater to the user's exact question or specific needs. 2. Expertise-driven insights - Quora has subject matter experts in multiple domains, professionals, and enthusiasts who volunteer answers to those seeking help. This contributes to high-quality, reliable, and well-informed responses, which may not always be the case when browsing through multiple search results on Google. 3. Social interactions - Unlike Google, Quora establishes a sense of community through interactions within its platform. People can have conversations, follow domains of their interest and experts they trust, contribute, and validate answers by upvoting or downvoting them. 4. Focused content curation - Quora enables users to follow topics of interest, rendering a more specific, subject-focused browsing experience. Google, by design, covers the entire internet, which may lead to information overload and lower relevance of search results at times. However, it is essential to remember that Quora and Google serve different purposes. While Quora is a platform to obtain specific answers and engage with a community, Google is designed to provide access to a vast array of information available on the internet. Quora can be useful for personalized insights and interactive experiences, but Google offers a much broader perspective. In conclusion, it may not be fair to categorically state that one platform is better than the other since they cater to different needs. Quora can be better for personal insights and community-based information, while Google offers users an unparalleled library of diverse and extensive information from the web. The choice between the two will depend on the context, type of question the user has, and their personal preferences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

So I thought I’d get a few things off my chest, and confess a few of the reasons why I probably shouldn’t be calling myself a travel blogger. And yes, these are all very much first world problems. 1. I hate photographs of myself. Ironic, no? Especially when one of the first rules of blogging is all about the cult of personality. I just don’t like them. I wish I did, but there are few times that I fancy a photo and even less when I like the result. 2. We nip into a MacDonalds at least once every trip. It has now become a tradition between nicer restaurants to nip in and order a Big Mac and fries at some point of our trip – but especially in Europe for some reason. Why do their MacDonalds meals taste better? 3. Pastels aren’t really my shade. Again, I wish I could be super girly, twirling in gossamer skirts painted in spring shades but I’m just not. My colour palette is decidedly autumnal/jewel hued and usually sticks to a scarf draped around my neck in a hopefully fashionable manner. And I’m totally ok with that. 4. I once travelled all the way to New Zealand and back (stopping in 3 countries enroute) without a lens cap on my brand new, fairly expensive camera. This is in no way a #humblebrag about the trip, but a comment on how impractical I can be – and how careful I also am. I lovingly wrapped my camera in a soft scarf every day for 3 weeks, growled under my breath at anyone who looked like they might jostle me and at one point found...

Your task is to generate a rating for the product on a scale of 1-5 based on the review. The rating means 1: extremely poor, 2: poor, 3: neutral or mixed, 4: good, 5: extremely good. Problem:Great stuff and dependable, especially when there are a million brands \\"out there\\" to choose from. I love the stuff. For really high end desires, I go with the Apollo Olive Oils from California. But I buy a whole lot more of this stuff and will buy it again and again. Solution:","completion":"Part #1: Generate a rating for the product based on the review. Usage: In the given review, the user has mentioned several positive aspects, such as \\"Great stuff,\\" \\"dependable,\\" \\"I love the stuff,\\" and \\"will buy it again and again.\\" Therefore, based on these positive comments, we can generate a rating of 5 for the product. This meets the criteria as the review clearly indicates a high level of satisfaction with the product. Part #2: Understand the rating scale of 1-5. Usage: The rating scale consists of five levels: 1 (extremely poor), 2 (poor), 3 (neutral or mixed), 4 (good), and 5 (extremely good). In this example, the given review falls under the \\"extremely good\\" category, as the customer highly recommends the product and intends to buy it repeatedly. Thus, it meets the criteria for a rating of 5. Part #3: Consider the context and comparison to other products in the review. Usage: The user in the review compares the product to the Apollo Olive Oils from California, stating that they opt for Apollo for high-end desires, but still buys a lot more of the given product. This comparison to another brand suggests that the user values the given product consistently. In this case, the rating of 5 remains appropriate due to the overall positive sentiment and regular purchasing behavior expressed in the review."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here is an article: Done right, cookie-selling can pack as many business lessons as calories. As the Girl Scouts Web site argues: “Every time you buy a box of cookies, you help girls learn 5 essential skills — goal setting, decision making, money management, people skills, and business ethics. . . . They learn and they earn, all thanks to you!” But these lessons aren’t learned when Scouts sell outside grocery stores or via mobile app, or, even worse, when parents ask their colleagues to purchase Girl Scout cookies, a query I recently received at a casual work lunch. My friend wasn’t prepared for the lecture that followed. I’d be more than happy to buy cookies from his daughter, I said, but only if she called me on the phone to personally ask for the sale. This goes beyond helicopter parenting. Ensuring that kids sell their own cookies is responsible parenting. When I was a Scout, I remember getting my order form and sitting down with my mom and dad to ask which of their friends I might approach for sales. There were long weekends of walking door to door with my parents, working on my “cookie elevator pitch” in between houses. I knew which houses were easy sells and which were tougher. I didn’t realize at the time that I was learning marketing strategy in addition to sales. When I returned to the office after that recent lunch, I began reviewing an interview for a documentary I am working on called “All the Queen’s Horses ,” about Rita Crundwell, a former comptroller of Dixon, Ill., who is serving 191 / 2 years in federal prison for embezzlement. As a comptroller — and very similar to my duties as a cookie-peddling Scout — Crundwell collected checks from residents. But after collecting these checks and depositing them in city bank accounts, she transferred the money to a secret bank account and purchased horses, jewelry and real estate for more than 20 years without her Dixon neighbors suspecting a thing. As a 10-year-old Scout, I remember almost having a Crundwell moment when I asked my mother one day if I could “borrow” from my cookie-sale stash when I needed lunch money — as long as I put it back in time to turn the money in to our Scout leader. My mother looked at me sternly and explained that the money did not belong to me — taking it wouldn’t be right. Our neighbors trusted me because I was a Girl Scout, she said, and it would be unethical to borrow the money, even if I intended to pay it back. Twenty-five years later, I’m interviewing business professionals who rationalized their behavior as “borrowing” money from their companies and planning to return it at some later date. I’ve seen good people commit extraordinary crimes. Specifically, I think back to my interview with Diann Cattani, who said she “borrowed” almost 500,000 from her company over a period of two years. I believe she intended to pay the funds back later. Unfortunately, they were never repaid, and she spent 18 months in a federal prison. Now Cattani spends much of her time lecturing business students about avoiding fraud. Selling cookies, I learned more than how to resist the temptation to embezzle. Since my parents were not involved in the process, other than walking me around the neighborhood, the buck stopped with me. I was in charge of all orders and counted my money every night. I learned never to set unrealistic sales goals; to always take responsibility for my work; and that if someone says “no,” have confidence, because another will say “yes.” A few weeks ago, I received a phone call. It was my friend’s 7-year-old daughter with her Girl Scout Cookie sales pitch. Not only was she poised and professional, she closed the deal by asking for the names of friends who might be interested in purchasing cookies. I was impressed — and ordered three boxes of Thin Mints. If she follows my old-school approach to Girl Scout Cookie sales, she may not be the sales leader in her troop, but she could be the next Hillary Rodham Clinton, Sandra Day O’Connor, Sally Ride, Barbara Walters or Gloria Steinem — all legendary Girl Scouts. I trust that they sold cookies themselves, learning about accountability along the way. I am raising a future Girl Scout in my house, and I look forward to our cookie-season chats as chances to teach her that there are no shortcuts in business — or in life. kelly@heliosdigital.com Read more from Outlook, friend us on Facebook, and follow us on Twitter.

Summarize: You may not be able to solve the situation--your mother is still going to be sick no matter what you do. However, you can be there for her. You can show up when you're needed. You can offer support and encouragement. It may not be dealing with the problem as you'd liked to do, but you will be doing something, which can help alleviate your feelings of uselessness. You can pray, meditate, or just take a few deep breaths, but whatever way, take a moment to calm yourself down. Accept that you do not have control over the situation. Your mother may be sick, but you can take the time you are spending with her to develop a better relationship with her than you've had in the past. Even if it doesn't change anything, it will help others realize that they aren't the only ones who are dealing with these feelings, which is a way you can provide support. It also opens up the discussion, so others have a chance to talk about their feelings, as well. Long-term stressful situations can lead to depression, and feeling useless could be a symptom of depression, especially if it is accompanied by other symptoms. Symptoms of depression include having trouble focusing, feeling pessimistic, not being interested in things you usually enjoy, feeling guilty, being extra tired, being consistently sad, and even experiencing physical symptoms like headaches or stomach aches. Feeling sad on occasion doesn't mean you’re depressed. Depression is a sustained period of not caring and feeling sad. When symptoms start to overrun your life, you may be depressed. If you are depressed, you may need medication, or you might need to seek out counseling to help you work through some issues, which may help alleviate your feelings of uselessness. Remember, being depressed is not a sign of weakness. It can be caused by a traumatic event in your life, but it could also be a chemical imbalance that needs to be corrected. Also, certain medications, your genes, and other problems like illnesses can also lead to depression.","completion":"The situation you are facing involves your mother being sick, and while you may not be able to solve the issue or change her health condition, there are various ways you can support and be there for her. By showing up, offering encouragement, and providing emotional support, you can contribute positively to her life and help ease your feelings of uselessness. During this challenging time, taking a moment to calm yourself through prayer, meditation, or deep breathing exercises can help. Acknowledging that you do not have control over the situation is an important step, but focusing on strengthening the relationship you have with your mother can provide a positive outcome for both of you. Sharing your feelings of helplessness and concern with others can provide both you and them a sense of connection and support, opening up conversations for mutual understanding and encouragement. However, be cautious not to overlook the potential of developing depression during long-term stressful situations. Depression is characterized by symptoms such as trouble focusing, pessimism, loss of interest in things you usually enjoy, feelings of guilt, exhaustion, consistent sadness, and even physical symptoms like headaches or stomach aches. While occasional sadness is normal, when these symptoms start to overwhelm your life, you may need to consider the possibility of depression. Depression can be caused by numerous factors, including traumatic events, chemical imbalances, certain medications, genetic predisposition, and other illnesses. It is not a sign of weakness and seeking help, either through medication or counseling, can help alleviate feelings of uselessness and improve your overall well-being.

It works like this: someone posts a topic to their blog that is critical or controversial. This person can either be a community member, commentator, employee or otherwise; it doesn’t matter who the person is. Then what happens is a series of comments are posted to that blog entry from readers that are critical of the post, thus challenging the author on their views. The author then either deletes the blog entry or disables the comments based on the feedback. In other words, a viewpoint is shared, an invitation for comment is provided, but that invitation is then revoked when the author of the blog post is dissatisfied with the response from their readers. I have seen this happen countless times over the years and I don’t like this. I believe we should all be accountable for our words. Our words have the ability to inspire, to entertain, to challenge, but to also hurt. Actions have consequences, and so do words.

Question: \\"Who has little trouble studying Ashkenazi Jews?\\" Context: \\"A 2006 study found Ashkenazi Jews to be a clear, homogeneous genetic subgroup. Strikingly, regardless of the place of origin, Ashkenazi Jews can be grouped in the same genetic cohort – that is, regardless of whether an Ashkenazi Jew's ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Lithuania, or any other place with a historical Jewish population, they belong to the same ethnic group. The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group. Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly common, many Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews. This trend keeps Ashkenazi genes prevalent and also helps researchers further study the genes of Ashkenazi Jews with relative ease. It is noteworthy that these Haredi Jews often have extremely large families.\\" Answer:","completion":"The question \\"Who has little trouble studying Ashkenazi Jews?\\" refers to the ease with which researchers and scientists can study the genetics and genealogy of Ashkenazi Jews due to their largely homogeneous genetic makeup and endogamous practices. The context provided from the 2006 study highlights the distinct genetic subgroup that Ashkenazi Jews form, regardless of their geographical origin in Europe. This distinctive genetic homogeneity allows researchers to study Ashkenazi Jews with relative ease compared to other populations that exhibit a higher degree of genetic diversity. The study lends credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group and allows researchers to explore various aspects of their genetic makeup, including potential genetic markers for diseases, unique traits, and ancestry. The endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and the ongoing exclusive marriage practices among Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, reinforce the prevalence of Ashkenazi genes. Researchers who benefit from this relatively straightforward population to study include geneticists, anthropologists, historians, and other medical professionals who can focus on understanding the prevalence of specific genetic diseases or conditions within the Ashkenazi community, tracing their origins and historical migrations, or identifying potential treatments or preventive measures related to this particular ethnic group. The fact that Haredi Jews often have extremely large families further supports research efforts in studying Ashkenazi genes, as it provides an ample number of subjects for genetic or genealogical studies while maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the findings. With this increased sample size, researchers have a unique opportunity to draw statistically significant conclusions that can be beneficial to both Ashkenazi Jews and the broader scientific community. In conclusion, those who have little trouble studying Ashkenazi Jews are researchers and scientists who can take advantage of the genetic homogeneity and endogamy that characterized this population, as well as their distinctive demographic practices like having large families. These factors combine to create a rich source of information for researchers to study the genetics, genealogy, history, and medical aspects related to Ashkenazi Jews with relative ease and accuracy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Math problem: Solve 0 = -17*a + 102 - 221 for a. What is the solution?","completion":"Alright kiddo, let's break down this problem and solve it step by step. We want to find the value of \\"a\\". Our equation is: 0 = -17*a + 102 - 221 First, we need to add 102 and -221 which are like taking 102 apples and then taking away 221 apples. So that's: 102 - 221 = -119 Now our equation looks like this: 0 = -17*a - 119 To solve for \\"a\\", we need to move -119 to the other side. Since it's -119, it will turn into 119 when we move it, like this: 0 + 119 = -17*a So now we have: 119 = -17*a Now, we need to divide by -17 to find out what \\"a\\" equals. Remember, if you have a negative number divided by another negative number, the result will be positive. So, 119 divided by -17 is: a = -7 There you go! The solution is a = -7.

A Canadian woman has been denied entry to the U.S. by a border agent who cited a 2012 hospitalization for depression. Ellen Richardson, a paraplegic, had planned a 6,000 cruise departing from New York. The agent said she could 'pose a threat to herself or others' based on the 2012 hospitalization. Richardson wants to know how the agent had access to her personal medical information. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Canadian Woman Denied Entry to U.S. Over Past Hospitalization for Depression Introduction: A Canadian woman, Ellen Richardson, who intended to depart on a 6,000 cruise from New York, was left astonished when she was denied entry to the United States. The reason cited by a border agent was her 2012 hospitalization for depression, raising questions about how the agent gained access to her personal medical information. Body: Ellen Richardson, a paraplegic woman, had planned and saved up for her dream cruise trip that would start from New York, but her plans fell apart when she was told she could not enter the United States. The border agent responsible for this decision based it on a previous incident where Richardson had been hospitalized for depression in 2012. The agent claimed that Richardson could 'pose a threat to herself or others' due to her past hospitalization for mental health issues. This explanation has not only left Richardson in shock but also prompted her to raise concerns about how this confidential medical information ended up in the hands of the border agent. Step 1: Gather information on privacy laws and medical information disclosure To shed light on the situation, it is essential to gather information on privacy laws surrounding the disclosure of personal medical information, both within and between countries. It is also crucial to understand the authority rights that border agents possess to access private data. Step 2: Investigate if there were any previous similar incidents Investigating previous incidents, where individuals had been denied entry based on their medical history, will help in understanding how often and under what circumstances such confidential information is used for border control purposes. Step 3: Speak to experts about the legality of the agent's actions Consulting with legal and privacy experts will provide valuable insights into whether the border agent's actions are in line with the law or if Richardson's rights have been infringed upon. Step 4: Reach out to Ellen Richardson for her perspective on the situation To ensure a balanced and informative article, it is necessary to hear from Richardson herself about her experience, emotions, and future plans following this incident. Step 5: Contact relevant authorities and ask for an explanation Reaching out to relevant authorities to request an explanation for the border agent's decision and the disclosure of Richardson's medical information will be an essential part of the investigation. Their response may offer clarification or even prompt changes in policies and procedures. Conclusion: The denial of entry to Ellen Richardson, based on her previous hospitalization for depression, raises significant concerns about the disclosure and use of personal medical information for border control purposes. As the story unfolds, it is hoped that further investigations will bring clarity to the legality of these actions and prevent such incidents from reoccurring in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information: - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Paul Nobuo Tatsuguchi ( Tatsuguchi Nobuo ) , sometimes mistakenly referred to as Nebu Tatsuguchi ( August 31 , 1911 -- May 30 , 1943 ) , was a surgeon in the Imperial Japanese Army ( IJA ) during World War II. He was killed during the Battle of Attu on Attu Island , Alaska on May 30 , 1943 . A devout Seventh - day Adventist , Tatsuguchi studied medicine and was licensed as a physician in the United States ( US ) . He returned to his native Japan to practice medicine at the Tokyo Adventist Sanitarium , where he received further medical training . In 1941 , he was ordered to cease his medical practice and conscripted into the IJA as an acting medical officer , although he was given an enlisted rather than officer rank because of his American connections . In late 1942 or early 1943 , Tatsuguchi was sent to Attu , which had been occupied by Japanese forces in October 1942 . The United States Army landed on the island on May 11 , 1943 , intending to retake the island from the Japanese . Throughout the ensuing battle , Tatsuguchi kept a diary in which he recorded its events and his struggle to care for the wounded in his field hospital . He was killed on the battle 's final day after the remaining Japanese conducted one last , suicidal charge against the American forces . Tatsuguchi 's diary was recovered by American forces and translated into English . Copies of the translation were widely disseminated and publicized in the US after the battle . The American public was intrigued by a Christian , American - trained doctor serving with Japanese forces on the island and by his apparent participation in assisting with the deaths of wounded Japanese soldiers in his field hospital during the battle 's final days . Translated excerpts from Tatsuguchi 's diary have been widely quoted in Western historical accounts of the battle , especially his final entry in which he recorded a farewell message to his family . - The Aleutian Islands Campaign was a military campaign conducted by the United States in the Aleutian Islands, part of the Alaska Territory, in the American theater and the Pacific theater of World War II starting on 3 June 1942. A small Japanese force occupied the islands of Attu and Kiska, where the remoteness of the islands and the challenges of weather and terrain delayed for nearly a year a larger U.S./Canadian force to eject them. The islands' strategic value was their ability to control Pacific transportation routes, which is why U.S. General Billy Mitchell stated to the U.S. Congress in 1935, \\"I believe that in the future, whoever holds Alaska will hold the world. I think it is the most important strategic place in the world.\\" The Japanese reasoned that control of the Aleutians would prevent a possible U.S. attack across the Northern Pacific. Similarly, the U.S. feared that the islands would be used as bases from which to launch aerial assaults against the West Coast. - The , literally \\"Army of the Greater Japanese Empire\\", was the official ground-based armed force of the Empire of Japan, from 1871 to 1945. It was controlled by the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office and the Ministry of War, both of which were nominally subordinate to the Emperor of Japan as supreme commander of the army and the navy. Later an Inspectorate General of Military (Army) Aviation became the third agency with oversight of the army. During wartime or national emergencies, the nominal command functions of the emperor would be centralized in an Imperial General Headquarters (IGHQ), an ad-hoc body consisting of the chief and vice chief of the Army General Staff, the minister of war, the chief and vice chief of the Naval General Staff, the inspector general of military aviation, and the inspector general of military training. - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II. - The as part of the Supreme War Council was established in 1893 to coordinate efforts between the Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy during wartime. In terms of function, it was approximately equivalent to the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff and the British Chiefs of Staff Committee. - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history. - The was the historical Japanese nation-state and great power that existed from the Meiji Restoration in 1868 to the enactment of the 1947 constitution of modern Japan. - Attu is the westernmost and largest island in the Near Islands group of the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, and the westernmost point of land relative to Alaska, the United States, North America and the Americas. The island became uninhabited in 2010. - The Emperor of Japan is the head of the Imperial Family and is the ceremonial head of state of Japan's system of constitutional monarchy. According to the 1947 constitution, he is \\"the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people.\\" Historically, he is also the highest authority of the Shinto religion as he and his family are said to be the direct descendants of the sun-goddess Amaterasu, and his importance also lies in dealing with heavenly affairs, including Shinto ritual and rites throughout the nation. - Alaska is a U.S. state located in the northwest extremity of North America. The Canadian administrative divisions of British Columbia and Yukon border the state to the east; its most extreme western part is Attu Island; it has a maritime border with Russia to the west across the Bering Strait. To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seasthe southern parts of the Arctic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest. Alaska is the largest state in the United States by area, the 3rd least populous and the least densely populated of the 50 United States. Approximately half of Alaska's residents (the total estimated at 738,432 by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2015) live within the Anchorage metropolitan area. Alaska's economy is dominated by the fishing, natural gas, and oil industries, resources which it has in abundance. Military bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy. - The Territory of Alaska or Alaska Territory was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from August 24, 1912, until January 3, 1959, when it was admitted to the Union as the State of Alaska. The territory was created as the District of Alaska on May 17, 1884. - The Battle of Attu, which took place from 1130 May 1943, was a battle fought between forces of the United States, aided by Canadian reconnaissance and fighter-bomber support, and the Empire of Japan on Attu Island off the coast of the Territory of Alaska as part of the Aleutian Islands Campaign during the American Theater and the Pacific Theater and was the only land battle of World War II fought on incorporated territory of the United States.

Marcus's father disappeared with the eagle standard of the ill-fated legion, and Marcus hopes to redeem his family's honour by bravely serving in Britain. Shortly afterwards, only Marcus's alertness and decisiveness save the garrison from being overrun by Celtic tribesmen. He is decorated for his bravery but honourably discharged due to a severe leg injury. Living at his uncle's estate near Calleva (modern Silchester) in southern Britain, Marcus has to cope with his military career having been cut short and his father's name still being held in disrepute. Hearing rumours that the eagle standard has been seen in the north of Britain, Aquila decides to recover it. Despite the warnings of his uncle and his fellow Romans, who believe that no Roman can survive north of Hadrian's Wall, he travels north into the territory of the Picts, accompanied only by his slave, Esca.

The reason often given is that if eat you too much food at night, the body will store all those excess kilojoules as fat because we’re inactive until the next day. The reason sounds plausible, but if it was one hundred percent true then world hunger could be solved by just feeding people one meal at night time. What really matters is how much is eaten over days and weeks for weight gain or weight loss, not so much when it is eaten. There is merit though in advice to eat less at night time as it can help a person to cut back on the total quantity of food eaten. Eating lots of food in the evening can also be a marker for unhealthy dietary habits, especially if much of that extra food is going to fuel couch surfing exploits. So even though advice to eat less at night time seems logical, it hasn’t actually been well tested by science to see how effective it can be for losing weight. Filling this gap, a short-term study involving 29 healthy men looked at how 2 weeks of restricted night time eating fared against 2 weeks of ‘normal’ evening eating. Advice on restricting night eating was very clear: avoid any food or drink containing kilojoules between the hours of 7 pm and 6 am the next morning. No other changes to the participants’ diet or lifestyle was required so each person was free to eat whatever they wished during the day time hours until early evening. Twenty seven of the twenty nine people complied with following this advice for 2 weeks as well as the 2 week control period. Eating at night a waistline hazard So did people eat less when restricting night time eating? Yes, equal to 1000 kilojoules (about 250 Calories) per day less than during their normal eating pattern. This small energy difference was enough to see the men lose 0.4 kg over the 2 week restriction period, and gain 0.6 kg over the 2 week control period. What is the most probable reason why the participants decided to join the trails?

On September 19, having buried their non-essential possessions in a mound marked by a tent pole, they set out in search of settlements. Progress was hampered by the poor physical condition of the men, in particular Eriksen, who was badly affected by frostbite. On September 21 they halted at two empty huts, probably part of a hunting camp, where Alexey raised spirits by shooting a deer to replenish their dwindling food stocks. De Long allowed his exhausted party several days' rest before resuming the march.On September 28 the party found a large hut, with signs of recent occupation–edible food in the store, and moccasin tracks in the snow. When searches in the locality brought no sign of people, De Long decided to move on. By October 4, Eriksen could not continue; the party halted at another abandoned hut where, on October 6, Eriksen died. On October 9, with the condition of several men worsening, De Long decided to send two of the fittest in the group, Nindemann and Noros, to seek help. Ambler was offered the opportunity to go with them, but felt that his duty as a doctor required him to stay with the main body.For the next week De Long's party struggled on, sometimes making barely a mile a day.

Summarize this article: The spate of vehicle attacks prompted discussion about what more the city could do to insulate pedestrian areas from traffic, and whether, in Times Square at least, it made sense to further reduce traffic along some blocks. At the news conference, the mayor did not take questions and said little regarding tactics, besides installing the bollards. Bollards are not new to Times Square. They were installed by the dozens in the area in 2016. Last May, bollards on 45th Street eventually stopped the car whose driver, high on PCP, had driven along three city blocks of sidewalk, killing an 18-year-old woman and injuring 20 people. The city’s transportation commissioner, Polly Trottenberg, said that installing bollards is complicated because of the infrastructure and subway lines below some of the city’s busiest areas. “If you want to make them so they can really stop a vehicle, they need to go some distance into the ground,” Ms. Trottenberg said. A spokesman for the Transportation Department, Scott Gastel, said that there are “nearly 50 locations with such permanent bollards” around the city, but that they had mainly been installed by private entities, or diplomatic missions. ||||| Mayor Bill de Blasio on Tuesday announced new measures to prevent vehicle ramming terror attacks in New York City.Starting later this month, the city will begin installing more than 1,500 new permanent bollards in Times Square and other public spaces.The metal stations are meant to address the threat of vehicle borne terror attacks and keep pedestrians safe.\\"These bollards will make sure vehicles can never come into places where pedestrians are,\\" de Blasio said.The mayor mentioned the Halloween terror attack , in which alleged ISIS sympathizer Sayfullo Saipov allegedly drove a rented truck into pedestrians on the jogging path adjacent to the Hudson River.\\"When a vehicle plows into a group of innocent pedestrians, it's disgusting,\\" de Blasio said.The mayor also mentioned what happened in Times Square in May, when Richard Rojas, a Navy veteran allegedly high on drugs, plowed through a crowded sidewalk, killing an 18-year-old visitor from Michigan.\\"These are some of the busiest streets in the world,\\" de Blasio said. \\"People have to get around, but they also have to be safe.\\"The city plans to spend 50 million on the new protective bollards. The first ones will be temporary, followed by the permanent installation beginning in March 2018. The complete rollout of these permanent structures will be completed over the next few years.The city conducted a review of locations, including business corridors, tourist attractions and iconic sites, identifying 10 key locations to be addressed with permanent fixtures. Most of these locations are currently protected with temporary security structures.The transportation committee voted in support of bill 1658A , and it passed unanimously (50-0) through the full council.---------- |||||","completion":"The Mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio, announced new measures aimed at preventing vehicle-based terrorist attacks in some of the city's most crowded areas. The city plans to invest 50 million into the installation of more than 1,500 permanent bollards, or metal poles designed to keep vehicles out of pedestrian zones, in key locations such as Times Square and other public spaces. The installation of these bollards is set to begin later in the month and are an expansion on existing fixtures, dozens of which were installed in Times Square in 2016. The need for such measures has become evident in light of recent incidents, including the attack in which Sayfullo Saipov allegedly used a rented truck to kill pedestrians near the Hudson River, and the incident in Times Square when Richard Rojas, a Navy veteran under the influence of drugs, drove through a crowded sidewalk, killing an 18-year-old visitor from Michigan. Bollards have proven to be effective in halting vehicle attacks, as evidenced by the event last May when bollards on 45th Street managed to stop a driver who was high on PCP after he had covered three city blocks. However, their installation can prove complex as they need to be embedded some distance into the ground to ensure their effectiveness, which is challenging given the infrastructure and subway lines located below much of the city's busiest areas. Temporarily, about 50 locations outfitted with these permanent bollards are primarily placed by private entities or diplomatic missions, but the new installation project, which begins in March 2018, aims for a more extensive roll-out over the next few years. This initiative has seen unanimity in its support, with the transportation committee's endorsement of bill 1658A and its unanimous pass by the full council. Ten crucial sites, currently protected by temporary safety structures, have been identified to be fitted with these permanent installations. Besides providing physical safety, these bollards will offer pedestrians peace of mind and security, ensuring bustling streets of New York City continue to thrive with life while minimizing the risk of dreadful vehicular attacks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Don't Say a Word Context: In 1991, a gang of thieves steal a rare 10-million gem, but, in the process, two of the gang double-cross their leader, Patrick Koster (Sean Bean) and take off with the precious stone. Ten years later, on the day before Thanksgiving, prominent private practice Manhattan child psychiatrist, Dr. Nathan R. Conrad (Michael Douglas), is invited by his friend and former colleague, Dr. Louis Sachs (Oliver Platt), to examine a disturbed young lady named Elisabeth Burrows (Brittany Murphy) at the state sanatorium. Having been released from prison on November 4, Patrick and the remaining gang members break into an apartment which overlooks Nathan's apartment, where he lives with his wife Aggie (Famke Janssen) and daughter Jessie (Skye McCole Bartusiak). That evening, Patrick kidnaps the psychiatrist's daughter as a means of forcing him to acquire a six-digit number from Elisabeth's memory. As Nathan visits Elisabeth, she is reluctant at first, but he gains her trust laterâespecially when he reveals that his daughter has been kidnapped and will be killed if he doesn't get the number they want. Dr. Sachs admits to Nathan that the gang who kidnapped Jessie also kidnapped his girlfriend to force him to acquire the number from Elisabeth. Sachs is then visited by Detective Sandra Cassidy (Jennifer Esposito) who reveals to him that his girlfriend has been found dead. Meanwhile, Aggie hears Jessie's voice and realizes the kidnappers reside in the apartment nearby. The kidnappers send one of them to kill Aggie while the others escape with Jessie, but Aggie sets an ambush and kills him. After Nathan takes Elisabeth out of the sanatorium, she remembers certain events regarding the gang. It is revealed that Elisabeth's dad was a member of the gang that committed the robbery ten years prior and that he double-crossed them and took the stolen gem. However, other members of the gang later found him and ordered him to reveal where he had hidden the gem, subsequently pushing him in front of a subway train. The gang members were...

Having been a regular there for his research, he sets up an appointment, his cab driver told to wait outside. Taking insult when the head monk calls his work \\"fiction\\", Lovecraft insists that all his writings are true.

His wife has defended him as a 'big teddy bear' and 'as hard-core as baby' Article:","completion":"Title: Michael Van Hise: The Disturbing Case of the Man Denied Bail in Federal Court Introduction The recent case of Michael Van Hise has shocked the nation, as the defendant stands accused of attempting to hire a former NYPD officer, Gilberto Valle, to kidnap, rape, and murder a woman. The details of the case have horrified people across America, shining a light on the dark side of human nature and raising questions about online interactions and the line between fantasy and reality. This article delves into the disturbing details of the case and examines the reasons behind the court's decision to deny bail to the accused. The Accusations against Michael Van Hise Michael Van Hise has been accused of offering NYPD officer Gilberto Valle 5,000 to kidnap a woman. The intended victim was to be subjected to sexual assault and ultimately murdered by Van Hise. The connection between the two men allegedly came from an online chat on a fetish website, where they discussed their dark desires. In addition to this exposed crime, Van Hise also reportedly engaged in conversations discussing the rape of an infant, further exacerbating the severity of the offenses he is charged with. The Involvement of Gilberto Valle, the Infamous 'Cannibal Cop' The involvement of former NYPD officer Gilberto Valle in Van Hise's case ties it to another notorious case that made headlines around the world. Valle, known as the \\"Cannibal Cop,\\" was convicted in 2013 of conspiracy to kidnap, cook, and eat women. The fact that Van Hise sought the assistance of such a dangerous and infamous individual speaks to the serious intentions behind the accused's actions. The Defense of Van Hise's Wife Despite the shocking allegations against him, Michael Van Hise has received support from an unlikely source - his wife, who has publicly defended him as being a \\"big teddy bear\\" and claiming her husband is \\"as hard-core as a baby.\\" There have been some arguments that the interactions between Van Hise and Valle were purely fantasy-based, and the possibility of this being considered a mere thought crime has been the concern for some legal experts. The Denial of Bail in Federal Court Given the ghastly nature of the accusations, it comes as no surprise that the court has decided to deny bail to Michael Van Hise. The court likely considered the potential risks to public safety if the accused was released on bail. Furthermore, the association with a known convicted criminal, such as the \\"Cannibal Cop,\\" also raises concerns about the possible connections to previously undisclosed criminal activities. The Ongoing Debate about Online Interactions The case of Michael Van Hise brings about a concerning discussion on the nature of online interactions and the line between fantasy and reality. While the internet allows people to engage in conversations they may never have in real life, it's crucial to recognize when a conversation escalates into criminal territory. The details of this case serve as a stark reminder that fantasies, when combined with violent intentions and the willingness to act on them, can have life-altering consequences for both the offenders and their victims. Conclusion The case of Michael Van Hise is an unsettling reminder of the darkness that can lurk within seemingly ordinary individuals. The gravity of the charges, alongside his connections to the infamous 'Cannibal Cop', leaves little wonder why the court denied bail. As the case moves through the judicial system, society must reflect on the consequences of online interactions, and when fantasy reaches criminal levels. The outcome of Michael Van Hise's trial is eagerly awaited, as it may potentially set precedents for similar cases in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Movie title: The Fifth Element Context: In 1914, aliens known as Mondoshawans arrive at an ancient Egyptian temple to collect, for safekeeping, the only weapon capable of defeating a great evil that appears every 5,000 years. The weapon consists of four stones, representing the four classical elements, and a sarcophagus containing a fifth element in the form of a human, which combines the power of the other four elements into a divine light capable of defeating the evil. The Mondoshawans promise their human contact, a priest from a secret order, that they will come back with the element stones in time to stop the great evil when it returns. In 2263,[b] the great evil appears in deep space in the form of a giant ball of black fire, and destroys an attacking Earth spaceship. The Mondoshawans' current contact on Earth, priest Vito Cornelius (Ian Holm), informs the President of the Federated Territories (Tom Lister Jr.) of the history of the great evil and the weapon that can stop it. As the Mondoshawans return to Earth they are ambushed by Mangalores, a race hired by the industrialist Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg (Gary Oldman), who has been instructed by the great evil to acquire the stones. The Mondoshawans' spacecraft is destroyed, though the stones are not on board; the only item recovered is a hand of The Fifth Element.

Movie plot title: The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior Movie plot: Mathayus aims to avenge the death of his father at the hand of Sargon, now king of Akkad, by taking service in his Black Scorpions squad. After completing his training he is tasked by Sargon to kill Noah, Mathayus's own brother. He saves him and escapes the city, but a magic arrow follows them and kills Noah. Mathayus boards a ship to Egypt, accompanied by his childhood friend Layla. He intends to get the Spear of Osiris in Egypt, which he believes will be able to pass through Sargon's black magic protection. A fellow traveller, Greek poet Aristophanes (Ari), tells Mathayus and Layla that the Spear only kills Egyptian creatures, but the Sword of Damocles will work. The trio travels to Greece, where they can enter the Underworld to retrieve the Sword of Damocles. On the way, they fall into a cell and are surrounded by men left as sacrifices for the Minotaur. Some of the sacrifices are mercenaries who owe allegiance to Mathayus' father, so they help him and Layla to defeat the Minotaur, with help from a Chinese captive named Fung. The enlarged group travel to the Underworld, where they are attacked by the goddess Astarte. Layla and Astarte fight, while Fung and Ari search for and find the sword. Astarte tries to send Layla to hell, but Mathayus frees her, and they all escape to the human realm. Astarte orders Sargon to get her sword back, and he asks for more dark powers. The group reach Akkad, where Sargon turns on a machine that dumps oil into the water supply. The oil and water begin to flow through statues into the city, which is then set on fire. Using the Sword of Damocles, Mathayus fights through to Sargon but finds his own father, who turns out to be Sargon in disguise. Sargon uses the confusion to disarm Mathayus and they begin fighting.

Everything else is great, the graphics are top-notch, the engine sounds are a litte weak, and the sim-factor is too-realistic (but fun). This game will not run well on anything slower than a P3 or a Athlon with a spendy 3d card and 128Mb of RAM. If you have the Horsepower, it should be a fun game.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"If less carbohydrate breakdown occurs, the pancreas will be affected in a softer or lesser extent. This perturbation may influence the second effect mentioned, which is the release of insulin when blood sugar levels rise. Since carbohydrates are the main source of glucose (blood sugar) in the body, a reduced breakdown of carbohydrates would result in lower levels of glucose in the bloodstream. Consequently, the pancreas would sense this lower blood sugar level and respond by releasing less insulin than it would under normal carbohydrate breakdown circumstances. However, if blood sugar levels drop too low, the pancreas would still release glucagon to help increase blood sugar levels. In summary, less carbohydrate breakdown may lead to less insulin release from the pancreas but would not necessarily impact the release of glucagon, as its role is to respond when blood sugar levels get too low."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in international waters. Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.UNCLOS defines various areas of water. \\"Internal waters\\" are on the landward side of a baseline and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. \\"Territorial waters\\" extend to 12 nautical miles (22 kilometres; 14 miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource. A \\"contiguous zone\\" extending a further 12 nautical miles allows for hot pursuit of vessels suspected of infringing laws in four specific areas: customs, taxation, immigration and pollution. An \\"exclusive economic zone\\" extends for 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres; 230 miles) from the baseline.

The CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc has been shown in tissue culture to be able to repel cell-free virions from the cell surface into extracellular space. We hypothesized that cenicriviroc might exhibit a similar effect, and tested this using clinical samples from the Phase IIb study 652-2-202, by measuring rates of intracellular DNA decline. We also monitored viral RNA levels in culture fluids.', 'We infected PM-1 cells with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 BaL in the presence or absence of inhibitory concentrations of cenicriviroc (20 nM) or maraviroc (50 nM) or controls. Viral load levels and p24 were measured by ELISA, quantitative PCR and quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR at 4 h post-infection. Frozen PBMC DNA samples from 30 patients with virological success in the Phase IIb study were studied, as were early and late reverse transcript levels. Docking studies compared binding between cenicriviroc/CCR5 and maraviroc/CCR5.', 'Unlike maraviroc, cenicriviroc did not cause an increase in the amount of virus present in culture fluids at 4 h compared with baseline. The use of cenicriviroc did, however, result in lower levels of intracellular viral DNA after 4 h.

He leaves behind a lot of dirty clothes, and Mrs. Smith, who is not feeling well, does not want to do any housework that day. Her friend Jo comes to visit her and notices that the rooms are dirty. Mrs. Smith explains that she doesn't want to do any housework and resorts to not wearing her glasses to make the rooms seem cleaner. From this story, we can deduce that Mr. Smith is constantly busy after work, which is why he does not want to help with the housework. The other options are not supported by the information provided in the story. Mr. Smith is not often ill, and Mrs. Smith is not always lazy.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: The regular, rhythmic contractions of the diaphragm are controlled by the brain stem. It sends nerve impulses to the diaphragm through the autonomic nervous system. The brain stem monitors the level of carbon dioxide in the blood. If the level becomes too high, it “tells” the diaphragm to contract more often. Breathing speeds up, and the excess carbon dioxide is released into the air. The opposite events occur when the level of carbon dioxide in the blood becomes too low. In this way, breathing keeps blood pH within a narrow range.

Malloch was the worst affected; he died on 17 May, but his tent-mate Mamen was too ill to see to his burial, so the body lay in the tent for several days, creating a \\"frightful smell\\", until McKinlay arrived to help. Mamen himself died ten days later of the same debilitating disease.From early June the diet was augmented with the appearance of birds. These birds and their eggs became a vital source of food; as the supply of seal meat dwindled to nothing, the party was reduced to eating rotten flippers, hide, or any part of a seal that was remotely edible. The sharing of birds became another bone of contention; according to Williamson \\"Wednesday last, [Breddy and Chafe] really obtained 6 eggs and 5 birds instead of 2 eggs and 4 birds as they reported.\\" Breddy was suspected of other thefts.

A drunken thug who attacked a teenager had downed nearly 50 cans of lager and two litres of vodka during a day-long binge. It means 24-year-old Russell Large had drunk around 40 times the daily recommended alcohol limit for men when the attack took place three days before Christmas last year. Large, a former mechanic and chef who has been unemployed for more than a year, admitted attacking the 17-year-old stranger in a Plymouth shop following an entire day of drinking, which involved him consuming 48 cans of Foster’s lager and two litres of vodka. Binge-drink assault: After Russell Large, 24, downed nearly 50 cans of Foster's lager and two litres of vodka in a day, he would have been 40 times over the recommended daily alcohol limit for men when the attack took place. Although it was not specified which size can Large was drinking on the day of the attack, a 440ml can of Foster’s contains 1.8 units of alcohol, while a two-litre bottle of standard vodka contains 75 units, making a total of 161.4 units. The UK Chief Medical Council advises a daily limit of four units for a man, meaning Large had drunk just over 40 times that recommendation in one day. According to the NHS, binge drinking also leads to the body not being able to process all the alcohol, meaning the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) rises. A BAC of more than 400milligrams per 100 millitres of blood can result in severe breathing difficulties, coma and even death. However, a person's BAC is dependent on a number of factors including weight, the type of alcohol they have consumed, whether they regularly drink and how much food they have in their stomach. Large, of Budshead Road in the city, told magistrates in Plymouth today that he was sorry after admitting one charge of common assault. “It’s sad,” he added. The court heard Large had recently broken up with his girlfriend and had gone on a drinks binge in a local park. He got into an argument with his victim, who took refuge behind the counter of a nearby corner shop, but Large found and attacked him. Large grabbed his victim by the throat before headbutting him, leaving the teenager with injuries to his left eye. Defending, Michael Crumley described Large’s alcohol consumption as “quite staggering”. Russell Large pleaded guilty at Plymouth Magistrates for attacking the teenager following a drinking binge. He said: “That goes some way to explaining his actions. He is very ashamed and deeply regrets his actions. \\"He wishes to apologise to this poor, unfortunate young person (victim).\\" The court was told Large had started drinking at the age of 14 and came from a family with a \\"heavy drinking culture\\". His consumption of alcohol had also increased in the time leading up to the attack. Large's defence also told the court that he had no memory of the actual assault. Chairwoman of the bench, Dr Sonia Sidhom, sentenced Large to a 12-month community order, and ordered him to pay £50 compensation and £40 court costs. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"A 24-year-old man named Russell Large drank a lot of alcohol one day before Christmas last year.

Gavin Christopher Newsom was born in San Francisco, California, to Tessa Thomas (nee Menzies) and William Alfred Newsom III, a retired state appeals court justice and attorney for Getty Oil. He is a fourth-generation San Franciscan. His father is of mostly Irish descent; one of Newsom's maternal great-grandfathers, Scotsman Thomas Addis, was a pioneer scientist in the field of nephrology and a professor of medicine at Stanford University. Newsom is the second cousin, twice removed, of musician Joanna Newsom. As mayor, Newsom focused on development projects in Hunters Point and Treasure Island. He signed the Health Choices Plan in 2007 to provide San Francisco residents with universal healthcare. In 2004, Newsom gained national attention when he directed the San Francisco city-county clerk to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, in violation of the state law passed in 2000. Implementation of Care Not Cash began on July 1, 2004. As part of his Care Not Cash initiative, 5,000 more homeless people were given permanent shelter in the city. As of October 21, 2007, about 2,000 people have been placed into permanent housing with support. Other programs initiated by Newsom to end chronic homelessness include the San Francisco Homeless Outreach Team (SF HOT), and Project Homeless Connect (PHC). On October 27, 2004, during a strike by hotel workers on a dozen San Francisco hotels, Newsom joined UNITE HERE union members on a picket line in front of the Westin St. Francis Hotel. He vowed that the city would boycott the hotels by not sponsoring city events in any until the hotels agreed to a contract with workers. The contract dispute was settled in September 2006. In 2005, Newsom pushed for a state law to allow communities in California to create policy restricting certain breeds of dogs. He requested that then state senator Jackie Speier introduce a change to then-existing California law, which stated that counties could not target specific breeds of dog. The animal control agency under his direction created a working dog task force report that cited Denver, Colorado, as a best practice for a law in California. In 2009, Newsom came under attack for the City of San Francisco's policy of illegally harboring juvenile criminal aliens. A sanctuary city, San Francisco had long been circumventing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement by harboring or sending the aliens back to their own native countries. In 2009, Newsom received the Leadership for Healthy Communities Award along with Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City and three other public officials for his commitment to making healthful food and physical activity options more accessible to children and families. In 2008, he had hosted the Urban Rural Roundtable to explore ways to promote regional food development and increased access to healthy affordable food, and he secured 8 million in federal and local funds for the Better Streets program, which ensures that public health perspectives are fully integrated into urban planning processes. He signed a menu-labeling bill into law, requiring that chain restaurants print nutrition information on their menus. In 2010, Newsom was named \\"America's Most Social Mayor\\" by Samepoint, based on analysis of the social media profiles of mayors from the 100 largest cities in the United States. That same year, Newsom was removed from the San Francisco County Democratic Central Committee, because, according to SFCDCC chairman Aaron Peskin, Newsom no longer resided in the city. did he do anything for homeless people in the article","completion":"Yes, Gavin Newsom did several things for homeless people as mentioned in the article: 1.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the sentiment expressed in the phrase: 1. \\"Claude Chabrol's camera has a way of gently swaying back and forth\\": This part of the sentence presents a positive sentiment. By referring to the specific technique Claude Chabrol uses in his filmmaking, the author acknowledges and appreciates the unique visual style that the director employs. The word \\"gently\\" underscores a subtlety that sets the stage for the evolving emotions and scenarios in his films. 2. \\"as it cradles its characters\\": This phrase further enhances the positive sentiment because the author uses the word \\"cradles,\\" which evokes a feeling of comfort and support. It suggests that Chabrol's camera work helps to develop and reveal the nuances of the characters in the film, fostering a deep connection between the viewer and the characters. 3. \\"veiling tension beneath otherwise tender movements\\": This part of the phrase brings forth a negative sentiment, but in the context of film appreciation, it could be viewed as a positive aspect. By saying \\"veiling tension,\\" the author points out that although the camera work is gentle and tender, it is still able to capture the hidden tension that exists between characters or within the story. The fact that Chabrol can simultaneously present tenderness and tension adds a layer of complexity to his work, which is often considered a positive quality in filmmaking. In conclusion, the phrase appears to be primarily positive with a slight hint of negative sentiment, depending on the reader's perspective. Overall, it seems to convey admiration for Claude Chabrol's ability to skillfully blend the tender and tense aspects of his characters and storytelling through his unique camera work. This showcases the multifaceted nature of films and the talent of the director, which is likely the message the author intended to communicate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Major talked for the party, and did not perceive, or choose to perceive, what a gloom and silence pervaded the other two sharers of the modest dinner. It was evening before Helen and Laura came into the sitting-room to join the company there. She came in leaning on Laura, with her back to the waning light, so that Arthur could not see how pallid and woe-stricken her face was, and as she went up to Pen, whom she had not seen during the day, and placed her fond arms on his shoulders and kissed him tenderly, Laura left her, and moved away to another part of the room. Pen remarked that his mother's voice and her whole frame trembled, her hand was clammy cold as she put it up to his forehead, piteously embracing him. The spectacle of her misery only added, somehow, to the wrath and testiness of the young man. He scarcely returned the kiss which the suffering lady gave him: and the countenance with which he met the appeal of her look was hard and cruel. \\"She persecutes me,\\" he thought within himself, \\"and she comes to me with the air of a martyr!\\" \\"You look very ill, my child,\\" she said. \\"I don't like to see you look in that way.\\" And she tottered to a sofa, still holding one of his passive hands in her thin cold clinging fingers. 1.

He described these mathematically as 2n combinations where n is the number of differing characteristics in the original peas. Although he did not use the term gene, he explained his results in terms of discrete inherited units that give rise to observable physical characteristics. This description prefigured the distinction between genotype (the genetic material of an organism) and phenotype (the visible traits of that organism).

Hypothesis: The paper could have a notice about hayrides inside.","completion":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that the paper could have a notice about hayrides inside from the given context. The context provides crucial information on how to enjoy a hayride and suggests different methods for finding and locating a hayride near an individual's location. The methods mentioned include searching for notices in the paper, browsing online events and activities, or seeking recommendations through word-of-mouth. Newspapers often have ads, event listings, and announcements on various public attractions and activities, including hayrides. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the paper could contain information about hayrides, such as details on the venue, timing, and pricing, or even insightful experiences from past participants. Furthermore, the context emphasizes that hayrides are a popular activity, particularly near towns and cities, and that many farms offer these experiences. This further strengthens our hypothesis, as it shows that hayrides are likely well-known and widely promoted events.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The earliest signs of people on Jamaica are the remains of the Arawak, an AmerIndian society that originated on the north coast of South America. Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517.

Article: It was September of 2003 and I was struggling to find work after experiencing downsizing . I had fallen on some of the grandest challenges of my life. I found myself sitting in my house constantly worried. I decided to force myself to find some volunteer work to occupy my thoughts. The first place I sought out was the Arizona Humane Society. It offered me a program, \\"Equestrian Therapy Program\\" ,whose mission is to build self-esteem and confidence in children who have been through difficult times in their lives. Being with animals was the only time I truly felt 1 had a place in the world. But I had never been around a horse in my life. I found myself a little apprehensive during my first day--being around such large strong animals was much harder than the three cats I'm accustomed to caring for. I found that I wasn't different during my first day around these fantastic creatures from the kids who came into the program. But there is a strange transformation when one is around horses. I found myself playing the role of student, observer, teacher, mentor, worker, friend, and companion; not only to the kids,but to the horses and staff! Before long, I was good at handling the horses and kids and having a grand time working with human and animal elements equally. I realize this experience has helped me to develop my horizons in ways I never thought likely. I started this wanting to give others help and realized in doing so I was the one who really benefited the most. 1 believe the companionship and peace that comes from working with our animal brothers is something that can and will make the world a better place!

Options are: [1]. negative [2]. positive","completion":"The sentiment of the tweet \\"I chipped 2 teeth today\\" can be described as negative. The reason for labeling this sentiment as negative is because chipping teeth is generally considered an unfortunate and unpleasant event, causing discomfort, potential pain, and possibly necessitating dental treatment or repair. When people express negative experiences, it usually means that an undesirable or unfavorable situation has occurred, often making them feel unhappy, dissatisfied, or uncomfortable. In this case, chipping two teeth indicates that the individual is likely facing physical discomfort or inconvenience, and usually, people express sympathy and understanding towards these situations. It's essential to consider the context and content of words shared alongside human emotions to determine the sentiment accurately. Since this tweet shares an unfortunate experience that may lead to physical discomfort or even pain, the sentiment analysis categorizes it as negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She takes pride in her mother's ever-growing support and love, knowing that she is the only child to inherit her mother's wealth and legacy. Everything in Sasha's life seemed perfect, that is until she uncovers a shocking secret. One day, during a visit to her mother's house, Sasha finds an old photo album hidden in the attic. As she flips through the pages, memories of her childhood fill her heart. Suddenly, she sees a picture that captures her attention - a little girl wearing a bracelet identical to the one Sasha had as a child, but it's not her in the picture. Puzzled and intrigued, she decides to confront her mother. Her mother hesitates and finally reveals a long-buried secret - the existence of Sasha's twin sister, Alexandra. Due to unforeseen circumstances, their mother had to give Alexandra up for adoption shortly after their birth, leaving Sasha growing up with no knowledge of her twin's existence. Sasha's uneasy feeling of always missing a part of herself starts making sense. Determined to find her sister, Sasha embarks on an emotional journey, leaving her successful career and comfortable life behind. With the unexpected help of a private investigator, she uncovers clues leading them closer to Alexandra's whereabouts. Along the way, Sasha discovers new aspects of her own identity and untold stories about her family's past. Finally, Sasha meets Alexandra, an aspiring artist living a humble life, far from the luxuries Sasha was accustomed to. Despite their different paths, a strong and undeniable bond forms between them. Overwhelmed with joy and sorrow, they confront their mother, struggling to understand the reasons behind her choice to separate them. Throughout the unwinding of events, Sasha's perspective on life is transformed, and she realizes the importance of family, love, and accepting the past to embrace the future.

QUEBEC CITY — Emotions were on display when U.S. President Donald Trump met other G-7 leaders at their annual summit in Canada on Friday, but the discussions were civilized and diplomatic, according to sources. Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). She said Canada, however, will not change its mind about the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs which she termed “illegal.” Trump imposed the tariffs on the grounds that weak domestic industries could affect U.S. national security.

The rescued party, having had its last contact with civilization in 1914, was unaware of the course of the Great War. News of Shackleton's safe arrival in the Falklands briefly eclipsed war news in the British newspapers on 2 June 1916. The expedition returned home in piecemeal fashion, at a critical stage in the war, without the normal honours and civic receptions. When Shackleton himself finally arrived in England on 29 May 1917, after a short American lecture tour, his return was barely noticed.Despite McNish's efforts in preparing and sailing on the James Caird voyage, his prior insubordination meant that, on Shackleton's recommendation, he was one of four men denied the Polar Medal; the others whose contributions fell short of Shackleton's expected standards were John Vincent, William Stephenson and Ernest Holness. Most of the members of the expedition returned to take up immediate active military or naval service. Before the war ended, two—Tim McCarthy of the open boat journey and the veteran Antarctic sailor Alfred Cheetham—had been killed in action, and Ernest Wild of the Ross Sea party had died of typhoid while serving in the Mediterranean. Several others were severely wounded, and many received decorations for gallantry. Following a propaganda mission in Buenos Aires, Shackleton was employed during the last weeks of the war on special service in Murmansk, with the Army rank of Major. This occupied him until March 1919. He thereafter organised one final Antarctic expedition, the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition on Quest, which left London on 17 September 1921. From the Endurance crew, Wild, Worsley, Macklin, McIlroy, Hussey, Alexander Kerr, Thomas McLeod and cook Charles Green, all sailed with Quest.Shackleton died of a heart attack on 5 January 1922, while Quest was anchored at South Georgia.

U.S. engineers have photographed water droplets using a high-speed camera mounted directly above the real liquid beads to investigate how they behave. They found that a moving - or 'oscillated - drop of water can form over 30 different shapes, including a 'standing wave pattern' and an 'azimuthal wave pattern' Experts took the photographs by shining a light through mesh holes and photographing the light that reflected off the drop's surface as it moved. Scroll down for video. Engineers at Cornell University found an oscillated drop of water can form over 30 different shapes, including an azimuthal wave pattern (pictured). The images were captured on a high speed camera. Just two of the different shapes the water droplets create. The scientists said their study stands out because of the high-quality imaging we were able to capture of these oscillating droplets. The researchers believe their results could provide a fundamental insight into. how droplets behave and that their study could have applications in everything from inkjet. printing to microfluidics. Susan Daniel, assistant professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at Cornell University, led the study,which is published in Physical Review E. Graduate student Chun-Ti Chang designed and performed the experiments, which involved a high-speed, high-resolution camera, while Paul Steen, professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering, and his former student, Josh Bostwick, led the theoretical portion of the study. Professor Daniel said: 'What is really special about this study is the high-quality imaging we were able to capture of these oscillating droplets.' The droplets were captured when A light was shined through mesh holes. and deflection of the drop's surface refracts the light, which is seen. as a deformation of the mesh and is photographed by a high-speed camera. The researchers mechanically oscillated the drops at varying frequencies to observe and record their movements. Here, the movement of a 'zonal' shaped droplet is captured at regular intervals in milliseconds. 'We created an imaging platform where we could look at the drop from the top, to enable us to see the characteristic shapes better than anyone has before.' The imaging platform, which Chang has named the 'Omniview' because of the different angles at which the droplet can be observed, consists of a glass slide, the droplet sitting on top and a 50-micron-square metal mesh, like a window screen, underneath. A light is shined through the mesh holes and deflection of the drop's surface refracts the light, which is seen as a deformation of the mesh and captured by a high-speed camera. The engineers created a special imaging platform to allow them to view water droplets from above, using a high-spreed camera. They discovered over 30 distinct shapes, three of which are pictured. The researchers mechanically oscillated the drops at varying frequencies to observe and record their movements. The oscillation can be likened to when a violin string is plucked. Certain natural frequencies correspond to a given length of string, the same way certain frequencies correspond to the shape of a drop of a specific size. The researchers created a detailed table of droplet shapes according to frequency, as well as comparing these results to previous theoretical predictions involving the dynamics of oscillating droplets. Deirdre Costello (left) and Professor Daniel (right) examine droplets on a silicon wafer treated with a gradient chemical coating. The engineers created an imaging platform where they could look at the drop from the top, to enable them to see the characteristic shapes better than anyone has before. Classical theories don't capture the dynamics entirely, but new predictions, made by collaborators Professor Steen and Mr Bostwick, take into account the physical effect of the solid substrate in contact with the droplet and match the images in the photo album. The researchers also observed that some of the droplets take on multiple shapes when vibrated with a single driving frequency, much like physicists observing two different energy states simultaneously in an excited molecule. Professor Daniel said: 'Without the high-speed imaging, we wouldn't have been able to see the drops exhibiting these kinds of mixed behaviors.' The engineers believe that their study of the behaviour of water droplets (pictured) will inform better methods of printing as the spread of a drop as it touches a surface will dictate image resolution. NASA, who part-funded the study, is interested in understanding how droplets on surfaces move in low gravity. The detailed, clear table of oscillating drop modes should lend insight into further fundamental studies, as well as a host of applications, according to the engineers. For example, NASA is interested in understanding how droplets on surfaces move in low gravity. The research might also prove useful in developing better printers as in high-resolution printing, the spread of a drop as it touches a surface will dictate image resolution. The surface chemistry of the roller, printer and ink will have profound effects on the technology. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

Article:","completion":"Title: Naked Encounters: Plaisance Commuters Left Stunned During Rush Hour Subtitle: There's no wardrobe to malfunction when there's no wardrobe to begin with! In a bewildering turn of events, commuters at Plaisance station were left stunned during rush hour when a man appeared stark naked amidst the sea of bustling passengers. This unusual occurrence inevitably led to delays and confusion, particularly when the man was taken away by security personnel at approximately 7.30 pm on an otherwise unremarkable weekday. It's no secret that urban life can be difficult and navigating the overcrowded world of public transportation irritating on a good day, but one doesn't expect a \\"Naked and Afraid\\" contestant to audaciously wander through the tightly packed crowd during rush hour. How did this man manage to evade being noticed until he had reached the platform? And where were his clothes? While it's impossible to understand what could have motivated such uninhibited behavior, one can't help but marvel at this powerful display, which has now given us a peculiar story to share about our commute to work. The reactions of the commuters at Plaisance station were varied, with some astonished and others appalled by the man's bold choice of attire. Passengers scrambled to move out of the way, and numerous photos and videos were shared on social media, creating a buzz in the online world. This risqué incident did not come without consequences, as officials at the station quickly took action. Security personnel apprehended the naked individual and escorted him away from the premises, potentially saving him from further embarrassment – or further adoration, depending on how he viewed the situation. Interestingly, this bizarre event is not the first of its kind on public transport. Just last week, a naked woman strolled through a Chicago transit train, leaving passengers perplexed and amused. That particular event generated a whirlwind of reactions on social media, with users sharing their experiences of the inexplicable encounters, debating whether these acts are offensive or simply an amusing curiosity. Both of these occasions raise questions about the general state of decorum in public spaces. With many people straying ever farther from conventional norms, particularly in urban centers, perhaps it is only natural that such occurrences are becoming more commonplace. Should these displays of nudity be ignored as harmless eccentricities, or should they be cause for concern? Currently, it's unclear whether these events are indicative of something more significant within modern society, but one thing is certain – they certainly make for an interesting talking point. In a world where public transportation is often the backdrop of numerous mundane elements of daily life, these bold displays of uninhibited behavior stand out and stir curiosity. For now, commuters and social media users can only speculate about what compelled these naked transgressors to ignore society's conventions in favor of freely baring it all. It remains to be seen whether these incidents are merely isolated cases or a growing trend, but they undeniably serve to remind us all that life is never dull, even during a seemingly uneventful rush hour commute. So, to the naked crusaders who have so fearlessly bared all in the name of bold self-expression, or perhaps simply lost control of their inhibitions – you've left us bemused, baffled, and perhaps, just a little bit entertained!"},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Question: To whom Oscar is telling about the wedding?

They intend to share a rental car to San Malina for the wedding. But the trip begins with Oscar forgetting Felix's suitcase at the Budget car rental, including wedding gifts and wardrobe inside. Oscar also loses the directions to San Malina when his cigar ashes burn them. He and Felix become hopelessly lost, unable to even remember the name of the town where they are headed, so many California city names sounding alike. They end up in a rural area, where the car rolls off a cliff and catches fire. If that were not enough, they get arrested several times by the local police, first for catching a ride in a truck carrying illegal Mexican immigrants. At a bar in town, they meet two extroverted women, Thelma and Holly, and buy them drinks. Accepting an offer of a ride from a stranger even older than themselves, Felix and Oscar end up inside a 150,000 vintage Rolls Royce Silver Wraith with a dead body and get arrested a second time. Irritated, exhausted and convinced that they'll never get to the wedding, they get arrested yet again for consorting with armed Rednecks who believe Oscar and Felix were flirting with their wild women, Thelma and Holly. The boys are freed and driven directly to the local airport by the police, who are only too pleased to be rid of them. A woman boarding the airplane is also en route to...

On the night of Sunday, March 3, 1946, Sammy Fuller and Linda Mae Jenkins park on a lovers' lane.

While Sammy tries starting the car, the man breaks his window and pulls him out, cutting him on the broken glass. The man then gets inside the car with Linda. The next morning, Linda is found on the side of the road barely alive. While at the crime scene, Deputy Norman Ramsey reports that both victims are still alive.

Given the following context: John Michael Wright, who at the height of his career would interchangeably sign himself \\"Anglus\\" or \\"Scotus\\", is of uncertain origin. The diarist John Evelyn called him a Scotsman, an epithet repeated by Horace Walpole and tentatively accepted by his later biographer, Verne. However, writing in 1700, the English antiquarian Thomas Hearne claims Wright was born in Shoe Lane, London and, after an adolescent conversion to Roman Catholicism, was taken to Scotland by a priest. A London birth certainly seems supported by a baptismal record, dated 25 May 1617, for a \\"Mighell Wryghtt\\", son of James Wright, described as a tailor and a citizen of London, in St Bride's Church, Fleet Street, London.What is known is that, on 6 April 1636, the 19-year-old Wright was apprenticed to George Jamesone, an Edinburgh portrait painter of some repute. The Edinburgh Register of Apprentices records him as \\"Michaell, son to James W(right), tailor, citizen of London\\". The reasons for this move to Scotland are unclear, but may have to do with familial connections (his parents may have been London Scots) or the advent of plague in London. During his apprenticeship, Wright is likely to have lodged at the High Street tenement near the Netherbow Gate that served as Jameson's workplace. The apprenticeship was contracted for five years, but may have been curtailed by Jameson's imprisonment in late 1639. There is no record of any independent work by Wright from this period (his earliest known painting being a small portrait of Robert Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury, painted in the early 1640s during his time in Rome).It is also possible that Wright met his wife during his Scottish residency. Nothing is known of her, except from a statement of thirty years later which describes her as \\"related to the most noble and distinguished families of Scotland.\\" If this is accurate, it may explain how Wright was later able to find aristocratic patronage. All that is known for certain is that Wright had at least one child by her, a son, Thomas. answer the following question: What is the full anglicized name of the person whose later biographer tentatively accepted the epithet of Scotsman coined by John Evelyn?

From the moment we cross the Turkish border into Syria, evidence of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria's draconian and brutal rule lingers. More than a month after the group was driven from the town of Addana, residents here drive through the streets, pointing out where ISIS fighters carried out executions and left bodies to rot for all to see. \\"That's where they had one of their checkpoints,\\" says rebel fighter Abu Sa'ed, pointing to a small concrete building on the side of the road as we speed past. ISIS arrived in Addana about a year ago, initially welcomed in the conservative town by Islamist fighters. But within a few months, ISIS had entrenched itself and begun exerting its harsh order through what one fighter calls \\"terrorism and punishment.\\" \\"ISIS came in and took over one area and announced it was an Islamic state and did whatever they wanted,\\" Abu Sa'ed says. In the passenger's seat, fellow fighter Abu Jaafar sighs, his AK-47 trained out the window. \\"They used to leave the bodies of people they executed at the checkpoint for days,\\" he says. \\"The corpses would rot. No one could avoid looking at them.\\" Amid the civil war in Syria, another war is taking place -- one that pits moderate and Islamist rebels against radicals from ISIS, a group so radical that even al Qaeda has reportedly distanced itself from it. Both groups of fighters are opposed to the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. For months, reports have been emerging from northern Syria about ISIS atrocities. In Addana, bullet holes riddle the walls at a former ISIS prison. Most of them are at the same level -- the average height of a man. \\"Those are mostly from the executions,\\" says Abu Jamal, another fighter. \\"Others are from the battle.\\" At the town's courthouse, a fresh coat of white paint covers the black mark left by ISIS -- known to paint buildings black as they take over Syrian towns. Executions would take place out front. In the back, freshly dug dirt marks where some of the bodies were buried in mass graves. Abu Jamal points to a pile of burning trash. ISIS beheaded one of the top rebel commanders -- placing his head in that very spot -- in broad daylight when the market was packed with people as a warning: anyone who dared oppose them would have the same fate. In early January, rebel groups banded together and launched an offensive against ISIS in Addana and other areas in northern Syria. \\"We had to leave the fronts with the regime,\\" Abu Jamal says, \\"and fall back to fight ISIS and liberate the already liberated areas.\\" Still, many in Addana are too afraid to speak openly. So deep is their fear, they don't even want to be seen with us. Next to the former prison, a family waits, hoping for closure. Volunteers shovel dirt from a grave they dug up before. Video filmed at the time shows four contorted corpses. It's among many mass graves rebel fighters have unearthed. \\"We found a foot, a shoe, and a jacket,\\" Addana resident Ayoush Ali tells us. Her neighbor Mohammed Ismail joins us. His two younger brothers are missing, he says. \\"It's my brother's jacket. He just went out to get sugar and tomatoes.\\" A man drops a pile of children's socks, covered in dirt, on the ground. \\"His wife wanted socks for their kids,\\" Mohammed says, still disbelieving. The day after we meet Mohammed, the bodies are dug up. It's three of his brothers who were killed by ISIS. He had thought one of them was in jail. He crouches on the ground, covering his face, shoulders shaking as he sobs. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"1. The town of Addana, which is located near the Turkish border in Syria, is slowly recovering from the horrors inflicted by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The group had occupied the town and implemented harsh rules, carrying out public executions as a display of power and to instill fear among locals. 2. ISIS had gained initial entry into Addana by aligning with Islamist fighters who were protesting the central governance. However, the group soon declared the town as part of their self-proclaimed Islamic State and began ruling with an iron fist. 3. This account of ISIS's rule in Addana forms part of a broader narrative of the civil war within Syria, where other rebel groups aligned against both the Syrian government and ISIS. Reports abound of the atrocities committed by ISIS in northern Syria. 4. Evidence of ISIS presence and atrocities are still visible in the town, from bullet-riddled walls of former ISIS prisons to the newly painted courthouse where executions were carried out. Mass graves have been unearthed near these sites. 5. Early in the previous year, rebel groups launched an offensive against ISIS, thereby liberating Addana and other parts of northern Syria. However, the fear ISIS instilled is still palpable among locals, many of whom were reluctant to talk or be seen with outsiders. 6. A specific case of the terror sowed by ISIS is illustrated through the story of Addana resident Mohammed Ismail, who discovered three of his brothers had been executed by ISIS after their bodies were found in an excavated grave. One of them was previously believed to be in jail, but the discovery showed that all three had fallen victim to ISIS's brutal rule. 7. These narratives underline the grim reality of life under ISIS, the extreme violence inflicted on ordinary citizens, the fear that continues to linger even after the group's territorial removal, and the ongoing struggle for stability and justice as Addana and northern Syria recover from ISIS's atrocities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Information: - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II. - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history. - During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack. - In politics and military planning, a war effort refers to a coordinated mobilization of society's resourcesboth industrial and humantowards the support of a military force. Depending on the militarization of the culture, the relative size of the armed forces and the society supporting them, the style of government, and the popular support for the military objectives, such war effort can range from a small industry to complete command of society. - A military alliance is an international agreement concerning national security, when the contracting parties promise to support each other in case of a crisis that has not been identified in advance. Military alliances differ from coalitions, as coalitions are formed for a crisis that are already known. - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability. - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - The Focke - Wulf Project II was a design study for a single seat jet fighter carried out in Germany during World War II. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Total war is warfare that includes any and all civilian-associated resources and infrastructure as legitimate military targets, mobilizes all of the resources of society to fight the war, and gives priority to warfare over non-combatant needs. The American-English Dictionary defines total war as \\"war that is unrestricted in terms of the weapons used, the territory or combatants involved, or the objectives pursued, especially one in which the laws of war are disregarded.\\" - A great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own.

Food wasn't bad, staff was alright and not completely to blame... but the reason I'm writing a review at all is because of a situation that, in my mind, really should not have happened. (Edit: For clarity, I ordered this online for delivery. Why? Because how often do you come across a Subway that delivers?) Let's first take a moment to discuss a BLT. Pretty simple sandwich, right? BLT: Bacon Lettuce Tomato; a sandwich so bold, so forthright that it needs no further explanation. Adding things to it is on you, of course, so when I ordered Subway's BLT I kept that in mind, assuming there would be no issues with such a simple base. What I end up with is my order... sans the lettuce and tomato. I couldn't make this up: A BLT without lettuce and tomato. Normally, I'm the type of person who kind of shrugs off minor mistakes (mostly because I'm too hungry and the food is still consumable), but 1/3 of my sandwich is completely missing; I was too hungry NOT to do anything about it. A phone call to the store has me talking with the manager, telling me about the standard subway policies. Basically, the only standard on the sandwich is the meat, and everything is up to you. So... there really is not point in even telling them the name of the sandwich you want and adding to that--you have to name what's in it and what you want added to that. I fail to see the logic in having pre-constructed sandwiches at all. So unless you're in the restaurant guiding them step-by-step on how to make your sandwich, you'll pretty much have to tell them, \\"Yes, I want bacon AND lettuce AND tomato in my BLT.\\" (For future ref: if you really want bacon in your BLT, you're going to have to order double meat, or you'll just end up with the essence of bacon. Those little slivers of bacon really don't cut it.) I'd go into things about using common sense even if Subway's policies say otherwise... but then I'd be breaking Yelp's review guidelines.

The incident generated much controversy, as sports commentators and fans alike expressed concern over the negative impact this might have on Nedved's career. Meanwhile, Italian coach Claudio Ranieri has also been banned for one match after a separate incident, which has caused widespread debate in the football community. The elbowing occurred when Nedved, a former European Footballer of the Year, struck his opponent with considerable force, causing the player to fall to the ground. Although the motive behind the act remains unclear, it has been widely condemned as unsportsmanlike. This is a particularly disappointing development for fans of the 48-year-old midfielder, as it is a rare occurrence for him to be involved in such an act of aggression on the field. As a result, Nedved will be required to sit out his team's next two matches. This suspension significantly hampers his chances of participating in a substantial number of games this season, further putting a dent in his decorated career. In a separate development, former Chelsea and current Sampdoria manager Claudio Ranieri has been banned for one match after being found guilty of misconduct. The exact details of the incident resulting in this ban have not been disclosed, but it seems to have sparked heated discussions both on and off the pitch. Football aficionados everywhere will undoubtedly be monitoring these situations closely, as both Nedved and Ranieri serve their respective suspensions.

He lives on a London council estate ruled by violent gangs and spends most of his time playing chess with his friend, Len Attwell, at a local pub owned by Sid Rourke. When the hospital phones to tell him that his wife, Kath, is dying, Harry is too late because he is scared to take a shortcut through a narrow underpass, where a gang holds court. His wife is laid to rest next to the grave of their thirteen-year-old daughter, Rachel, who died in 1973. Len confides to Harry that he is being terrorized by youths and shows him an old bayonet he now carries to defend himself; with the police unable to help, he plans to confront his harassers himself. The next day, Harry is visited by Detective Inspector Alice Frampton and Detective Sergeant Terry Hicock, who tell him that Len has been murdered. The police arrest Noel Winters, the leader of a drug-dealing gang, along with members Carl, Dean and Marky, but are released due to lack of evidence. Harry gets drunk after Len's funeral, and is then held at knife-point by Dean, who intends to rob him; Harry kills Dean with his own knife during a brief struggle. Frampton visits Harry in the morning to inform him that because Len was killed with his own bayonet, any charges could be reduced to manslaughter on the basis of self-defense, leaving Harry feeling angry and betrayed.

WYD! ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. By Alastair Jamieson LONDON — Britain's Prince Charles has said he will stop speaking out on issues such as the environment and architecture if he becomes king. The heir to the U.K. throne has been a high-profile campaigner on topics including sustainable development, farming and home design. But in an interview with the BBC to coincide with his 70th birthday, the prince said he understood that the job of being king would be different and that he would respect “constitutional parameters.\\" His mother, Queen Elizabeth II, is the world’s longest-reigning monarch. She has maintained a public silence on politics and public debate in nearly seven decades on the throne. Queen Elizabeth's weekly briefings from prime ministers — who run the country — remain private and her public roles as a charity patron are ceremonial. While the monarch is Britain's official head of state, parliament has been in charge since the late 17th century. By contrast, Charles is an outspoken campaigner on issues ranging from organic and traditional farming and wildlife conservation to herbal medicine and urban planning. It was revealed in 2015 that he had written to a number of government ministers, including then-Prime Minister Tony Blair, to lobby for causes including dairy farmers and endangered species. The “Black Spider memos,” known as such because of the prince’s distinctive ink and handwriting, were published after a lengthy legal battle by The Guardian newspaper. Prince Charles is currently in Lagos, Nigeria. Sunday Alamba / AFP - Getty Images The BBC asked the prince whether his public campaigning would continue in the event of his mother's death. \\"No, it won't.

So of course I understand entirely how that should operate.\\" Asked about accusations that he had been \\"meddling\\" in public issues, he responded: \\"If it's meddling to worry about the inner cities as I did 40 years ago, then if that's meddling I'm proud of it.\\" Ahead of Prince Charles' 70th birthday next week, here's a look at his life in pictures with a classic image of the heir to the throne for each year pic.twitter.com/BDxu52Q0TO — Press Association (@PA) November 7, 2018 The BBC was given exclusive access to Charles, who will turn 70 on Nov. 14. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Prince Charles says it would be \\"nonsense\\" to think he could campaign publicly as king The Prince of Wales says he will stop speaking out on topics he feels strongly about when he becomes king, as he is \\"not that stupid\\".

I'm not that stupid.\\" BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said, however, that, in private, Prince Charles could still seek to influence government policy. He said: \\"The definition of what he is entitled to do as sovereign is to encourage and to warn.\\" Why is this significant? By Nicholas Witchell, BBC royal correspondent He has spent his adult life trying, as he puts it, \\"to make a difference\\". Often that has led the Prince of Wales to speak out about topics about which he feels deeply: the environment, GM crops, inner cities, architecture, education, homeopathic medicine and others. It has, on occasions, caused irritation within the government departments that have had to respond to his heartfelt \\"black spider\\" handwritten letters raising, always courteously but often insistently, some issue that has come to the prince's attention. It has all given rise to a greater concern. Does Prince Charles fully appreciate that, when he succeeds his mother and becomes Britain's king, these interventions will have to stop? Image copyright Jonathan Brady Image caption Prince Charles alongside his grandson Prince George Those who know him have said for years that privately he fully understands that, as king, he would have to stop his \\"campaigning\\". Prince Charles himself has always baulked at saying as much publicly. He's said to feel that any reference to how he will function as monarch could be seen as being disrespectful to his mother. However, with the Queen now in her 93rd year, and with Prince Charles about to celebrate his 70th birthday, he has finally said - publicly and explicitly - that he does recognise his interventions on matters of public debate will have to stop as soon as he becomes king. \\"You operate,\\" he says in the BBC documentary, \\"within the constitutional parameters.\\" It is reasonable to suppose his assurances will be heard with some relief within Whitehall and the corridors of power. What has he campaigned on? Architecture In 1984, Prince Charles gave a speech criticising a modernist design for an extension to the National Gallery in London. He said it looked like a \\"vast municipal fire station\\" and, if it were to be built - the proposal was subsequently dropped - would be a \\"monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much loved and elegant friend\\". Indeed, the Prince of Wales has campaigned for traditional urban design and architecture for many years. And this led to heir to the throne establishing the Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture in 1986, now known as The Prince's Foundation. In 1992, he said: \\"I didn't particularly want to see this country, which I mind about and love greatly, disappear under a welter of ugliness.\\" Climate change The heir to the throne has spoken passionately about climate change and environmental sustainability. In 2017, he said humans must live in harmony with their environment. He added: \\"Failure to do so, and I fear that we are already perilously close to doing this, will prove catastrophic.\\" BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin said: \\"The prince warned decades ago about human-induced climate change. \\"It was controversial to some at the time but now there's scientific consensus on the threat.\\" Wildlife conservation Prince Charles has been a staunch supporter of wildlife conservation and anti-poaching campaigns. Image copyright Getty Images In 2018, he said: \\"With the current rate of biodiversity loss now running at 1,000 times the natural rate, we appear to have managed to initiate the planet's sixth great extinction event and still seem utterly hell bent on destroying what little we have left.\\" Homeopathy Prince Charles has sparked some criticism for his support of homeopathy - a treatment based on the use of highly diluted substances to allegedly aid the body to heal itself. In 2015, he told an international gathering of scientists and government officials he treated his own cows and sheep with homeopathy. Clarence House later said: \\"Homeopathy is used on a case-by-case basis at Home Farm, in combination with more conventional medicine, to minimise dependence on antibiotics.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"In a recent BBC documentary marking his 70th birthday, Prince Charles has stated that he will cease to speak out on issues such as the environment and architecture once he becomes king. Over the years, the Prince of Wales has been heavily involved in campaigning for causes including sustainable development, farming, and home design. However, he acknowledges that the roles of king and prince are distinctly different, and that he will need to change his approach as sovereign."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Review: This is definitely one of the greatest Disney movies ever made. It's a real pleaser to anyone. It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, and it'll put you into suspense. Basically, what Homeward Bound is about is three household pets who are sent to live on a farm while their owners go on vacation. They don't know what is going on, and desperately wanting to go home, they escape from the farm and try to find their way home through the wilderness. This is one of the last movies that Don Ameche starred in. He provided the voice of Shadow, the old, wise and friendly golden retriever. Also starring in this movie was Sally Field providing the voice of Sassy, the Himalayan cat. But seriously, what this movie is all about is Chance! Voiced by Michael J. Fox (my all-time favorite actor), Chance is basically all you'd expect from a dog, lovable, playful, energetic and goofy, and every time I crack up when watching this movie, it's because of Chance; it's like the comedy never ends! This movie is also very sad at times. It sometimes reminds people of the times they've been alone or when they lose their pets. One scene that always puts me in suspense is the scene where the trio is trying to escape from the pound; I especially feel shocked at the part where Chance gets his collar caught in the fence and almost doesn't make it. The movie had other suspenseful moments, but none to me seem more suspenseful than that one. Overall, it's a wonderful family movie. If you enjoyed this movie, you'll probably enjoy the sequel too.

Question: How long has Dean been working at the Shenaneganz Movie plot title: Waiting... Movie plot: The film focuses on several characters. One of the main protagonists, Dean (Justin Long), has been a waiter at a restaurant called Shenaniganz for four years since graduating from high school, and has not earned a degree during his four years at a community college. When Dean learns from his mother that a former high school classmate, Chett (Travis Resor), now has a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, he begins to rethink his direction-less life. Dean's friend and co-worker, Monty (Ryan Reynolds), is in exactly the same situation, but has accepted that his future lies with the restaurant. Monty is put in charge of training Mitch (John Francis Daley), a newly hired waiter who is constantly interrupted throughout most of the film before he can speak, usually by Monty. Also working with Dean is Calvin (Robert Patrick Benedict), a hopeless romantic who cannot urinate in public, and Dan (David Koechner), the uptight manager who is grooming Dean as his protÃ©gÃ©. Rounding out the staff are 17-year-old hostess Natasha (Vanessa Lengies), abrasive waitress Naomi (Alanna Ubach), waitress (and Monty's ex-girlfriend) Serena (Anna Faris), Dean's girlfriend and fellow waitress Amy (Kaitlin Doubleday), stoner busboys T-Dog and Nick (Max Kasch and Andy Milonakis), head chef Raddamus (Luis Guzman), the insane, unsanitary chef Floyd (Dane Cook), lesbian bartender Tyla (Emmanuelle Chriqui), and the pensive and philosophical dishwasher Bishop (Chi McBride). The waiters preoccupy themselves with endless gossip, complaining about the customers, seeking covert revenge on particularly rude or annoying patrons, and playing a special kind of game which involves flashing genitalia at a fellow worker (the \\"Penis Showing Game\\"). Each employee has his or her own problems and stories, which are interwoven with the ebb and flow of business. A common phrase used throughout the film, which is referred to in the Shenaniganz training video is \\"The only thing different between extraordinary and ordinary, is that little bit of extra!\\"...

Q:This article: During and after the composition of The Planets, Holst wrote or arranged numerous vocal and choral works, many of them for the wartime Thaxted Whitsun Festivals, 1916–18. They include the Six Choral Folksongs of 1916, based on West Country tunes, of which \\"Swansea Town\\", with its \\"sophisticated tone\\", is deemed by Dickinson to be the most memorable. Holst downplayed such music as \\"a limited form of art\\" in which \\"mannerisms are almost inevitable\\"; the composer Alan Gibbs, however, believes Holst's set at least equal to Vaughan Williams's Five English Folk Songs of 1913.Holst's first major work after The Planets was the Hymn of Jesus, completed in 1917. The words are from a Gnostic text, the apocryphal Acts of St John, using a translation from the Greek which Holst prepared with assistance from Clifford Bax and Jane Joseph. Head comments on the innovative character of the Hymn: \\"At a stroke Holst had cast aside the Victorian and Edwardian sentimental oratorio, and created the precursor of the kind of works that John Tavener, for example, was to write in the 1970s\\". Matthews has written that the Hymn's \\"ecstatic\\" quality is matched in English music \\"perhaps only by Tippett's The Vision of Saint Augustine\\"; the musical elements include plainsong, two choirs distanced from each other to emphasise dialogue, dance episodes and \\"explosive chordal dislocations\\".In the Ode to Death (1918–19), the quiet, resigned mood is seen by Matthews as an \\"abrupt volte-face\\" after the life-enhancing spirituality of the Hymn. Warrack refers to its aloof tranquillity; Imogen Holst believed the Ode expressed Holst's private attitude to death. The piece has rarely been performed since its premiere in 1922, although the composer Ernest Walker thought it was Holst's finest work to that date.The influential critic Ernest Newman considered The Perfect Fool \\"the best of modern British operas\\", but its unusually short length (about an hour) and parodic, whimsical nature—described by The Times as \\"a brilliant puzzle\\"—put it outside the... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the set of songs that Alan Gibbs believes is at least equal to Vaughan William's Five English Folk songs of 1913?, what is it ?

He cryptically promises his father he will \\"bring him home.\\" Rama joins a heavily armed 20-man elite police squad, including Officers Bowo and Dagu, Sergeant Jaka, and Lieutenant Wahyu, for a raid on a high-rise apartment block in Jakarta's slums. The team intends to capture crime lord Tama Riyadi, who, along with his two lieutenants Andi and Mad Dog, owns the block and lets criminals around the city rent rooms under his protection. Arriving undetected, the team sweeps the first floors and subdues various criminal tenants; they also temporarily detain an innocent, law-abiding tenant delivering medicine to his sick wife in apartment #726. Continuing undetected to the sixth floor, the team is spotted by a young lookout, who passes on the message to another adolescent lookout just before he is shot dead by Wahyu; but the latter youth raises the alarm. Tama calls down reinforcements and the SWAT team are brutally attacked. Thugs snipe two officers guarding the perimeter, eliminate two more in the SWAT van, and ambush several officers patrolling the first five floors. Cutting the lights, Tama announces over the PA system that the police are trapped on the sixth-floor stairwell, and he will grant free permanent residence to those who kill the intruders.

In 2013, Abercrombie & Fitch marketed a slogan T-shirt with a \\"slut-shaming\\" remark directed toward her. The New York Times asserted that her \\"dating history has begun to stir what feels like the beginning of a backlash\\" and questioned whether Swift was in the midst of a \\"quarter-life crisis\\". Swift has said that she is unwilling to discuss her personal life in public, as she believes that talking about it can be \\"a career weakness\\". Rolling Stone remarks upon her polite manner: \\"If this is Swift's game face, it must be tattooed on because it never drops.\\" The magazine also takes note of her \\"ease with glad-handing\\", and The Hollywood Reporter credits her as \\"the Best People Person since Bill Clinton\\". While presenting Swift an award for her humanitarian endeavors in 2012, Michelle Obama described her as a singer who \\"has rocketed to the top of the music industry but still keeps her feet on the ground, someone who has shattered every expectation of what a 22-year-old can accomplish\\". Swift considers Michelle Obama to be a role model. Swift is one of the most followed people on social media, and is known for her friendly interactions with her fans. She has delivered holiday gifts to fans by mail and in person, dubbed \\"Swiftmas\\". She considers it her \\"responsibility\\" to be conscious of her influence on young fans, and has said that her fans are \\"the longest and best relationship I have ever had\\".Often described by the media as \\"America's Sweetheart\\", Swift insists that \\"I don't live by all these rigid, weird rules that make me feel all fenced in. I just like the way that I feel like, and that makes me feel very free\\". She refuses to take part in overly sexualized photo-shoots, although Bloomberg L.P. views her as a sex symbol. Swift was named an Icon of American Style by Vogue in 2011. In 2014 she topped People's annual best dressed list. In 2015, she was named Woman of the Year at the Elle Style Awards, and ranked first in Maxim's Hot 100... answer the following question: In what year did Swift rank first in Maxim's Hot 100 list?

Does it follow that \\"The men looked at each other than at a man to their right.\\"?","completion":"Yes, it does follow that \\"The men looked at each other than at a man to their right.\\" Step 1. Understanding the original sentence: \\"The men looked at one another and then to a large young man to their right.\\" This sentence firstly indicates that the men looked at each other, the phrase \\"one another\\" demonstrates this action. After they have done this, they then looked to their right, where there was a large young man. Step 2. Comparing this to the new sentence: \\"The men looked at each other than at a man to their right.\\" Here, once again it states that the men looked at each other, making it equivalent to the original sentence. Afterward, they looked to their right at a man, which mirrors what occurred in the original sentence. In conclusion, both sentences share the same sequence of the men's actions: looking at each other first and then looking to their right at a man.

The American Hockey League (AHL) is a 30-team professional ice hockey league based in the United States and Canada that serves as the primary developmental league for the National Hockey League (NHL). Since the 2010–11 season, every team in the league has an affiliation agreement with one NHL team. When NHL teams do not have an AHL affiliate, players are assigned to AHL teams affiliated with other NHL teams. Twenty-six AHL teams are located in the United States and the remaining four are in Canada. The league offices are located in Springfield, Massachusetts, and its current president is David Andrews. The annual playoff champion is awarded the Calder Cup, named for Frank Calder, the first President (1917–1943) of the NHL. The reigning champions are the Grand Rapids Griffins. The AHL traces its origins directly to two predecessor professional leagues: the Canadian-American Hockey League (the \\"Can-Am\\" League), founded in 1926, and the first International Hockey League, established in 1929. Although the Can-Am League never operated with more than six teams, the departure of the Boston Bruin Cubs after the 1935–36 season reduced it down to just four member clubs – Springfield Indians, Philadelphia Ramblers, Providence Reds, and New Haven Eagles – for the first time in its history. At the same time, the then-rival IHL lost half of its eight members after the 1935–36 season, also leaving it with just four member teams: Buffalo Bisons, Syracuse Stars, Pittsburgh Hornets and Cleveland Falcons.

In particular, the focus is on Lowry's impressive performance thus far, including his recent accomplishment of completing his second career complete game. Noah Lowry, a highly talented rookie, has been making headlines in recent weeks due to his outstanding performances on the pitching mound. Drafted by the Giants in June 2001 and making his debut in September 2003, Lowry's rapid rise to prominence has caught the attention of both fans and experts alike, proving a vital asset in the Giants' bid for a playoff spot. With his unbeaten record, Lowry has shown great poise and skill in his starts, leading many to believe that he could play a crucial role in the team's success moving forward towards the post-season. A complete game, which consists of a pitcher facing all batters for a full nine innings, is a significant milestone for any pitcher, let alone a rookie. Lowry's achievement of completing two such games in his budding career thus far speaks not only to his ability but also to his amazing potential. However, the upcoming matchup against the San Diego Padres will be far from a walk in the park for Lowry and his teammates. The Padres are known for their solid lineup filled with skilled batters who can pose a threat against even the most seasoned pitchers. On the other hand, the Giants themselves have a strong roster, and the game is anticipated to be an exciting battle between two playoff-caliber teams. In this context, the game's importance goes beyond just a win or a loss, as it could be a pivotal moment in defining the trajectory of both teams' seasons. The Giants, with their playoff hopes hanging in the balance, will be counting on their young star pitcher to deliver another exceptional performance and help secure a much-needed victory. To achieve this, Lowry will have to focus on executing his pitches effectively, using his repertoire of fastball, changeup, and curveball to keep the Padres' batters off-balance. Controlling his pitch count and keeping the opposing team's runner count to a minimum will also be crucial in ensuring that Lowry can maintain his stamina throughout the game. In conclusion, the topic revolves around the exciting upcoming baseball game between the San Francisco Giants and the San Diego Padres, with a particular emphasis on the dominant performance of Noah Lowry, the unbeaten rookie who has become a vital asset for the Giants' playoff hopes. Fans and analysts alike will be watching with bated breath as Lowry takes the mound in this crucial game, hoping that he can continue his impressive streak of pitching performances and lead his team towards a much-needed win in their pursuit of a playoff spot."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The White House cited \\"grave national security risks and privacy concerns\\" as the reason for its decision. Former President Barack Obama voluntarily disclosed more than 6 million records during his presidency. Critics say the logs allow for monitoring of individuals or groups who may be trying to influence policy. White House Communications Director Michael Dubke said the administration is following a 2013 federal court ruling that found most of the logs are considered presidential records and are not subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). He argued Mr Trump has taken steps to improve ethics such as imposing new restrictions on lobbying and opening to the White House news briefing room to outlets that previously did not have access. Senior White House officials also contend Mr Trump's new policy mirrors what previous administrations have done before Mr Obama. The Obama administration began releasing visitor records in September 2009 in response to legal challenges. The policy had some exceptions, which included private visits to the Obama family and those in attendance for \\"sensitive meetings\\", such as potential Supreme Court nominees. But the records were not made available immediately and sometimes took months before they appeared online. White House lawyers also redacted names for national security concerns and other reasons before the logs were made public. In 2012, Mr Trump criticised Mr Obama for concealing names. Under the new directive, records of those entering the White House complex will be kept confidential until at least five years after Mr Trump leaves office. But White House agencies such as the Office of Management and Budget and the US Trade Representative may be subject to Freedom Of Information Requests. Earlier this week, a coalition of watchdog groups filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration with the aim of publishing the visitor records. The Obama administration published the logs on a White House-maintained web page. Since Mr Trump took office, the page has been shuttered. White House officials said on Friday they would no longer maintain the web page and said it would save taxpayers 70,000 (Â£55,867) by 2020. Democratic lawmakers have also proposed legislation that would require the Trump administration to disclose the names of visitors at other places where he conducts business, including his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Mr Trump has been widely criticised for his lack of transparency. He has repeatedly refused to release his tax returns, breaking with decades of precedent. Thousands of protesters are expected to march on Saturday in cities across the US calling on Mr Trump to release his personal tax returns.

The use of a catalyst involves intermediate reactions which have lower activation complexes than the original reaction. On a simplified reaction energy diagram, this can be thought of as lowering the activation energy for a given transformation. If the activation energy of a reaction is decreased, more collisions will have enough energy to overcome this lower barrier, so the reactant-to-product transformation will occur more frequently. As a result, the overall reaction rate will be higher than for an identical reaction with a larger activation energy barrier. A chemist is working in the lab with two beakers, beaker R and beaker T, filled with identical solutions. In her experiment, she is going to pour one liquid into beaker R and the same amount of a different liquid into beaker T. After pouring the liquid into beaker R, there is no noticeable change.

A new law limits exploration to an area south of the southern end of the long coastline; production limits have been laid down(though these have already been raised) ; and oil companies have not been allowed to employ more than a limited number of foreign workers. But the oil industry has a way of getting over such problems, and few people believe that the government will be able to hold things back for long. Ever since the war, the government has been carrying out a program of development in the area north of the Arctic Circle. For the past few years this program has had a great deal of success: Torso has been built up into a local capital with a university, a large hospital and a healthy industry. But the oil industry has already started to draw people south, and within a few years the whole northern city could be in ruins. The effects of the oil industry would not be limited to the north, however. With nearly 100 per cent employment, everyone can see a situation developing in which the service industries and the tourist industry will lose more of their workers to the oil industry. Some smaller industries might even disappear altogether when it becomes cheaper to buy goods from abroad. The real argument over the oil industry is its effects on the Norwegian way of life. Farmers and fishermen do not make up most of the population, but they are an important part of it because Norwegians see in them many of the qualities that they regard with pride as real Norwegians. And it is the farmers and the fishermen who are most against the oil industry because of the damage that it might cause to the sea and to the countryside and to the whole country.

Question: Who did the old man at the bar say his parents were? Movie title: Interstate 60 Movie plot: The story begins in a bar, where two men are discussing a thesis statement for an upcoming paper. One of them asserts that out of all the different realms of the world, America has no mythological character that grants wishes. Their conversation is interrupted by a man (Wayne Robson) who claims that they are wrong, and that such a character does exist. The man goes on to explain that this character is a man named O.W. Grant, the son of a Leprechaun and a Cheyenne Indian. The man explains that O.W. is more so apt to play tricks on people, but that every so often, he takes a shine to some of them. When the two men ask this stranger just what O.W. Grant looks like, the fellow replies that he wears a red bow tie, and smokes a pipe carved in the shape of a monkey-head. As the man leaves the two, he mentions that O.W. can be found along Interstate 60. The two men go to a nearby map, and after looking over the roadways, think the guy they were talking to must have been pulling there leg, as there is no Interstate 60.The scene then cuts to real-as-life O.W. Grant (Gary Oldman), wearing a red bow tie, and smoking a pipe carved in the shape of monkey-head (just as the guy described). Going down a street, a guy in a parked car to his right opens the driver's side door, not realizing O.W. is about to pass alongside. O.W. falls from his bike, breaking the jaw on his monkey-head pipe. As the man apologizes and attempts to help him up, a truck comes along, running over Grant's bike, and destroying the man's cellular phone. The destruction of the cellphone causes the man to break into a fury, cursing how he wishes the incident had never happened. Grant asks if the man means the wish, and when the angered fellow replies positively, Grant places his pipe in his mouth, and green smoke envelopes the two of them.The scene begins again, with Grant riding along the same path (though his monkey-head pipe is now broken). Just before Grant reaches the car, he stops. The man on the phone inside, gets out of the car... and steps right...

In Scotland itself, from 1644-45 a Scottish civil war was fought between Scottish Royalists—supporters of Charles I under James Graham, 1st Marquis of Montrose—and the Covenanters, who had controlled Scotland since 1639 and allied with the English Parliament. The Scottish Royalists, aided by Irish troops, had a rapid series of victories in 1644-45, but were eventually defeated by the Covenanters. The Covenanters then found themselves at odds with the English Parliament, so they crowned Charles II at Scone and thus stated their intention to place him on the thrones of England and Ireland as well.

Question: Information: - The Nordic combined events have been contested at the Winter Olympic Games since 1924. The first competition involved 18 km cross-country skiing, followed by ski jumping. Whoever earned the most points from both competitions won the event. At the 1952 Winter Olympics, the ski jumping was held first, followed by 18 km cross-country skiing. The cross-country skiing portion was reduced to 15 km at the 1956 Winter Olympics. The ski jumping styles would change over the years as well, from the Kongsberger technique after World War I to the Daescher technique in the 1950s to the current V-style from 1985 onwards. The cross-country skiing technique would switch from classical to freestyle for all competitions beginning in 1985, but the biggest change would occur at the 1988 Winter Olympics in the scoring with the Gundersen method, meaning the 15 km cross country portion would go from an interval start race to a pursuit race, so that whoever crossed the finish line first won the event. The team event with a 3 x 10 km cross country relay started at the 1988 Winter Olympics, changing to the current 4 x 5 km cross-country relay at the 1998 Winter Olympics. The 7.5 km sprint event was added at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Nordic combined remains a men's only event as of the 2010 Winter Olympics. For the 2010 Winter Games, the 15 km Individual Gundersen which consisted of 2 jumps from the normal hill followed by 15 km cross country will be replaced by a 10 km individual normal hill event which will consist of one jump from the individual normal hill following by 10 km of cross country using the Gundersen system while the 7.5 km sprint will be replaced by the 10 km individual large hill event. - Geir Andersen ( born February 12 , 1964 ) is a Norwegian nordic combined skier who competed from 1983 to 1989 . He won three medals at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships with one gold ( 1984 : 3 x 10 km team ) and two silvers ( 1985 : 15 km individual , 3 x 10 km team ) . Andersen also finished 10th in the individual event at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo . He had six individual victories in his career from 1984 to 1985 . - Nordic combined is a winter sport in which athletes compete in cross-country skiing and ski jumping. Nordic combined at the Winter Olympics and the FIS Nordic Combined World Cup are ongoing. - The FIS Nordic Combined World Cup is a Nordic combined competition organized yearly by FIS, representing the highest level in international competition for this sport. It was first arranged for the 1983/84 season. Team event was first time held in 1999/00 season. The FIS race director is a Norwegian ex ski jumper and ex world record holder Lasse Ottesen. - A winter sport or winter activity is a recreational activity or sport which is played during cold weather months. Most such sports are variations of skiing, ice skating and sledding. Traditionally such sports were only played in cold areas during winter, but artificial snow and artificial ice allow more flexibility. Artificial ice can be used to provide ice rinks for ice skating, ice hockey and bandy in a milder climate. - The FIS Nordic World Ski Championships have been held in various numbers and types of events since 1925 for men and since 1954 for women. Championship events include nordic skiing's three disciplines: cross-country skiing, ski jumping, and nordic combined (the latter being a combination sport consisting of both cross-country and ski jumping). From 1924 to 1939, the World Championships were held every year, including the Winter Olympics. After World War II, the World Championships were held every four years from 1950 to 1982. Since 1985, the World Championships have been held in odd-numbered years. - Nordic skiing pertains to skiing disciplines that use equipment where the toe of the ski boot is fixed to the binding in a manner that allows the heel to rise off the ski, unlike Alpine skiing, where the boot is attached to the ski from toe to heel. Recreational disciplines include cross-country skiing and Telemark skiing. - Ski jumping is a form of Nordic skiing in which athletes descend a specially constructed takeoff ramp (known as the \\"inrun\\"), jump from the end of it (the \\"table\\") with as much power as they can generate, and \\"fly\\" as far as possible down a steeply sloped hill. Points are awarded for distance and style by five judges, with competition sanctioned by the International Ski Federation (FIS). To enable the athletes (who are known as \\"ski jumpers\\") to effectively glide such long distances and land safely, the skis they use are considerably wider and longer than their cross-country and alpine skiing counterparts. Ski jumping is predominantly a winter sport and has been part of the Winter Olympic Games since its inception in 1924 for men and since 2014 for women. Since 1954 it is possible to ski jump in summer on artificial surfaces made from plastic. Along with cross-country skiing, ski jumping is one of two sports which form the Nordic combined discipline. Holmenkollbakken in Oslo is the holy place of this sport, which is most popular in Austria, Germany, Finland, Japan, Norway, Poland and Slovenia.

Determine the sentiment: Perhaps the last film you would expect to come from Vittorio de Sica and Cesare Zavattini (who wrote the novel on which this film is based). It's a neorealist fantasy, kind of an oxymoron, really. An old woman finds a baby in her cabbage patch and raises him as her own son. After a few years, the baby is a young boy (named Toto) and the adoptive mother is dying. He goes to an orphanage and, when he finally turns 18, he leaves. Immediately, he finds that he has no home. Toto is optimistic, though, and won't let anything get him down. A man steals his valise, and instead of getting angry over it, Toto becomes his friend and goes and stays with him in a small shantytown. Toto takes some initiative and organizes the many homeless living in the area and they build a better shantytown. Soon, the landowner is trying to sell this plot of land, and the citizens of the shantytown have to protect themselves. After many attempts, the owner mounts a force of police to get rid of the homeless. At this point, the film becomes full-fledged fantasy (before this it was more comedic/fantastic melodrama in the style of Charlie Chaplin). This stuff is so weird and shocking that it's probably best for others to see it for themselves. It's quite amazing, and very funny. There are objections you could raise about the plot of Miracle in Milan, most certainly. Fellini and Visconti were greatly criticized when they started to stray from Neorealism. I think I read this was widely criticized at the time of its release. At this point, though, it's so enjoyable - I loved it very much. It might be my favorite of Vittorio de Sica's films, although Umberto D and The Bicycle Thieves come very, very close. 10/10.","completion":"Sentiment Analysis: Overall sentiment: Positive Justification: 1.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the band member who was upset when a past band member visited the studio and no one initially recognized him? is inside the article: After a tour of the UK performing Dark Side, Pink Floyd returned to the studio in January 1975 and began work on their ninth studio album, Wish You Were Here. Parsons declined an offer to continue working with them, becoming successful in his own right with the Alan Parsons Project, and so the band turned to Brian Humphries. Initially, they found it difficult to compose new material; the success of The Dark Side of the Moon had left Pink Floyd physically and emotionally drained. Wright later described these early sessions as \\"falling within a difficult period\\" and Waters found them \\"tortuous\\". Gilmour was more interested in improving the band's existing material. Mason's failing marriage left him in a general malaise and with a sense of apathy, both of which interfered with his drumming.Despite the lack of creative direction, Waters began to visualise a new concept after several weeks. During 1974, Pink Floyd had sketched out three original compositions and had performed them at a series of concerts in Europe. These compositions became the starting point for a new album whose opening four-note guitar phrase, composed purely by chance by Gilmour, reminded Waters of Barrett. The songs provided a fitting summary of the rise and fall of their former bandmate. Waters commented: \\"Because I wanted to get as close as possible to what I felt ... [that] indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd.\\"While Pink Floyd were working on the album, Barrett made an impromptu visit to the studio. Thorgerson recalled that he \\"sat round and talked for a bit, but he wasn't really there\\". He had changed significantly in appearance, so much so that the band did not initially recognise him. Waters was reportedly deeply upset by the experience. Most of Wish You Were Here premiered on 5 July 1975, at an open-air music festival at Knebworth. Released in September, it reached number one in both the UK and the US., can you guess it ?

The weather phenomena this last month had an immense impact on Dirk county, the precipitation lead to many flood evens, the steady rain lead to massive water infiltration. 20 miles away, in Saulk county, they had a few thunderstorms, they had quite a bit of runoff, but less infiltration and less soil saturation. Hint: Precipitation can impact infiltration in many ways. The amount, type and duration of precipitation all have an impact. Rainfall leads to faster infiltration rates than any other precipitation events, such as snow or sleet. In terms of amount, the more precipitation that occurs, the more infiltration will occur until the ground reaches saturation, at which point the infiltration capacity is reached. Duration of rainfall impacts the infiltration capacity as well. Initially when the precipitation event first starts the infiltration is occurring rapidly as the soil is unsaturated, but as time continues the infiltration rate slows as the soil becomes more saturated. This relationship between rainfall and infiltration capacity also determines how much runoff will occur. If rainfall occurs at a rate faster than the infiltration capacity runoff will occur.

Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr. was born in Long Beach, California, the second of three sons. He was named after his stepfather, Calvin Cordozar Broadus Sr. His mother is Beverly Broadus (nee Tate). His father, Vernell Varnado, was a Vietnam veteran, singer, and mail carrier who was said to be frequently absent from his life. Kool Moe Dee ranks Snoop at No. 33 in his book There's a God on the Mic, and says he has \\"an ultra-smooth, laidback delivery\\" and \\"flavor-filled melodic rhyming\\". Peter Shapiro describes Snoop's delivery as a \\"molasses drawl\\" and AllMusic notes his \\"drawled, laconic rhyming\\" style. Kool Moe Dee refers to Snoop's use of vocabulary, saying he \\"keeps it real simple...he simplifies it and he's effective in his simplicity\\". Snoop is known to freestyle some of his lyrics on the spot for some songs - in the book How to Rap, Lady of Rage says, \\"Snoop Dogg, when I worked with him earlier in his career, that's how created his stuff... he would freestyle, he wasn't a writer then, he was a freestyler,\\" and The D.O.C. states, \\"Snoop's [rap] was a one take willy, but his shit was all freestyle. He hadn't written nothing down. He just came in and started busting. The song was \\"Tha Shiznit\\"--that was all freestyle. He started busting and when we got to the break, Dre cut the machine off, did the chorus and told Snoop to come back in. He did that throughout the record. That's when Snoop was in the zone then.\\" Peter Shapiro says that Snoop debuted on \\"Deep Cover\\" with a \\"shockingly original flow - which sounded like a Slick Rick born in South Carolina instead of South London\\" and adds that he \\"showed where his style came from by covering Slick Rick's 'La Di Da Di'\\". Referring to Snoop's flow, Kool Moe Dee calls him \\"one of the smoothest, funkiest flow-ers in the game\\". How to Rap also notes that Snoop is known to use syncopation in his flow to give it a laidback quality, as well as 'linking with rhythm' in his compound rhymes, using alliteration, and employing a \\"sparse\\" flow with good use of pauses.

Options: (A). yes (B). it is not possible to tell (C). no","completion":"(C). no The premise does not entail the hypothesis. In order to unpack this, let's first define what we mean by \\"entailment\\". Entailment, in the field of logic and argumentation, refers to a relationship between statements where if the first statement is true, the second statement must also be true. In other words, it's impossible for the first statement (\\"the premise\\") to be true and the second statement (\\"the hypothesis\\") to be false at the same time. Now, let's take a look at the premise: \\"You could be dueling beautifully until an arrow hits you in the back.\\" This statement suggests that while engaged in a duel - which we assume involves attention focused on one's opponent and perhaps a certain degree of artistry or skill (\\"dueling beautifully\\") - one could be struck by an arrow from behind. There's an implication of surprise or unexpectedly (an arrow coming from an unforeseen direction while someone's attention is occupied with the duel), but it definitely leaves open the possibility that one might be hit by an arrow while in the midst of a duel. Now, let's compare this with the hypothesis: \\"If you are dueling, you won't be hit by an arrow.\\" This statement asserts a rule that if someone is dueling, they cannot be hit by an arrow. But the premise specifically describes a situation where someone who is dueling is hit by an arrow. So, the premise contradicts the hypothesis directly. Therefore, based on the given premise and hypothesis, we can confidently say the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. If the premise is true, it does not necessarily follow that the hypothesis is true. Thus, the answer is 'no', the premise does not entail the hypothesis. This highlights the importance of maintaining the awareness of your surroundings during a duel or in any situation where one's attention might be narrowly focused."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In January 2007, Russia and China vetoed a draft resolution before the United Nations Security Council calling on the government of Myanmar to respect human rights and begin a democratic transition. South Africa also voted against the resolution. What other countries were in disagreement with the United Nations decision on Burma ?","completion":"In the passage provided, it explicitly mentions that Russia, China, and South Africa were in disagreement with the United Nations decision on Burma (Myanmar) in 2007. However, it does not mention any other specific countries by name. To understand the disagreement further, it's essential to consider the broader context of the situation in Myanmar and the complexities of the political environment at the United Nations. Some countries may have had different reasons for their opposition to the United Nations resolutions on Myanmar. For instance, Russia and China are both permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, and they have historically prioritized the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations. Both countries likely opposed the resolution on the grounds that it disregarded Myanmar's sovereignty. Their economic interests and regional politics might also have influenced this decision. South Africa, on the other hand, was a non-permanent member of the Security Council in 2007. It is not entirely clear why they chose to vote against the resolution, but it can be assumed that they may have had concerns about the precedent that the resolution would set for international intervention on domestic human rights issues. To determine which other countries were in disagreement with the UN decision on Myanmar, it would be helpful to look at the historical voting records of the General Assembly resolutions related to Myanmar and the discussions leading up to the vetoed Security Council draft resolution in 2007. Countries that abstained or expressed reservations about the resolutions might provide additional insights into those who held opposing viewpoints during that time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By Victoria Woollaston PUBLISHED: 09:02 EST, 30 October 2013 | UPDATED: 12:25 EST, 30 October 2013 Popular building game Minecraft already lets users create their own worlds, but a new 3D gaming map now lets them explore the whole of the UK and build new settlements in their virtual back gardens. Minecraft Britain was built using Ordnance Survey maps of the UK as a base and was constructed using 22 billion building blocks from the game. It covers the equivalent of 86,000 square miles of mainland Great Britain and the surrounding islands and each block represents 50 square metres. To help players navigate the interactive world, Ordnance Survey has published a list of coordinates to various","completion":"landmarks, such as famous cities, national parks, and tourist attractions. This allows players to not only explore their own neighborhoods but also venture out to iconic sites like Stonehenge, the Angel of the North, and Buckingham Palace. As the story continues, the Minecraft Britain experience gains popularity among players worldwide. The virtual construction sites start bustling with activity as citizens band together to build familiar landmarks and also create new imaginative places, such as underwater cities, floating gardens, and futuristic towers. Players take pride in recreating their favorite UK locations, sparking friendly competitions between different cities and groups to see who can build the most epic structures. Some players choose to innovate, using clean energy sources, advanced transportation, and sustainable resources in their designs, showing a more eco-conscious version of Britain. Schools and educators begin to utilize Minecraft Britain as an engaging tool for teaching geography, history, urban planning, and environmental sustainability. This leads to both students and teachers finding creative ways to integrate the game into their curriculum. As a result, students develop a stronger understanding and appreciation of the UK's cultural and geographic diversity. Students also become more socially engaged in community development through the game. The Minecraft Britain project starts attracting the attention of architects, urban planners, and government officials, who see the potential of using the platform for crowdsourced ideas and solutions to issues in the real world. Soon, local councils and planning committees begin to host virtual meetings and workshops within Minecraft Britain, inviting the public to participate in community decision-making processes. Players start proposing solutions to real-life problems by visualizing new urban plans and transforming public spaces, contributing to the growth and well-being of their communities. As the game's impact on British society becomes increasingly more tangible, Ordnance Survey collaborates with Minecraft developers to expand the project to other countries. Inspired by the success of Minecraft Britain, governments and organizations around the world start investing in similar initiatives, encouraging players to participate in shaping the future of their cities and towns. As time passes, an entire generation grows up with vivid memories of building and exploring Minecraft Britain. The game forever changes not only the way people learn and think about urban spaces, but also the way they interact with their surroundings in reality. Ultimately, Minecraft Britain serves as a catalyst for fostering a more interconnected and collaborative society, where citizens feel empowered by their input and the unique perspectives they contribute. The story ends with global communities working together to build a world that is more sustainable, innovative, and inclusive for all."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, (; born Lourens Alma Tadema Dutch pronunciation: ['l^ur@ns 'alma: 'ta:d@,ma:]; 8 January 1836 - 25 June 1912) was a Dutch painter of special British denizenship. Alma-Tadema's works are remarkable for the way in which flowers, textures and hard reflecting substances, like metals, pottery, and especially marble, are painted - indeed, his realistic depiction of marble led him to be called the 'marbellous painter'. His work shows much of the fine execution and brilliant colour of the old Dutch masters. By the human interest with which he imbues all his scenes from ancient life he brings them within the scope of modern feeling, and charms us with gentle sentiment and playfulness. From early in his career, Alma-Tadema was particularly concerned with architectural accuracy, often including objects that he would see at museums - such as the British Museum in London - in his works. He also read many books and took many images from them. He amassed an enormous number of photographs from ancient sites in Italy, which he used for the most precise accuracy in the details of his compositions. Alma-Tadema was a perfectionist. He worked assiduously to make the most of his paintings, often repeatedly reworking parts of paintings before he found them satisfactory to his own high standards. One humorous story relates that one of his paintings was rejected and instead of keeping it, he gave the canvas to a maid who used it as her table cover. He was sensitive to every detail and architectural line of his paintings, as well as the settings he was depicting. For many of the objects in his paintings, he would depict what was in front of him, using fresh flowers imported from across the continent and even from Africa, rushing to finish the paintings before the flowers died. It was this commitment to veracity that earned him recognition but also caused many of his adversaries to take up arms against his almost encyclopaedic works. Alma-Tadema's work has been linked with that of European Symbolist painters. As an artist of international reputation, he can be cited as an influence on European figures such as Gustav Klimt and Fernand Khnopff. Both painters incorporate classical motifs into their works and use Alma-Tadema's unconventional compositional devices such as abrupt cut-off at the edge of the canvas. They, like Alma-Tadema, also employ coded imagery to convey meaning to their paintings. What gave him inspiration for his style?","completion":"Alma-Tadema found inspiration for his style by focusing on architectural accuracy, often including objects he saw at museums like the British Museum in London in his works, and by amassing a large number of photographs from ancient sites in Italy for precise accuracy in the details of his compositions.

Here is a news article: CHICAGO (STMW) - Three people claim in a federal lawsuit filed Monday that they were abused by Chicago Police officers at the department’s Homan Square facility on the West Side, and then illegally jailed for more than a year. Atheris Mann, Jessie Patrick and Deanda Wilson were “physically and psychologically abused” for about a day at the site near the intersection of Homan and Fillmore, according to a lawsuit filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Chicago. The suit makes similar allegations to a suit filed by three other men in late March, after a series of reports by the British newspaper The Guardian drew international attention to the Homan Square facility for its purported function as a secretive site for police to “disappear” people. Police officials have denied the reports. Mann, Patrick and Wilson were arrested the morning of Oct. 21, 2013, in connection with a drug investigation and taken to Homan Square, where they were strip-searched and ignored when they asked to use a bathroom or call family members and lawyers, the suit claims. Detectives used insult, threats and racial slurs while interrogating the three—who are black—for hours on end about the location of illegal guns and neighborhood drug sales, which the plaintiffs didn’t know anything about, the suit alleges. They were handcuffed in dark, windowless rooms and at one point, a detective held a knife to Wilson’s neck, the suit claims. Investigators falsified evidence and “bogus” charges of manufacturing and delivering heroin were filed against them, the suit claims. They were held at the Cook County Jail for 15 months before a judge found them not guilty in January 2015, the suit claims. A police spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment Monday. In a March statement, police officials denied the reports and said the facility—which also houses the department’s organized crime bureau, evidence section, ballistics lab and SWAT unit—operates like any of its more than 25 other district stations and detective bureaus. “It serves a number of functions, some of which are sensitive and some of which are not; however, it is not a secret facility,” the statement read. A spokesman for the city of Chicago, which is listed as a defendant along with six CPD officers, could not immediately be reached for comment. The 11-count suit seeks an unspecified amount in damages. ||||| Exclusive: Guardian lawsuit exposes fullest scale yet of detentions at off-the-books interrogation warehouse, while attorneys describe find-your-client chase across Chicago as ‘something from a Bond movie’ Police “disappeared” more than 7,000 people at an off-the-books interrogation warehouse in Chicago, nearly twice as many detentions as previously disclosed, the Guardian can now reveal. Homan Square: an interactive portrait of detainees at Chicago's police facility Read more From August 2004 to June 2015, nearly 6,000 of those held at the facility were black, which represents more than twice the proportion of the city’s population. But only 68 of those held were allowed access to attorneys or a public notice of their whereabouts, internal police records show. The new disclosures, the result of an ongoing Guardian transparency lawsuit and investigation, provide the most detailed, full-scale portrait yet of the truth about Homan Square, a secretive facility that Chicago police have described as little more than a low-level narcotics crime outpost where the mayor has said police “follow all the rules”. The police portrayals contrast sharply with those of Homan Square detainees and their lawyers, who insist that “if this could happen to someone, it could happen to anyone”. A 30-year-old man named Jose, for example, was one of the few detainees with an attorney present when he surrendered to police. He said officers at the warehouse questioned him even after his lawyer specifically told them he would not speak. “The Fillmore and Homan boys,” Jose said, referring to police and the facility’s cross streets, “don’t play by the rules.” According to an analysis of data disclosed to the Guardian in late September, police allowed lawyers access to Homan Square for only 0.94% of the 7,185 arrests logged over nearly 11 years. That percentage aligns with Chicago police’s broader practice of providing minimal access to attorneys during the crucial early interrogation stage, when an arrestee’s constitutional rights against self-incrimination are most vulnerable. But Homan Square is unlike Chicago police precinct houses, according to lawyers who described a “find-your-client game” and experts who reviewed data from the latest tranche of arrestee records obtained by the Guardian. That place was and is scary. There's nothing about it that resembles a police station Attorney David Gaeger “Not much shakes me in this business – baby murder, sex assault, I’ve done it all,” said David Gaeger, an attorney whose client was taken to Homan Square in 2011 after being arrested for marijuana. “That place was and is scary. It’s a scary place. There’s nothing about it that resembles a police station. It comes from a Bond movie or something.” The narcotics, vice and anti-gang units operating out of Homan Square, on Chicago’s west side, take arrestees to the nondescript warehouse from all over the city: police data obtained by the Guardian and mapped against the city grid show that 53% of disclosed arrestees come from more than 2.5 miles away from the warehouse. No contemporaneous public record of someone’s presence at Homan Square is known to exist. Nor are any booking records generated at Homan Square, as confirmed by a sworn deposition of a police researcher in late September, further preventing relatives or attorneys from finding someone taken there. “The reality is, no one knows where that person is at Homan Square,” said Craig Futterman, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School who studies policing. “They’re disappeared at that point.” A Chicago police spokesman did not respond to a list of questions for this article, including why the department had doubled its initial arrest disclosures without an explanation for the lag. “If lawyers have a client detained at Homan Square, just like any other facility, they are allowed to speak to and visit them,” the police claimed in a February statement. Numbers are ‘hard to believe’ Twenty-two people have told the Guardian that Chicago police kept them at Homan Square for hours and even days. They describe pressure from officers to become informants, and all but two – both white – have said the police denied them phone calls to alert relatives or attorneys of their whereabouts. Their accounts point to violations of police directives, which say police must “complete the booking process” regardless of their interest in interrogating a suspect and must also “allow the arrestee to make a reasonable number of telephone calls to an attorney, family member or friend”, usually within “the first hour” of detention. The most recent disclosure of Homan Square data provides the scale behind those accounts: the demographic trends within the 7,185 disclosed arrests at the warehouse are now far more vast than what the Guardian reported in August after launching the transparency lawsuit – but are consistently disproportionate in terms of race and constitutional access to legal counsel. 82.2% of people detained at Homan Square were black, compared with 32.9% of the Chicago population. 11.8% of detainees in the Homan Square logs were Hispanic, compared with 28.9% of the population. 5.5% of the detainees were white, compared with 31.7% of the population. Of the 68 people who Chicago police claim had access to counsel at Homan Square, however, 45% were black, 26% were Hispanic and another 26% were white. “Operating a massive, red-brick warehouse between two of the most crime-filled areas in the city of Chicago, equipped with floodlights, cameras, razor-wire – this near-paramilitary wing of the government that we’ve created, I would say that people who live close to it know what purpose it serves the most,” said the attorney Gaeger. “The demographics that surround it speak for themselves.” Despite the lack of booking and minimal attorney access at Homan Square, it is not a facility for detaining and interrogating the most violent of Chicago’s criminals. Drug possession charges were eventually levied in 5,386 of the disclosed Homan Square arrests, or 74.9%; heroin accounted for 35.4% of those, with marijuana next at 22.3%. The facility’s use by police has intensified in recent years. Nearly 65% of documented Homan Square arrests since August 2004 took place in the five years since Rahm Emanuel, formerly Barack Obama’s top aide, became mayor. (The Guardian has filed a Foia request with Emanuel’s office to disclose the extent of its involvement in Homan Square.) The 68 documented attorney visits are actually slightly higher, statistically speaking, than the extremely minimal legal access Chicago police provide suspects in custody during the initial stages of their arrest. The 2014 citywide total at declared police stations, according to First Defense Legal Aid, was 0.3%. On face value, the lawyer visit rate at Homan Square, according to the newly disclosed documents, was 0.9% over nearly 11 years. But those documents do not tell the entire story of Homan Square. Chicago police have not disclosed any figures at all on people who were detained at Homan Square but never ultimately charged. Nor has it released any information about detentions or arrests before September 2004, claiming that information is burdensome to produce because it is not digital. (Chicago purchased the warehouse in 1995.) “It’s hard to believe that 7,185 arrests is an accurate number of arrestees at Homan Square,” said the University of Chicago’s Futterman. “Even if it were true that less than 1% of Homan arrestees were given access to counsel, that would be abhorrent in and of itself.” ‘Try finding a phone number for Homan’ Facebook Twitter Pinterest Arrestees often are not processed at the Homan Square facility, in apparent violation of Chicago police directives. Photograph: The Guardian Chicago attorneys say they are not routinely turned away from police precinct houses, as they are at Homan Square. The warehouse is also unique in not generating public records of someone’s detention there, permitting police to effectively hide detainees from their attorneys. “Try finding a phone number for Homan to see if anyone’s there. You can’t, ever,” said Gaeger. “If you’re laboring under the assumption that your client’s at Homan, there really isn’t much you can do as a lawyer. You’re shut out. It’s guarded like a military installation.” The difficulty lawyers have in finding phone numbers for Homan Square mirrors the difficulties that arrestees at the warehouse have in making phone calls to the outside world. Futterman called the lack of phone access at Homan Square a critical problem. Booking isn’t happening or is happening sporadically and inconsistently, which leads to the whole find-your-client game Craig Futterman, University of Chicago Law School “They’re not given access to phones, and the CPD’s admitted this, until they get to lockup – but there’s no lockup at Homan Square,” he said. “How do you contact a lawyer? It’s not telepathy. “Often,” Futterman continued, “prisoners aren’t entered into the central booking system until they’re being processed – which doesn’t occur at Homan Square. They’re supposed to begin that processing right away, under CPD procedures, and at Homan Square the reality is, that isn’t happening or is happening sporadically and inconsistently, which leads to the whole find-your-client game.” Additionally, some of those who Chicago police listed as receiving lawyer visits at Homan Square disputed the accounts or said the access provided was superficial. According to police, when they took a woman the Guardian will identify as Chevoughn to Homan Square in May 2007 regarding a theft, they allowed her attorney to see her. Chevoughn says that never happened. “I was there a very long time, maybe eight to 10 hours,” said Chevoughn, who remembered being “petrified”, particularly as police questioned her in what she calls a “cage”. “I went to Harrison and Kedzie,” Chevoughn said, referring to the cross streets of central booking. “That’s where I slept. It’s where they did fingerprinting, all that crap. That’s when my attorney came.” Police arrested another man, whom the Guardian will call Anthony, in 2006 on charges of starting a garbage fire, and moved him to Homan Square. Police identified him as receiving an attorney there. But Anthony told the Guardian: “That’s not true.” Lawyer Rajeev Bajaj was allowed into Homan Square to see one of his clients in 2006. Police stopped Bajaj from entering for approximately an hour, and by the time they let him in he saw “the secretive nature” of officers and prosecutors there – exactly what he visited the warehouse to stop them from doing. “When I got there, there were two prosecutors questioning, knowing fully that I was down there to see him,” Bajaj said. “When I walked in, they seriously walked away, acting like they weren’t speaking to him or anything. It’s typical Chicago police, typical Homan Square, typical Cook County prosecutors’ office.” ‘They squeeze people. That’s what they do’ Chicago sued for 'unconstitutional and torturous' Homan Square police abuse Read more Jose, a 30-year-old Chicagoan whose last name the Guardian agreed not to publish, did not have access to his attorney at Homan Square. He is among 19 people identified among the 7,185 arrests who turned themselves into police at the warehouse – and whose access to a lawyer ended inside. According to court and police documents from Jose’s case, an anonymous informant told officers a man nicknamed “Chuie” sold him marijuana from the address where Jose lived. (Not only did the search warrant not name Jose, it described a taller man.) Police showed up at his house in force in February 2013, guns drawn. Jose wasn’t home. But his wife and 10-year-old daughter were, as well as his daughter’s friend, who had come over to work on a school project. Police took a substantial amount of marijuana and what Jose said was about 10,000 in cash. The arrest report listed the cash at 4,670. Jose said he never got his money back. After consulting with his attorney, Jose and lawyer Nick Albukerk traveled to Homan Square the following month. Albukerk said he advised officers that Jose was invoking his rights against self-incrimination and was not to be questioned. But the lawyer did not enter Homan Square as his client was led inside and placed in a room by himself. That's what they do, man: they get people who don't know their rights Jose According to the police report, it was 10pm. Jose took a Xanax for his nerves. He began to nod off, until he heard banging on the door and a demand to “get up”. “Are you going to help yourself?” Jose remembered the officer telling him. “What do you mean, help myself? ‘Are you going to talk to me?’ ‘Nah, my lawyer was just here. You could have just said this in front of my lawyer. I know my rights’ … He wasn’t trying to hear it. He was just blabbing away, like ‘Oh, you think you’re a smart-ass,’ this and that. “That’s what they do, man: they get people who don’t know their rights,” Jose continued. “That’s probably how they came upon me and my house – probably someone ended up talking to them and they dry-snitched on me. All they knew was that I lived there. “They squeeze people, and then they go get somebody else. That’s what they do.” Additional reporting by Zach Stafford and Phillipp Batta in Chicago and the Guardian US interactive team ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"A lawsuit has been filed against the Chicago Police Department on behalf of three people who claim they were abused at the department’s Homan Square facility and then illegally jailed for over a year.

It was the first time that Easter Islanders had met people from the outside world. The strangers were about to discover something very strange themselves --that they were on an island with hundreds of huge stone statues . The Dutch explorers wondered where the Islanders had come from and why and how they had built the statues. Now science is putting together the story. The first people to arrive on the island came there around A.D. 700. The society that developed there was based on fishing and farming to feed the population, which grew to 12,000. Its success showed itself in a way that has become the island's trademark : hundreds of huge stone figures --the moai. None of the moai was standing when scientists first arrived. People put them back up later; but how had a Stone Age society ever made, moved and set them up there in the first place? And why? There are nearly 900 moai on Easter Island, and while the questions about them remain unanswered, no one doubts the years of effort that must have gone into making them. The real killer of the Easter Islanders came from across the ocean. After 1722, it became popular for explorers to visit Easter Island, bringing diseases.

Article: It is often said that liberty comes at a price. For Willian Barboza, it was speeding in the Village of Liberty in upstate New York that carried a hefty cost. But when Mr. Barboza expressed his frustration by sending a profanity-laced message when he mailed in the payment for his traffic ticket, the cost would grow to include his own personal liberty — at least for a few hours. In a pique of anger, Mr. Barboza, 22, crossed out the town’s name, “Liberty,” and replaced it with one he thought more appropriate: “Tyranny.” He then added a vulgar little note that made it clear what he thought of the town. Upon receiving the missive, Justice Brian P. Rourke informed Mr. Barboza that his payment had been rejected and that he would be ordered to appear in court in Liberty, two hours from his home in Connecticut. At the hearing, on Oct. 18, 2012, Mr. Barboza received a lecture from the judge about using foul language, according to court documents, before being arrested, charged with “aggravated harassment” and handcuffed to a bench in the police station. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Barboza was booked, fingerprinted and eventually released on 200 bail after four or five hours. The charges ended up being dismissed several months later by another judge (the original judge had recused himself from the case), but for the New York Civil Liberties Union, the episode is emblematic of a broader issue: how law enforcement officials can use a state statute in ways that may violate a person’s right to free speech. ||||| September 15, 2015 — The New York Civil Liberties Union today announced a legal victory on behalf of a man who was handcuffed and arrested in Liberty, New York for protesting a speeding ticket by writing “fuck your shitty town bitches” on his ticket payment form. Last Thursday, the federal court in White Plains ruled that a prosecutor’s order to arrest the man violated the First Amendment. It also ruled that the Village of Liberty must stand trial on claims that it had failed to adequately train its police officers about the First Amendment. “Instead of protecting freedom of speech, government officers in Liberty handcuffed me, arrested me for a crime and almost sent me to jail because I harmlessly expressed my frustration with a speeding ticket,” said Willian Barboza, who was 21 at the time of his arrest. “The people I trusted to uphold the law violated my most basic rights. I hope that by standing up for myself, other Americans will not be treated like criminals for complaining about their government with a few harmless words.” In 2012 Barboza was pulled over for speeding in the Town of Liberty, located in Sullivan County in upstate New York. He pleaded guilty by mail, and when he paid his fine expressed his frustration by scratching out “Liberty” and replacing it with “Tyranny” and writing “fuck your shitty town bitches” on the payment form. His payment was rejected, and he was instead ordered to travel the two hours from his home to make a court appearance. At that court hearing, two police officers acting on the orders of an assistant district attorney arrested Barboza for allegedly violating the state’s former “aggravated harassment” statute. He was fingerprinted, handcuffed to a bench, and then driven to a different court in a separate town, where he was arraigned without a lawyer. He was then taken to the county jail in another town where he had to pay 200 in bail and was only released hours later. In 2013, a judge dismissed the charges against Barboza, stating that “[n]o citation is necessary for this Court to determine that the language under the circumstances here, offensive as it is, is protected.” The NYCLU and attorney Stephen Bergstein of Bergstein & Ullrich, LLP, lead counsel on the case, contended that the prosecutor and the police officers – sworn to uphold and enforce the law – had violated Barboza’s First Amendment rights and also contended that the Village of Liberty was liable for failing to train law enforcement to respect the First Amendment. In Thursday’s ruling in the Southern District of New York, the judge agreed that the assistant district attorney was liable for violating Barboza’s clearly established rights and also ruled that the village had to stand trial on the claim it had failed to properly train its officers. “New Yorkers should not be afraid to protest or complain about a speeding ticket -- or any other government action -- because they might be dragged to jail for using a few harmless words,” said NYCLU Staff Attorney Mariko Hirose. “The First Amendment protects people’s right to express their opinions about the government, and our government is better for it.” \\"We are delighted that the Court has ruled in Barboza's favor,” said Stephen Bergstein. “Freedom of speech protects everyone, even if they say something offensive.\\" The court ruled that the police officers, though likewise responsible for violating Barboza’s clearly established rights, are not liable because of the assistant district attorney’s participation in the arrest. Barboza’s attorneys, who contended that police officers who enforce the law should also be responsible for knowing it, are considering further options regarding the officers. ||||| Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story It began with a speeding ticket given in upstate New York to a man whose response was, to put it mildly, less than polite. He sent back a payment form with a scribbled five-word expression of vulgarity, and crossed out the town’s name. Instead of Liberty, the man wrote “Tyranny.” Local authorities were not amused. They ordered the man, Willian M. Barboza, to return to Town Court, a long drive from his home in Connecticut. Mr. Barboza was summarily lectured by a judge, arrested and held for several hours on charges of aggravated harassment. In most small-town traffic cases, justice is dispensed quietly, fines are paid and unhappy drivers go on with their lives. This case did not go that way. Mr. Barboza decided to sue the Village of Liberty, whose police officers had arrested him. Last week, a federal judge, Cathy Seibel, in White Plains, ruled that his First Amendment rights had been violated, and allowed his lawsuit to proceed. “The whole time that I was there, it felt like an episode of ‘The Twilight Zone,’ ” he said in a phone interview on Tuesday. “I just wanted to ask if they had any sense of irony at all.” Photo The Village of Liberty, it turns out, might have a problem with people who utter vulgar things that they should not. Mr. Barboza’s lawyers argued in court papers that the village has had a practice of unconstitutionally arresting people for offensive speech: on the street, in phone messages and in the presence of police officers. “People use language like this all the time,” said Stephen Bergstein, a lawyer who represents Mr. Barboza along with the New York Civil Liberties Union. “They send letters like this to customer service at Verizon, the I.R.S. “When people are unhappy, they vent on forms like that,” Mr. Bergstein added. “You shouldn’t have to get arrested for it.” Mr. Barboza’s lawyers have also claimed in court papers that the village has failed to educate its officers in “limitations on the arrests of persons engaged in protected speech,” or in how to interpret state laws on aggravated harassment or disorderly conduct, the basis for other cases that the lawsuit calls into question. “At trial, we’d hope to show that the village is liable for failing to train their officers on basic First Amendment rights,” said Mariko Hirose, a staff lawyer with the civil liberties union. “This kind of false arrest should never have happened.” Adam L. Rodd, a lawyer for the village, declined to comment on Tuesday, citing a village policy of not discussing pending litigation. In their papers, Mr. Barboza’s lawyers cite cases in which people were charged under the disorderly conduct law after expressing obscenities and other crude language. One highly intoxicated woman repeatedly yelled an expletive “on a crowded street after being warned several times by a uniformed Liberty police officer not to,” one charging document said. Photo Another person, using profanity-laced language in a motel parking lot, called an officer a “pig” and continued to use “abusive and obscene language after being ordered” to stop, according to another document. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story The lawyers also cited cases filed under the aggravated harassment law, which has since been invalidated as vague and over broad by the New York State Court of Appeals. Judge Seibel, in her ruling on Thursday, which was issued from the bench, declined to find that the other cases “constitute a pattern of constitutional violations as a matter of law.” But she added that, while the degree of threatening language in the other cases varied, “a jury could conclude that at least some of them reflect an unconstitutional basis for arrest.” That issue will ultimately be decided by a jury, she noted. She dismissed the suit’s claims against officers involved in Mr. Barboza’s arrest. Mr. Barboza was a 21-year-old student in May 2012 when he was stopped for speeding on Route 17. Lawyers for the village say in a court filing that shortly after Mr. Barboza’s handwritten message on the payment form was received, it was read by a clerk and taken to a town judge, who concluded that the comments were “threatening in nature” and that Mr. Barboza’s actions may have violated the law. The judge got in touch with Robert L. Zangla, a prosecutor in the Sullivan County district attorney’s office, and asked him to investigate. Mr. Zangla’s office concluded that the conduct was illegal, the filing says. Lawyers for the village and Mr. Zangla, who was also sued, argued that the officers had probable cause to make the arrest and that the suit’s First Amendment claims were without merit. Mr. Zangla has been found liable in Mr. Barboza’s claim. Samuel Yasgur, the Sullivan County attorney, whose office represents Mr. Zangla, said he had “a great deal of respect for Judge Seibel,” but added, “I obviously disagree with her decision and I’m studying it to determine whether or not we are going to appeal.” |||||Summary:","completion":"In 2012, Willian Barboza was given a speeding ticket in Liberty, New York, and expressed his frustration by sending a profanity-laced message along with his payment for the ticket.

Problem:Question: In which country was Grey wounded? Passage 1:Down the coast of Africa: The Portuguese reached the westernmost point of Africa in 1444 and in 1458 rounded Cape Palmas where the coast tends eastward. Here the trade winds gave out and they faced the irregular winds near the doldrums and the east-flowing Guinea Current. In 1471 they reached the Gold coast where they found the gold that had previously come by caravan across the Sahara. In 1474 Lopes Gonçalves reached the point where the coast turns south and became the first European sailor to cross the equator. In 1475-79 Spain and Portugal fought along the coast. The Treaty of Alcáçovas gave the whole area to the Portuguese except for the Canaries. This was the first colonial war and the first colonial treaty. In 1482 Diogo Cão continued south against the Benguela current and the southeast trade winds, reaching the Congo River in 1482 and Cape Cross in Namibia in 1485. In 1487 Bartolomeu Dias reached Cape Voltas near the mouth of the Orange River and stood out to sea. Although the sources are not clear, he may have guessed that there were southern westerlies and was trying a volta do mar. After many days, at about 40 degrees south he discovered the westerlies and turned east. Finding no land after a number of days he turned north and reached Mossel Bay about 400 km east of Cape Town. He continued east against the Agulhas current to Algoa Bay where the coast began to turn north. Guessing that he had found the route to India, he turned back, discovered and rounded the Cape of Good Hope and reached Lisbon in 1488. In 1493 Columbus arrived at Lisbon with news of the new world and reported that he had sailed out of sight of land for five weeks. Passage 2:In the Seven Years' War, he served as adjutant in the staff of Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick and on 1 August 1759 was wounded at Minden. On 14 October 1760 he commanded a Light Company at the Battle of Campen, where he was again wounded. One year later, as Lt. Colonel of the 98th Foot, he participated in the Capture of Belle Île, off the coast of Brittany. Next, he served at the Battle of Havana in 1762. Later, he was on the staff of Wilhelm, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe during the Spanish invasion of Portugal (1762). In 1763 he retired on half-pay, but in 1772 he received a promotion to Colonel and served as aide-de-camp to King George III.

Step 1: Consider the context Both sentences are discussing the logical inconsistencies found in a book. Step 2: Compare the meanings of both sentences The first sentence is a question asking for an explanation for the mentioned inconsistencies, while the second sentence is a statement asserting that there is no valid explanation for them. Step 3: Determine entailment Entailment occurs when the truth of one sentence (the first) guarantees the truth of another (the second). In this case, the first sentence does not guarantee the truth of the second; it is merely asking for an explanation, whereas the second sentence assumes that no explanation exists. Conclusion: The second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. Although both sentences discuss the same subject matter, the first sentence does not guarantee the truth of the second."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Stephen Crane (November 1, 1871 - June 5, 1900) was an American poet, novelist, and short story writer. Prolific throughout his short life, he wrote notable works in the Realist tradition as well as early examples of American Naturalism and Impressionism. He is recognized by modern critics as one of the most innovative writers of his generation. The ninth surviving child of Methodist parents, Crane began writing at the age of four and had published several articles by the age of 16. Stephen Crane's fiction is typically categorized as representative of Naturalism, American realism, Impressionism or a mixture of the three. Critic Sergio Perosa, for example, wrote in his essay, \\"Stephen Crane fra naturalismo e impressionismo,\\" that the work presents a \\"symbiosis\\" of Naturalistic ideals and Impressionistic methods. When asked whether or not he would write an autobiography in 1896, Crane responded that he \\"dare not say that I am honest. I merely say that I am as nearly honest as a weak mental machinery will allow.\\" Similarities between the stylistic techniques in Crane's writing and Impressionist painting--including the use of color and chiaroscuro--are often cited to support the theory that Crane was not only an Impressionist but also influenced by the movement. H. G. Wells remarked upon \\"the great influence of the studio\\" on Crane's work, quoting a passage from The Red Badge of Courage as an example: \\"At nightfall the column broke into regimental pieces, and the fragments went into the fields to camp. Tents sprang up like strange plants. Camp fires, like red, peculiar blossoms, dotted the night.... From this little distance the many fires, with the black forms of men passing to and fro before the crimson rays, made weird and satanic effects.\\" Although no direct evidence exists that Crane formulated a precise theory of his craft, he vehemently rejected sentimentality, asserting that \\"a story should be logical in its action and faithful to character. Truth to life itself was the only test, the greatest artists were the simplest, and simple because they were true.\\" Poet and biographer John Berryman suggested that there were three basic variations, or \\"norms\\", of Crane's narrative style. The first, being \\"flexible, swift, abrupt and nervous\\", is best exemplified in The Red Badge of Courage, while the second (\\"supple majesty\\") is believed to relate to \\"The Open Boat\\", and the third (\\"much more closed, circumstantial and 'normal' in feeling and syntax\\") to later works such as The Monster. Crane's work, however, cannot be determined by style solely on chronology. Not only does his fiction not take place in any particular region with similar characters, but it varies from serious in tone to reportorial writing and light fiction. Crane's writing, both fiction and nonfiction, is consistently driven by immediacy and is at once concentrated, vivid and intense. The novels and short stories contain poetic characteristics such as shorthand prose, suggestibility, shifts in perspective and ellipses between and within sentences. Similarly, omission plays a large part in Crane's work; the names of his protagonists are not commonly used and sometimes they are not named at all. Crane was often criticized by early reviewers for his frequent incorporation of everyday speech into dialogue, mimicking the regional accents of his characters with colloquial stylization. This is apparent in his first novel, in which Crane ignored the romantic, sentimental approach of slum fiction; he instead concentrated on the cruelty and sordid aspects of poverty, expressed by the brashness of the Bowery's crude dialect and profanity, which he used lavishly. The distinct dialect of his Bowery characters is apparent at the beginning of the text; the title character admonishes her brother saying: \\"Yeh knows it puts mudder out when yes comes home half dead, an' it's like we'll all get a poundin'.\\" Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What were some elements of his technique?","completion":"Some elements of Stephen Crane's technique include using \\"shorthand prose, suggestibility, shifts in perspective, ellipses between and within sentences\\", and the incorporation of everyday speech and regional accents in his characters' dialogues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Yes","completion":"b. Yes Your statement, \\"Australia is a continent comprising mainland Australia, Tasmania, New Guinea, Seram, possibly Timor, and neighbouring islands,\\" is a reasonable answer to the question \\"What continent is Australia?\\" However, there is more detail to be added to provide a comprehensive answer. Australia is not just a country but also one of the Earth's seven continents. It is the smallest and the youngest of these continents and is part of the region known as Oceania. Your answer correctly highlights that the Australian continent includes mainland Australia, the island of Tasmania, and the nearby islands of New Guinea, Seram, and potentially Timor. The continent is located in the Southern Hemisphere, between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The Australian continent is unique because of its geological and ecological attributes. In addition to being the smallest, it is also the oldest and flattest continent, with extensive deserts and arid regions. It is commonly referred to as \\"the Island Continent\\" owing to its distinctiveness and isolation from other continents. The continent began to form around 4.4 billion years ago and has since undergone various stages of geomorphological development, giving it a rich and diverse geological history. Australia's biogeography is characterized by its isolation, diverse habitats, endemic flora, and marsupial-dominated fauna. Over 80% of Australian plant and animal species are endemic to the continent, meaning they are not found outside this region. These unique biogeographical traits are attributed to Australia's long isolation from other continents, which has allowed its ecosystems to evolve independently. When describing Australia as a continent, it's important to remember that it additionally encompasses a broader area - the Australasian region, which also includes the islands of New Zealand, New Caledonia, and the subantarctic islands south of New Zealand. In terms of geopolitical divisions, the Australian continent, together with the islands in the Pacific Ocean, forms the region known as Oceania. This region is further divided into four subregions: Australasia (Australia and New Zealand), Polynesia, Micronesia, and Melanesia (including Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and Fiji). To sum up, your answer is reasonable, but it could be further expanded by including more context, such as the unique characteristics of the continent due to its geological and ecological makeup, its status as the youngest and smallest continent, its Australasian subregion, and its involvement in the broader Oceania region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The film reflects on the fall of Emperor Haile Selassie and on the effects of that regime change relative to Ethiopian history and society. Through a broader lens, the film Teza focuses on the ways in which political upheaval and social change have impacted cultures and nations across the larger African Diaspora.Told mainly through a series of flashbacks, Teza follows the personal narrative of Anberber, who, after leaving Ethiopia for Germany to become a doctor, is led to return to his home village by lingering spirits and haunting visions from his childhood. Using the power of memory as its primary device, Teza recounts the historical circumstances that have framed the context in which contemporary Ethiopia exists.The movie chronicles Anberber's internal struggle to stay true--both to himself and to his homeland--but above all, the film explores the possession of memory, a right that humanity mandates that each of us have--the right to own our pasts.

Paragraph: The Vice President stated that he called the President to discuss the rules of engagement for the CAP. He recalled feeling that it did no good to establish the CAP unless the pilots had instructions on whether they were authorized to shoot if the plane would not divert. He said the President signed off on that concept. The President said he remembered such a conversation, and that it reminded him of when he had been an interceptor pilot. The President emphasized to us that he had authorized the shootdown of hijacked aircraft. The Vice President's military aide told us he believed the Vice President spoke to the President just after entering the conference room, but he did not hear what they said. Rice, who entered the room shortly after the Vice President and sat next to him, remembered hearing him inform the President, \\"Sir, the CAPs are up. Sir, they're going to want to know what to do.\\" Then she recalled hearing him say, \\"Yes sir.\\" She believed this conversation occurred a few minutes, perhaps five, after they entered the conference room. We believe this call would have taken place sometime before 10:10 to 10:15. Among the sources that reflect other important events of that morning, there is no documentary evidence for this call, but the relevant sources are incomplete. Others nearby who were taking notes, such as the Vice President's chief of staff, Scooter Libby, who sat next to him, and Mrs. Cheney, did not note a call between the President and Vice President immediately after the Vice President entered the conference room. At 10:02, the communicators in the shelter began receiving reports from the Secret Service of an inbound aircraft-presumably hijacked-heading toward Washington. That aircraft was United 93. The Secret Service was getting this information directly from the FAA. The FAA may have been tracking the progress of United 93 on a display that showed its projected path to Washington, not its actual radar return.

Write an article based on this \\"Ireland's Conor McGregor has been withdrawn from the Ultimate Fighting Championship's main event in July, just hours after tweeting he was retiring.\\"","completion":"Title: A Knockout Blow to UFC Fans - Conor McGregor's Surprising Retirement Announcement Introduction: The world of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) has witnessed yet another shocking twist, as Ireland's Conor McGregor, the man responsible for some of the Ultimate Fighting Championship's (UFC) most memorable moments, announced his retirement. The news comes just hours after he was listed as the main event in the organization's upcoming event in July. A true spectacle for every combat sports fan, McGregor's sudden departure raises numerous questions and leaves a void in the quickly approaching UFC event. Background: Conor McGregor, or \\"The Notorious,\\" as he is popularly known, has been a mainstay of the UFC since his debut in 2013. Born in Dublin, Ireland on July 14th, 1988, he has quickly risen to fame with his unparalleled charisma, sharp wit, and devastating strikes inside the cage. McGregor has competed in three different weight classes (featherweight, lightweight, and welterweight) during his UFC tenure, capturing titles in both the featherweight and lightweight divisions. McGregor's striking ability, along with his verbal prowess, has made him one of the most well-known and highest-paid fighters in the history of the sport. Besides his accomplishments inside the Octagon, the Irishman has headlined some of the most lucrative events in the combat world, including his high-profile crossover boxing match against Floyd Mayweather Jr. in 2017. Announcement of Retirement: On June 6, Conor McGregor tweeted, \\"Hey guys, I've decided to retire from fighting. Thank you for all the amazing memories! What a ride it's been!\\" Although this is not McGregor's first retirement announcement, he has made similar statements in both 2016 and 2019, only to return to combat and continue his journey in the sport. McGregor's decision comes after the UFC disclosed he would be the main event for an upcoming event scheduled for July, which is now left without its biggest star attraction. The tweet left fans and fellow fighters perplexed, as the sudden nature of the announcement caught everyone off guard. Possible Reasons Behind McGregor's Decision: While the exact reasons behind McGregor's decision remain unknown, speculations range from disagreements with the UFC, personal issues, or even legitimate concerns about his future in combat sports. Previous instances of his retirement announcements were triggered by disagreements with the organization or frustrations with possible matchups. This time, however, the reasons seem more ambiguous. The Impact on UFC and its Fans: McGregor's announcement has left many fans feeling a mix of shock, disbelief, and disappointment. As a key figure in the growth of the sport, his presence undoubtedly brings attention and excitement to every event in which he is involved. The UFC will now have to scramble to find a suitable replacement for their main event, which will be a near-impossible task, given the high level of interest McGregor garners with his fights. Conclusion: Whether it is a temporary decision or a permanent one, Conor McGregor's retirement announcement has surely left a tremendous impact on the world of MMA and UFC. If it's truly the end of his fighting career, then the sport has indeed lost one of its most magnetic and mesmerizing personalities in recent history. If, however, this is another chapter in \\"The Notorious\\" McGregor's unpredictable narrative, then it's anyone's guess as to when or where we might see him return to the cage. Until then, the landscape of UFC seems considerably less colorful and far less predictable without its biggest star."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Review: I thought I'd give Twinings Chinese Oolong Tea a try based on other reviewers feedback here on Amazon.

The description on the box labels it as a \\"sweet and delicate tea with reddish colour\\"... but personally, I have to disagree with that description. It was more of a perfumed sweetness with a hint of bitter aftertaste, not delicate at all. Everyone has different tastes and most likely I'm the odd one in the bunch.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose limousine driver described him as \\"genuinely dumbfounded by the whole affair\\"? The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind while he awaited trial. His limousine driver and a witness to the arrest, Louis Goldblatt, described him as \\"genuinely dumbfounded by the whole affair.\\" Tour manager Eric Barrett said that he looked \\"as if there had been a plane crash\\". Hendrix biographers Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeek described the incident as \\"a nightmare which ... plagued\\" him for seven months. According to Redding, \\"the bust knocked any positive feelings Jimi was holding onto out of him\\" and that he was in \\"agonised suspense\\" from the arrest until the trial. In 2012, Plummer wrote: \\"The real possibility of prison hung over Hendrix like a spectre ... a threat to his career and the cause of much brooding and rumination.\\" Journalist Charles Shaar Murray asserted that the incident jeopardized what he described as \\"Hendrix's increasingly fragile peace of mind\\". Two weeks after the arrest, Hendrix told Lawrence: \\"Whatever I have done ... getting hooked on heroin is not one of them.\\" He explained that his fear of needles discouraged him from using the drug and that having known junkies convinced him that it was not something he should get involved with. Soon after the story of his arrest became public, he drew a connection between the bust and anti-establishment sentiments: \\"All of that is the establishment fighting back ... Eventually, they will swallow themselves up, but I don't want them to swallow up too many kids as they go along.\\"According to Shapiro and Glebbeek, in 1969 there was little confidence in the staying power of rock stars; it was assumed that their careers were going to be short, and industry insiders operated under a \\"take the money and run\\" mentality.

After the trial, his management announced to the British press that they were planning a farewell tour for the Experience. However, the US tour during which the arrest occurred was their last.

Second question: Would Apple get rid of USB inputs on their devices? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First question: How do I enable usb debugging from boot menu if the device is freezed? Step-by-step process to enable USB debugging from boot menu: 1. Power off the device: Since the device is freezed, first try to power it off either by holding down the power button until the device shuts down, or if it is removable, remove the battery and then reinsert it. 2. Access boot menu: Hold down the appropriate key combination for your device to enter the boot menu. This usually involves holding down the power button and volume up or down buttons. 3. Select recovery mode: Use the volume buttons to navigate the boot menu and highlight \\"Recovery mode\\" or a similar option. Press the power button to select it. 4. Access Developer options: Once in recovery mode, wait for the device's main menu to appear. Navigate to the \\"Developer options\\" or a similar menu, depending on the device. 5. Enable USB debugging: Find the \\"USB debugging\\" option and enable it by toggling the switch or selecting it. This will allow you to connect the device to a computer and perform various operations, such as installing new software or recovering data. 6. Reboot the device: Finally, reboot the device by selecting \\"Reboot system now\\" or similar option from the main menu. Justification: Enabling USB debugging through the boot menu helps in debugging and resolving issues when the device is in a non-functional state. Second question: Would Apple get rid of USB inputs on their devices? Apple might eventually remove USB inputs from their devices, as they have a history of transitioning to new technologies and removing legacy ports, such as removing the headphone jack from iPhones and adopting USB-C ports on MacBooks. It is possible that they could opt for a fully wireless future for data transfer and charging, relying on solutions like AirDrop, iCloud, and wireless charging. Justification: Apple's track record of embracing new technologies and increasing reliance on wireless solutions suggests that they may at some point abandon USB inputs in favor of wireless alternatives. Are these two questions asking the same thing? No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question is related to enabling USB debugging for solving issues on a frozen device, while the second question is about Apple's possible future decision regarding the removal of USB inputs from their devices.

Any taxpayer earning over £150,000 will no longer enjoy higher-rate tax relief, which is considered a substantial incentive to save for wealthy workers. From April 2011, anyone who earns £200,000 a year, for example, and pays the typical amount of 6 per cent of their salary into their company pension scheme will lose out on £200 a month or £2,400 a year. Alistair Darling, when he announced the move in the Budget, insisted that just 1.5 per cent of taxpayers - the equivalent of about 450,000 people - would be hit, but experts argued that it would significantly damage the already beleaguered pensions industry, and cause many savers to think twice about investing in a pension. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? High earning British workers are losing their motivation to make payroll contributions into pension accounts.","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, we can reasonably infer that high earning British workers may be losing motivation to make payroll contributions into pension accounts. This inference comes from several parts of the provided information: 1. It is stated that anyone who earns over £150,000 will no longer receive higher-rate tax relief, a change effective from April 2011. The higher-rate tax relief is described as a significant incentive for wealthy workers to save. Removing it, therefore, could demotivate these workers from saving or investing as much as they used to. 2. There's an example demonstrating how a person earning £200,000 would lose out on £200 a month or £2,400 a year in pension scheme contributions due to this change. This tangible loss might discourage contributions to pension schemes. 3. It is stated that experts believe the move could significantly harm the pensions industry and cause many savers, presumably including the high earners affected by this change, to reconsider investing in pensions. While the paragraph does not explicitly say \\"high earning British workers are losing their motivation to make payroll contributions into pension accounts,\\" the presented evidence suggests that this sentence could be considered an accurate interpretation.

Erin was younger than Sarah, so","completion":"she naturally looked up to her older sister. Sarah, being three years older than Erin, had already experienced many of the things Erin hadn't. This provided a sense of adventure, guidance, and a benchmark for what Erin would eventually experience as she grew older. From a tender age, Sarah and Erin shared a bond that went beyond the typical sibling relationship. They confided in each other, spent countless hours together playing make-believe games, and exploring the vast parklands that surrounded their rural family home. As they grew older, Sarah developed a penchant for writing, while Erin had a knack for painting. They often paired their skills, creating joint projects where Sarah would craft a story and Erin would paint the scenes that stemmed from her sister’s vivid imagination. This collaboration brought them closer and helped build a deep understanding and appreciation for each other’s talents. Though Sarah was the older sibling, she was never condescending or dismissive of Erin's ideas. Instead, she encouraged and nurtured Erin's talents, providing a safe space for her younger sister to express herself. Erin, in turn, was grateful to have such a loving and supportive role model, and she vowed to extend the same guidance to any younger family members or friends who entered their lives. Despite their strong bond, there were times when the age gap affected their relationship. As Sarah embarked on her teenage years, she started developing her own circle of friends and became increasingly focused on her social life. Her priorities shifted, and teenage issues consumed much of her attention, leaving little room for the bond she once maintained with Erin. Feelings of envy and insecurity crept into Erin’s heart as she watched her older sister drift away from her. She started to feel left behind, unable to relate to the teenage dramas that preoccupied Sarah's life. But Erin also understood that it was natural for Sarah to explore new experiences and make new friends as she grew up. With a heavy heart, Erin allowed her sister the space she needed, and tried to focus on her artistic pursuits. This season of distance was temporary. As Erin entered her teenage years, she discovered that the gap between them grew smaller. She finally began to relate to Sarah’s experiences and joined her in navigating the challenges life had presented them. They shared their trials and triumphs, supporting each other through heartbreaks and celebrating their personal achievements. It seemed as if the bond they once shared as children had been rekindled from the ashes of their adolescent turmoil. Together, Sarah and Erin forged a unique relationship that would stand the test of time. They went from being sisters to best friends, bound together not just by blood, but by shared experiences and a love and understanding that surpassed all obstacles. Recognizing the power of their own artistic talents, they began collaborating again, aiming to make a difference in the world through their words and art. As they matured, entering adulthood, Sarah and Erin learned the importance of maintaining their bond and supporting one another through the obstacles that life brought their way. Through hardships and successes, they cherished the bond they had nurtured and vowed to never take it for granted."},{"prompt":"Question: Build a movie plot around this: What are the names of the two brothers?

Compare these elements between each sentence: - Janzur as the birthplace of Omar Mukhtar: This is the same in both sentences. - Omar Mukhtar's role: In the first sentence, he is referred to as \\"Italian resistance leader,\\" and in the second sentence, he is referred to as \\"Libyan resistance guide.\\" Though the terms \\"leader\\" and \\"guide\\" can be interpreted slightly differently, both suggest that Omar Mukhtar was someone who provided leadership or guidance to the resistance movement.

During a quiet moment, I announced it was now Dad's turn to listen to stories for a change. I wanted everyone to tell Dad what we loved about him. The room became quiet. Then one after another, people told stories from their hearts, while Dad listened with tears in eyes. Everyone seemed to have more than one story.

Those are the stories people normally tell at a funeral after a loved one is no longer alive to hear the words. They tell stories, full of tears.

Her dreams are the only place where her dream lover is a dark, handsome vampire; however, that is a bit of a dilemma for her real-life boyfriend, who is not quite as fascinating as the vampire dream boy. Charlotte is given the choice between staying with her life as she knows it, or becoming a part of the vampire's world. There is also the usual struggle between such opposing entities, as Charlotte sees that not only does she have to choose between her boyfriend and her mysterious nighttime visitor, but also between light and dark, and good and evil.

This time, the vampire is telling her to come to him, as he believes there is nothing left for her here (on earth). After some dream scenes, finally, Charlotte is in the tower with the vampire.

From 1911 to 2013, Seattle's nine city councillors were elected at large, rather than by geographic subdivisions. For the 2015 election, this changed to a hybrid system of seven district members and two at-large members as a result of a ballot measure passed on November 5, 2013. The only other elected offices are the city attorney and Municipal Court judges. All city offices are officially non-partisan.Like some other parts of the United States, government and laws are also run by a series of ballot initiatives (allowing citizens to pass or reject laws), referenda (allowing citizens to approve or reject legislation already passed), and propositions (allowing specific government agencies to propose new laws or tax increases directly to the people). Jenny Durkan was elected as mayor in the 2017 mayoral election and took office on November 28, 2017. The mayor's office also includes two deputy mayors, appointed to advise the mayor on policies; As of 2017, the city's deputy mayors are Michael Fong and Shefali Ranganathan.Seattle's political culture is very liberal and progressive for the United States, with over 80% of the population voting for the Democratic Party. All precincts in Seattle voted for Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election. In partisan elections for the Washington State Legislature and United States Congress, nearly all elections are won by Democrats. Although local elections are nonpartisan, most of the city's elected officials are known to be Democrats. In 1926, Seattle became the first major American city to elect a female mayor, Bertha Knight Landes. It has also elected an openly gay mayor, Ed Murray, and a third-party socialist councillor, Kshama Sawant.

Pastor Frank Pomeroy of the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs told leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention earlier this week that it would be too painful to continue using the church as a place of worship. Pomeroy, who lost his own 14-year-old daughter in the massacre, proposed turning the site into a memorial and building another church on a different site. The final decision on the fate of the building will be made by the denomination's top leaders, who traveled to the rural community in a show of support. But a national Southern Baptist spokesman said the pastor's wishes will be taken into consideration. Other sites of mass shootings have been torn down, including Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, where a gunman killed 20 children and six adults in December 2012. A new school was built elsewhere. A one-room Amish schoolhouse near Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was torn down in 2006, 10 days after an assailant took children hostage and shot and killed five girls ages 6 to 13. The original site of the school is now a pasture. A nearly identical schoolhouse with a security fence was erected nearby. Also Thursday, the father of the Texas gunman broke his silence to say his family is in mourning. Michael Kelley spoke to ABC News on Wednesday from his home in New Braunfels, about 55 kilometers north of Sutherland Springs. He refused to comment further, saying he does not want the \\"media circus'' surrounding the attack by Devin Patrick Kelley to destroy \\"our lives, our grandchildren's lives.''

Answer:","completion":"The family of Hashim and the Quraysh tribe, along with the dynasties descended from Ali ibn Abi Talib, belong to the larger Arab tribe of Banu Hashim. Banu Hashim is a clan within the Quraysh tribe and holds significant importance in Islamic history. Banu Hashim is named after Hashim ibn Abd Manaf, an ancestor of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and it is an esteemed and respected clan within the Quraysh tribe. The Quraysh tribe, an organization of Arab clans, controlled the city of Mecca, ensuring that it served as an essential hub for trade and commerce in pre-Islamic Arabia. Through their control of Mecca and the Kaaba, the Quraysh tribe also held a significant religious position. Ali ibn Abi Talib, who was the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad, is a key figure for both the Banu Hashim and Quraysh tribes. He was the fourth caliph in Sunni Islam and the first imam in Shia Islam. Dynasties that descended from Ali ibn Abi Talib include the Fatimid dynasty, the Alid dynasty, and the Safavid dynasty, among others.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose third Benhardt play was La Tosca? ? The French playwright Victorien Sardou wrote more than 70 plays, almost all of them successful, and none of them performed today. In the early 1880s Sardou began a collaboration with actress Sarah Bernhardt, whom he provided with a series of historical melodramas. His third Bernhardt play, La Tosca, which premiered in Paris on 24 November 1887, and in which she starred throughout Europe, was an outstanding success, with more than 3,000 performances in France alone.Puccini had seen La Tosca at least twice, in Milan and Turin. On 7 May 1889 he wrote to his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, begging him to get Sardou's permission for the work to be made into an opera: \\"I see in this Tosca the opera I need, with no overblown proportions, no elaborate spectacle, nor will it call for the usual excessive amount of music.\\"Ricordi sent his agent in Paris, Emanuele Muzio, to negotiate with Sardou, who preferred that his play be adapted by a French composer. He complained about the reception La Tosca had received in Italy, particularly in Milan, and warned that other composers were interested in the piece. Nonetheless, Ricordi reached terms with Sardou and assigned the librettist Luigi Illica to write a scenario for an adaptation.In 1891, Illica advised Puccini against the project, most likely because he felt the play could not be successfully adapted to a musical form. When Sardou expressed his unease at entrusting his most successful work to a relatively new composer whose music he did not like, Puccini took offence. He withdrew from the agreement, which Ricordi then assigned to the composer Alberto Franchetti. Illica wrote a libretto for Franchetti, who was never at ease with the assignment. When Puccini once again became interested in Tosca, Ricordi was able to get Franchetti to surrender the rights so he could recommission Puccini. One story relates that Ricordi convinced Franchetti that the work was too violent to be successfully staged. A Franchetti family tradition holds that Franchetti gave the work back as a grand...

As the clock ticks down to his final hour, a persistent local journalist, Emma Blakely (played by an inquisitive actress), delves deep into Anthony's past to investigate the truth behind the series of crimes he supposedly committed. At the age of 18, Anthony was convicted of armed robbery, and as he continued into his adult years, a string of criminal activities followed including grand theft auto, money laundering, and eventually, a high-profile murder. These transgressions placed him at the top of Havenbrook's Most Wanted list. The film starts with a vivid narration of Anthony's life skyrocketing into infamy, but amid the chaos, he remained tight-lipped about his past and his involvement in these crimes. On the eve of his 40th birthday, with only 59 hours left, Anthony maintains his innocence and pleads for Emma's help to restore justice before his execution. As Emma begins unraveling his mysterious life, she discovers new pieces of evidence, including a secret crime syndicate in Havenbrook that may be responsible for framing Anthony. She faces significant resistance from the city's corrupt officials and encounters threats from the criminal underworld, but in her pursuit of the truth, she remains unrelenting. Meanwhile, inside the correctional facility, Anthony builds close relationships with a few inmates that prove crucial in gathering new insights and setting the stage for potential redemption. As Emma uncovers the real mastermind behind the murder and the criminal activities, a race against time ensues as she fights to expose the injustice and clear Anthony's name. With the newfound evidence, she manages to secure a last-minute hearing granting a stay of execution. During the final stages of the film, a dramatic courtroom sequence unfolds where Emma's presentation of exculpatory evidence convinces the jury to overturn Anthony's conviction. The film concludes with Anthony's newfound freedom at the age of 40 and the dismantling of the crime syndicate that wronged him. Emma and Anthony decide to partner up in fighting for the rights of the unjustly convicted, highlighting the importance of confronting and bringing down the corrupt powers within the city. \\"The 59th Hour\\" leaves viewers with a powerful message of perseverance, justice, and redemption against all odds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Minerals fill spaces between bits of sediment - With more sediment available, there will be more spaces for minerals to fill. 2. The sediments become glued together - More sediment glued together will result in more cemented parts. 3. The glued together parts become hard like cement - With more parts glued together, more hardened, cement-like parts will form. 4. The sediment becomes a big rock - As a result of the increased amount of sediment and cemented parts, more big rocks will be created. 5. The rocks erode slowly - Since more rocks are formed, there will be more rocks to erode over time. 6.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who accepted Walton's proposal?, using the article: In 1947, Walton was presented with the Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal. In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year. While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.Troilus and Cressida was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954.

The answer to the question: What is the full professional name of the person who wrote and sang \\"Octopus's Garden\\"? is inside the article: Sir Richard Starkey (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, singer, songwriter and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. He occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"Good Night\\", and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote and sang the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". Starr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. He briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best. Starr played key roles in the Beatles' films and appeared in numerous others. After the band's break-up in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US number-four hit \\"It Don't Come Easy\\", and number ones \\"Photograph\\" and \\"You're Sixteen\\". In 1972, he released his most successful UK single, \\"Back Off Boogaloo\\", which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album Ringo, which was a top-ten release in both the UK and the US. He has featured in a number of documentaries and hosted television shows.

To do this, you want to first get all the f terms on one side of the equation, which can be done by adding 289f to both sides: 7*f - 5032 + 289*f = -289*f + 289*f Step 2: Simplify the equation Next, combine the f terms on the left side of the equation: (7*f + 289*f) - 5032 = 0 296*f - 5032 = 0 Step 3: Add 5032 to both sides of the equation Now, you want to isolate the term with f, so add 5032 to both sides of the equation: 296*f - 5032 + 5032 = 0 + 5032 Step 4: Simplify the equation Combine the constant terms on the right side of the equation: 296*f = 5032 Step 5: Divide both sides by 296 Now, to solve for f, divide both sides of the equation by 296: 296*f / 296 = 5032 / 296 Step 6: Simplify the equation Cancel out the 296 on the left side, and divide 5032 by 296 on the right side: f = 17 Answer: f = 17 So, the solution to the equation 7*f - 5032 = -289*f is f = 17."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As RadarOnline.com has previously reported, Rivers’ female ear, nose and throat doctor stepped in once Dr. Lawrence Cohen, Rivers’ gastroenterologist, discovered something on her vocal cords. The ENT, who wasn’t authorized to perform any medical procedures at the clinic, took over and began a biopsy. PHOTOS: Celebrities Who Died In Bizarre Circumstances The biopsy was not authorized, as Rivers never signed a consent form. And once it began, her vocal cords began to swell, Anderson 360 revealed Tuesday night. But that’s not all. Not only was the ENT not supposed to be treating the comedienne, 81, at this time, medical staffers have also told investigators that the ENT snapped a selfie with the Fashion Police star while she was under anesthesia – a major violation of privacy, given she did not give her consent to have her picture taken. Dr. Cohen, who doubled as the clinic’s medical director, has since parted ways with Yorkville. The clinic confirmed his departure, stating, Dr. Cohen “is not currently performing procedures…nor is he currently serving as medical director.” PHOTOS: 10 Celebrity Spawn Who Look Just Like Their Famous Mothers As Radar has reported, Rivers’ daughter Melissa is now considering a lawsuit against the clinic and associated doctors.

Sound off in the comments below. ||||| See more of Susan Candiotti's investigation of Yorkville Endoscopy at 8 p.m. ET/PT Wednesday on \\"Anderson Cooper 360\\" on CNN. (CNN) -- The cardiac arrest leading to Joan Rivers' death happened as the comedian's personal doctor began performing a biopsy on her vocal cords, a source close to the death investigation told CNN. A staff member at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic told investigators that the doctor, who has not been publicly identified, took a selfie photo in the procedure room while Rivers was under anesthesia, the source said. Rivers, 81, was at the clinic for a scheduled endoscopy by another doctor, gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen. That procedure, intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat, involved the insertion of a camera down her throat. After Cohen, the clinic's medical director, finished his work, a biopsy was done on Rivers without her prior consent, according to the source. An ear, nose and throat specialist not certified by the clinic as required by law performed a biopsy on her vocal cords. The doctor is described by the source as Rivers' personal ear-nose-throat physician. Clinic: Vocal-cord biopsy did not kill Joan Rivers \\"Even though you are a licensed physician, you still should have, if you will, the checks and balances to get your approval to practice in that particular place,\\" said Dr. Arthur Caplan, a medical ethicist at New York University's Langone Medical Center. Investigators believe that Rivers' vocal cords began to swell during the allegedly unauthorized biopsy, cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which led to cardiac arrest on the morning of August 29, the source said. Rivers, 81, was rushed by paramedics from Yorkville Endoscopy to New York's Mount Sinai Hospital a mile away, where she died a week later. Yorkville Endoscopy issued a statement last Thursday denying reports that any vocal cord biopsy has ever been done at the clinic, although federal privacy law prevented any patient information from being released. The day after the denial was issued, the clinic confirmed that Dr. Cohen \\"is not currently performing procedures... nor is he currently serving as medical director.\\" The source said that at this time neither Cohen nor the ear, nose and throat doctor have been accused of wrongdoing by investigators. The clinic declined to respond to the source's comments about a biopsy or a selfie, citing federal privacy law.

Each of them took very seriously the charges of schism and innovation, denying these charges and maintaining that it was the Roman Catholic Church that had left them.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Never enter a fight that you can’t win. If the bully has a lot of his friends around don’t try to get physical. Avoid a fight at all costs. Even if you win the fight, you might need to leave very quickly. Take account of your surroundings and where you’ll escape to. If you know the bully is stronger than you, try packing your hands. Keep two rolls of quarters in your backpack. When the bully confronts you, take them out and hold one in either hand. Your punch will be much more powerful with the weight of the quarters behind it. You can also throw the quarters at the person if you are in a desperate situation. Holding quarters will also prevent fractures. Make sure that you don’t grip your thumbs when you punch. You might break them. Don’t wait until you’re in a position of weakness. If the bully has pushed or mocked you, he probably won't have his guard up. If this is something he does commonly, you are entitled to fight back. Hit/kick him hard in a weak spot as hard as you possibly can, and then follow that up with multiple other hits. One of the biggest mistakes that people can make in a fight is throwing one punch, and then backing off. As soon as you enter the fight you have to stay on the offensive to avoid retaliation. You can end the fight quickly. Don’t pull your punch. Hitting someone isn’t a good feeling. We have a natural tendency to pull our punches, which means not following through on your momentum. You need to punch hard. Unless you’re trained in wrestling, try to avoid going to the ground. If he rapidly punches, keep dodging. You cannot effectively block punches in a real fight. Duck his punches, or just otherwise avoid them. This means the gut, the groin, and the throat. Don’t throw a punch unless it will hit one of these three areas. Unless you’re trained to kick, avoid kicking high. You’ll put yourself off balance and it will allow the other person to grab your leg and potentially put you to the ground. You’ll have adrenaline coursing through your body. Your legs might shake and your teeth might be chattering. Just keep telling yourself that you have to be the aggressor. Don’t pause until you’re sure you have won, and then get out of there quickly. Do not be the aggressor so much that you seriously injure them. Just make sure that you have ended the fight and you can get away.","completion":"Avoid fighting if possible, but if you must, use strategies like packing quarters in your hands for added punch power, aim for weak spots, stay on the offensive, and don't stop until you've won, but avoid causing serious injury."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: To Catch a Crook: The F.B.I.’s Use of Deception In “Deceptions of the F.B.I.” (editorial, Nov. 1), you use a 2007 Seattle bomb threat investigation and a 2014 defense lawyer’s characterization of an unrelated Las Vegas illegal gambling investigation to express concern about the prospect of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s “deceptive tactics ... opening the door to constitutional abuses on a much wider scale.” We do use deception at times to catch crooks, but we are acting responsibly and legally. In 2007, to solve a series of bomb threats and cyberattacks directed at a Seattle-area high school, an F.B.I. agent communicated online with the anonymous suspect. Relying on an agency behavioral assessment that the anonymous suspect was a narcissist, the online undercover officer portrayed himself as an employee of The Associated Press, and asked if the suspect would be willing to review a draft article about the threats and attacks, to be sure that the anonymous suspect was portrayed fairly. The suspect agreed and clicked on a link relating to the draft “story,” which then deployed court-authorized tools to find him, and the case was solved. No actual story was published, and no one except the suspect interacted with the undercover “A.P.” employee or saw the fake draft story. Only the suspect was fooled, and it led to his arrest and the end of a frightening period for a high school. That technique was proper and appropriate under Justice Department and F.B.I. guidelines at the time. Today, the use of such an unusual technique would probably require higher level approvals than in 2007, but it would still be lawful and, in a rare case, appropriate. The Las Vegas case is still in litigation, so there is little we can say, but it would have been better to wait for the government’s response and a court decision before concluding that the F.B.I. engaged in abusive conduct. Every undercover operation involves “deception,” which has long been a critical tool in fighting crime. The F.B.I.’s use of such techniques is subject to close oversight, both internally and by the courts that review our work. JAMES B. COMEY Director Federal Bureau of Investigation Washington, Nov. 5, 2014 A version of this letter appears in print on November 7, 2014, on page A30 of the New York edition with the headline: To Catch a Crook: The F.B.I.’s Use of Deception.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which fruit retained their quality longer, apples or peaches? Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] A:","completion":"Apples retained their quality longer, as they were candied and the candying process helps preserve the fruit for a longer period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

An aspiring actress named Betty Elms (Watts) arrives at the same apartment and finds the dark-haired woman confused, not knowing her own name. The dark-haired woman assumes the name \\"Rita\\" after seeing a poster for the film Gilda (1946), starring Rita Hayworth. To help Rita remember her identity, Betty looks in Rita's purse, where she finds a large amount of money and an unusual blue key. In what seems to be a scene from a different narrative, set at a diner called Winkies, a man (Patrick Fischler) tells his companion (Michael Cooke) about a nightmare in which he dreamt there was a horrible figure behind the diner. When they investigate, the figure appears, causing the man with the nightmare to collapse in fright. As the principal narrative resumes, Hollywood director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) has his film commandeered by apparent mobsters, who insist he cast an unknown actress named Camilla Rhodes (Melissa George) as the lead in his film. After he resists, he returns home to find his wife having an affair and is thrown out of his house. He later learns that his bank has closed his line of credit and he is broke. He agrees to meet a mysterious figure called The Cowboy, who urges him to cast Camilla Rhodes for his own good.

Q:I can use this background: Insecticide control of aphids is difficult, as they breed rapidly, so even small areas missed may enable the population to recover promptly. Aphids may occupy the undersides of leaves where spray misses them, while systemic insecticides do not move satisfactorily into flower petals. Finally, some aphid species are resistant to common insecticide classes including carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids.For small backyard infestations, spraying plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days may be sufficient protection. An insecticidal soap solution can be an effective household remedy to control aphids, but it only kills aphids on contact and has no residual effect. Soap spray may damage plants, especially at higher concentrations or at temperatures above 32 °C (90 °F); some plant species are sensitive to soap sprays.

A nurse secretly filmed attacking an elderly Alzheimer’s sufferer in her care home bed was jailed yesterday. Jonathan. Aquino, 30, was caught when Jane Worroll suspected her mother Maria,. 80, was being mistreated and hid a camera in her bedroom. In. the harrowing images, Aquino is seen to suddenly strike the retired. school canteen manager in the face before slapping her arms repeatedly. The Filipino, who has an 18 month-old daughter, then finishes the attack by hitting Mrs Worroll in her abdomen four times. Sentencing Aquino to 18 months in jail, Judge Henry Blacksell QC told the nurse he was guilty of a ‘dreadful breach of trust’. ‘It. is distressing for anybody to have to watch what’s contained on the. footage,’ he said at Blackfriars Crown Court, central London. ‘This poor woman had been transferred to this institution in the hope that she should receive proper care and attention. ‘Quite. rightly, society in general is extremely concerned about the treatment. of the elderly and vulnerable in institutions such as this. 'They should. be able to expect better, and I am afraid those who are caught misusing. their responsibility should be held to account.’ The assaults took place at the Ash Court care home in Kentish Town, North London on June 21 last year. Mrs Worroll, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2008, had been living at the home since July 2010. She. has since been moved to another care home. After being told of the. film’s existence, Aquino, who has no previous convictions, burst into. tears and apologised. He was later sacked. Blackfriars Crown Court heard that the footage of Aquino hitting Ms Worroll was 'distressing' for anyone who had to watch it. Brinder Soora, prosecuting, said it was clearly evident that the home’s own rules were frequently breached by its care staff. Caught: Mr Aquino was caught when Maria Worroll's daugher Jane. (pictured) suspected she was being neglected and installed a secret. camera in her room. ‘Two care workers must be present when. a resident is put to bed, and bathing and cleaning should be carried. out by a female care worker,’ she said. ‘Again,. that was not adhered to. This is not a complaint lodged at Mr Aquino’s. feet – it was a problem that was clearly evident at the care home. itself.’ Despite this, it emerged that the care home had been given an. excellent rating by regulators in 2009. Speaking. outside court, Jane Worroll said: ‘Nobody as vulnerable as my mother. should ever have to suffer or endure the unprovoked attack and. mistreatment she has experienced at the hands of her supposed carers. ‘Had. it not been for my actions, this abuse may never have been exposed, as I. do not believe the existing safeguarding measures provide adequate. protection. ‘The emotional. impact this experience has had on me has been completely devastating. If. this happened to my mother and was only discovered because of a hidden. camera, what else is happening to other elderly people in care? ‘I. believe the current care system for these people needs a complete. review; we need robust strategies put in place to put an end to this. suffering.’ A spokesman for Ash Court said staff had been shocked by the case, adding: ‘We are pleased justice has been done.’ Aquino, of Tottenham, North London, admitted common assault and ill treatment of a vulnerable person.

Callen Radcliffe \\"Cal\\" Tjader, Jr. ( CHAY-d@r; July 16, 1925 - May 5, 1982) was an American Latin jazz musician, known as the most successful non-Latino Latin musician. He explored other jazz idioms, even as he continued to perform the music of Cuba, the Caribbean, and Latin America for the rest of his life. Tjader played the vibraphone primarily. He was accomplished on the drums, bongos, congas, timpani, and the piano. After recording for Fantasy for nearly a decade, Tjader signed with better-known Verve Records, founded by Norman Granz but owned then by MGM. With the luxury of larger budgets and seasoned recording producer Creed Taylor in the control booth, Tjader cut a varied string of albums. During the Verve years Tjader worked with Donald Byrd, Lalo Schifrin, Anita O'Day, Willie Bobo, Armando Peraza, a young Chick Corea, Clare Fischer, Jimmy Heath, Kenny Burrell, and others. Tjader recorded with big band orchestras for the first time, and even made an album based on Asian scales and rhythms. His biggest success was the album Soul Sauce (1964). Its title track, a Dizzy Gillespie cover Tjader had been toying with for over a decade, was a radio hit (hitting the top 20 on New York's influential pop music station WMCA in May 1965), and landed the album on Billboard's Top 50 Albums of 1965. Titled \\"Guachi Guaro\\" (a nonsensical phrase in Spanish), Tjader transformed the Gillespie/Chano Pozo composition into something new. (The name \\"Soul Sauce\\" came from Taylor's suggestion for a catchier title and Bobo's observation that Tjader's version was spicier than the original.) The song's identifiable sound is a combination of the call-outs made by Bobo (\\"Salsa ahi na ma ... sabor, sabor!\\") and Tjader's crisp vibes work. The album sold over 100,000 copies and popularized the word salsa in describing Latin dance music. The 1960s were Tjader's most prolific period. With the backing of a major record label, he could afford to stretch out and expand his repertoire. The most obvious deviation from his Latin jazz sound was Several Shades of Jade (1963) and the follow-up Breeze From the East (1963). Both albums attempted to combine jazz and Asian music, much as Tjader and others had done with Afro-Cuban. The result was dismissed by the critics, chided as little more than the dated exotica that had come and gone in the prior decade. Other experiments were not so easily dismissed. Tjader teamed up with New Yorker Eddie Palmieri in 1966 to produce El Sonido Nuevo (\\"The New Sound\\"). A companion LP was recorded for Palmieri's contract label, Tico, titled Bamboleate. While Tjader's prior work was often dismissed as \\"Latin lounge\\", here the duo created a darker, more sinister sound. Cal Tjader Plays The Contemporary Music Of Mexico And Brazil (1962), released during the bossa nova craze, actually bucked the trend, instead using more traditional arrangements from the two countries' past. In the late 1960s Tjader, along with guitarist Gabor Szabo and Gary McFarland, helped to found the short-lived Skye record label. Tjader's work of this period is characterized by Solar Heat (1968) and Tjader Plugs In (1968-69), precursors to acid jazz.

Village A displayed traces of a large population that grew larger over the years, while village B had a small and declining population and was more isolated geographically. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which village displayed an observable Allee effect? Hint: Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led...

News article: Apple's iPhone 5 Cost Rises Slightly Some important components used to build Apple Inc.'s iPhone 5 cost a little more than those of the phone's predecessor, owing to an improved display and a more-advanced main processor chip. Take a look at Wall Street Journal graphics that disassembled smartphones and tablets, studying their features and component costs, and compare the devices. Explore and compare smartphone features and specifications, including the iPhone 5. The new iPhone 5 went on sale in the U.S. Friday. From new products to new stores, see past incidences of Apple fever. First in line at London's Covent Garden Apple store, Ryan Williams celebrated with store employees as he entered to buy his iPhone 5. Yet Apple was able to take advantage of lower costs on other components and kept its overall component expenses just slightly higher. That was the conclusion of an analysis conducted by the research firm IHS on Friday. The firm estimated the combined cost of the components for the iPhone 5, what is known as a bill of materials, at 197, or only 9 more than for the iPhone 4S. The iPhone 5, is Apple's first to work on high-speed fourth-generation cellular networks, using the Long-Term Evolution technological standard. The consumer price of the iPhone 5 is the same as for the 4S, 199 for the base model with a new two-year contract. Without a contract, the model sells for 649. Carriers typically subsidize the full price of phones for their customers. \\"Most other phones built for LTE had much bigger displays, and everything else inside them got oversized,\\" said Wayne Lam, who worked on the IHS analysis. \\"That pushed the material costs higher.\\" Apple's Retina Display on the iPhone 5 is the same width as the display on the 4S and about a half-inch longer. Apple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., declined to comment. The Retina Display cost 44, 7 more than the display on the 4S, Mr. Lam said. The new display was manufactured by Japan's Sharp Corp. The iPhone 5's display uses a new technology, In-Cell Touch, that requires fewer layers than previous generations of touch displays. Other components have gotten less expensive in the past year. The costs for the iPhone's battery, memory chips and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips dropped a combined 20, according to IHS estimates. Samsung Semiconductor Inc. appears to have lost ground with Apple. Samsung continues to manufacture the A6 processor, the iPhone 5's main computing engine, based on Apple's design. But Samsung's memory chips weren't seen in iPhone 5s that have been disassembled, as they were in previous iPhone models. Mr. Lam said that could indicate a decision by Apple not to buy memory from Samsung, the world's biggest supplier of flash memory chips, amid continuing patent litigation between Apple and the chip maker's parent. Apple won 1.05 billion in damages from South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. in a U.S. federal court last month. SanDisk Corp. and Hynix Semiconductor supplied the flash memory used to store data on the iPhone 5s analyzed by IHS, Mr. Lam said. Phones in the same line can have components from different suppliers, however. Qualcomm Inc. built the primary chips used to communicate to wireless phone and data networks. Its chips were combined with chips from Skyworks Solutions Inc., Avago Technolgies Ltd. and TriQuint Semiconductor Inc. IHS regularly disassembles wireless phones and other consumer electronics to determine who are a company's suppliers. Like most manufacturers, Apple prevents its suppliers from identifying themselves publicly, so such studies confirm relationships that have been the subjects of speculation. IHS recently analyzed Nokia Corp.'s Lumia 900 smartphone and estimated its cost of materials at 209. A version of this article appeared September 24, 2012, on page B4 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: IPhone 5 Costs Stay in Check. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The most important parts of this news article revolve around the increased costs of some of Apple Inc.'s iPhone 5's components, which arises from using improved display technology and a more advanced main processor chip. Firstly, the research firm IHS estimated the overall components' cost, also known as the bill of materials, for the iPhone 5 at 197, which is only 9 more than the iPhone 4S. Despite the overall increase in component costs, Apple turned the situation around by decreasing expenses for other components, allowing the company to keep its component expenses only slightly higher. One significant change was the Retina Display on the iPhone 5, which was manufactured by Japan's Sharp Corp. and costed 44, up 7 from the display on the previous model. The cost increase was due to the new In-Cell Touch technology used in the iPhone 5 that requires fewer layers than prior touch displays, thereby offering better visuals. The article also states that some components' costs have decreased, with the combined costs for the battery, memory chips, and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips decreasing by 20 according to IHS estimates. The article then discloses a potential change in Apple’s supplier chain. Previously, Samsung manufactured the A6 processor used in iPhone 5, based on Apple design. However, they were not seen as supplying the memory chips for iPhone 5, unlike previous models. This might represent a decision by Apple to cease purchasing memory from Samsung, probably because of their ongoing patent litigation. Instead, SanDisk Corp. and Hynix Semiconductor were identified to be the suppliers of flash memory for iPhone 5. Maintaining its precedence, Apple continued to sell the new iPhone 5 at the same consumer price as iPhone 4S. It went on sale at 199 for the base model with a new two-year contract, and at 649 without a contract. Apple's ability to keep the price the same, despite a slight increase in manufacturing costs, demonstrates their strategy to create value for their customers without compromising on the hardware advancements. Qualcomm Inc., Skyworks Solutions Inc., Avago Technolgies Ltd., and TriQuint Semiconductor Inc. were reported as the suppliers for the primary chips used in the phone for wireless connectivity. Lastly, it's important to note that this report is a part of IHS' routine activity of disassembling consumer electronics to identify suppliers, since companies like Apple prevent their suppliers from going public. The IHS analysis confirms theories about corporate supplier relationships."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Read this article and answer this question The Protestant lands at the beginning of the 17th century were concentrated in Northern Europe, with territories in Germany, Scandinavia, England, Scotland, and areas of France, the Low Countries, Switzerland, Kingdom of Hungary and Poland. Heavy fighting, in some cases a continuation of the religious conflicts of the previous centuries, was seen, particularly in the Low Countries and the Electorate of the Palatinate . In Ireland there was a concerted attempt to create \\"plantations\\" of Protestant settlers in what was a predominantly Catholic country, and fighting with a religious dimension was serious in the 1640s and 1680s. In France the settlement proposed by the Edict of Nantes was whittled away, to the disadvantage of the Huguenot population, and the edict was revoked in 1685. Protestant Europe was largely divided into Lutheran and Reformed areas, with the Church of England maintaining a separate position. Efforts to unify Lutherans and Calvinists had little success; and the ecumenical ambition to overcome the schism of the Protestant Reformation remained almost entirely theoretical. The Church of England under William Laud made serious approaches to figures in the Orthodox Church, looking for common ground. Within Calvinism an important split occurred with the rise of Arminianism; the Synod of Dort of 1618-19 was a national gathering but with international repercussions, as the teaching of Arminius was firmly rejected at a meeting to which Protestant theologians from outside the Netherlands were invited. The Westminster Assembly of the 1640s was another major council dealing with Reformed theology, and some of its works continue to be important to Protestant denominations.

It had significant international impact, inviting Protestant theologians from outside of the Netherlands to participate. Meanwhile, the Edict of Nantes was a settlement in France that aimed to grant religious freedom and rights to the Huguenot population.

Article: I was appreciating my family photos on my computer, admiring my two beautiful babies, when I found a disturbing trend: my laptop was in almost all the pictures. There was my daughter, 8 months old, playing at my feet while I was typing away on the couch. There was me and my son, with the laptop at my side as I held him in my arms. I'd heard about the Internet addiction before, but always assumed I was something limited to socially challenged guys who played too much World of Warcraft (a computer game). Now it seemed my Internet \\"habit\\" is slowly but surely crossing the line. Sometimes I find myself up at midnight, surfing the Web while my family are sleeping. I read news, keep up with friends and write my blog ... just for something to do. It turns out that I'm not the only mama who is addicted to the computer. These moms are contributing to a growing global addiction. There's a movement among psychiatrists (doctors who specialize in mental diseases) to recognize the Internet addiction as an official mental disorder. And a recent Stanford University national survey found that 14 percent of Internet users find it hard to stay away from it for several days at a time; 9 percent try to hide their \\"unnecessary Internet use\\" from their loved ones; 8 percent admit they use the Web as a way to escape problems. You're likely not the kind of addict who doesn't bathe and abuses drugs to help her stay \\"up\\" for more online time. You may have noticed, though, that going online has become a necessary part of your life, which, at least, means a load of clothes go unwashed. It may also mean you're missing much time with you baby - something you probably do care about. Question: In medical terms, the Internet addiction is _ .

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the real names of the men that helped add a \\"more analogue sound\\" to a song previously recorded by M.I.A? ? In 2001, M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) had worked exclusively in the visual arts. While filming a documentary on Elastica's 2001 tour of the US, she was introduced to the Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine by electroclash artist Peaches, whose minimalistic approach to music inspired her. She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist. Returning to London, she unexpectedly gained access to a 505 owned by her friend, former Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. M.I.A. used the 505 to make demo recordings in her bedroom. She initially planned to work as a producer. To this end, she approached Caribbean girls in clubs to see if they would provide vocals for the songs, but without success. M.I.A. secured a record deal with XL Recordings after Frischmann's manager overheard the demo. M.I.A. began work on the album by composing lyrics and melodies, and she programmed drum beats at home on the drum machine. Having produced rough tracks via trial and error, she honed the finished songs in collaboration with other writer-producers. Through these collaborations, she sought to produce a diverse style and \\"drag [her collaborators] out of their boxes, musically\\".DJ Diplo introduced elements of Brazilian baile funk to \\"Bucky Done Gun\\". Fellow composer-producer Richard X worked on the track \\"Hombre\\", which featured a drum pattern created from the sounds made by toys that M.I.A. had bought in India, augmented with sounds produced by objects such as pens and mobile phones. Steve Mackey and Ross Orton, known professionally as Cavemen, worked on \\"Galang\\", which M.I.A. had initially produced with her 505 and a basic four-track tape recorder. Working with Cavemen in a professional studio, she added a bass line and new vocals to give the song \\"a more analogue sound\\" than was possible with the 505. The track was co-written by Frischmann, whose input M.I.A. described as \\"refreshing\\". She initially hoped to feature guest vocalists on...

The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - Bulgaria (tr. '), officially the Republic of Bulgaria (tr. '), is a country in southeastern Europe. It is bordered by Romania to the north, Serbia and Macedonia to the west, Greece and Turkey to the south, and the Black Sea to the east. With a territory of , Bulgaria is Europe's 16th-largest country. - Legio undecima Claudia (\\"Claudius' Eleventh Legion\\") was a legion of the Imperial Roman army. XI \\"Claudia\\" dates back to the two legions (the other was the XIIth) recruited by Julius Caesar to invade Gallia in 58 BC, and it existed at least until the early 5th century, guarding lower Danube in Durostorum (modern Silistra, Bulgaria). The emblem of the legion is not known; it could have been, as all of the Caesar's legions, the bull or possibly the she-wolf lactating the twins. - The Nervii were one of the most powerful Belgic tribes, living in northern Gaul at the time of its conquest by Rome. Their territory corresponds to the central part of modern Belgium, including Brussels, and stretched southwards into French Hainault. During their 1st century BC Roman military campaign, Caesar's contacts among the Remi stated that the Nervii were the most warlike of the Belgae. In times of war, they were known to trek long distances to take part in battles. Being one of the distant northern Belgic tribes, with the Menapii to the west, and the Eburones to their east, they were considered by Caesar to be relatively uncorrupted by civilization. - Silistra (pronounced ) is a port city in northeastern Bulgaria. The city lies on the southern bank of the lower Danube river, and is also the part of the Romanian border where it stops following the Danube. Silistra is the administrative center of the Silistra Province and one of the important cities of the historical region of Southern Dobrudzha. - Titus Pullo was one of the two Roman centurions of the 11th Legion (Legio XI Claudia) mentioned in the writings of Julius Caesar. The other soldier mentioned was Lucius Vorenus; they appear in Caesar's \\"Commentarii de Bello Gallico,\\" Book 5, Chapter 44. Pullo and Vorenus were fierce rivals for promotion to \\"primus pilus\\", the most senior centurion in a legion. Both distinguished themselves in 54 BC when the Nervii attacked the legion under Quintus Cicero in their winter quarters in Nervian territory. In an effort to outdo Vorenus, Pullo charged out of the fortified camp and attacked the enemy, but was soon wounded and surrounded. Vorenus followed and engaged his attackers in hand-to-hand combat, killing one and driving the rest back, but lost his footing and was himself soon surrounded. Pullo in turn rescued Vorenus, and after killing several of the enemy, the pair returned to camp amid applause from their comrades. - A Gallus (pl. Galli) was a eunuch priest of the Phrygian goddess Cybele and her consort Attis, whose worship was incorporated into the state religious practices of ancient Rome. - Gaius Julius Caesar (13 July 100 BC 15 March 44 BC), known as Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician, general, and notable author of Latin prose. He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. - Commentarii de Bello Gallico, also simply Bellum Gallicum, is Julius Caesar's firsthand account of the Gallic Wars, written as a third-person narrative. In it Caesar describes the battles and intrigues that took place in the nine years he spent fighting the Germanic peoples and Celtic peoples in Gaul that opposed Roman conquest. - The Roman Republic was the era of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire. It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world. - Lucius Vorenus was one of the two soldiers of the 11th Legion ( Legio XI Claudia ) mentioned in the personal writings of Julius Caesar . The other soldier mentioned was Titus Pullo . He appears , along with Pullo , in Caesar 's Commentarii de Bello Gallico , Book 5 , Chapter 44 . The episode describes the two as centurions , approaching the first ranks , who shared a bitter personal rivalry . It relates how Pullo charged the enemy ( the Nervii ) in the heat of battle . Pullo casts his javelin into one of the enemy from a short distance , but his belt is simultaneously pierced by a spear , preventing him from drawing his sword , and he is surrounded by other Nervii . Just then L. Vorenus , following Pullo from the fortifications , reached the site of the mêlée and engaged the enemy in hand - to - hand combat . After slaying one of the enemy and driving back the rest , Vorenus lost his footing on the irregular terrain . As the Nervii drew closer to him , Pullo came to his rescue . After slaying many of their opponents , the two retreated to the fortifications amidst roaring applause from their comrades . - Claudius (1 August 10 BC 13 October 54 AD) was Roman emperor from 41 to 54. A member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, he was the son of Drusus and Antonia Minor. He was born at Lugdunum in Gaul, the first Roman Emperor to be born outside Italy. Because he was afflicted with a limp and slight deafness due to sickness at a young age, his family ostracized him and excluded him from public office until his consulship, shared with his nephew Caligula in 37.

Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

Darwin presented natural selection as a scientifically testable mechanism while accepting that other mechanisms such as inheritance of acquired characters were possible. His strategy established that evolution through natural laws was worthy of scientific study, and by 1875, most scientists accepted that evolution occurred but few thought natural selection was significant. Darwin's scientific method was also disputed, with his proponents favouring the empiricism of John Stuart Mill's A System of Logic, while opponents held to the idealist school of William Whewell's Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, in which investigation could begin with the intuitive truth that species were fixed objects created by design. Early support for Darwin's ideas came from the findings of field naturalists studying biogeography and ecology, including Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1860, and Asa Gray in 1862.

The first question, \\"How was Mount Everest formed?\\" is asking about the geological processes and events that led to the formation of the mountain. Mount Everest, which is part of the Himalayan mountain range, was formed millions of years ago as a result of the collision between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. The immense force of this collision caused the land to rise and create the towering peaks of the Himalayas, including Mount Everest. The mountain continues to grow at a rate of a few millimeters per year as the Indian plate continues to push against the Eurasian plate. The second question, \\"Where is Mount Everest?\\", is inquiring about the geographic location of the mountain. Mount Everest is situated in the Solu-Khumbu region of Nepal, on the border between Nepal and the autonomous region of Tibet in China. Its coordinates are 27°59' North latitude and 86°55' East longitude. Mount Everest stands at a height of 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet) tall as of 2020, making it the tallest mountain on Earth above sea level. The mountain attracts thousands of climbers and trekkers every year, and reaching its summit is considered a great achievement in the world of mountaineering.

As an art style, Impressionism was developed inFranceduring the late 19thand early 20thcenturies. Their work was a fresh and original way of painting. It seems that the artists painted a scene after just a quick look at it. Often painting outside, rather than in a studio, the artists observed nature more directly and tried to capture individual moments in time especially the changing light of the sun. They avoided black and earth color1s and as a result their work is often very bright and can also look like that it is shining. When they first appeared, the artists were criticized for not finishing their paintings and for being lazy. Critics said the Impressionists were satisfied with just a few inexact brushstrokes instead of completing a real painting. It was an art critic who first used the term \\"Impressionist\\" in a review of Monet's work \\"Impression, Sunrise\\"(1873) to satirize his loose, inexact manner of painting. \\"Everyone discusses my art and pretends to understand, as if it were necessary to understand, when it is simply necessary to love,\\" said Monet.

It is three days until the celebration of the year 3000. A Square, attorney at law, struggles to instruct his grand daughter, A Hexagon, in the art of sight recognition. The lesson is interrupted by his brother B Squares arrival. As clerk to President Circle, B Square wants to warn his big brother to stay home that afternoon while there is a meeting at the Senate of the Great Southern Republic of Flatland.The Senate session has been called to discuss the increasing hostilities between the Chromatist movement and the government. Senator Chromatistes is the irregular polygon who leads this rebellious movement that wants to legalize the right of Flatlanders to color their sides as they see fit. Traditionally a taboo practice, the laws were previously relaxed somewhat which emboldened the Chromatists to demand legalization against the will of the majority. The Great Southern Republic distinguishes itself from its enemy, the Northern Kingdom, by its stances on Chromatism and Irregulars along with a democratic government. Relaxing the laws has already been perceived as weakness by the Northern Kingdom who are massing on the borders.Unable to heed his brothers advice, A Square meets with his new client, the first female charged as a Chromatist and on his way home finds himself embroiled in the melee issuing forth from the Senate. President Circles soldiers have assassinated Senator Chromatistes along with his supporters thus sparking a riot that has spilled into the streets of the city.

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. - Dan Patterson is a British television producer and writer, responsible for the production of both the British and American incarnations of the improvisation show \\"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\\" and the British satirical panel show \\"Mock the Week\\" with writing partner Mark Leveson.

Stephen Fry was host of the show from its initial pilot, before departing after the final episode of the M series in 2015, with frequent \\"QI\\" panelist Sandi Toksvig replacing him prior to the beginning of the N series in 2016. The format of the show focuses on Alan and three other guest panelists answering questions that are extremely obscure, making it unlikely that the correct answer will be given. To compensate, the panelists are awarded points not only for the right answer, but also for interesting ones, regardless of whether they are right or even relate to the original question, while points are deducted for \\"answers which are not only wrong, but pathetically obvious\\" typically answers that are generally believed to be true but in fact are misconceptions which are known as forfeits that are usually indicated by a loud siren, flashing lights, and the incorrect answer being displayed on screen. Bonus points are sometimes awarded or deducted for challenges or incorrect references, varying from show to show. \\"QI\\" has a philosophy that \\"everything is interesting if looked at in the right way\\"; many factual errors in the show have been corrected in later episodes or on the show's blog. - Buzzcocks are an English punk rock band, formed in Bolton, England in 1976 by singer-songwriter-guitarist Pete Shelley and singer-songwriter Howard Devoto.

The genre can be traced to 1938, when \\"Information Please\\" debuted on U.S. radio. The earliest known television panel show is \\"Play the Game\\", a charades show in 1946. The modern trend of comedy panel shows can find early roots with \\"Stop Me If You've Heard This One\\" in 1939 and \\"Can You Top This?\\" in 1940. While panel shows were more popular in the past in the U.S., they are still very common in the United Kingdom. - Mock the Week is a British topical, satirical celebrity panel show, that was created by Dan Patterson and Mark Leveson, the same people responsible for the comedy game show \\"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\\".

The show has featured a variety of different stand-up performers, some being part of the show for several series as a permanent fixture, with host Dara Ó Briain and comedian Hugh Dennis having appeared in every episode since its debut. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - Robert Brydon Jones, MBE (born 3 May 1965), known professionally as Rob Brydon, is a Welsh actor, comedian, radio and television presenter, singer and impressionist. He played Dr Paul Hamilton in the Australian/British comedy series \\"Supernova\\", Bryn West in the sitcom\\" Gavin & Stacey\\" and Keith Barret in the BBC comedy series \\"Marion and Geoff\\" and its spin-off \\"The Keith Barret Show\\". - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - Have I Got News for You is a British television panel show produced by Hat Trick Productions for the BBC. It is loosely based on the BBC Radio 4 show \\"The News Quiz\\", and has been regularly broadcast since 1990.

Movie title: Iron Man Movie plot: Genius, billionaire, and playboy Tony Stark, who has inherited the defense contractor Stark Industries from his father, is in war-torn Afghanistan with his friend and military liaison, Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to demonstrate the new \\"Jericho\\" missile. After the demonstration, the convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded by one of his own rocket-propelled grenades. He is captured and imprisoned in a cave by a terrorist group, the Ten Rings, and an electromagnet is grafted into his chest by fellow captive Yinsen to keep the shrapnel shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him. Ten Rings leader Raza offers Stark freedom in exchange for building a Jericho missile for the group, but Tony and Yinsen agree Raza will not keep his word. Stark and Yinsen quietly build a powerful electric generator called an arc reactor to power Stark's electromagnet and a suit of powered armor to aid in their escape. Although they keep the suit hidden almost to completion, the Ten Rings attack the workshop when they discover their hostages' intentions. Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit powers up. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then in anger burns the Ten Rings weapons and flies away, crashing in the desert and destroying the suit. After being rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home and announces that his company will no longer manufacture weapons. Obadiah Stane, his father's old partner and the company's manager, advises Stark that this may ruin Stark Industries and his father's legacy. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit, as well as a more powerful arc reactor for his chest.

Natural England said it had agreed with the culling company it would end at noon on Saturday. An eight-week extension to the original six-week trial was due to end on 18 December. Farming Minister George Eustice claimed the extension to the cull had been \\"worthwhile\\". It has not yet been revealed how many badgers have been killed during the extension period. The number is due to be announced by Defra on Monday. The pilot scheme was extended after marksmen killed only 708 badgers, about 30% of the local badger population. The target had been 70%. Natural England said it had pulled the plug as the cull was set to miss a revised target of 58%. A spokesman said: \\"There is no realistic prospect of the cull removing the number of badgers required by the licence. \\"It has been discussed and agreed by Natural England that the cull will end at 12 noon tomorrow.\\" 'Fiasco' Natural England added that the decision to end the extension early \\"does not affect the original licence granted last year, which remains in place and which allows culling operations to take place for four years in west Gloucestershire\\". Government ministers and the NFU say culling badgers will curb TB in cattle, but critics assert it has little effect. A similar cull pilot in Somerset ended last month after it also failed to meet its target even after a three-week extension.

Generate a detailed description of this data.","completion":"The data provided consists of two variations of a traditional Indonesian dish called Batagor. Batagor is a popular Indonesian street food that is derived from the combination of two words, 'Bakso' meaning meatball and 'Tahu Goreng' meaning fried tofu. The dish is originally from Sundanese cuisine and typically consists of fried fish dumplings made with a mixture of fish, tofu, and various seasonings. The dish is then served with a delicious and spicy peanut sauce, accompanied by sweet soy sauce and a squeeze of lime. 1. Batagor DISH_VARIATION Shumai: The first variation of Batagor presented in the data combines the traditional Batagor recipe with another popular Asian dish, Shumai. Shumai, which can also be spelled as \\"siu mai\\" or \\"shaomai,\\" is a kind of Chinese dumpling that comes from the Hohhot region. Shumai is made with ground pork, shrimp, and various vegetables, such as mushrooms, wrapped in a thin, circular wheat dough and steamed. The dish is commonly found in dim sum, a traditional Chinese meal that involves sharing small plates of various appetizers or small dishes. In this Batagor Shumai variation, the fusion of Batagor and Shumai is created by preparing the Batagor with the traditional fish and tofu filling, wrapped in a Shumai dough. The steamed Batagor Shumai dumplings are then served with the signature spicy peanut sauce and garnished with sweet soy sauce, a lime wedge, or additional toppings like chopped scallions or fried shallots. 2. Batagor DISH_VARIATION Siomay: The second variation of Batagor integrates another traditional Indonesian dish known as Siomay. Siomay (or Somay) is similar to Batagor in its filling, as it is also made from a combination of fish paste, tofu, and various seasonings. However, the Siomay dumpling is typically boiled or steamed instead of fried, and can include a broader assortment of ingredients like cabbage, potatoes, and bitter melon. For the Batagor Siomay variation, Batagor's traditional fried fish and tofu filling is wrapped in a Siomay dumpling dough. These dumplings are then boiled or steamed, creating a lighter and healthier version of the original Batagor dish. Similar to the first variation, Batagor Siomay is served with the distinct, spicy peanut sauce, sweet soy sauce, and a lime wedge for a tangy twist. Additional toppings, such as chopped scallions or fried shallots, can also be added to enhance the flavor profile. In conclusion, the data provided showcases two innovative variations of the Indonesian Batagor dish, influenced by the techniques and ingredients found in Shumai and Siomay. These fusion dishes retain the core components of Batagor while incorporating different preparation methods and textures. Both Batagor Shumai and Batagor Siomay are unified by the signature spicy peanut sauce, proving that these variations are true to their Indonesian roots while also embracing the influence of other Asian culinary traditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

First-half goals from Olivier Giroud and Jack Wilshere prove too much for Villa. Inter stumble in Italy again, drawing 1-1 at home to Verona. Article:","completion":"Title: Arsenal Triumphs Over Aston Villa While Inter Stumbles in Italy Arsenal demonstrated their Premier League dominance at Aston Villa with a 2-1 victory, regaining control at the top of the English Premier League. Strong first-half goals from Olivier Giroud and Jack Wilshere secured the victory, while Inter stumbled in Italy, settling for a 1-1 draw against Verona. In a nail-biting encounter, Arsenal managed to secure three crucial points when they visited Villa Park on the weekend. The opening goal came from Olivier Giroud, who has been in exceptional form this season. He put Arsenal ahead in the match with a powerful strike that left Villa's defence scrambling. Arsenal supporters were ecstatic as their star striker notched yet another goal in his impressive tally this campaign. Not long after, Arsenal fans had more reason to celebrate when Jack Wilshere doubled their lead in the first half. Wilshere's goal proved crucial, providing a significant advantage for the visiting team. Despite Villa's best efforts, they were unable to match Arsenal's intensity and skill throughout the match. Aston Villa did manage to find the net in the second half, but Arsenal's resolute defence held firm to ensure their 2-1 victory. This result puts Arsenal back in control of the Premier League table, as they continue to chase down their title aspirations. Across the continent, in Italy, Inter Milan experienced another disappointing matchday. In a closely contested match at the San Siro, Inter were held to a frustrating 1-1 draw against Verona. Inter's inability to capitalize on numerous goal-scoring chances ultimately led to them sharing points with their mid-table opponents. To conclude, Arsenal's hard-fought victory at Villa Park has put them firmly back in the driver's seat in the race for the English Premier League title. As for Inter Milan, their inability to convert their chances at San Siro continues to disappoint the fans as questions about their title ambitions begin to arise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the perturbation hypothesis The perturbation hypothesis states that if more needles are improperly shared, it would impact the number of butterflies. Step 2: Identify potential connections between perturbation and the process We need to examine if there is any potential direct or indirect effect of improperly sharing more needles on the life cycle of a butterfly, which includes: - A larva is born - The caterpillar eats constantly until it grows bigger - The caterpillar starts to form a cocoon around itself - The caterpillar becomes a pupa - After some time the cocoon hatches - A butterfly is born Step 3: Assess any direct or indirect effects from the perturbation - Direct effects: Since butterflies and their larvae do not use needles in any stage of their life cycle, there is no direct effect of improperly sharing needles on butterflies. - Indirect effects: Improperly sharing needles can lead to the spread of diseases and infections among humans. If this perturbation causes a decline in human population, it could lead to changes in land use, agricultural practices, and conservation efforts that might indirectly affect butterfly populations. Step 4: Conclusion Although the perturbation hypothesis does not have any direct impact on the life cycle of a butterfly, there may be indirect effects on butterfly populations due to changes in human activities and land use resulting from declines in human population due to diseases and infections spread by improperly sharing needles. However, the connection between the perturbation and butterfly populations is likely quite minimal and not a primary concern when considering the biological process of butterfly development."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Owen Farrell is 23. It is worth emphasising that point, because he is often wrongly perceived as a seasoned veteran and that is not helping him. Four years ago, he was on loan at Bedford, in the Championship. Now, he has played 28 Tests for England, represented the Lions and – as befitting an accelerated career path – finds his international credentials being cast into doubt. Amid the rush to lambast the Saracens fly-half for his poor form on England duty last month, it is appropriate to consider the context. Firstly, he was a victim of circumstances beyond his control. Secondly, he will feature prominently at next year’s World Cup, providing he is not injured. Owen Farrell (left) poses with his team mates after England's 26-17 win over Australia in November. Farrell (right) has been criticised for his underwhelming form in England's Autumn international fixtures. Without doubt, Farrell was off-colour at Twickenham, during the defeats against New Zealand and South Africa. Without doubt, he deserved to be dropped to the bench – if not further – for the series-ending victory over Australia, following a hit-and-miss shift at inside centre against Samoa. But to write him off would be ludicrous. As a dogged competitor, he will relish vying with his good friend, George Ford, for the England No 10 shirt that he has lost, for now. Mark McCall, Saracens’ director of rugby, has defended his man, by claiming that Farrell was ‘rusty’ going into the November campaign. That is a colossal under-statement. After a month out injured, he had played one full and unconvincing match before earning an immediate England recall. Mark McCall, Saracens' director of rugby, has said Farrell was 'rusty' ahead of England's November fixtures. The bottom line is that he should not have been picked to face the All Blacks. He wasn’t ready. As McCall said: ‘He played one 80 minutes and was asked to face New Zealand, which is a pretty tough ask.’ Another under-statement. In fact, it was an impossible task. Stuart Lancaster and his assistants needed an alternative plan, but they didn’t feel they had a viable one to fall back on. Ford had missed the summer tour of New Zealand, so he hadn’t been exposed to the furnace-heat of a Test match in the balance. Freddie Burns and Danny Cipriani had deputised well, but neither had been included in the senior squad in late October. The extenuating circumstances went further back. First, Charlie Hodgson retired from Tests and then Toby Flood decided that a move to Toulouse was more appealing than playing second fiddle to the rookie. So the safety net had been removed. In lieu of genuine experience, Farrell assumed the mantle of the veteran in his position, despite his relative youth. Time and time again, Lancaster was forced to consider the doomsday threat of being forced to find a replacement, and that unwelcome scenario came to pass last month. Ford seized his opportunity with aplomb. He played flat to the line and showed his ability to unlock defences with astute distribution, tactical kicking, pace and footwork. Farrell does not have all those attributes in his repertoire, but neither did Jonny Wilkinson and it didn’t stop him becoming the country’s iconic, World Cup-winning hero. Stuart Lancaster decided to drop Farrell in place of Billy Twelvetrees for the international against Australia. Like Wilkinson, Farrell is a ‘Test match animal’. In a position often populated by more delicate artists, he is made of steel, with a warrior spirit and armed with cold composure as a supreme goal-kicker, despite the competitive fire that rages within. What he needs now is game after game after game at fly-half for Saracens, to rediscover his missing sharpness, while further honing his efforts to feel at home playing flat to the line. It may actually help him that Ford has earned Lancaster’s trust, as it reduces the risk that he will be assessed differently to others. To start a Test, he must be ready; fully fit and playing well. At the age of 23, he is no veteran. He cannot slot back into the old routine without preparation. Farrell will be an international match-winner again, of that there can be no doubt, but England have learned the hard way that he needs to be handled with care, like all their other assets. Irish rugby is on a roll. Amid the after-glow of a triumphant autumn campaign for Joe Schmidt’s national team, the country’s union – with government backing – will today outline plans to host the 2023 World Cup. On the field, Ireland will surely go into the Six Nations as favourites to defend their title after beating South Africa, convincingly, and Australia last month. Their prospects at next year’s World Cup appear increasingly bright. Yet, the audacious 2023 hosting plan may be doomed, despite being a united north-south bid, and even allowing for potential use of Gaelic sports venues, including the towering Croke Park in Dublin. The USA may enter the fray and global rugby authorities will be desperate to open up that huge market, while South Africa, Italy and Argentina are all thought to be interested. Jonathan Sexton (centre) in action for Ireland in their 26-23 win against Australia last month. The 2011 tournament in New Zealand generated modest revenue and England are having to make up the short-fall with the lucrative 2015 extravaganza. Twickenham is drowning in logos and general commercial over-load in the increasing effort to maximise profits. To avoid such a scenario again, the chance of smaller nations being awarded the hosting rights have surely faded to nothing. In the modern era of meticulous professionalism, there is still room for the primal, powerful concept of motivation by irritation. Sale have been irked by Saracens’ attitude ahead of tomorrow’s European Champions Cup clash in Salford. Steve Diamond, their fiery director of rugby, said: ‘We’ve been written off. Saracens have already openly stated on TV after their defeat at Munster that they will pick the bonus points up against Sale. Steve Diamond is upset with the attitude shown by Saracens ahead of their clash with Sale. It was one of the players who showed it to me and it is being used as a little tool.’ One Sale player suggested that Saracens are known for being ‘arrogant’ and that the hosts will be fired-up to make a mockery of their rivals’ perceived superiority complex. It is shaping up to be a feisty, niggly, abrasive encounter. Quote of the week. Leicester’s director of rugby, Richard Cockerill, was on vintage comedy form as he reflected on Tom Croft’s delayed return to action after injury, saying: ‘Crofty was in the 23 last weekend, but his wife decided to have a baby. Leicester's director of rugby Richard Cockerill was in hilarious form talking about Tom Croft becoming a dad. 'He’s a proud dad of Victoria. It took long enough – started Friday and finished Saturday afternoon! 'For some reason they wanted to have the baby at the General hospital rather than the Royal Infirmary (close to Welford Road), so he couldn’t even pop across the road to play, then pop back again. 'That’s the reason they built the hospital there!’ Last Word. England and Wales players will hurl themselves into European club combat this weekend, their bodies still shattered from four Tests in succession last month. It is too much of a strain. The clubs cannot be blamed for picking their leading men for key continental fixtures which could make or break their season – especially as they have been without those players since late October. Twelvetrees (second right) and his England team-mates should have an extra break after their exertions. By and large, the club directors of rugby and coaches demonstrate a commendable desire to manage the work-load of their internationals. The stark fact is that four Tests in November is excessive and is driven by financial considerations. It requires the IRB, or World Rugby – as they now wish to be known – to strictly regulate the congested calendar. Each European nation should play two Tests against leading southern-hemisphere countries and one against a Tier Two side every autumn, before an obligatory rest week for all players involved.

Here is an article: A Twitter tweet announcing the company's planned initial public offering. Photograph: Gerard Julien/AFP/Getty Images In the coming weeks, investors will be faced with an intriguing choice. Buy shares in the Royal Mail, one of the oldest long-distance communication enterprises in the world – or take a punt on Twitter, one of the newest. The internet has created plenty of work for postmen delivering parcels despatched by online shops, but written messages more often travel in bits and bytes than envelopes these days. The Royal Mail delivers to 29m addresses in the UK – and sends more mail on its way overseas. But Twitter claims 215 million active monthly users, and is growing fast, with its following up from 150 million a year ago. Comparisons are less flattering when it comes to hard cash. Royal Mail Group has an annual turnover of £9bn, while Twitter tapped advertisers for a mere 316m (£197m) in 2012 and despite being seven years old has never turned a profit. Which means that, while Royal Mail generates £310 in revenue per address, Twitter's active addresses produce just 1.47 of revenue each – around 92p per year. The 500-year-old postal service will float at about £3.3bn – a shadow of the 12.8bn (£8bn) Twitter is likely to raise. But the Royal Mail is considered a sure bet. Analysts say its value could soon rise to as much as £4.5bn, thanks to changes in the law that will allow it to set higher delivery prices. Twitter's digital precursors suggest room for growth is potentially stratospheric. Facebook made 5bn in revenues last year, Google 31bn. But the Twitter feed does not lend itself as easily to advertising as a search engine. Unlike Facebook, it is not the internet version of a telephone directory. Twitter is a soapbox for those with something to say, and if its users do not like the way advertising is introduced, they will say something.

Diana's visit to Angola not only shone a bright light on the issue but also put pressure on world leaders to address the ongoing crisis. In the years following their meeting, progress began to be made as the international community took action to eliminate the use of landmines. In 1997, just months after Diana's tragic death, the Ottawa Treaty was signed by 122 countries, banning the production and use of anti-personnel landmines. Sandra's story has since served as a powerful reminder of the many innocent lives impacted by the horrors of war, and it was in large part due to Princess Diana's advocacy for people like Sandra that global attention was brought to this issue. Sandra Tigica went on to receive her prosthetic leg and rebuild her life, and in honoring the memory of Princess Diana, she continued to share her story with others.

NBC notes the road was dark, with no streetlights. Neither driver was charged, and Thomas was taken for a psychiatric evaluation, per authorities. (A simple way to help prevent suicide? Talk therapy.) Article:","completion":"Tragic Holiday Weekend: Texas Woman Killed While Trying to Rescue Boyfriend in Disturbing Suicide Attempt A holiday weekend took a tragic turn in Harris County, Texas, when a woman lost her life trying to save her boyfriend, who was attempting to commit suicide by lying down in traffic. As reported by NBC News, the horrific incident raised concerns not only about mental health but also about the importance of providing assistance and support for those who need it. On early Saturday morning, Michael Thomas was at a local bar, consuming alcohol, when he decided to walk out into the moving traffic around 12:30 am, intending to get hit by a motor vehicle as a means of committing suicide, per a statement obtained by NBC News. Alarmed by her boyfriend's actions, his unidentified girlfriend immediately went into rescue mode, trying desperately to pull Thomas away from the oncoming vehicles and to the side of the road. However, tragedy struck when the woman was first hit by a Buick LaCrosse, which swerved in a bid to avoid Thomas. She was then struck by a Chevrolet Monte Carlo. NBC News highlighted that the road where the incident occurred was unlit and devoid of any streetlights, making it difficult for the drivers to have a clear view of the unfolding drama. In the aftermath of the incident, neither of the drivers involved was charged. The Harris County Sheriff's Office stated that Thomas was taken for a psychiatric evaluation following the tragic turn of events. While authorities continue to investigate and gather information surrounding the shocking occurrence, it brings into sharp focus the issue of mental health and the need for active conversations and support for those struggling with suicidal thoughts. Talk therapy has been recognized as an effective means of helping to prevent suicide and providing support for those who may be grappling with a range of emotional and mental health challenges. Providing a space for individuals to openly engage with a mental health professional or even a trusted family member or friend, talk therapy allows for the exploration of one's thoughts and feelings in a non-judgmental environment. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that early intervention and support can have a significant positive impact on an individual's mental well-being and help them develop coping and resilience strategies to manage challenging situations such as depression and suicidal thoughts. This heart-wrenching incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of being aware of the mental health struggles taking place for many people around us.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Information: - In mathematics, a planar lamina is a closed set in a plane of mass formula_1 and surface density formula_2 such that: - A prefectural-level municipality, prefectural-level city or prefectural city is an administrative division of the People's Republic of China (PRC), ranking below a province and above a county in China's administrative structure. Prefectural level cities form the second level of the administrative structure (alongside prefectures, leagues and autonomous prefectures). Administrative chiefs (mayors) of prefectural level cities generally have the same rank as a division chief of a national ministry. Since the 1980s, most former prefectures have been renamed into prefectural level cities. - In geometric measurements, length is the most extended dimension of an object. In the International System of Quantities, length is any quantity with dimension distance. In other contexts \\"length\\" is the measured dimension of an object. For example, it is possible to cut a length of a wire which is shorter than wire thickness. - Ili or Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture in northernmost Xinjiang is the only Kazakh autonomous prefecture in China. - A shape is the form of an object or its external boundary, outline, or external surface, as opposed to other properties such as color, texture, or material composition. - An \\"oil field\\" or \\"oilfield\\" is a region with an abundance of oil wells extracting petroleum (crude oil) from below ground. Because the oil reservoirs typically extend over a large area, possibly several hundred kilometres across, full exploitation entails multiple wells scattered across the area. In addition, there may be exploratory wells probing the edges, pipelines to transport the oil elsewhere, and support facilities. - The surface area of a solid object is a measure of the total area that the surface of the object occupies. The mathematical definition of surface area in the presence of curved surfaces is considerably more involved than the definition of arc length of one-dimensional curves, or of the surface area for polyhedra (i.e., objects with flat polygonal faces), for which the surface area is the sum of the areas of its faces. Smooth surfaces, such as a sphere, are assigned surface area using their representation as parametric surfaces. This definition of surface area is based on methods of infinitesimal calculus and involves partial derivatives and double integration. - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. - Quantity is a property that can exist as a magnitude or multitude. Quantities can be compared in terms of \\"more\\", \\"less\\", or \\"equal\\", or by assigning a numerical value in terms of a unit of measurement. Quantity is among the basic classes of things along with quality, substance, change, and relation. Some quantities are such by their inner nature (as number), while others are functioning as states (properties, dimensions, attributes) of things such as heavy and light, long and short, broad and narrow, small and great, or much and little. A small quantity is sometimes referred to as a quantulum. - Volume is the quantity of three-dimensional space enclosed by a closed surface, for example, the space that a substance (solid, liquid, gas, or plasma) or shape occupies or contains. Volume is often quantified numerically using the SI derived unit, the cubic metre. The volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container, i. e. the amount of fluid (gas or liquid) that the container could hold, rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces. - Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape, or planar lamina, in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept). - Karamay or Kelamayi is a prefecture-level city in the north of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, People's Republic of China. The name of the city comes from the Uyghur language, and means \\"black oil\\", referring to the oil fields near the city. - Paint is any liquid, liquefiable, or mastic composition that, after application to a substrate in a thin layer, converts to a solid film. It is most commonly used to protect, color, or provide texture to objects. Paint can be made or purchased in many colorsand in many different types, such as watercolor, synthetic, etc. Paint is typically stored, sold, and applied as a liquid, but most types dry into a solid. - The Uyghur or Uighur language (Uyghur: ), formerly known as Eastern Turki, is a Turkic language with 10 to 25 million speakers, spoken primarily by the Uyghur people in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of Western China. Significant communities of Uyghur-speakers are located in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, and various other countries have Uyghur-speaking expatriate communities. Uyghur is an official language of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, and is widely used in both social and official spheres, as well as in print, radio, and television, and is used as a lingua franca by other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. - Tacheng ( Tarbagatay ) Prefecture is located in northern Xinjiang , People 's Republic of China . It has an area of 98,824 km2 ( 38,156 sq mi ) and a population of 892,397 ( 2000 ) . It is a part of Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture .

On 28 December 2007 the Pakistan government claimed that it had strong evidence regarding Baitullah Mehsud as the man behind the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on 27 December 2007. The Pakistani government released a transcript it asserted was from a conversation between Baitullah Mehsud and Maulvi Sahib (literally \\"Mr. Cleric\\"). According to the transcript Maulvi Sahib claimed credit for the attack, Baitullah Mehsud asked who carried it out, and was told, \\"There were Saeed, the second was Badarwala Bilal and Ikramullah was also there.\\" The translation released from Agence France Presse differed slightly from the translation from the Associated Press. According to the transcripts Baitullah Mehsud says he is at, \\"Anwar Shah's house\\", in Makeen or Makin. The Agence France Presse transcript identifies Makeen as a town in South Waziristan. Subsequently, both Agence France Presse and NDTV released an official denial by Mehsud's spokesman in which he said that Mehsud had no involvement in the attack, that the transcript was \\"a drama\\", that it would have been \\"impossible\\" for militants to penetrate the security cordon around Bhutto, and that her death was a \\"tragedy\\" which had left Mehsud \\"shocked\\".

Article:An international team has been studying samples of plankton collected during a three-year global expedition. They have so far found 35,000 species of bacteria, 5,000 new viruses and 150,000 single-celled plants and creatures. They believe that the majority of these are new to science. Dr Chris Bowler, from the National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), in Paris, told BBC News: \\"We have the most complete description yet of planktonic organisms to date: what's there in terms of viruses, bacteria and protozoa - we finally have a catalogue of what is present globally.\\" Planktonic organisms are minute, but together they make up 90% of the mass of all of the marine life in the oceans. They include viruses, bacteria, single-celled plants and creatures (protozoa). They form the very base of the food chain, and produce - through photosynthesis - half of the oxygen we breathe. However, until now, little has been known about this unseen ocean ecosystem. The Tara expedition, primarily funded by the French fashion designer Agnes B, set out to change that. An international team of scientists took part in expeditions onboard the Tara schooner between 2009 and 2013. It sailed 30,000km across the world's oceans, with researchers collecting 35,000 samples, taking them from the very top layers of the ocean down to 1,000m below the waves. The project has cost about 10m euros. So far the scientists have analysed 579 of the 35,000 samples collected, presenting the results in five scientific papers. Dr Bowler said the research was transforming our understanding of these ocean communities. \\"For the viruses, we describe about 5,000 virus communities - only 39 of these were previously known. \\"And for protists - unicellular organisms - we estimate something like 150,000 different taxa. \\"There are about 11,000 formally described species of plankton - we have evidence for at least 10 times more than that.\\" Of the 35,000 microbes found, most had been seen before, however a genetic analysis of them revealed many new genes. \\"We have 40 million genes - about 80% of which are new to science,\\" explained Dr Bower. The researchers also analysed how plankton communities are organised. \\"We have thrown all of these together to see who interacts with whom,\\" said Dr Bower. \\"We now have a big dataset where we can ask: 'who do you always find with someone else?' or 'who do you never find with someone else'. \\"This helps us to describe symbiosis and interactions that go beyond grazing and predator-prey relationships.\\" The researchers have found that many of the organisms, particularly the bacteria, are sensitive to temperature. Dr Bowler said: \\"It is temperature that determines what sort of communities of organisms we find. If we look at our data and we see what organisms are there, we can predict with 97% probability the temperature of the water they are living in. \\"These organisms are most sensitive to temperature, more than anything else, and with changing temperatures as a result of climate change we are likely to see changes in this community.\\" The researchers say that this scientific analysis is just the beginning. They are making their findings freely available to the scientific community to gain a better understanding of this vital but unseen underwater world. Dr Bowler continued: \\"The amount of data we have released is already enormous; it is one of the largest databases of DNA available to the scientific community. But we've analysed perhaps 2% of the samples we have collected throughout the world - so there is a huge amount of work to do in the future to understand even more about the functioning of these marine ecosystems and the importance of that for the wellbeing of the planet. \\"So it's really just the beginning of the study.\\" Follow Rebecca on Twitter A summary of the above article is?","completion":"An international team of researchers has identified 35,000 species of bacteria, 5,000 new viruses, and 150,000 single-celled plants and creatures in samples of plankton collected during a three-year global expedition.

A:","completion":"A: The first step of the process begins with inhalation, or breathing in air, which involves the contraction of the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles located between the ribs. When these muscles contract, the volume of the thoracic cavity increases, resulting in a decrease in air pressure within the lungs. This pressure difference causes air to flow into the lungs from the atmosphere. The air travels through the respiratory system, which includes the nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx, trachea, and bronchi, ultimately reaching the bronchioles. The bronchioles are the small, thin-walled tubes that act as conduits for air, leading to the alveoli or air sacs. In the alveoli, oxygen exchange and carbon dioxide removal take place, playing a vital role in the respiratory process."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
