In 1995, material costs were 30 cents for the jewel case and 10 to 15 cents for the CD. Wholesale cost of CDs was 0.75 to 1.15, which retailed for 16.98. On average, the store received 35 percent of the retail price, the record company 27 percent, the artist 16 percent, the manufacturer 13 percent, and the distributor 9 percent. When 8-track tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs were introduced, each was marketed at a higher price than the format they succeeded, even though the cost to produce the media was reduced. This was done because the apparent value increased. This continued from vinyl to CDs but was broken when Apple marketed MP3s for 0.99, and albums for 9.99. The incremental cost, though, to produce an MP3 is very small. Q: Who received the most profit from the sale of CDs?","completion":"Imagine you are buying a toy, and the toy's price is divided among different people who helped make it.

When you are learning English, listening, speaking and writing are important, but reading can also be very helpful. When you read, you can not only learn some new words, but also learn how to use these English words. When you read, it gives you a good example for writing. Good reading tips: Try to read at the right level . Read something that you can (more or less) understand. If you need to stop every three words to use a dictionary, it is not interesting. Try to increase the number of your new words. If there are four or five new words on a page, write them in your notebook. But you don't have to write them while you read. Instead, try to guess their meanings as you read: mark them with a pen. Then come back when you have finished reading to look them up in a dictionary and write them in your own vocabulary book. Then try to remember them. Try to read regularly. For example, read for a short time once a day. Fifteen minutes every day is better than two hours every Sunday. Fix a time to read and keep to it. You could read for fifteen minutes when you go to bed, or when you get up or at lunchtime. Read what interests you. Choose a book or a magazine about a subject that you like, because you are going to spend time and money reading it. So, choose an interesting book. You can also read newspapers. There are many English newspapers in China. For example, 21st Century Teens. It is easy enough for you to understand. There is something interesting in it. To make your reading better, _ . A) it's enough for you to read 21st Century Teens B) only read a magazine about a subject that you like C) you should read something that you like for a short time once a day at least D) reading English for two hours every Sunday is much better Answer:","completion":"C) you should read something that you like for a short time once a day at least Reading in English can bring numerous benefits for learners, and it is crucial to maximize its advantages by following some helpful tips. Firstly, it is essential to select materials that are suitable for your reading level. If you require frequent dictionary consultations, the material might be too advanced and potentially discourage your progress. Aim for texts with four or five unknown words on a page and try to deduce their meanings from the context before consulting a dictionary. This approach will enable you to maintain a steady flow while refining your vocabulary. Maintaining consistency in your reading practice is key to achieving progress. Establishing a routine that involves reading for a short period every day (e.g., 15 minutes) is more effective than reading for longer durations sporadically (e.g., two hours every Sunday). By allotting specific time slots for your reading sessions – be it before bed, upon waking up, or during lunch – you enhance your chances of forming a beneficial habit. It is equally important to read texts that genuinely interest and engage you. Whether it's books, magazines, or even newspapers, select the materials based on your preferences, as this will motivate you to continue reading. For example, 21st Century Teens is an English newspaper readily available in China that might prove suitable for many learners with its accessible content and diverse range of topics. To sum up, reading in English can significantly improve your language skills, provided you adopt a consistent routine, select suitable materials, and engage with topics that genuinely interest you. By following these guidelines, you will not only expand your vocabulary but also enhance your overall understanding of English language usage."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He researched Mount St. Helens in the United States before and after its 1980 eruption, and was very distraught about the death of fellow volcanologist David A.

In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request.

Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, 300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget. In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort. He bought several Strip properties — the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them — and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort — Mirage — which became an instant success. Question: \\"What did Hughes do as soon as he arrived in Vegas in 1966?\\" Answer: \\"He got married\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"No, the answer is not correct. When Howard Hughes arrived in Las Vegas in 1966, he cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse.

Answer this question please: Would pack A's health warning be more or less visible than pack B's? A:","completion":"Pack A's health warning would be less visible than pack B's health warning. Here's a step-by-step explanation: 1. The background information states that beginning in September 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration required larger, more prominent cigarette health warnings on all cigarette packaging and advertisements in the United States. 2. Based on this information, the health warnings on cigarette packs became more visible after September 2012. 3. Pack A is from before September 2012, when the new, more visible health warnings were not yet required. 4. Pack B is from after September 2012, when the new, more visible health warnings were required. 5. Since Pack A is from the time before the more visible health warnings were required, its health warning would be smaller and less prominent compared to Pack B. 6. Therefore, Pack A's health warning would be less visible than Pack B's health warning."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Nick Answer:","completion":"Title: The Enigma Envelope Genre: Mystery, Thriller, Drama Plot: Michael Thompson, a struggling journalist in his late 30s, is stuck at a dead-end job in a local newspaper. Like any ambitious person in his profession, he dreams of writing a groundbreaking story that would earn him recognition and success, but life seems to have different plans for him. One day, Michael's old college friend, Nick, pays him an unexpected visit. They both had lost touch over the years and Michael is pleasantly surprised to see him. As they catch up over drinks, Nick mentions a strange article he found in the attic of his grandmother's house. He hands Michael an old, worn out envelope containing the article. Intrigued, Michael examines the article closely and realizes it's about a high-profile unsolved murder case from the 1970s. The story was written by a renowned investigative journalist named James Harris, who suspiciously vanished a few years after this piece was published. Harris had claimed that he was on the brink of cracking the case and exposing a deep-seated conspiracy involving corrupt police officials, powerful organized crime figures, and potentially even government officials. But before he could make his findings public, he disappeared. This revelation sparks new life in Michael's journalistic ambitions. Determined to uncover the truth behind Harris' disappearance and potentially solve the high-profile murder case, he embarks on an investigation with Nick's help. Together, they follow a trail of clues left by the long-dead journalist, leading them further down a dark and twisted path filled with danger and deceit. As they dig deeper, the duo starts uncovering a web of complex alliances and powerful people who will do anything to keep their secrets buried. Nick's life becomes endangered when the criminal underworld realizes that he might hold the key to unravelling their long-hidden secrets. Fearing for his friend's life, Michael races against time to piece together the puzzle and break the story that has the potential to bring justice for the victims and bring the perpetrators to light. The climax unfolds in a thrilling and dramatic confrontation at an abandoned warehouse, where Michael and Nick face their adversaries and lay their lives on the line for the sake of truth and journalistic integrity. As the truth surfaces, their story gains nationwide attention, not only solving the decades-old mystery but also exposing a powerful criminal network that has long manipulated the city's affairs from the shadows.

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First, let's address both questions independently, then we can discuss if they are asking the same thing or not. First question: How many Facebook victims were there in 2010? The term \\"Facebook victims\\" can be interpreted in different ways. If you mean the number of people who fell victim to scams, hacks, or data breaches involving Facebook in 2010, it's challenging to provide an exact number, as many incidents may have gone unreported or undetected. Nevertheless, I can provide some notable incidents that occurred in 2010: 1. In October 2010, there was a major privacy breach involving third-party applications on Facebook. At the time, the 10 most popular Facebook apps, including FarmVille, Texas HoldEm Poker, and FrontierVille, were found to be leaking the user IDs of app users to advertisers and third parties. It is estimated that tens of millions of Facebook users were affected by this breach. 2. Throughout 2010, numerous Facebook scams and attacks were reported, a trend that continues today. Some of these scams included phishing attacks, bogus friend requests, the \\"dislike button\\" scam, and many more. The exact number of victims of these various scams is unknown, but it's safe to say that thousands, if not millions, of users were harmed or inconvenienced. Second question: How many Facebook victims were there in 2005? Facebook was in its infancy in 2005, having been launched only the previous year. As a result, there were significantly fewer users compared to 2010, translating to fewer potential victims. The majority of users at this time were students and members of specific universities and schools. It's worth noting that in 2005, Facebook was not as ubiquitous as it became later on, and many of the privacy issues, scams, and attacks associated with the platform had not yet emerged. Now, to address the final query: Are these two questions asking the same thing? No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. While both questions inquire about the number of Facebook victims in a given year, they refer to two distinct years, 2010 and 2005. The number of Facebook victims is likely to differ between those years due to the platform's growth, the evolution of the digital landscape, and changes in privacy and security measures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Duchy of Bavaria dates back to the year 555. In the 17th century CE (AD), the Duke of Bavaria became a Prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire. The Kingdom of Bavaria existed from 1806 to 1918, when Bavaria became a republic. In 1946, the Free State of Bavaria re-organised itself on democratic lines after the Second World War. Bavaria has a unique culture, largely because of the state's Catholic majority (52%) and conservative traditions. Bavarians have traditionally been proud of their culture, which includes festivals such as Oktoberfest and elements of Alpine symbolism. The state also has the second largest economy among the German states by GDP figures, giving it a status as a rather wealthy German region. 1. Which festival does Bavaria celebrate? 2.

Half the students sneered. The rest nearly fell out of their chairs laughing. \\"Don't be silly, only geniuses can become writers,\\" the English teacher said, \\"And you are getting a D this semester.\\" I was so humiliated that I burst into tears. That night I wrote a short sad poem about broken dreams and mailed it to the Capri's Weekly newspaper. To my astonishment, they published it and sent me two dollars. I was a published and paid writer. I showed it to my teacher and fellow students. They laughed. \\"Just plain dumb luck,\\" the teacher said. I tasted success. I'd sold the first thing I'd ever written. That was more than any of them had done and if it was just dumb luck, that was fine with me. During the next two years I sold dozens of poems, letters, jokes and recipes. By the time I graduated from high school, with a C minus average, I had scrapbooks filled with my published work. I never mentioned my writing to my teachers, friends or my family again. They were dream killers and if people must choose between their friends and their dreams, they must always choose their dreams. I had four children at the time, and the oldest was only four. While the children slept, I typed on my ancient typewriter. I wrote what I felt. It took nine months, just like a baby. A month later Crying Wind, the title of my book, became a best seller, was translated into fifteen languages and Braille and sold worldwide. I appeared on TV talk shows. I traveled from New York to California and Canada on promotional tours. My first book also became required reading in native American schools in Canada. People ask what college I attended, what degrees I had and what qualifications I have to be a writer. The answer is: \\"None.\\" I just write. I'm not a genius.

Question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: At the last minute, a wealthy American expatriate in Europe, Richard Sturges (Clifton Webb), buys a steerage-class ticket for the maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic from a Basque immigrant. Once aboard he seeks out his runaway wife, Julia (Barbara Stanwyck). He discovers she is trying to take their two unsuspecting children, 18-year-old Annette (Audrey Dalton) and ten-year-old Norman (Harper Carter), to her hometown of Mackinac, Michigan, to raise as down-to-earth Americans rather than rootless elitists like Richard himself. As the ship prepares for departure, her captain, E. J. Smith (Brian Aherne), receives a hint from the shipping company representative that a record-setting speedy passage would be welcomed. Other passengers include a wealthy woman of a working-class origin (based on a real-life Titanic survivor Molly Brown), Maude Young (Thelma Ritter); social-climbing Earl Meeker (Allyn Joslyn); a 20-year-old Purdue University tennis player, Gifford \\"Giff\\" Rogers (Robert Wagner); and George S. Healey (Richard Basehart), a Catholic priest who has been defrocked for alcoholism. When Annette learns her mother's intentions, she insists on returning to Europe with her father on the next ship as soon as they reach America. Julia concedes that her daughter is old enough to make her own decisions, but she insists on keeping custody of Norman. This angers Richard, forcing Julia to reveal that Norman is not his child, but rather the result of a one-night stand after one of their many bitter arguments. Upon hearing that, he agrees to give up all claim to Norman. Richard joins Maude, Earl, and George Widener in the lounge to play contract bridge with them. The next morning, when Norman reminds Richard about a shuffleboard game they had scheduled, Richard coldly brushes him off. Meanwhile Giff falls for Annette at first glance.

It was a made-for-TV moment that all presidents would relish, but it seemed especially significant for the man who turned a reality TV career into a successful bid for the presidency. Donald Trump triumphantly greeted the three Americans released by North Korea in the early morning darkness at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington early Thursday, an image one can expect to see over and over again come the 2020 U.S. presidential election campaign. “It was a very important thing to all of us to be able to get these three great people out,” Trump told reporters on the tarmac. He then went on to speculate that live television coverage of the arrival “probably broke the all-time in history television rating for 3 o’clock in the morning.” It was a moment the president gladly seized given that his White House has been buffeted by a chaotic mix of policy and personal drama in recent days. The prospect of a potentially historic breakthrough on North Korea could move a number of other unwelcome distractions to the side, including the ongoing Russia investigation, the growing legal difficulties for Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the soap opera that the Stormy Daniels story has become. Daniels is the adult film actress who claims she once had an affair with Trump. He denies the claim. Trump also announced Thursday on Twitter that he will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore. A new CNN poll found that 77 percent of those surveyed support Trump meeting the North Korean leader, and 53 percent approve of his handling of the North Korea issue generally. Those numbers are in keeping with a general trend of late that has seen the president’s poll ratings improving, perhaps in part because of the strong economy.

Step 1: Analyze the question and the given choices In this question, we are asked to identify the component through which the blood is transported in most animals via the circulatory system. The given choices are fur, stratum corneum, nerves, and body. Step 2: Eliminate irrelevant choices - Fur: Fur is the outer covering of animals providing insulation. It plays no role in blood circulation. - Stratum corneum: Stratum corneum is the outermost layer of the skin, and it is not related to blood circulation. - Nerves: Nerves are part of the nervous system that transmits signals from the brain to the rest of the body, but they are not the main component for blood transportation. Step 3: Identify the correct choice - Body: Blood is transported by the circulatory system throughout an animal's body to supply oxygen and nutrients to the cells, and remove waste products from them.

Please answer the following question: Dogs are social animals and without proper training, they will behave like wild animals. They will soil your house, destroy your belongings, bark excessively, fight other dogs and even bite you. Nearly all behavior problems are perfectly normal dog activities that occur at the wrong time or place or are directed at the wrong thing. The key to preventing or treating behavior problems is learning to teach the dog to redirect its normal behavior to an outlet that is acceptable in the domestic setting. One of the best things you can do for your dog and yourself is to train its obedience. Obedience training doesn't solve all behavior problems, but it is the foundation for solving just about any problem. Training pens up a line of communication between you and your dog. Effective communication is necessary to instruct your dog about what you want it to do. Training is also an easy way to establish the social rank order. When your dog obeys a simple request of \\"come here, sit,\\" it is showing obedience and respect for you. It is not necessary to establish yourself as top dog or leader of the pack by using extreme measure. You can teach your dog its subordinate role by teaching it to show submission to you. Most dogs love performing tricks for you to pleasantly accept that you are in charge. Training should be fun and rewarding for you and your dog. It can enrich your relationship and make living together more enjoyable. A well-trained dog is more confident and can more safely be allowed a greater amount of freedom than an untrained animal. Behavior problems of dogs are believed to _ . A) occur when they go wild B) be just part of their nature C) get worse in modern society D) become a threat to the community A:","completion":"B) be just part of their nature The passage states that \\"nearly all behavior problems are perfectly normal dog activities that occur at the wrong time or place or are directed at the wrong thing.\\" This suggests that these behaviors are a natural part of a dog's instincts and tendencies, which can be redirected and modified through training and establishing a proper social rank in a domestic setting."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What is the full name of the person that had a reclusive life style? Answer the above question based on the context below: Charles-Valentin Alkan (French: [ʃaʁl valɑ̃tɛ̃ alkɑ̃]; 30 November 1813 – 29 March 1888) was a French-Jewish composer and virtuoso pianist. At the height of his fame in the 1830s and 1840s he was, alongside his friends and colleagues Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt, among the leading pianists in Paris, a city in which he spent virtually his entire life. Alkan earned many awards at the Conservatoire de Paris, which he entered before he was six. His career in the salons and concert halls of Paris was marked by his occasional long withdrawals from public performance, for personal reasons. Although he had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the Parisian artistic world, including Eugène Delacroix and George Sand, from 1848 he began to adopt a reclusive life style, while continuing with his compositions – virtually all of which are for the keyboard. During this period he published, among other works, his collections of large-scale studies in all the major keys (Op. 35) and all the minor keys (Op. 39). The latter includes his Symphony for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 4–7) and Concerto for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 8–10), which are often considered among his masterpieces and are of great musical and technical complexity. Alkan emerged from self-imposed retirement in the 1870s to give a series of recitals that were attended by a new generation of French musicians. Alkan's attachment to his Jewish origins is displayed both in his life and his work. He was the first composer to incorporate Jewish melodies in art music. Fluent in Hebrew and Greek, he devoted much time to a complete new translation of the Bible into French. This work, like many of his musical compositions, is now lost. Alkan never married, but his presumed son Élie-Miriam Delaborde was, like Alkan, a virtuoso performer on both the piano and the pedal piano, and edited a number of the elder composer's works. Following his death (which according to persistent but unfounded legend was caused by a falling bookcase) Alkan's music became neglected,...

He was a French-Jewish composer and virtuoso pianist who, despite his initial fame and friendships with fellow leading pianists, such as Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt, started to adopt a reclusive lifestyle from around 1848.

Answer the following question: You are presented with the question \\"what does a solar panel convert sunlight into?\\" and the following answer choices: - adding heat - heat energy - deoxyribonucleic acid - electromagnetic energy - rays or beams - activation energy - Solar energy - electrons in motion Now knowing that asolar panel converts sunlight into electricity and electricity is electrons in motion, choose the best answer. Answer:","completion":"A solar panel works through the process referred to as the Photovoltaic Effect. This phenomenon involves the conversion of sunlight (which is essentially a form of electromagnetic energy) into electricity. In a solar panel, sunlight is absorbed by photovoltaic cells, which are generally made up of semi-conductive material, usually silicon. The absorbed sunlight provides energy that excites the electrons in the silicon. When these electrons are excited, they move from a state of low energy to a higher energy state, thereby creating an electric current. This electric current is direct current (DC) electricity. The DC electricity is then usually converted into alternating current (AC) electricity (the type of electricity used in most homes) by an inverter, to be used for typical household appliances and systems. Therefore, and considering the provided answer choices, the most accurate is \\"electrons in motion\\". None of the other choices entirely capture the concept of what a solar panel does. While some might somewhat describe part of the process or result in broader or somewhat related terms, they do not accurately describe the conversion process that occurs in a solar panel. For instance, while sunlight is a form of \\"electromagnetic energy\\", a solar panel doesn’t convert sunlight into electromagnetic energy; instead, it uses the electromagnetic energy from the sunlight. Similarly, while \\"heat energy\\" could, in a way, describe a form of energy gained from sunlight, solar panels specifically aim to convert sunlight into electrical energy, not general heat energy. Also, \\"solar energy\\" is too broad a term for the specific result of a solar panel's operation, which is the generation of electricity.

Article: Detective Chief Inspector Jes Fry said they were examining cold case files nationally to try and identify her. Mr Fry said: \\"We are at the very early stages of the investigation and it could be a complex inquiry. \\"The body had been there for some time. The circumstances suggest this is a murder case and we are looking at missing persons reports and cold cases both locally and nationwide.\\" Residents expressed their shock at the discovery of human remains in woodland on the Queen’s country retreat in Norfolk. A major police inquiry was launched after a dog walker discovered the woman's remains on New Year’s Day just a mile from the Royal Stud and less than two miles from the estate’s main residence. Officers are carrying out a “detailed search” throughout the area of woodland in Anger, near King’s Lynn, which is east of Sandringham House, where members of the Royal Family had gathered. The operation was kept secret for more than 24 hours as detectives worked to establish how the body was so close to the Royal residence. A large area of the woodland had been cordoned off. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, who are currently staying on the 20,000-acre (8,000-hectare) estate for their Christmas break, were informed of the discovery on Monday night. The body was discovered shortly after the Royals attended a church service on Sunday. A post mortem is due to take place later. It remains unclear how long the woman's body has been there. The dog walker has also not been named. Residents told The Daily Telegraph that the large police operation had been shrouded in secrecy. One resident, who did not want to be named, said: “There is a heavy police presence even 24 hours after the discovery. \\"You couldn't get very close to the site. Police said they expected to be there on tomorrow (Tuesday). \\"It is just a stone's throw from the Stud and the Royals' house. It is very close.\\" Another resident, who also did not want to be named, said locals were shocked at the discovery. \\"I spoke to several of my friends who work on the estate and they were at work on Monday and didn't hear anything about it,\\" he said. \\"No one knows anything about it. It has been quite a secret operation. \\"The area is only used by people who work nearby, dog walkers and local residents.\\" He added: \\"It is quite a bit of a shock, given the proximity to the grounds itself. The area is really not that far from Sandringham House. \\"We are all a bit stunned to be honest. It is just a really quiet area.\\" Mike Berman, the Chairman of Norfolk Ramblers, added: \\"I believe Anmer did once have a burial site which is no longer used so perhaps that may shed some light on the discovery.\\" A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman declined to comment, referring inquiries to police. The details emerged just days after the Duke, 90, left Papworth Hospital, Cambridgeshire, where he was treated for a blocked artery after suffering chest pains. The Duke’s heart scare forced him to miss the annual celebrations, including the annual Boxing Day shoot. He was airlifted to hospital from Sandringham on December 23 and kept under observation for four nights after undergoing the “minimally invasive procedure” of coronary stenting, which was declared a success. The Queen, who makes it her official base until February, was seen riding on the estate on Monday morning. The 85-year-old year-old wore only a headscarf and the hood of her long blue waxed jacket for protection as she rode a chestnut coloured horse. She emerged in the winter sunshine a few minutes later on horseback, accompanied by a smartly-dressed male groom on a white horse who was wearing a proper black riding hat in case he fell off. Sandringham has served as a private residence for Royal Family since 1862. King George V, the queen's grandfather, once called \\"dear old Sandringham ... (the) place I love better than anywhere in the world\\". Around half of the estate is let to farm tenants, with much of the remainder used for forestry. In October The Daily Telegraph disclosed that the remains of an American man had been lying near Buckingham Palace for years. Robert James Moore sent hundreds of letters to the Queen and was driven by his obsession to set up home within sight of Buckingham Palace, on an island in St James’s Park. But somehow his camp that he set up by went unnoticed until a tree surgeon uncovered the remains of his body in October, as many as three years after his death. ||||| British police are treating the discovery of a body on the queen's Sandringham estate as murder. A woman's body was found on the vast estate in eastern England on New Year's Day, and Detective Chief Inspector Jes Fry said authorities are examining missing person reports and unsolved cases around the country to see if there are any links. \\"We are at the very early stages of the investigation and it could be a complex inquiry,\\" Fry said Tuesday. \\"The body had been there for some time.\\" Authorities were doing a post-mortem Tuesday on the body. A member of the public found the body in a woodland at Anmer, a tiny village 115 miles (185 kilometers) northeast of London. The village is part of the Sandringham estate where the royal family spends some of its holidays. The hamlet of Anmer is home to several dozen people and sits around three miles (4.8 kilometers) from Sandringham House, which has served as a private residence for British monarchs since 1862. Queen Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip spent part of the holiday season there and were at Sandringham House on New Year's Day. Sandringham Estate's website says the entire estate is spread over 8,000 hectares (19,768 acres) in Norfolk. Sandringham House and its gardens make up 24 hectares (59 acres), and there are 240 hectares (590 acres) of woods and open countryside in a section that is open to the public free of charge all year. There are also two stud farms and a fruit farm. The estate employs over 100 full-time staff. Buckingham Palace referred all questions about the body's discovery back to police. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A woman's body was found on the Queen's Sandringham estate in Norfolk, eastern England, on New Year's Day, launching a major police investigation that is being treated as a murder case.

The Royal College of Music commissioned an official portrait of the composer from Sir Gerald Kelly (1952) which hangs in the college. The Manchester Art Gallery has a bronze sculpture of Vaughan Williams by Epstein (1952) and the National Portrait Gallery (NPG) has drawings by Joyce Finzi (1947) and Juliet Pannett (1957 and 1958); versions of a bronze head of the composer by David McFall (1956) are in the NPG and at the entrance to the Music reading room of the British Library. There is a statue of Vaughan Williams in Dorking, and a bust in Chelsea Embankment Gardens, near his old house in Cheyne Walk.In 1994 a group of enthusiasts founded the Ralph Vaughan Williams Society, with the composer's widow as its president and Roy Douglas and Michael Kennedy as vice presidents. The society, a registered charity, has sponsored and encouraged performances of the composer's works including complete symphony cycles and a Vaughan Williams opera festival. The society has promoted premieres of neglected works, and has its own record label, Albion Records.Composers of the generation after Vaughan Williams reacted against his style, which became unfashionable in influential musical circles in the 1960s; diatonic and melodic music such as his was neglected in favour of atonal and other modernist compositions. In the 21st century this neglect has been reversed. In the fiftieth anniversary year of his death two contrasting documentary films were released: Tony Palmer's O Thou Transcendent: The Life of Vaughan Williams and John Bridcut's The Passions of Vaughan Williams. British audiences were prompted to reappraise the composer. The popularity of his most accessible works, particularly the Tallis Fantasia and The Lark Ascending increased, but a wide public also became aware of what a reviewer of Bridcut's film called \\"a genius driven by emotion\\". Among the 21st-century musicians who have acknowledged Vaughan Williams's influence on their development are John Adams, PJ Harvey, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, Anthony Payne, Wayne...

Answer:","completion":"The given review would likely decrease the chances of buying the product, particularly if the primary purpose of the purchase is for group studies and engaging in deeper discussions. While this specific review doesn't entirely dismiss the product as worthless, it does highlight a few shortcomings that could affect the overall experience and purpose of using it for group studies. Firstly, the reviewer mentions that the study questions provided are more like quiz questions, which only ensure that the reader has read the book. This indicates that the questions do not encourage thought-provoking conversations or lead to deeper, more meaningful discussions among the group members, which is often a crucial aspect for successful group studies. Secondly, the reviewer points out that they had to write their own questions to foster better-quality discussions within the group, and the study guide only helped with this task to a limited extent. This could signal a potential inconvenience for those who are looking for a comprehensive and well-structured guide to facilitate group studies without having to invest significant time or effort into creating their own materials. Lastly, the reviewer does mention one positive aspect of the study guide: the incorporation of key Bible verses related to the chapters discussed. However, they also note that this useful feature is not consistently present throughout the guide. In conclusion, this particular review would likely decrease the chances of purchasing the product if the main intention is for group study sessions and engaging in deeper discussions. The review highlights the limited scope and inadequate support of the study guide in facilitating meaningful conversations, while only acknowledging some minor positive aspects. It is important to consider other reviews and factors before making a decision, as well. Additionally, potential buyers should assess their own needs and preferences in the context of the product's limitations, and look for alternative products or supplementary materials if necessary, to ensure a satisfying group study experience."},{"prompt":"Q:Process: - Oil is gathered through mining operations - The oil is transported to stores - Oil is purchased by homeowners - Oil is placed into a stove in the house - The oil is lit on fire, and burns for a long time - The warm air off of the oil travels through the house - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose people care less about climate change happens, how will it affect less heat for the house.

By mentioning Lyne's directorial credits for these two films, it is inferred that he serves as the director for \\"Indecent Proposal.\\" Adrian Lyne is a notable director in the realm of film, having established a reputation for creating thrilling and provocative movies that delve into the depths of human relationships and desires. Apart from \\"Fatal Attraction\\" and \\"Indecent Proposal,\\" Lyne has also directed other successful films like \\"Flashdance\\" and \\"Unfaithful.\\" In this proposed biopic about Johnny Stompanato, the choice of Adrian Lyne as a potential director would appear fitting, given his penchant for exploring the dark and complicated nature of human connections. Johnny Stompanato was an enigmatic and controversial figure from the 1950s, often associated with organized crime and romantic relationships with high-profile actresses, including Lana Turner. His life was cut short in 1958, when Turner's teenage daughter, Cheryl Crane, stabbed him in what was later ruled a justifiable homicide due to self-defense. The Stompanato story offers a compelling, dramatic, and intriguing tale that would likely benefit from Adrian Lyne's deft directorial touch.

In conclusion, the sentence \\"Adrian Lyne is the director of 'Indecent Proposal'\\" logically follows the given text and accurately reflects the provided information.

She sweetens the deal with a 25,000 bonus for solving the case. Of course this comes contingent that The Globe gets the exclusive story. Gentry takes the case and begins the investigation of the murder with Weston in tow. When at the club, Gentry encounters a waitress, Marlene (Hedda Lubin), whose obnoxiousness rivals his. He gets through her to speak to another stripper and gets his first suspect, Joseph Carter. Soon, another stripper, Candy Cane, gets murdered and Gentry expands his suspect list to Grout (Ray Sager), an unstable veteran who takes pride in crushing the heads of corpses he found when on the battlefields of Vietnam. He relieves tension by drawing faces on squashes and tomatoes and then crushing them with his bare hands. Gentry also suspects the leader of a radical feminist group that riots in the strip club, carrying banners with catchy phrases like \\"Lewd is Crude\\", \\"Quit with Tit\\" and \\"Women Right On!\\". Pickles, another stripper, is murdered and has her buttocks mutilated with a meat tenderizer hammer before having it salt and peppered. A badge with \\"Women Right On!\\" is found at the scene.

Gentry ignores this and concentrates on the case. His investigation takes him to the owner of the strip clubs in town, Mr. Marzdone Mobilie (Henny Youngman).

Write an article based on this \\"A man who was jailed for 12 years over an international drug trafficking operation is to have more cash seized under proceeds of crime laws.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: International Drug Trafficker Faces Additional Financial Consequences Under Proceeds of Crime Laws Introduction: The ramifications of an international drug trafficking operation continue to unfold for a man who was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Authorities have recently announced their intentions to seize more of his assets under proceeds of crime laws, leaving no doubt that justice will be served to its fullest extent. Background of the Case: The male perpetrator, whose name has been withheld for legal reasons, was arrested and subsequently jailed for his notorious involvement in an extensive international drug trafficking operation. After thorough investigation by law enforcement agencies, it was discovered that his criminal activities spanned across multiple countries, which ultimately led to his arrest and a 12-year jail sentence. The Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA): The Proceeds of Crime Act, enacted in various jurisdictions, targets the profits earned through criminal activity. The legislation offers law enforcement agencies the power to confiscate and recover assets, making it highly effective in targeting individuals like the aforementioned convict. By dismantling the financial support structure behind criminal activities, POCA serves as a vital tool in the fight against organized crime. Recent Developments: In light of the convict's prominent role in the international drug trafficking operation and his now known vast financial resources, the authorities have opted to take further action under the Proceeds of Crime Act. Although specific details of the assets to be seized remain undisclosed, it is expected to include properties, vehicles, and cash holdings. This additional seizure will not affect his existing 12-year prison sentence but will ensure that he faces the full consequences of his unlawful actions. Impact on the Convict: The enforcement of proceeds of crime laws and the additional seizure of assets will have a significant impact on the convict's life. Apart from the already imposed sentence, the seizure of his wealth will limit his financial freedom and reduce the likelihood of re-establishing his drug trafficking operations upon his release from prison, demonstrating the efficacy of combining prison sentences with asset recovery measures. Wider Implications: This case highlights the potency of proceeds of crime laws when implemented correctly. By targeting the financial backbone of organized crime, governments can effectively dismantle operations such as drug trafficking, human trafficking, and weapons smuggling. This approach cuts off resources that would otherwise enable criminal enterprises to continue thriving and ultimately pave a way for a safer society. Conclusion: The confiscation of additional assets under proceeds of crime laws emphasizes the seriousness with which authorities will deal with criminals involved in international drug trafficking operations. Seizing assets in conjunction with imposing lengthy prison sentences sends a strong message to would-be criminals hoping to amass wealth through illegal means. Furthermore, it illustrates the importance of coordination between law enforcement agencies and international bodies to combat organized crime effectively. The decisive action taken against this international drug trafficker underscores the need for urgent and cooperative action in dismantling the financial infrastructure of criminal networks. With continued efforts in this regard, society will be better positioned to combat the scourge of organized crime and make the world a safer place for all."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"The supposed perturbation in this scenario would be indirectly impacting a step of the process. Here's a detailed explanation: First, let's break down the original process: 1. Bees go out during the day and gather food. 2. While gathering food, they make wax, which is the building block of their bee hive. 3. Bees make food called honey. 4. They use a sticky, glue-like substance called propolis as a binding to hold their hives together. 5. Bees produce all of the building blocks to build their hive in their own body. Now, let's consider the hypothetical scenario in which more bees produce propolis. The question asks how this change will affect a smaller hive. We can analyze this by examining the impact of this change on each step of the process. 1. Bees go out during the day and gather food: The scenario does not mention any change to the food-gathering process, so this step is not impacted directly. 2. While gathering food, they make wax, which is the building block of their bee hive: The change in propolis production does not affect the bees' ability to make wax, so this step is not impacted directly either. 3. Bees make food called honey: The production of honey is independent of propolis production, so this step is not directly impacted. 4. They use a sticky, glue-like substance called propolis as a binding to hold their hives together: Here, the change will indirectly impact this step, as having more propolis available could potentially improve the strength and durability of the hive. In the case of a smaller hive, this might mean a more secure and well-constructed hive overall. 5. Bees produce all of the building blocks to build their hive in their own body: This step is indirectly impacted because we are assuming that more bees produce propolis, thereby increasing the availability of this building material for hive construction. In summary, the supposed perturbation of having more bees produce propolis is indirectly impacting a step of the process, as it does not directly change any specific step, but instead alters the amount of propolis available for constructing and maintaining hives. This indirect impact could potentially result in a stronger, more durable, and better-built smaller hive."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Emmet Walsh) to take photos of them. When Visser reports back to Marty, he teases him about being cuckolded. The morning after their tryst, Marty makes a silent phone call to Ray and Abby. The following day Ray goes to the bar to collect his earnings, two weeks worth of work, but instead confronts Marty and quits his job. Marty threatens Ray's life and advises him not to trust Abby, that she will one day tell him she \\"hasn't done anything funny\\" and he won't believe her. Marty then hires Visser to kill the couple. Visser suggests he take a fishing trip to Corpus Christi to establish an alibi. He then breaks into Ray's home, steals Abby's gun, and photographs the sleeping couple through the bedroom window. Visser presents an edited photo of their fake corpses to Marty, who dumps four dead fish on his desk. Marty goes to the bathroom to vomit, then opens the safe to give Visser his 10,000 fee. Visser then shoots Marty with Abby's gun in a double cross, leaving her gun at the scene as evidence that she killed Marty. But he accidentally leaves his cigarette lighter and does not realize that Marty has stolen one of the incriminating photographs and locked it in the safe. Ray returns to the bar to get his last paycheck and accidentally kicks Abby's gun, firing it. He finds a motionless Marty and decides to cover up the murder. He cleans up the blood and disposes of evidence in a backyard...

Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget. It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example: you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall. Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. Question: What does the narrator probably think of dried foods? Answer:","completion":"The text does not provide explicit information on what the narrator thinks about dried foods. However, based on the narrator's emphasis on fresh ingredients, it would seem the narrator would likely not promote dried foods as a first choice. Dried foods might be considered more processed than fresh or frozen ones, thus not strictly adhering to the principles of clean eating as described in the context. However, since the narrator acknowledges the potential for budget constraints and the need to be practical, it is possible they might see dried foods as an acceptable option in certain circumstances, especially if the drying process is natural and doesn't involve the addition of sugars or preservatives. These are conjectures since the narrator's exact stance on dried foods is not specified in the context. The safest assertion we can make is that the narrator highly values fresh and least processed foods for a clean eating lifestyle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: Bob was a homeless boy who lived in a house for homeless children. He always felt lonely and sad. He felt he was a nobody in this world. One day, he said to Mr. White, head of the house, \\"Why did my parents bring me to this world? What value do I have now?\\" Mr. White gave Bob a stone and said to him, \\"Take it to the market, but don't sell it no matter how much money they pay you. Bob took the stone to a market called Green Market. A man wanted to buy it for 100 pounds, and Bob wouldn't sell it. Later, another buyer would pay more for the stone, but Bob still wouldn't sell it. The next day in Center Market, the people would buy it at a much higher price. But Bob wouldn't sell it. The third day, Bob took the stone to Street Market. This time, the people there offered a price which was ten times higher than that in Green Market. But Bob wouldn't sell it. Bob couldn't understand. He asked Mr. White, \\" Why did they pay me so much money for just a stone?\\" \\" Even for a stone, if you think it valuable, it will be valuable, \\" said Mr. White. ,. Question: For what reason didn't Mr. White want Bob to sell the stone? Options: A: Bob wanted a higher price. B: The stone is very expensive. C: Mr. White wanted to teach Bob a lesson. D: Mr. White wanted to play a joke on Bob. Answer:","completion":"C: Mr. White wanted to teach Bob a lesson. In the referenced article, we read about Bob, a homeless boy living in a home for destitute children, feeling useless and questioning his worth. Mr. White, the head of the house, gives Bob a seemingly ordinary stone and advises him to not sell it, regardless of the amount offered. Bob follows this instruction; he takes the stone to various markets, and while numerous interested parties willingly up their offers, Bob refuses to sell. The actions of Mr. White implies he used this scenario as a lesson for Bob, rather than for regards to the stone's potential economic value (which we don't have any indication about within the article) or trying to incite Bob to get a higher offer. He did not give the stone to Bob to make a profit, nor was there any indication that this was a joke. Upon being shown different high-priced offers, Bob is left bewildered about the stone's escalating value. When he returns to Mr. White, the latter uses this as an opportunity to impart a wisdom, saying, \\"Even for a stone, if you think it valuable, it will be valuable.\\" The intention behind the exercise was to make Bob understand the concept of self-worth – that value isn't attached to one's status, property, or what others think, but is instead a product of one’s personal belief. Regardless of Bob’s circumstances or others’ opinions of him, if he perceives himself as valuable, then he is. This unambiguous observation directs us to conclude that the correct answer is 'C: Mr. White wanted to teach Bob a lesson.'"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the specific name of the heavenly figures whose heads are highly circular and who wear round haloes? Perhaps influenced by van Eyck's Madonna in the Church, Lochner closely detailed the fall and gradient of light. According to the art historian Brigitte Corley, the clothes of \\"protagonists change their hues in delicate reaction to the influx of light, reds being transformed through a symphony of pink tonalities to a dusty greyish white, greens to a warm pale yellow, and lemon shading through oranges to a saturated red\\". Lochner employed the notion of supernatural illumination not just from van Eyck, but also from von Soest's Crucifixion, where light emanating from Christ dissolves around John's red robe, as yellows rays eventually become white. There is a real possibility that a number of the faces of saints are modelled on historical persons, i.e. as donor portraits of the commissioners and their wives. Figures fitting this theory include St Ursula and St Gereon panels from the City Saints altarpiece.Unlike the painters in the Low Countries, Lochner was not so concerned with delineating perspective; his pictures are often set in shallow space, while his backgrounds give little indication of distance and often dissolve into solid gold. Thus, and given his harmonious colour schemes, Lochner is usually described as one of the last exponents of the International Gothic. This is not to say his paintings lack contemporary northern sophistication; his arrangements are often innovative. The worlds he paints are hushed, according to Snyder, achieved with the symmetry of subdued use of colour and the often repeated stylistic element of circles. Angels form circles around the heavenly figures; the heavenly figures' heads are highly circular and they wear round haloes. According to Snyder, the viewer is slowly \\"drawn into empathy with the revolving forms\\".Because of the paucity of surviving attributed works, it is difficult to detect any evolution in Lochner's style. Art historians are unsure if his style became progressively more or less influenced by Netherlandish art. Recent dendrochronological examination of...

This name change took place in 1996 when the Indian government decided to officially rename the city. Chennai is the capital of the Tamil Nadu state in southern India and one of the four major metropolitan cities in the country, along with Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata. The name change was part of a broader effort across India to replace Anglicized colonial names with their indigenous or historical names. The name \\"Madras\\" is believed to have been derived from the term \\"Madrasapattinam,\\" which was a fishing village near the city's location during the British colonial era. However, after India's independence, there were discussions and efforts to revert the city's name to its original, more culturally-rooted name, Chennai. Chennai has a rich history that spans several centuries, with its existence dating back to the 1st century CE. Initially, the area was inhabited by the Pallavas, a South Indian dynasty, followed by the Chola Dynasty in the 9th century. The region also faced colonization by the Portuguese, Dutch, and, eventually, the British. The city is known for its diverse and vibrant culture, with a foundation in South Indian customs and traditions. It is home to many classical Indian dance and music performances, particularly in Carnatic music. Its history and tradition make it a hub for promoting Tamil literature, and Chennai is occasionally referred to as the \\"Cultural Capital of South India.\\" Economically, Chennai has evolved into a significant industrial and technology center, boasting the nickname \\"The Detroit of India\\" due to its thriving automobile industry. Additionally, Chennai is home to a robust information technology (IT) sector, with numerous IT parks and export centers. The city also has a well-developed transport infrastructure, supporting an extensive road network, an international airport, a sea port, and the Chennai MRTS (Metropolitan Rapid Transit System). These facilities foster the growth of trade and commerce, enhancing the city's overall development. In summary, the city of Madras is now known as Chennai, a vibrant and culturally rich metropolis with a distinguished history and a thriving economic landscape. The name change reflects the city's efforts to preserve its cultural identity and move towards a post-colonial future."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. George Michael Cohan (July 3, 1878 - November 5, 1942), known professionally as George M. Cohan, was an American entertainer, playwright, composer, lyricist, actor, singer, dancer and producer. Cohan began his career as a child, performing with his parents and sister in a vaudeville act known as \\"The Four Cohans.\\" Beginning with Little Johnny Jones in 1904, he wrote, composed, produced, and appeared in more than three dozen Broadway musicals. Cohan published more than 300 songs during his lifetime, including the standards \\"Over There\\", \\"Give My Regards to Broadway\\", \\"The Yankee Doodle Boy\\" and \\"You're a Grand Old Flag\\". Cohan was born in 1878 in Providence, Rhode Island, to Irish Catholic parents. A baptismal certificate from St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church (which gave the wrong first name for his mother) indicated that he was born on July 3, but Cohan and his family always insisted that George had been \\"born on the Fourth of July!\\" George's parents were traveling vaudeville performers, and he joined them on stage while still an infant, first as a prop, learning to dance and sing soon after he could walk and talk. Cohan started as a child performer at age 8, first on the violin and then as a dancer. He was the fourth member of the family vaudeville act called The Four Cohans, which included his father Jeremiah \\"Jere\\" (Keohane) Cohan (1848-1917), mother Helen \\"Nellie\\" Costigan Cohan (1854-1928) and sister Josephine \\"Josie\\" Cohan Niblo (1876-1916). In 1890, he toured as the star of a show called Peck's Bad Boy and then joined the family act; The Four Cohans mostly toured together from 1890 to 1901. He and his sister made their Broadway debut in 1893 in a sketch called The Lively Bootblack. Temperamental in his early years, Cohan later learned to control his frustrations. During these years, Cohan originated his famous curtain speech: \\"My mother thanks you, my father thanks you, my sister thanks you, and I thank you.\\" As a child, Cohan and his family toured most of the year and spent summer vacations from the vaudeville circuit at his grandmother's home in North Brookfield, Massachusetts, where Cohan befriended baseball player Connie Mack. The family generally gave a performance at the town hall there each summer, and Cohan had a chance to gain some more normal childhood experiences, like riding his bike and playing sandlot baseball. Cohan's memories of those happy summers inspired his 1907 musical 50 Miles from Boston, which is set in North Brookfield and contains one of his most famous songs, \\"Harrigan\\". As Cohan matured through his teens, he used the quiet summers there to write. When he returned to the town in the cast of Ah, Wilderness! in 1934, he told a reporter, \\"I've knocked around everywhere, but there's no place like North Brookfield.\\"Answer this question using a quote from the following article: where was he born","completion":"George M.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What were the names of the pupils who revered Saint-Saëns as a genius?, using the article: Charles-Camille Saint-Saëns (French: [ʃaʁlkamij sɛ̃sɑ̃s]; 9 October 1835 – 16 December 1921) was a French composer, organist, conductor and pianist of the Romantic era. His best-known works include Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso (1863), the Second Piano Concerto (1868), the First Cello Concerto (1872), Danse macabre (1874), the opera Samson and Delilah (1877), the Third Violin Concerto (1880), the Third (\\"Organ\\") Symphony (1886) and The Carnival of the Animals (1886). Saint-Saëns was a musical prodigy; he made his concert debut at the age of ten. After studying at the Paris Conservatoire he followed a conventional career as a church organist, first at Saint-Merri, Paris and, from 1858, La Madeleine, the official church of the French Empire. After leaving the post twenty years later, he was a successful freelance pianist and composer, in demand in Europe and the Americas. As a young man, Saint-Saëns was enthusiastic for the most modern music of the day, particularly that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner, although his own compositions were generally within a conventional classical tradition. He was a scholar of musical history, and remained committed to the structures worked out by earlier French composers. This brought him into conflict in his later years with composers of the impressionist and dodecaphonic schools of music; although there were neoclassical elements in his music, foreshadowing works by Stravinsky and Les Six, he was often regarded as a reactionary in the decades around the time of his death. Saint-Saëns held only one teaching post, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris, and remained there for less than five years. It was nevertheless important in the development of French music: his students included Gabriel Fauré, among whose own later pupils was Maurice Ravel. Both of them were strongly influenced by Saint-Saëns, whom they revered as a genius., what would be the answer ?

Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room.

Being universally understood by the devotees of the particular science or art, they have the precision of a mathematical formula . Besides, they save time, for it is much more economical to name a process than to describe it. Thousands of these technical terms are very properly included in every large dictionary, yet, as a whole, _ Different professions, however, differ widely in the character of their special vocabularies. In trades and handicrafts and other professions, such as farming and fishing, that have occupied great numbers of men from remote times, the technical vocabulary is very old. It consists largely of native words, or of borrowed words that have worked themselves into the very fiber of our language, hence, though highly technical in many particulars, these vocabularies are more familiar in sound, and more generally understood than most other technicalities. The special dialects of law, medicine, and philosophy have also become pretty familiar to cultivated person, and have contributed much to the popular vocabulary. Yet, every profession still possesses a large body of technical terms that remain essentially foreign, even to educated speech. And the proportion has been much increased in the last fifty years, particularly in the various departments of natural and political sciences and in the mechanic arts.

CHAPTER VI: FIRKET June 7, 1896 Since the end of 1895 the Dervish force in Firket had been under the command of the Emir Hammuda, and it was through the indolence and neglect of this dissipated Arab that the Egyptian army had been able to make good its position at Akasha without any fighting. Week after week the convoys had straggled unmolested through the difficult country between Sarras and the advanced base. No attack had been made upon the brigade at Akasha. No enterprise was directed against its communications. This fatal inactivity did not pass unnoticed by Wad Bishara, the Governor of Dongola; but although he was nominally in supreme command of all the Dervish forces in the province he had hardly any means of enforcing his authority. His rebukes and exhortations, however, gradually roused Hammuda, and during May two or three minor raids were planned and executed, and the Egyptian position at Akasha was several times reconnoitred. Bishara remained unsatisfied, and at length, despairing of infusing energy into Hammuda, he ordered his subordinate Osman Azrak to supersede him. Osman was a Dervish of very different type. He was a fanatical and devoted believer in the Mahdi and a loyal follower of the Khalifa. For many years he had served on the northern frontier of the Dervish Empire, and his name was well known to the Egyptian Government as the contriver of the most daring and the most brutal raids. His cruelty to the wretched inhabitants of the border villages had excluded him from all hope of mercy should he ever fall into the hands of the enemy. His crafty skill, however, protected him, and among the Emirs gathered at Firket there was none whose death would have given greater satisfaction to the military authorities than the man who was now to replace Hammuda.

Given the question: Process: - You inhale - The air enters the mouth and nose - The diaphragm contracts - Air fills all the sacks in the lungs - Oxygen passes through the sacks into capillaries - The blood is passed to the blood in the capillaries - The blood carries the oxygen to the heart - The heart pumps the oxygenated blood to the body. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose gene manipulation achieved happens, how will it affect greater lung capacity. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you've proposed suggests that gene manipulation could potentially lead to increased lung capacity. If this were achieved, it could indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the process of respiration. Direct effects: 1. Enhanced lung capacity: The increased volume of air that the lungs can hold would allow for a more efficient exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. This means that with each inhalation, more air would enter the lungs, providing a greater amount of oxygen for the body to use. 2. Improved gas exchange: With greater lung capacity, the surface area of the alveolar sacs (where the oxygen is transferred to the capillaries) could also increase. This would improve the efficiency of gas exchange, allowing more oxygen to be absorbed by the blood and more carbon dioxide to be removed. Indirect effects: 1. Enhanced physical performance: With more oxygen available to the body, an individual could potentially experience improved physical performance, endurance, and reduced muscle fatigue due to more efficient oxygen and nutrient delivery to the organs and muscles. 2. Adaptation to high altitudes: Greater lung capacity could prove advantageous in situations where oxygen is scarce, such as at high altitudes or during intense physical activities. An increased lung capacity might alleviate some of the negative impacts of these situations by providing larger oxygen reserves and more efficient gas exchange. It is essential to note that while gene manipulation may hold promise for enhancing lung capacity in theory, many ethical, safety, and scientific concerns would need to be addressed before such an intervention could be considered viable. In addition, the interactions between genetics, environment, and individual variables would need to be carefully examined to evaluate the specific effects of gene manipulation on lung capacity and respiration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Avoid letting your dog get familiar with toileting indoors if you'd like it to toilet outside. If you have a place in your yard where you'd like your dog to toilet, bring it to the spot immediately. Before you even go into your house, let it sniff around the yard until your dog urinates or defecates. When your dog does urinate or defecate, give your dog lots of verbal praise and attention so your dog associates going to the bathroom outside with being praised. In order to make your French bulldog a good household member, begin potty training your dog as soon as you get it. If you wait to begin training and let your dog toilet on puppy pads, it will take longer to potty train it and you dog will be confused about where to toilet. You'll need to be very consistent and encouraging when you begin housebreaking your French bulldog. Most dogs will show signs that they need to toilet, so watch your French bulldog to become familiar with your dog's specific signs. You should also be in the habit of frequently giving it the opportunity to toilet. Signs that your dog needs to toilet include: Panting Pacing or sniffing around the house Barking Wandering off to a quiet area If you didn't notice your dog's cue to toilet or your dog accidentally goes in the house, thoroughly clean up the mess. You'll need to use a product designed for pet messes or a special pet-urine enzymatic cleaner.

One day the King sent out a message to all of the single women to attend the Royal Ball in honor of his son, to find a wife. Of course, Cinderella didn't get to go, but her stepsisters did. Cinderella was very upset and thought that there was no way she could attend the Royal Ball, until her fairy godmother appeared. So she did some magic and made Cinderella into a beautiful woman, but she had to be back by midnight because that is when the magic changes back. While at the Royal Ball, Cinderella loses track of time and the clock strikes midnight, so she runs out of the palace and loses her glass slipper. Then the King orders the duke to find the women who wore that slipper. The duke searched every house, but finally found the women who it belonged to, Cinderella.

When it comes to exercise, many people seem to fall into two distinct camps: those who love a vigorous, sweat-soaked workout and those who view it as a form of torment. With hopes of getting more people up and moving, scientists are looking at the body's biological and chemical processes for clues to understanding what's behind differing attitudes toward exercise. That could mean there are factors beyond motivation and discipline to explain why some people enjoy exercising and others don't. One finding so far: How people interpret their body's sensations during and after exercise plays a large role in whether they enjoy it. Also, researchers at Iowa State University found that people's physical capacity could be much lower than many realize, so many people push beyond their limits without realizing it. For example, for sedentary people, just cooking dinner could count as exercise and they need to build up to even walking, the researchers found. Dan Cederholm has tried for years to find some type of exercise he could stick with. He finds the gym boring and basketball and baseball leagues unappealing. As for running? \\"My shins always hurt like hell,\\" says Mr. Cederholm, 38, a Web designer from Salem, Mass. His friend Rick Johnson, on the other hand, competes in 20 road races a year. He remembers that even as a kid, when he was told to run a lap during gym class, he would ask to do extras. \\"To me, it seems very foreign to say I don't enjoy sweating or running,\\" says Mr. Johnson, 41, an editor who also lives in Salem. From couch potatoes to Olympic athletes, everyone has a physical capacity for exertion, beyond which the body becomes stressed and begins to feel bad. How much stems from genetic factors—things like lung capacity, oxygen transport and the rate at which oxygen is used in the muscle cells—is still a subject of scholarly debate. Estimates vary from 10% to 50%, says Panteleimon Ekkekakis, a professor of kinesiology at Iowa State who has been studying the psychophysiology of exercise. But many sedentary people push beyond their intrinsic range when they try to exercise too quickly or intensely, which can make them hate the activity and want to stop, says Dr. Ekkekakis. The idea hinges on something called the \\"ventilatory threshold.\\" Normally when people breathe, they expel an amount of carbon dioxide that is equal to the amount of oxygen taken in. But beyond the ventilatory threshold, the release of carbon dioxide begins to exceed the body's intake of oxygen. This excess release of carbon dioxide is a sign that the muscles have become more acidic, which the body finds stressful. For most individuals, the ventilatory threshold is around 50% to 60% of the way to their maximum capacity, though there is tremendous individual variation. For elite athletes, the threshold may be as high as 80%, while sedentary people may hit it at 35%. By using tricks such as listening to music, people can continue to feel good even slightly past their ventilatory threshold, Dr. Ekkekakis and his colleagues have found. As people approach their maximum capacity, however, the feel-bad reaction is unavoidable. And while both ventilatory threshold and maximum capacity can be slowly increased, people have to have enough positive experiences to stick with exercise over time so they actually can boost these limits. In continuing studies of obese, sedentary but otherwise healthy middle-aged women, Dr. Ekkekakis found that some individuals reach their ventilatory threshold after just one minute at a slow pace on a treadmill. Some women's thresholds are so low that they would reach their maximum capacity simply by doing the dishes or cooking, says Dr. Ekkekakis. This means that though many weight-loss interventions suggest walking as the primary form of physical activity, it is probably too hard for many people. How people interpret some of the physical sensations of exertion or fatigue, such as buildup of lactic acid in muscle or increases in body temperature, can also influence whether they stick with an exercise routine. Some people tend to read such physical cues as a sign of a good workout or progress, whereas many sedentary people just find them uncomfortable or painful, say researchers. Elite athletes have even been dubbed \\"benign masochists\\" because they appear to enjoy the pain of exertion, says Dominic Micklewright, a researcher and curriculum director at the Centre for Sports & Exercise Science at the University of Essex in the U.K. The sensation of how hard one is working also can be influenced by some surprising external factors. In one study published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology last year, Dr. Micklewright and his team examined how the color of the imagery participants viewed while cycling would affect their mood and perceived feelings of exertion. After viewing scenes that involved green trees, participants reported feeling happier and their exercise less difficult than when the same scenes appeared in black-and-white or red, suggesting that exercising in nature or simulated green spaces could be helpful for exercisers, says Dr. Micklewright. It wasn't until age 48 that Sharon Weinbar (in black) of Hillsborough, Calif., found a workout she looked forward to: rowing. Researchers have found several other psychological factors and cognitive tricks that can help boost the motivation to move. Three that appear critical include how competent a person feels, whether he or she feels they have some control or choice in the matter and, for many, whether the activity fosters social relatedness, says Sarah Ullrich-French, a professor in kinesiology at Washington State University in Pullman, Wash. Adults can be discouraged from exercising by not knowing what to do or how to do it. Those who were athletic in childhood may be frustrated by how their abilities have deteriorated over time. Dr. Ullrich-French suggests that adults try new activities where they won't be comparing themselves. For Mr. Cederholm, the Web designer from Salem, going back to hockey, which he had enjoyed as a boy, wasn't an option. But the first time he played squash was an epiphany. \\"It was fun at the level that you don't even realize you're sweating your butt off,\\" says Mr. Cederholm, who now plays three to four hours a week with a friend or practices shots by himself on the court. Sharon Wienbar, a venture capitalist in Hillsborough, Calif., became a rower at the age of 48 because she enjoys the feeling of speeding along on the water, discussing her workout routines with her teammates and having a coach who helps her get better. \\"A couple months into rowing, it was like a light switch going on in my head,\\" she says. Once a \\"geeky, bookish\\" child who was always picked last for gym, Ms. Wienbar says rowing is now part of her identity and has prompted her to think of herself as an athlete. And at age 51, she says she enjoys the physical feeling of pushing herself. \\"I don't even feel like I've reached the maximum,\\" says Ms. Wienbar. \\"I'm in better shape now than I was 10 years ago. Maybe I'll be in even better shape in a decade.\\" Write to Shirley S.

Mike pleaded guilty to the crime and served prison time to protect Lou. After being released, Mike was hired by the construction firm of Chester Conway (Ned Beatty).

News article: Texas sheriff mistrusts Mexico's border lake inquiry By Kevin Johnson, USA TODAY The Texas sheriff leading the U.S. investigation into the fatal shooting of an American man said Mexican officials are trying to discourage the victim's wife from pushing for a fuller inquiry. Zapata County Sheriff Sigifredo \\"Sigi\\" Gonzalez said Sunday that Tiffany Hartley was subjected to 12 hours of questioning by Mexican investigators Friday in an effort to \\"intimidate and discourage her from doing anything.\\" Hartley is scheduled to meet with Mexican prosecutors and investigators today, Gonzalez said. He said the questions asked by Mexican investigators were not aimed at resolving the Sept. 30 incident, when Hartley says her husband, David, was shot by Mexican pirates. His body has not been recovered. \\"It's wrong. It makes no sense,\\" Gonzalez said. He said he received an account of the meeting from U.S. officials who attended the session in McAllen, Texas. Mexican officials could not be reached for comment Sunday. Gonzalez's account contradicts a statement released Saturday by the Mexican attorney general's office. It said Hartley's wife provided new information about the Jet Ski outing on Falcon Lake, which spans the U.S.-Mexican border. \\"Mrs. Hartley provided valuable information that will allow federal investigations to continue,\\" the Mexican government's statement said. The statement did not elaborate on the nature of the information provided by Hartley, who has expressed concern that the investigation and search would be abandoned. Tiffany Hartley has said she and her husband were attacked when they ventured into Mexican waters on Jet Skis to photograph the ruins of a church. She said her husband was shot in an assault by gunmen in boats. She said she tried but failed to pull her husband onto her Jet Ski and fled to the Texas side of the border as the gunmen continued firing on her craft. Gonzalez said the gunmen are believed to be members of the violent Zetas drug cartel. Last week, the Mexican inquiry into the Hartley shooting was shaken when the severed head of the commander in the case, Rolando Flores Villegas, was found. Gonzalez said Villegas' killing is one of the reasons Mexican authorities do not want to proceed with the investigation. During the questioning Friday, Gonzalez said, Mexican investigators asked Hartley to participate in a re-enactment of the incident. Gonzalez said the request was inappropriate because it posed a clear risk to Hartley's safety. \\"She's never hinted at not cooperating with them,\\" he said. \\"But she's not going to go do that, and you can't blame her.\\" \\"They don't want to investigate this,\\" Gonzalez said. \\"Their position is, 'We hope we can discourage her enough so that she won't continue to go forward with it.' \\" You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Ed, who's in town for the Spirit of Detroit Music Festival, then tweets out, \\"If you see this rude bar owner, give him a smack from me,\\" which leads to nearly every person who stops by the bar hitting Justin in the head. Nicki's getting married this weekend, and Justin's pretty bummed out, so Danny tries to cheer him up by watching Scandal. Only, Danny flips out upon learning that Justin thinks Scott Foley is better looking than him. A super-hot girl (Victoria Justice) at the next table overhears his tantrum and thinks the best friends' banter is hilarious. This prompts the two idiots to try to one up each other for the lovely Amanda's affections. Amanda's a backup singer in town for the musical festival, so of course, Justin immediately starts singing. When Amanda leaves, Danny announces he's going to bow out of the competition so Justin has a chance with her. This infuriates Justin, leading to a face-off between the roommates. If Amanda picks Justin, Danny has to wax his chest, and if she picks anyone else, Justin has to wax his chest… live. Meanwhile, Brett complains that people from Detroit are horrible tippers, but Leslie kindly reminds him that he's not exactly the nicest bartender. At a table nearby, Shelly's retirement home coworkers Zach (Zach Braff) and Donald (Donald Faison) agree with Leslie - Brett was a bitch to them, too! So nice-guy Shelly challenges the snarky Brit to see who can earn the most tips by the end of the night. Shelly, being the adorable teddy bear that he is, quickly fills up his bucket with tips from pretty ladies (Christa Miller and Minnie Driver - Version 1; Christa Miller and Kate Walsh Version 2) while Brett's is totally empty. Dr. Drew, who's been sitting at the bar, notices and tells Shelly he's worried about Brett, prompting Shelly to give his bucket money to Dr. Drew to give to Brett. Dr. Drew pockets most of it, but throws a 50 at Brett, making him the winner! Upstairs, Candace is hiding a big secret: her ex-boyfriend Trent! When Leslie and Burski spot him they're livid - Trent's an absolute jackass who treated Candace terribly. Candace swears he just needed a place to crash and they're not getting back together. Leslie and her new boyfriend Mike (Mike Catherwood) explain that Candace is just backsliding, but that'll all change the second she meets someone who makes her forget about him. Downstairs, Justin preps for Amanda's return by trying out pick-up lines on Candace. Only, she inadvertently gets sucked in by his charm and Leslie realizes Candace is definitely not thinking about Trent anymore... But when Amanda comes back, Justin comes on a bit too strong, while Danny's smooth moves win him a movie date. Burski tells Danny that he should do what Shelly did - let his best friend win because it means more to him. Danny reluctantly agrees and decides to coach Justin into beating him. He suggests picking on his insecurities and then brings out the big guns: TV's Scott Foley! Scott gives Justin a pep talk, slaps him for Ed Sheeran and then convinces Danny to drive him to the airport just by using the power of his intoxicating green eyes. When Amanda stops by for her date with Danny, Justin tries out Danny's aggressive approach but quickly realizes he's not being himself. He apologizes to Amanda and spills that he's just a guy looking for a serious relationship. Unfortunately, Amanda's not looking for anything serious, and while Danny was at the airport with TV's Scott Foley, she made other plans.

Premise: Further information The given premise indicates that there might be additional information that is to be provided or accessed. It suggests that the current information may not be sufficient or complete and that there could be more information relevant to a certain topic or situation. The premise does not state whether this further information is readily available or not, so one cannot be certain about its accessibility. Hypothesis: We don't have more information at this time The stated hypothesis asserts that additional or more information is currently unavailable or simply not present. This could mean the accessible information pool is limited and that, at this moment, there is no other information to provide or gather about the situation or topic. Now, let's analyze if the premise entails the hypothesis. Entailment occurs when the truth of one statement (premise) guarantees the truth of another statement (hypothesis), i.e., if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true. In this case, the premise refers to the existence of further information, while the hypothesis relates to the unavailability or absence of more information at the moment. Therefore, the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. In fact, they appear as contrasting views on the availability of further information. The premise has an implication that there might be more information, and the hypothesis states that no such information is present or accessible. However, it's important to note that these statements could be contextually compatible depending on the circumstances under discussion. For example, it's possible that there exists additional information, but it is not possible to obtain or access it at this time. In this scenario, the premise and hypothesis could co-exist. In conclusion, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. They do not strictly follow the entailment relation, though they could be contextually compatible depending on the situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

A plume of black smoke rose over Cairo early Friday after a powerful explosion hit the city's police headquarters, killing at least four people and wounding more than 50 others, Egyptian authorities said. The blast struck a key symbol of authority in a country that has been shaken by political turmoil and violent unrest in recent years. It was followed by two smaller explosions near police stations in the Cairo area, one of which killed one person. And later, a fourth explosion outside a movie theater in Giza city, near Cairo, killed one person and injured seven others, state television said. The blasts took place at a time of high tension -- the day before the third anniversary of the 2011 revolution that eventually brought down authoritarian leader Hosni Mubarak. And they come amid the instability ushered in by the military's overthrow last year of the democratically elected former President, Mohamed Morsy, and the ensuing crackdown by security forces on the Islamist movement that supported him, the Muslim Brotherhood. Suicide bomber suspected. The first blast appeared to have been caused by a suicide attacker who tried to drive a vehicle laden with explosives into the police headquarters, said Maj. Gen. Hany Abdel Latif, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, citing preliminary reports. Guards stationed in front of the headquarters in the Abdeen district of Cairo opened fire at the vehicle, and the explosion went off in the building's vicinity rather than inside, he told state news agency Egynews. The blast destroyed the front of the first and second floors of the eight-story building, he said, and damaged the third floor. Most of the building's windows appeared to have been blown out. Air-conditioning units dangled by cables from the shattered facade. At least 51 people were wounded in the explosion, state-run broadcaster Masriya TV reported, citing the Health Ministry. Visiting the ruined building, Egyptian Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim condemned the bombing. \\"These are nothing but desperate attacks in an attempt to create chaos, but the citizens here will remain resilient,\\" he told Masriya TV. Ibrahim said security forces will ensure that Egyptians will be able to celebrate the anniversary of the revolution Saturday \\"as if nothing happened today.\\" A powerful blast. CNN's Reza Sayah said the blast appeared to be \\"the most powerful bomb attack that we've seen here in central Cairo in recent memory.\\" Speaking from near the scene of the blast, he said the attack will probably intensify the fight between Egypt's military-backed government and the groups that oppose it. It wasn't immediately clear who was behind that bombing. Friday is a holiday in Egypt, so the police headquarters is unlikely to have been as busy as it would have been on a weekday. The blast happened around 6:30 a.m., according to state media. Hundreds of people -- some stunned, some angry -- gathered around the scene, Sayah said. Many of those in the crowd were quick to blame the Muslim Brotherhood, despite no official word on who might be to blame. The Muslim Brotherhood denied responsibility for the bombing and issued a statement condemning it. \\"The Muslim Brotherhood condemns any acts of violence or killing, regardless of who are the perpetrators, and the (Muslim Brotherhood) emphasizes that the revolution that has continued for seven months is a peaceful revolution and it will insist to remain peaceful.\\" Separately, the Muslim Brotherhood called for protests and sit-ins across multiple sites in and out of Cairo in a show of defiance. The group said security forces fired live ammunition on demonstrators in Beni Suef on Friday; surrounded and mistreated worshippers at a mosque in Suez on Friday; and thugs attacked a funeral in Alexandria on Thursday, among other grievances. Police arrested 111 protesters across the country, the Interior Ministry said. Egypt's armed forces condemned the bombings, as did the U.S. government. \\"It should be clear to all ... Egyptians that violence has not and will not move Egypt's political transition forward,\\" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. \\"Ongoing unrest and cycles of violence surrounding protests hurt Egypt's prospects for political and economic stability.\\" A U.S. State Department official said that Washington is \\"aware of reports\\" that one of its citizens \\"has been detained in Egypt.\\" But the official said the U.S. government wouldn't comment any more than that. Fears of more turmoil. Friday's second explosion was much smaller and went off near a police station in Dokki, a residential area of Cairo, wounding several people, authorities said. And in the Al-Haram district of Giza city, a small bomb was thrown at a moving police vehicle near a police station, killing one person, deputy Giza security chief Mahmoud Farouk told state TV. This new wave of violence follows a referendum earlier this month in which Egyptian voters overwhelmingly approved a new constitution proposed by the military-backed government, according to the country's electoral commission. But supporters of the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood had boycotted the vote in response to a continuing government crackdown. Rights groups have expressed concern about what they call an increasingly repressive environment in Egypt, where more than 2,200 people have been killed since Morsy's ouster. Some anti-government groups have resorted to violence. Bomb attacks and shootings against the security apparatus have taken place across the country in recent months -- a situation described by some as a low-level insurgency. The government has blamed the Muslim Brotherhood for many of the attacks, even though the movement has condemned them. The bombing of the Cairo police headquarters suggested the violence is taking on a more serious, high-profile form. \\"The fear is there's a very difficult and tumultuous phase ahead for this country,\\" Sayah said.

Once the gel is massaged into the roots, press and comb the cowlick in the direction you would like it styled. Some gel is heat-activated. Use a hair dryer to style your hair the way you would like it after applying the hair gel. Apply pomade to dry hair to help style it in the direction you wish the hair to run. Run your forefinger and middle finger through the pomade to pick up some of the wax. Rub these fingers against your thumb to spread the pomade.

Choose a pomade with a matte finish. Avoid using more than a thin layer of pomade or your hair may appear wet until you wash the pomade out. Root brushes are specifically created for getting to the root and adjusting the direction of hair growth. While your hair is wet, repeatedly run the brush over the cowlick in the opposite direction of the hair growth. The bristles are very flexible to keep from tangling in the hair follicle.

Nearly a year after Sept. 11, the Legal Aid Society-the lawyers for New York's poor and homeless-remains, well, homeless. The nonprofit has been barred from returning to its 90 Church St. headquarters, across from the World Trade Center site, because of environmental concerns. Legal Aid has uncomfortable company. More than 11,500 New Yorkers continue to work out of temporary space, according to analysis by Manhattan-based real estate brokerage TenantWise.com Inc. and Crain's New York Business. That's 8% of the 137,000 workers who lost their offices or access to them when the Twin Towers collapsed. Legal Aid's 450 displaced attorneys and staffers have spent the past 12 months spread among previously unused spaces-some unused for good reason-in the nonprofit's other offices.

In this article, I’ll address a real mainstay of modern medicine: laboratory tests that require drawing blood. This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!)

If we assume that the first sentence is true, it suggests that the actor being discussed gave a performance that wasn't always funny in \\"The World According to Garp.\\" This implies that the actor indeed played a serious part in the movie. \\"The World According to Garp\\" is a 1982 American dramedy film based on John Irving's novel of the same name.

Garp, a character who experiences a range of emotions and situations. While there might be some funny moments in the movie, the overall tone is a mix of serious and comedic moments. This allows actors like Robin Williams to showcase their versatility and take on roles beyond their usual comic personas.

This sentence informs us that Scatarie Island is an island within the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. This island is situated in the Atlantic Ocean, and its geographical location is specifically off the coast of Baleine, a region on the southeastern extremity of Cape Breton Island. Cape Breton Island itself is also a part of the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, and it is one of the largest islands in Canada. 2. Cape Breton Island is an island located in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, off the coast of Baleine, Scatarie Island. In contrast, this sentence is describing Cape Breton Island, which is an island within the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. It is worth noting that the sentence construction is not entirely accurate and appears to be attempting to relate the locations of Cape Breton Island and Scatarie Island. Cape Breton Island, mentioned in both sentences, is the northern part of the Canadian province of Nova Scotia and measures approximately 10,311 square kilometers. It is connected to the mainland of Nova Scotia by the Canso Causeway, a long narrow strip of land that carries the Trans-Canada Highway. Cape Breton Island is well-known for its natural beauty, featuring the famous Cape Breton Highlands National Park, which includes breathtaking coastal landscapes. Scatarie Island, on the other hand, is a much smaller island with an area of approximately 42 square kilometers. It is situated off the northeastern coast of Cape Breton Island and specifically off the coast of the region of Baleine. In summary, these sentences are referring to different islands in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. Scatarie Island is a smaller island off the coast of Cape Breton Island, while Cape Breton Island is a much larger island in Nova Scotia, of which Baleine is a part."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: A week, as they say, is a long time in football. By that reckoning, six weeks is almost an eternity. For fans of one of English football's oldest clubs, it certainly feels that way. On Boxing Day 2012, former European champions Nottingham Forest lined up to play Leeds United in a second flight match in the English Championship. After going a goal behind, Forest roared back to an emphatic 4-2 victory that had a certain swagger about it. Watching at the time, it was hard to escape the feeling that things were finally coming together for a side that has come to embody the term 'sleeping giant'. One point and one place outside the playoffs, that afternoon Forest fans would have tucked into their turkey sandwiches with a sense of satisfaction and thoughts of good things to come. But just hours after the final whistle the club's Kuwaiti owners, the Al Hasawi family, fired the club's quietly progressive manager, Sean O'Driscoll. Baffling decision. For fans and observers alike it was a baffling decision. \\"We cannot speak highly enough of Sean as a man,\\" said Chairman Fawaz Al Hasawi. \\"He was appointed at an extremely difficult time for the club and can count himself unlucky to have lost his job with the team just one point away from the top six. But we have a responsibility to look to the future for this great Club because we have huge ambitions for it.\\" Fast forward just a few weeks, and O'Driscoll's replacement, Alex McLeish, has followed his predecessor to the exit. January had also seen the sudden and unceremonious exits of Forest's CEO, its head of recruitment, and the popular club ambassador (and former player and manager) Frank Clark. McLeish departed 'by mutual consent' after just one win in seven games and a transfer window that bordered on farcical, as key target George Boyd's switch to the club foundered after the player apparently failed an eye test. Forest fans took to social media once more in a bewildered daze as headlines painted a picture of a shambolic club in disarray. Days later another former Forest manager, the combative Billy Davies, was reinstalled in this hottest of managerial hot seats. But before he could properly take charge his team duly lost 2-0 to a Bristol City side now, somewhat poetically, managed by none other than Sean O'Driscoll. Blackburn woes. This odd story will have particular resonance in England's north west, where another of English football's most venerable institutions, Blackburn Rovers, has collapsed from mid table comfort in the English Premier League (EPL) to relegation and ignominy. The club's owners, India's Venky's Group, began their tenure by sacking the widely respected Sam Allardyce in December 2010. Since then they appear to have embarked on a kamikaze PR strategy, which has led to ridicule off the pitch and confusion on it. In the latest chapter, Shebby Singh, the former TV pundit brought in by Venky's as the club's 'global advisor', is reportedly at loggerheads with managing director Derek Shaw, amid allegations of interference with football matters and disputes over players' contractual deals. The culture clash between the old and the new sides of the club looks wider than ever. Rovers are now onto their third manager of the season and a swift return to the EPL looks wildly improbable. Venky's and the Al-Hasawi family are the latest in a wave of foreign owners taking control of clubs in the English leagues. Few on the growing list are strangers to controversy. Mixed feelings. Cardiff City's new Malaysian owners changed the club's colors from blue to red, causing outrage -- but perhaps they will be forgiven as they are currently well set for promotion to the EPL. The Glazer family's takeover of Manchester United sparked a supporter's revolt that saw the formation of a completely new team -- FC United of Manchester -- by fans alarmed at the level of debt (currently around Â£360million - 550m) foisted upon the club. Then there's Roman Abramovich's Chelsea, whose phenomenal success has been tempered by the owner's propensity to fire managers; and Sheikh Mansour of Manchester City, whose investments in the club stretch UEFA's concept of Financial Fair Play to the limit, and very probably beyond. The attitude of football fans to these types of investor is pretty schizophrenic. On the one hand the very prospect of a new owner, awash with cash, coming in and transforming a club's fortunes would get many salivating, regardless of where the money is from and who is taking the reins. English football, or at least the Premier League, is an enormously attractive stage and clubs make for interesting playthings for the super-rich. Meanwhile, fans are attracted to the idea of quick-fix success. Community connection. On the other hand, with spiraling ticket prices driven largely by players' wages and the increasingly erratic pictures being painted by some of these new owners, there is a sense that clubs' connections with the communities in which many have existed for over a century are being undermined. Then of course there's the idea of what constitutes super rich in the context of football. Away from the financial machinations of the Glazers, Randy Lerner's more straightforward commitment to Aston Villa appears to have run dry, with the team staring at a relegation battle and the purse strings tied tightly shut. In the Championship, Watford's owners have enjoyed remarkable success by filling their side with loan signings from another club, Italy's Udinese, which they also own. And then, in England's League One, there's Portsmouth. If the Glazer's ownership of Manchester United appears complex, the background to Portsmouth's stewardship is positively arcane. An excellent blog by Portsmouth fan SJ Maskell recently dissected the baffling raft of creditors currently being pored over in the English courts. The club, which enjoyed a Premier League berth and an FA Cup win just five years ago, is facing relegation to England's fourth tier and possible ruin. It has seen a succession of owners, offshore companies, and paper trails leading all over the world drive it into successive demotions and financial collapse. Wayward club. A group of fans has formed the Portsmouth Supporters' Trust, which is looking to gain control of this wayward club and finally wrestle it back from a course to apparent doom. All logic points to their being given the chance to do so, but this is a club that has defied logic for years and a decision in their favor is by no means certain. The Portsmouth Supporters Trust faces a battle, but it is perhaps this kind of institution that points to a more stable future for clubs and the sport of football in England. The problem with many of the new wave of owners in English football is not that they are foreign. Football is a global game, and the EPL is filled with players from all over the world, so it would be illogical to deny owners from overseas the chance to take part too. But the disconnect between the fans that pay to watch these clubs, the communities in which they operate, and even the armchair fans that follow them from afar, is an issue. A report launched this week by the football community trust Supporters Direct outlines a range of measures primarily focused on the physical manifestations of clubs -- the stadia in which they play, and the various off-shoots of these buildings. At the report's core are recommendations designed to protect the relationship between clubs and their communities, including joint ownership of stadia, 'golden shares' to be held by supporters collectively, and clubs that are owned by or formed as so-called Community Benefit Societies. In essence, it is about taking a degree of control into the hands of supporters. The sentiment behind this applies not just to the bricks and mortar of a football stadium. Clubs like Barcelona in Spain and throughout Germany's Bundesliga are protected from extreme and erratic behavior by the fact that fans are directly involved in a democratic ownership arrangement. The worst excesses of owners, who can act on a whim to often disrupt and damage the course of some of the long established institutions at the heart of communities, can be curbed by what is basically a democratic, rather than autocratic structure. Allied to initiatives such as UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules, perhaps this will see a game in England that is balanced less precariously, and fit for a long term and sustainable future. For now, however, English football fans should perhaps be careful what they wish for. Highlights:","completion":"- Nottingham Forest faced some unexpected changes as the Al Hasawi family fired the club's manager, Sean O'Driscoll, after a 4-2 victory against Leeds United in 2012. - English football has seen multiple instances of foreign owners taking control, leading to mixed feelings and controversy among fans. - High-spending owners can lead to an unstable environment for clubs and their connection to their communities. - To regain stability, some suggest a more democratic ownership structure, allowing fans more control and involvement in the clubs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Halloween II Context: After being attacked by Michael Myers (Dick Warlock), who vanished after being shot six times and falling from a second story balcony on October 31, 1978, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is rushed to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital that same night while Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) continues to search for Michael. Seeking shelter to recover from his injuries, Michael steals a kitchen knife from an elderly couple's house and kills their teenage neighbor. He learns that Laurie is at the local hospital after listening to a radio broadcast and heads there. Paramedic Jimmy Lloyd (Lance Guest) starts to develop romantic feelings for Laurie, despite the chagrin of head nurse Virginia Alves (Gloria Gifford) and explains to her about Michael; he soon realizes Laurie is in a comatose state. When Loomis sees Ben Tramer (who is wearing a mask similar to Michael's) walking towards him, he mistakes him for Michael and attempts to shoot him, but Sheriff Leigh Brackett (Charles Cyphers) tries to stop him when an oncoming police car hits a van and explodes, accidentally killing Ben. Once Michael arrives at the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital, he cuts the phone lines, and after killing most of the hospital personnel using various tools and methods, he reaches Laurie's room, but finds it empty. When Jimmy goes to get help, he discovers Mrs. Alves's corpse in the surgery room. While trying to run out of the room, he slips in a pool of blood on the floor and loses consciousness. Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis follows clues Michael left at a school he broke into when his colleague Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens) and a marshal (John Zenda) arrive with orders to transport Loomis back to Smith Grove's Sanitarium. During the drive, Marion tells him that Laurie Strode is Michael's sister. Now knowing Laurie is in danger and that he must get to her before Michael does, Loomis shoots at the window, demanding the Marshal quickly bring him to the hospital where she is.

Answer:","completion":"In the movie Halloween II, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) experiences flashbacks of a burning body while being treated at the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital. These flashbacks are specifically of the burning body of Michael Myers (Dick Warlock), the masked killer who attacked her earlier on October 31, 1978, and who has continued to terrorize the town in search of her. These flashbacks are symbolic of Laurie's ongoing trauma and fear, knowing that Michael is still alive and may come for her again. After Michael Myers discovers Laurie's location at the hospital, he proceeds to kill most of the hospital staff and eventually reaches Laurie's room. Laurie, realizing she is in danger, manages to elude Michael and escape her room before he can harm her. Throughout the movie, characters such as Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) and paramedic Jimmy Lloyd (Lance Guest) are involved in the efforts to stop the relentless killer and protect Laurie from the terror that she continuously faces. As the climax of Halloween II unfolds, it is revealed that Laurie Strode is actually Michael Myers' younger sister, providing a further explanation for Michael's relentless pursuit of Laurie as he seeks to kill the last remaining member of his family. With this knowledge, Dr. Loomis and Laurie must work together to confront Michael and put an end to the horrifying ordeal unfolding in Haddonfield."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Reality Check says: There is evidence for this and charging fees for employment tribunals has led to a bigger fall in the number of claims than the government expected. The fees were introduced when they were in government with the Conservatives in July 2013 - taking a case to an employment tribunal had previously been free. At the time one of the reasons it gave was that fees could: \\"disincentivise unreasonable behaviour, like pursuing weak or vexatious claims\\". Weak claims are presumably ones that are less likely to be successful, while strong ones would be more likely to be successful. The Labour manifesto said the party would \\"reverse the unfair employment tribunal fees which literally price people out of justice\\". There was no mention of employment tribunals in the Conservative or UKIP manifestos. Employment tribunals are devolved - we'll start with the situation in England and Wales. Individual claimants now have to pay a claim fee of £160 or £250 depending on the type of case and a further £230 or £950 if the case goes to a hearing. There is means-tested help available with paying tribunal fees. If you win the case then your employer might be forced to pay your tribunal fees but that is not automatic. After the fees were introduced the average number of total cases fell from about 5,000 a month to about 1,500 a month. The government had a review earlier this year to look at the impact of charging fees. It concluded that the introduction of fees had been successful in the sense that it had raised £8.5m to £9m a year and encouraged people to use free mediation services, but it also said that: \\"The fall in claims has been significantly greater than was estimated when fees were first introduced.\\" As a result, the government is consulting on whether changes are needed to the Help with Fees scheme to make it easier for people on lower incomes to get their fees paid. Brian Doyle, president of employment tribunals in England & Wales said in his submission to the review: \\"We do not consider that there has been a reduction in weak or unmeritorious claims. Had that been the case we would have expected the percentage of successful claims to have risen, whereas in fact it has declined slightly.\\" Statistics presented as part of the review show that the proportion of successful claims fell from an average of 15.3% in the nine months before the introduction of charging (62.6% were withdrawn before a hearing) to an average of 12.6% since then (with 59.0% being withdrawn). \\"Cases are being upheld in the same proportions as ever - there are just fewer winners and fewer losers,\\" Gareth Brahams from Brahams Dutt Badrick French, who is chair of the Employment Lawyers Association told BBC News. In Scotland, fees are also charged for employment tribunals. The Scottish National Party has promised to abolish them but has not yet done so. It gained the power to do so as part of last year's Scotland Act. The SNP has also pledged to abolish the fees as part of its Westminster campaign, which means it wants to see them abolished in England and Wales as well. It is also consulting on proposals to move some of its functions to the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland, which brings together a number of other legal functions, although there has been some opposition to this.

They became a transitional group between early hard rock and heavy metal and the new wave of British heavy metal. The band's current lineup includes vocalist Phil Mogg, lead guitarist Vinnie Moore, bass guitarist Rob De Luca, keyboardist and rhythm guitarist Paul Raymond and drummer Andy Parker. They have gone through several line-up changes, leaving Mogg as the only constant member, and had two hiatuses (1983-1984 and again from 1989 to 1991). Tensions had begun to grow between Mogg and Schenker in the late 1970s, possibly from Schenker often leaving before or during shows. Soon after UFO's show in Palo Alto, California on 29 October 1978, Schenker left the band. He made a brief return to the Scorpions before going on to form his own Michael Schenker Group. After Schenker's exit, UFO rehired Paul \\"Tonka\\" Chapman on guitar who brought over unused track ideas from Lone Star's drummer Dixie Lee. Shortly after, they released their next LP, No Place to Run in January, 1980. Produced by former Beatles producer George Martin, No Place To Run failed to match up to the success of its predecessors, though it fractionally missed the UK Top 10. Paul Raymond left the band at the end of the No Place To Run tour and was replaced by John Sloman from Uriah Heep for a couple of months and then by former Wild Horses guitarist and keyboardist Neil Carter, who helped fill the void in the songwriting left by Schenker's departure. Carter debuted with UFO on stage at the three-day Reading Festival on 23 August 1980, when the band played as the Saturday night headline act. At the beginning of the following year, UFO released the self-produced The Wild, the Willing and the Innocent, which had a lighter pop rock sound, which was popular at the time. The album achieved mild success in the UK, reaching the UK Top 20, and the single \\"Lonely Heart\\" was released. In February 1982 the band released Mechanix. It was very successful in the UK, where it reached No.8, the band's highest ever placing. Later that year, founding member Pete Way left the band to form Fastway with Motorhead guitarist \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke and then his own band, Waysted. He was replaced by Talas bassist, Billy Sheehan. UFO released Making Contact in 1983, but the album was a critical and commercial failure. Thus, that March, UFO decided to disband. The band played a UK farewell tour with Paul Gray (ex Eddie and the Hot Rods and The Damned bassist). However, there was a hint that this might not be permanent, when UFO released a compilation album featuring songs by UFO (as well as other groups featuring ex-members of UFO) entitled Headstone, the sleeve of which showed a headstone, denoting UFO with their formation date but an incomplete end date. This proved to be a short hiatus as, just short of two years later, in late 1984, Mogg assembled a new UFO line-up, featuring Paul Gray on bass again, ex-Diamond Head drummer Robbie France (replaced in 1985 by former Magnum drummer Jim Simpson), and Atomik Tommy M (Tommy McClendon), a former roadie who also wrote lyrics for Loudness, on guitar, with Paul Raymond rejoining shortly after and released Misdemeanor. This was followed by the 1988 EP Ain't Misbehavin. Despite the renewed activity of the band, neither release was financially successful and they officially disbanded again in 1989 after a string of guitarists replacing McClendon: Myke Gray of Jagged Edge in late 1987, in 1988 former Legs Diamond guitarist Rik Sanford and Tony Glidewell, while Pete Way rejoined on bass, and finally in 1989 future Cold Sweat guitarist Erik Gamans.

Two game companies, Antenna Research and Cortical Systematics, compete against each other. In addition, a group of \\"realists\\" fights both companies to prevent the \\"deforming\\" of reality. Antenna Research's Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh), the world's preeminent game designer, is testing her latest virtual reality game, eXistenZ, with a focus group at a seminar. She is shot in the shoulder by an assassin named Noel Dichter (Kris Lemche) with an organic pistol, which is undetectable by security. As Dichter is gunned down by the security team, security guard (and marketing trainee) Ted Pikul (Jude Law) rushes to Geller and escorts her outside. Allegra discovers that her pod, which contains the only copy of the eXistenZ game, may have been damaged due to an \\"UmbyCord\\" being ripped out as the game was being downloaded. To test it, she must plug into the game in tandem with another player she can trust, and talks a reluctant Pikul into installing a bio-port in his own body so he can play the game with her. Pikul, one of a dwindling few who has refused to have a bio-port installed to this point, at first objects due to a phobia about \\"surgical penetration\\", but eventually gives in. They head to a gas station run by a black-marketeer named Gas (Willem Dafoe) to get it installed. Gas deliberately installs a faulty bio-port and the game pod is damaged. Gas (a shotgun in hand) reveals that he is going to kill Allegra for the bounty on her head, but Pikul shoots him with the rivet gun used to install the port. The pair make their way to a former ski lodge used by Allegra's mentor, Kiri Vinokur (Ian Holm). He and his assistant repair the damaged pod and give Pikul a new bio-port.

Options: 1). semi truck 2). Tesla Model S 3). Ford Explorer 4). Toyota Tundra The answer is:","completion":"The Tesla Model S would make less pollution among the given options. Here's a detailed analysis of each vehicle's environmental impact: 1). Semi-truck: Semi-trucks usually run on diesel fuel, which emits various pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2). In addition, the large engines used in these trucks consume more fuel, leading to higher emissions. Therefore, semi-trucks contribute significantly to air pollution and have a considerable environmental impact. 2). Tesla Model S: The Tesla Model S is an electric vehicle powered by an electric motor, which uses electricity stored in rechargeable batteries. Since electric vehicles (EVs) do not have internal combustion engines, they do not emit tailpipe pollutants. Electricity, as stated in the fact, causes less pollution than gasoline. While the production of electricity may generate some pollution, its overall environmental impact is still lower than that of gasoline. Furthermore, as more renewable energy sources are used to produce electricity, the carbon footprint of EVs will keep decreasing. 3). Ford Explorer: The Ford Explorer is a gasoline-powered vehicle, which means it has an internal combustion engine with emissions including CO2, NOx, and other pollutants. Gasoline vehicles emit considerable greenhouse gases and pollutants that contribute to air pollution and climate change. Consequently, the Ford Explorer has a higher environmental impact when compared to electric vehicles like the Tesla Model S. 4). Toyota Tundra: The Toyota Tundra is a large pickup truck with an internal combustion engine powered by gasoline or, in some models, flex-fuel (a blend of gasoline and ethanol). Vehicles of this type usually have lower fuel efficiency, which means they consume more fuel and produce more emissions per mile than smaller, more efficient vehicles. As a result, the Toyota Tundra contributes a significant amount of pollution to the environment. In conclusion, the Tesla Model S would make less pollution among the given options due to its electric-powered motor, zero tailpipe emissions, and the fact that electricity causes less pollution than gasoline. The environmental impact of electric vehicles will continue to decrease as renewable energy sources become more prevalent in electricity production."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

First, we have a math problem that looks like this: -4297 * a + 1491 = -4794 * a Our mission is to find out what \\"a\\" is. So, let's follow these steps: 1. Let's keep the parts with \\"a\\" together. To do that, we're going to take -4297 * a and add 4794 * a to both sides of the problem. Here's what it looks like: -4297 * a + 4794 * a + 1491 = -4794 * a + 4794 * a 2. Now, let's add the two parts with \\"a\\" together on the left side. (-4297 + 4794) * a + 1491 = 0 * a 3. Next, let's find out how much is -4297 + 4794: 497 * a + 1491 = 0 4. Now, we're going to move that 1491 to the other side of the problem to get closer to finding \\"a\\". To do that, we'll subtract 1491 from both sides, like this: 497 * a + 1491 - 1491 = 0 - 1491 5. The left side becomes: 497 * a = -1491 6. The last step is to find what \\"a\\" is. To do that, we'll divide both sides by 497: (497 * a) / 497 = -1491 / 497 7. When we divide, we'll find out what \\"a\\" is: a = -3 And there you go! Our answer is a = -3.

It is located south of Turkey, west of Syria and Lebanon, northwest of Israel and Palestine, north of Egypt and east of Greece. The earliest known human activity on the island dates to around the 10th millennium BC. Archaeological remains from this period include the well-preserved Neolithic village of Khirokitia, and Cyprus is home to some of the oldest water wells in the world. Cyprus was settled by Mycenaean Greeks in two waves in the 2nd millennium BC. As a strategic location in the Middle East, it was subsequently occupied by several major powers, including the empires of the Assyrians, Egyptians and Persians, from whom the island was seized in 333 BC by Alexander the Great. Subsequent rule by Ptolemaic Egypt, the Classical and Eastern Roman Empire, Arab caliphates for a short period, the French Lusignan dynasty and the Venetians, was followed by over three centuries of Ottoman rule between 1571 and 1878 (de jure until 1914). 1. what did archaeologists find? 2. from what time frame? 3. where is it located? 4. who were the settlers in the area? 5. when did they settle? 6. how many people occupied it? 7. was it ever conquered? 8. by who? 9. when did they hold power? 10. is it the most populated place in the Sea?","completion":"1.

The 1980 Bank Robbery in Central Nyack that was medically managed at the Nyack Hospital where I responded to the ONLY Code 66 of my career. That “66”indicated for us an external disaster about to unload in our emergency room. The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses. Their injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site. In our Trauma and Triage Course we never learned about machine gun injuries. Additionally there were the criminals who were also injured and of course we needed to treat them as any other patient regardless of their behavior. The friends of the injured policemen were trying to get to these villains and it was just the most awful evening of my life. To this day I remember feeling nauseous in a way I had never felt before. We had debriefing sessions for weeks and of course were very upset for months. The wounds we had to address, the insertion of chest tubes and everything else all in such a rapid manner was indeed a more than gross situation. There was even open heart massage. Private doctors reported to help; many are not trained or current in emergency medicine; much is left to critical care nurses in a community hospital that is not a teaching institution with residents and interns on staff. Recently one of the women involved in this crime came up for parole. Of course there was great opposition from the community relative to her release. She was young and that was 38 years ago. I believe people deserve a second chance, but of course this is a very controversial matter. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Would the following sentence, by the strictest standards, be considered correct by a linguist? They tried all to like John.","completion":"By the strictest standards, the sentence \\"They tried all to like John\\" would not be considered correct by a linguist for a variety of reasons. Language is based on a system of rules known as grammar, morphology, syntax, and semantics. Each component contributes to the construction of well-formed sentences that convey clear meanings. Let us look at the issues present in the given sentence and provide a corrected version. 1. Syntax issues: Syntax is the study of the arrangement of words and phrases to create coherent sentences in a language. The given sentence has incorrect word order, leading to confusion about its intended meaning. Corrected version: \\"They all tried to like John.\\" In the corrected version, the word \\"all\\" is placed before the verb \\"tried\\" to modify the noun \\"they,\\" which clarifies the subject of the action. 2. Semantics issues: Semantics is the study of meaning in language. In the given sentence, it is unclear whether \\"all\\" refers to a group of people's collective effort to like John or a single individual trying with their entire being to like John. Corrected version: \\"They all tried to like John.\\" The semantics issue is resolved in the corrected version, as \\"all\\" now clearly modifies \\"they,\\" indicating that each person in the group made an effort to like John. 3. Diction issues: Diction refers to word choice and the way words are used in speech and writing. In the given sentence, \\"all\\" is not the best word to convey the intended meaning. Alternate versions: - \\"Everyone tried to like John.\\" - \\"Each of them tried to like John.\\" These alternate versions improve diction by using \\"everyone\\" or \\"each of them\\" to describe the group's effort more explicitly. In conclusion, the given sentence would not be considered correct by a linguist, mainly due to syntax and semantics issues. By reordering the words and carefully selecting the appropriate diction, the sentence can be corrected to effectively convey the intended meaning. The corrected version of the sentence is \\"They all tried to like John,\\" with alternate versions being \\"Everyone tried to like John\\" or \\"Each of them tried to like John.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If all else was the same, the wire that Ron had more resistance or less resistance.? Assuming that: Longer wires have more resistance than shorter wires. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Based on the assumption that longer wires have more resistance than shorter wires, the wire that Ron ran would have more resistance than the wire that Chris ran. Let's look deeper into the concept of resistance and the factors that influence it to better understand the situation. Resistance (R) is a property of a material that opposes the flow of electric current. It depends on several factors, including the length (L) of the wire, the cross-sectional area (A) of the wire, and the resistivity (ρ) of the material it is made of. The relationship between these factors can be expressed using the formula: R = (ρ * L) / A In this case, the length of Chris's wire is 3 feet and the length of Ron's wire is 10 feet. Since all else is the same (the resistivity and cross-sectional area of the wires are equal), we can compare their resistances directly using their lengths: R_Chris = (ρ * 3) / A R_Ron = (ρ * 10) / A Since ρ and A are the same for both wires, we can relate their resistances directly as: R_Ron = (10 / 3) * R_Chris Because 10 is greater than 3, this equation tells us that: R_Ron > R_Chris In other words, the wire that Ron had (10-foot long) has more resistance than the wire that Chris had (3-foot long). It is important to note that this conclusion is based on the assumption that longer wires have more resistance than shorter wires, and other factors such as resistivity and cross-sectional area remain consistent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize: Your doctor will try available medications to control your arrhythmia before resorting to an invasive therapy option or inserting a rhythm-stabilizing device. If your arrhythmia doesn’t respond to medication, the medications produce too many side effects, or your doctor determines that you’re at risk for serious complications that require more than medication, then they will discuss your options. Which option is right for you will depend on your medical history and type of arrhythmia. If none of the anti-arrhythmic medications have effectively controlled your arrhythmia, then you may be a candidate for electrical cardioversion. Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are the most common forms of arrhythmia that respond to electrical cardioversion. The procedure involves delivering a small electrical signal to your heart to stabilize the rhythm. An electrophysiologist can use catheter ablation to correct a variety of arrhythmias, including AFib, atrial flutter, and ventricular tachycardia, which is potentially life threatening. For this procedure, your doctor will insert a small catheter into your heart and deliver high-frequency currents to the tissue causing the arrhythmia. This essentially “disconnects” the faulty pathway, resulting in a normal heartbeat. Because this procedure is more invasive than electrical cardioversion, your doctor may try the latter option first, followed by ablation if necessary. This is a short procedure (two to four hours), and you can typically resume normal activities within a few days with a low risk of any complication. If your arrhythmia causes your heart to beat too slowly, then your doctor will likely discuss the option of a pacemaker. Unfortunately, no medications are available to treat a slow heart rate (bradycardia). A pacemaker includes a very small set of wires that measure the electrical activity in your heart. They connect to a small pulse generator that delivers a signal to normalize your heart’s rate whenever it detects an abnormality. Though it sounds very invasive, the procedure is considered very safe and requires only one night in a hospital while the team monitors your heart rate and rhythm to ensure proper functioning of the device. Because of their ability to interfere with your pacemaker, you should avoid strong magnetic fields and power-generating equipment (getting an MRI or using arc welding equipment, for instance). You should also avoid storing an electronic device such as your cell phone in your chest pocket next to your pacemaker. An ICD is similar to a pacemaker (leads inserted into the heart connected to a pulse generator), but they are used to treat a wider range of arrhythmias, especially ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, both of which can be life threatening. Before you consider an ICD, your arrhythmia must be life-threatening and originate from an uncorrectable cause such as: acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), myocardial ischemia (inadequate blood flow to the heart muscle), or electrolyte imbalance and drug toxicity. If you choose an ICD, you can maintain a normal lifestyle, including taking part in sports and exercise. Your ICD may need to get checked several times a year, although their batteries last between five and seven years. To help protect the ICD’s pulse generator, you will need to avoid large magnetic fields and energy-generating equipment (such as MRIs and arc welding equipment, for example). You should also avoid placing your cell phone or headphones within six inches of the device. If nothing else has controlled your atrial fibrillation, then your doctor may discuss the option of a heart Maze procedure, which can be minimally invasive cardiac surgery or is an open heart surgery. In the surgery, the doctor creates small cuts that are stitched together and scar tissue forms, which interferes with abnormal impulses.","completion":"Your doctor will first attempt to control your arrhythmia using medications before considering invasive therapy or inserting a rhythm-stabilizing device.

Electrical cardioversion involves using a small electrical signal to stabilize the heart rhythm, while catheter ablation disconnects the faulty pathway causing the arrhythmia. Pacemakers and ICDs involve inserting wires into the heart and using a pulse generator to normalize the heart rate, with ICDs being used for more severe cases.

Rather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome. I still feel for her. I wish I had contact information, so I could touch base, and express those thoughts personally. But that's the most personally resonant version of false advertising affecting someone that I've seen. Question: What is probably true about R? Answer: Answer:","completion":"It is probably true that R was initially naive about false advertising and believed in the claims made by the \\"miracle cure\\" company. After realizing she had been deceived, she became determined to prevent others from falling for such scams and was motivated to pursue a medical profession, where she could provide genuine advice and support to other people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the platform conspiracy theorists argue is a mobile version of the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program? Ford Island continues to be used by the US Navy. It hosts the 34,000-square-foot (3,200 m2) Pacific Warfighting Center for exercises, training and battle simulations. The Admiral Clarey Bridge enabled the Navy to develop a 331 million Pacific tsunami warning center named after Senator Daniel Inouye, replacing the aging facility on ʻEwa Beach. The center's location is controversial because of its location in a tsunami-vulnerable area and the Navy's tsunami-evacuation plan calls for the island's only access point—the Admiral Clarey Bridge—to be opened for ship evacuation (making the bridge inaccessible to land vehicles). The island also continues to host a military brig.Nominally based in Alaska, the Sea-based X-band Radar (SBX-1) arrived on Ford Island in 2006 for maintenance and repairs and has returned several times since. Primarily used as a warhead-detection radar system on a self-propelled floating platform in the Pacific, its presence on the island has been controversial. The platform, with a cost reaching nearly 1,000,000,000, has never actually made it to Alaska and conspiracy theorists argue that the platform is a mobile version of the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program.In 2013, the Navy unveiled a 4-million training facility, using simulators and virtual reality, at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Keyport on Ford Island. The Fleet Integrated Synthetic Training/Testing Facility (FIST2FAC) was developed to save on training costs with a reusable facility which could emulate electronic, mine and anti-air warfare scenarios instead of real-world training requiring fuel, logistics and deployment costs for ships.

Abstract: In an effort to determine whether life in industrialized societies can have an effect on hearing, 90 natives from Easter Island over 45 years old were evaluated. They underwent complete clinical and audiological assessment and were divided into groups according to those having lived only on the island or those having lived in modern civilization. With all factors being equal, except exposure to modern civilization, our results showed that living in civilized societies has a significant negative effect on hearing; the severity is directly proportional to the years of exposure. The median hearing thresholds of natives always living on the island (men and women combined) was found to be similar to those of female citizens of the United States; there was no significant difference in hearing thresholds between men and women among these natives. These results suggest that there are no significant inherent racial differences nor significant inherent differences between males and females in the sensitivity of hearing. A relationship between aging and hearing was noted and interpreted as true or intrinsic presbycusis. There were no cases of otosclerosis, Meniere's disease, or exostoses of the external ear canal among natives who had always lived on the island. Pure natives were found not to be prone to otitis media in spite of having an extremely high incidence of severe upper respiratory tract allergies.

Given the question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What happened when there was a forced coupling of children? Context: The Greek kingdom of Bactria began as a breakaway satrapy of the Seleucid empire, which, because of the size of the empire, had significant freedom from central control. Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus. The answer is:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"What happened when there was a forced coupling of children?\\" isn't clearly written in the context provided.

Given the question: Process: - Add water to a pot - Put the pot over a source of heat - Turn the heat on - Wait for a few minutes - Begin to observe small bubbles in the water - Wait until the water starts to bubble a lot - Wait until you can see steam rising from the water - Turn the heat source off - Take the pot off of the heat source. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a smaller vessel is used happens, how will it affect FASTER boiling. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of using a smaller vessel does have an effect on the process, both directly and indirectly, leading to faster boiling of the water in certain conditions. In general, the boiling process depends on various factors such as the size of the vessel, water volume, heat transfer rate, stove efficiency, and surface area of the vessel in contact with the heat source. When a smaller vessel is used, several factors contribute to the faster boiling of water: 1. Direct Effect: A smaller vessel typically has a smaller volume capacity, meaning it would hold a lesser amount of water compared to a larger vessel. Keeping the heat source power constant, the energy required to raise the temperature of a smaller volume of water is less than that for a larger volume, making the water in the smaller vessel heat up and boil faster. This is due to the direct relationship between heat applied, mass of the water, and temperature change, as represented by the formula Q = mcΔT, where Q is the heat applied, m is the mass of the water, c is the specific heat capacity of water, and ΔT is the change in temperature. 2. Increased Heat Transfer Rate: Depending on the material the smaller vessel is made of, it may conduct heat more efficiently, allowing the water to receive more heat energy in a shorter period and, thus, boil faster. Thinner walls can also lead to improved heat transfer rates. 3. Increased Surface Area to Volume Ratio: A smaller vessel usually has a higher surface area to volume ratio, enabling the heat to be more evenly distributed across the water surface. The increased surface area in contact with the heat source can allow a more uniform and efficient transfer of energy, leading to faster boiling. 4. Indirect Effect: The process of observing small bubbles and waiting until the water starts to bubble a lot is affected when using a smaller vessel. As the water heats up faster, these visual cues will appear more quickly, and the user will progress through the process steps more rapidly. It is essential to note that these effects are heavily influenced by other factors like the vessel's shape and material, the heat source intensity, and the specific conditions in which the boiling takes place. In some cases, the difference in boiling time may not be significant if other conditions are unfavorable. Nevertheless, the use of a smaller vessel can lead to faster boiling of water due to the direct and indirect effects that it introduces to the boiling process."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information: - Piracetam (sold under many brand names) is a nootropic drug in the racetams group, with chemical name \\"2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetamide\\". It shares the same 2-oxo-pyrrolidone base structure with pyroglutamic acid. Piracetam is a cyclic derivative of GABA (gamma-Aminobutyric acid). Presently piracetam is used in many European countries, Asia and South America. In the United States, it is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for any medical use and it is not permitted to be sold as a dietary supplement. In the UK, piracetam is prescribed mainly for myoclonus, but is used off-label for other conditions. Evidence to support its use for many conditions is unclear. - Levetiracetam, marketed under the trade name Keppra among others, is a medication used to treat epilepsy. It is used for partial onset, myoclonic, or tonic-clonic seizures. It is the S-enantiomer of etiracetam. - Phenylpiracetam (INN: fonturacetam, brand names Phenotropil, Carphedon), also called is a phenylated analog of the drug piracetam which was developed in 1983 in Russia where it is available as a prescription drug. Research on animals has indicated that phenylpiracetam may have anti-amnesic, antidepressant, anticonvulsant, antipsychotic, anxiolytic, and memory enhancement effects. - Anticonvulsants (also commonly known as antiepileptic drugs or as antiseizure drugs) are a diverse group of pharmacological agents used in the treatment of epileptic seizures. Anticonvulsants are also increasingly being used in the treatment of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder, since many seem to act as mood stabilizers, and for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Anticonvulsants suppress the rapid and excessive firing of neurons during seizures. Anticonvulsants also prevent the spread of the seizure within the brain. Some investigators have observed that anticonvulsants themselves may cause reduced IQ in children. However these adverse effects must be balanced against the significant risk epileptic seizures pose to children and the distinct possibility of death and devastating neurological sequelae secondary to seizures. Anticonvulsants are more accurately called antiepileptic drugs (abbreviated \\"AEDs\\"), and are often referred to as antiseizure drugs because they provide symptomatic treatment only and have not been demonstrated to alter the course of epilepsy. - Etiracetam is a chemical compound belonging to the racetam family, which was developed as a nootropic drug. It is racemic; its biologically active enantiomeric form is levetiracetam, now marketed as an antiepileptic drug. - Stimulants (also referred to as psychostimulants) is an overarching term that covers many drugs including those that increase activity of the body, drugs that are pleasurable and invigorating, or drugs that have sympathomimetic effects. Due to their rendering a characteristic \\"up\\" feeling, stimulants are also occasionally referred to as \\"uppers\\". Depressants or \\"downers\\", which decrease mental and/or physical function, are in stark contrast to stimulants and are considered to be the functionally opposite drug class. Stimulants are widely used throughout the world as prescription medicines as well as without a prescription (either legally or illicitly) as performance-enhancing or recreational drugs. The most frequently prescribed stimulants as of 2013 were lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, and amphetamine. It is estimated that the percent of the population that has abused amphetamines, cocaine and MDMA combined is between .8% and 2.1%. - Motivation is a theoretical construct used to explain behaviour. It gives the reasons for people's actions, desires, and needs. Motivation can also be defined as one's direction to behavior, or what causes a person to want to repeat a behavior and vice versa. A motive is what prompts the person to act in a certain way, or at least develop an inclination for specific behavior. According to Maehr and Meyer, \\"Motivation is a word that is part of the popular culture as few other psychological concepts are.\\" - Nootropicsalso called smart drugs or cognitive enhancersare drugs, supplements, or other substances that improve cognitive function, particularly executive functions, memory, creativity, or motivation, in healthy individuals. The use of cognition-enhancing drugs by healthy individuals in the absence of a medical indication is one of the most debated topics among neuroscientists, psychiatrists, and physicians which spans a number of issues, including the ethics and fairness of their use, concerns over adverse effects, and the diversion of prescription drugs for nonmedical uses, among others. Nonetheless, the international sales of cognition-enhancing supplements exceeded billion in 2015 and the global demand for these compounds is still growing rapidly. - In medicine, an adverse effect is an undesired harmful effect resulting from a medication or other intervention such as surgery. - Epilepsy is a group of neurological diseases characterized by epileptic seizures. Epileptic seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable to long periods of vigorous shaking. These episodes can result in physical injuries including occasionally broken bones. In epilepsy, seizures tend to recur, and have no immediate underlying cause. Isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy. People with epilepsy in some areas of the world experience stigma due to the condition. The cause of most cases of epilepsy is unknown, although some people develop epilepsy as the result of brain injury, stroke, brain tumors, infections of the brain, and birth defects. Known genetic mutations are directly linked to a small proportion of cases. Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal nerve cell activity in the cortex of the brain. The diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms such as fainting and determining if another cause of seizures is present such as alcohol withdrawal or electrolyte problems. This may be partly done by imaging the brain and performing blood tests. Epilepsy can often be confirmed with an electroencephalogram (EEG), but a normal test does not rule out the condition. Epilepsy that occurs as a result of other issues may be preventable. Seizures are controllable with medication in about 70% of cases. Inexpensive options are often available. In those whose seizures do not respond to medication, then surgery, neurostimulation, or dietary changes may be considered. Not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong, and many people improve to the point that treatment is no longer needed. As of 2013 about 22 million people have epilepsy. Nearly 80% of cases occur in the developing world. In 2013 it resulted in 116,000 deaths up from 112,000 deaths in 1990. Epilepsy is more common in older people. In the developed world, onset of new cases occurs most frequently in babies and the... - A drug is any substance (other than food that provides nutritional support) that, when inhaled, injected, smoked, consumed, absorbed via a patch on the skin, or dissolved under the tongue, causes a physiological change in the body. - Oxiracetam (ISF 2522) is a nootropic drug of the racetam family and very mild stimulant. Several studies suggest that the substance is safe even when high doses are consumed for a long period of time. However, the mechanism of action of the racetam drug family is still a matter of research. Oxiracetam is not approved by Food and Drug Administration for any medical use in the United States. - Executive functions (collectively referred to as executive function and cognitive control) are a set of cognitive processes including attentional control, inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility, as well as reasoning, problem solving, and planning that are necessary for the cognitive control of behavior: selecting and successfully monitoring behaviors that facilitate the attainment of chosen goals. Executive functions gradually develop and change across the lifespan of an individual and can be improved at any time over the course of a person's life. Similarly, these cognitive processes can be adversely affected by a variety of events which affect an individual. Neuropsychological tests are used to measure executive functions, and are usually performed as part of a more comprehensive assessment to diagnose neurological and psychiatric disorders. - Racetams are a class of drugs that share a pyrrolidone nucleus. Some, such as piracetam, are considered nootropics. Some such as oxiracetam and phenylpiracetam are also stimulants. Others such as levetiracetam and seletracetam are anticonvulsants. - Etiracetam is a nootropic drug of the racetam family . It is racemic ; its biologically active enantiomeric form is levetiracetam . - Seletracetam (UCB 44212) is a pyrrolidone-derived drug of the racetam family that is structurally related to levetiracetam (trade name Keppra). It was under development by UCB Pharmaceuticals as a more potent and effective anticonvulsant drug to replace levetiracetam but its production has been halted. - In chemistry, an enantiomer, also known as an optical isomer, is one of two stereoisomers that are mirror images of each other that are non-superposable (not identical), much as one's left and right hands are the same except for being reversed along one axis (the hands cannot be made to appear identical simply by reorientation). Organic compounds that contain a chiral carbon atom usually have two non-superposable structures. These two structures are mirror images of each other and are, thus, commonly called enantiomorphs (\\"enantio\\" = opposite ; \\"morph\\" = form), hence this structural property is now commonly referred to as enantiomerism.

In Britain, further experiments in the genre boosted its appeal. House and rave clubs such as Lakota and Cream emerged across Britain, hosting house and dance scene events. The 'chilling out' concept developed in Britain with ambient house albums such as The KLF's Chill Out and Analogue Bubblebath by Aphex Twin. The Godskitchen superclub brand also began in the midst of the early 90's rave scene. After initially hosting small nights in Cambridge and Northampton, the associated events scaled up in Milton Keynes, Birmingham and Leeds. A new indie dance scene also emerged in the 90's. In New York, bands such as Deee-Lite furthered house's international influence. Two distinctive tracks from this era were the Orb's \\"Little Fluffy Clouds\\" (with a distinctive vocal sample from Rickie Lee Jones) and the Happy Mondays' \\"Wrote for Luck\\" (\\"WFL\\") which was transformed into a dance hit by Vince Clarke. The late Robert Miles also produced house tracks such as \\"One and One\\" with Maria Nayler, \\"Fable\\" and his biggest hit, \\"Children\\". In England, one of the few licensed venues was The Eclipse, which attracted people from up and down the country as it was open until the early hours. Due to the lack of licensed, legal dance event venues, house music promoters began organising illegal events in unused warehouses, aeroplane hangars and in the countryside. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 was a government attempt to ban large rave dance events featuring music with \\"repetitive beats\\", due to law enforcement allegations that these events were associated with illegal club drugs. There were a number of \\"Kill the Bill\\" demonstrations by rave and electronic dance music fans. The Spiral Tribe dance event at Castle Morten was the last of these illegal raves, as the bill, which became law, in November 1994, made unauthorised house music dance events illegal in the UK. Despite the new law, the music continued to grow and change, as typified by Leftfield with \\"Release the Pressure\\", which introduced dub and reggae into the...

Would \\"Euskara Batua was created so that Basque language could be used—and easily understood by all Basque speakers—in formal situations (education, mass media, literature), and this is its main use today.\\" be a reasonable answer? The answer is:","completion":"Basque, also known as Euskara, is primarily spoken in the Basque Country, a region that spans the border between northern Spain and southwestern France. Within Spain, the Basque-speaking territory encompasses the three provinces of Gipuzkoa, Bizkaia, and Araba/Álava in the autonomous community of the Basque Country. In France, it is spoken in the western part of the Pyrénées-Atlantiques department within the French Basque Country. Euskara Batua, or Unified Basque, was indeed created to help facilitate mutual understanding among Basque speakers and to serve as a standardized version of the language for use in formal situations such as education, mass media, and literature. The various dialects of Euskara once made communication difficult among speakers from different regions, but Euskara Batua has been successful in bridging those gaps and is now widely used and understood by all Basque speakers in formal contexts.

Piyush \\"Bobby\\" Jindal (born June 10, 1971) is an American politician who was the 55th Governor of Louisiana between 2008 and 2016, and previously served as a U.S. Congressman and as the vice chairman of the Republican Governors Association. In 1996, Jindal was appointed secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals and in 1999, at age 28, he was appointed as the youngest president in the history of the University of Louisiana System. In 2001, President George W. Bush appointed Jindal as principal adviser to the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. He first ran for governor of Louisiana in 2003, but lost in the run-off election to Democratic candidate, Kathleen Blanco. Jindal had been mentioned as a potential candidate for the 2012 presidential election. On December 10, 2008, Jindal indicated that he would likely not run for president in 2012, saying he will focus on his re-election in 2011 and that this would make transitioning to a national campaign difficult, though he did not rule out a possible 2012 presidential bid. Speculation increased when Republicans chose Jindal to deliver the response to President Obama's first address to a joint session of Congress. The Jindal for President Draft Council Inc. PAC was formed in 2009 to raise funds for a future presidential run. Jindal has stated that he has no involvement with the PAC. In April 2010, while speaking at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference, Jindal ruled out running for the Republican nomination for President in 2012. In 2012, Jindal traveled across the country in support of the Mitt Romney-Paul Ryan ticket. Because Louisiana and other Deep South states voted heavily for the GOP, Jindal could hence devote his campaign time elsewhere. In August 2012, Politico reported that \\"Bobby Jindal would be considered [for] and would likely take\\" appointment as United States Secretary of Health and Human Services in a potential Romney cabinet. After the defeat of Romney-Ryan, Jindal called for his party to return to \\"the basics... If we want people to like us, we have to like them first,\\" he said on the interview program Fox News Sunday. As the incoming president of the Republican Governors Association, which had thirty members in 2013, Jindal questioned Romney for having criticized President Obama as having provided \\"extraordinary financial gifts from the government\\". In reply to Romney, Jindal said, \\"You don't start to like people by insulting them and saying their votes were bought.\\" Jindal said that his party must convince a majority of voters that it supports the middle class and the principle of upward mobility. He also criticized what he termed \\"stupid\\" remarks regarding rape and conception made in 2012 by defeated Republican U.S. Senate nominees Todd Akin in Missouri and Richard Mourdock in Indiana.","completion":"This text is about Piyush \\"Bobby\\" Jindal, an American politician who served as the 55th Governor of Louisiana between 2008 and 2016.

(Associated Press) The lucky trio did not immediately identify themselves, but they bought their tickets in the small working class town of Munford, Tennessee; in the quiet Los Angeles suburb of Chino Hills; and at a supermarket in affluent Melbourne Beach, on Florida's Space Coast. They overcame odds of 1 in 292.2 million to land on all the numbers: 4-8-19-27-34 and Powerball 10. They can let their winnings be invested and thereby collect 30 annual payments totaling an estimated 533 million, or take their third of 983.5 million in cash all at once. Getting such a windfall is the start of a \\"new journey\\" and the winners should be prepared with lawyers, accountants and financial planners before they come forward, California Lottery spokesman Russ Lopez said. Too many lottery winners unaccustomed to sudden wealth have gone bankrupt, been victimized or experienced other losses because they were unprepared for an onslaught of unwanted attention, said Andrew Stoltmann, an Illinois attorney who has represented winners. He compared it to \\"throwing meat into a shark-infested ocean.\\" But they shouldn't wait too long: California gives its top winners up to a year to contact lottery officials before the money automatically goes to schools. Winners in Tennessee and Florida must claim their winnings within 180 days of Wednesday night's drawing. State and local taxes can eat up nearly half the winnings for many lottery players around the country, but these three could be even more lucky if they live in Florida or Tennessee, which have no state income tax, or California, which exempts winnings from lottery tickets bought in-state. They would still owe federal taxes, topping out at 39.6 percent. The huge draw also produced eight 2 million Power Play winners and 73 1 million winners nationwide who matched all five white balls but missed the red Powerball, said Sally Lunsford of the Kansas Lottery. The California ticket was sold at a 7-Eleven; the Florida ticket at a Publix supermarket and the Tennessee ticket at a family-owned grocery store, where the owner, Dana Naifeh, received a 25,000 check. \\"I need to digest this,\\" said Naifeh, who plans to share some of her modest bounty with store employees. Florida's store collects 100,000, and California's 1 million bonus will be shared between the Chino Hills store owner and the 7-Eleven company. California Lottery spokesman Alex Traverso said officials there heard plenty of stories about possible jackpot winners, but no one had come forward to cash in the ticket as of late Thursday afternoon. Munford auto body shop worker Jerry Caudle said he was \\"freaking out\\" when he heard a winning ticket was sold in his town, but then saw that he matched only two numbers and the Powerball, for a prize of 14. He wore a wistful smile as he left the Short Stop gas station and convenience store, where Tipton County's \\"best chicken on a stick\\" costs 3.69. \\"It's been tough,\\" Caudle said. \\"The hardest winter for me here in 17 years.\\" The California store and its surrounding strip mall suddenly became a popular gathering spot in the rural suburb of 78,000, where cows still graze on hillsides. Hundreds of people crowded into the 7-Eleven store, chanting \\"Chino Hills! Chino Hills!\\" Store owner Balbir Atwal worked as an electronics salesman after immigrating from India in 1981, and bought his first 7-Eleven franchise at the age of 27. Now he owns four. He said he has sold winning tickets before, but never like this one. \\"I was just joking, I said, this is the time someone's going to hit it,\\" laughed Atwal. He said he would share his part of the store's bonus with employees and family, and give some to charity. Michael Fahim, 48, real estate broker from Chino Hills, said he bought 20 lottery tickets Wednesday night just up the street. \\"I'm happy it's in Chino Hills. I think it put us on the map — all over the world,\\" he said, adding that his brother called from Australia overnight to learn if he won. Melbourne Beach's 3,100 residents live on a spit of beachfront no bigger than one-square mile. Unlike parts of the Space Coast dominated by high rises, the affluent town has large single-family homes on its beaches. Nobody emerged to claim their winnings, but excitement was palpable outside the Publix where the ticket was sold. \\"The winner could be as close as your neighbors!\\" said Lisa Londini, a professional caregiver shopping at the market. \\"I wish it was me!\\" Ticket sales and payouts had risen steadily as weeks came and went without a winner since Nov. 4, when the jackpot amount was reset at 40 million. In addition to three jackpot winners, more than 26 million other winning tickets will pay out total cash prizes of 273,869,373, Lunsford said. For Wednesday night's drawing alone, Powerball sales totaled 1,270,206,274. People were buying 37,000 Powerball tickets a minute in California, where 386 million in Powerball tickets were sold since Nov. 4, the most of any state and more than California sold in the entire previous fiscal year, spokesman Russ Lopez said. \\"You get a lot of new players with a large jackpot,\\" California Lottery Director Hugo Lopez said. \\"Our goal is to have a lot of people play a little bit.\\" A big chunk of the profits go to schools, although not enough to solve all their budget problems, officials said. Sales for this jackpot generated nearly 115 million since November for education in Florida, which uses the lottery to provide 6 percent of the education budget, Florida Lottery Secretary Tom Delacenserie said. California's share represents 154 million for its schools, Russ Lopez said — not enough \\"to get schools out of trouble.\\" ___ Contributors include David Pitt and Scott McFetridge in Iowa City, Iowa.

The 62-year-old nurse was even identified by her employer, Park Avenue Health & Wellness Center in Pomona, California, who also may have fallen for the prank. Shlomo Rechnitz, right, purchased Powerball tickets for all of his 15,000 employees for Wednesday night’s historic drawing. David Livingston / Getty Images ID: 7772707 The story spread quickly in local news broadcasts and social media, but it began to quickly unravel after details surrounding the ticket emerged. One of the woman’s daughters told the New York Daily News that the ticket, and the picture, had in fact been part of a prank from one of her siblings. California Lottery officials told BuzzFeed News they were skeptical about the win for a couple of reasons, including the fact that no one had come forward to claim the prize. “No one from that group has come forward,” Alex Traverso, assistant deputy director of the California Lottery, told BuzzFeed News. He said a picture of the supposed winning ticket also appeared to have been purchased at the wrong retailer. “We checked out the ticket, and the retailers don’t check out,” he said.

She and her colleagues began to celebrate at the nursing home Wednesday night after the numbers were announced, Nass said, believing she was a big winner. He told BuzzFeed News he and her employer had been unable to contact the woman after news spread she might have been the victim of a prank. “If it is indeed the case that someone pulled a prank on her, that’s reprehensible,” Nass said. At this point, Nass said it was unclear what happened. “She’s a wonderful lady, and an incredible employee,” Nass said. “She stayed to finish her shift.” The real winning ticket was purchased at a 7-Eleven in Chino Hills, California. A picture of the woman’s ticket, however, showed it came from a different store, Traverso said. Two other jackpot winning tickets were purchased in Florida and Tennessee. None of the winners have been identified. Traverso said it is also rare for winners to make any sort of public announcement before claiming the winnings with the California Lottery. “They usually play it really close to the vest,” he told BuzzFeed News. “They don’t want people to know they’re big winners.

The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a great film, and often regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. I never much paid attention to how the film was lit, but on examination I don’t know what I think of the lighting. Maybe i’m totally wrong, but the lighting seems quite obvious when you pay attention to it, which makes me thing it could have been done better? Certainly the lighting is masterfully done, in the way it properly exposes the characters faces and splashes off and around certain props and objects, adding a great deal of dimension to many of the shots. But it does look quite obvious, once you pay attention to it, especially when you can see multiple shadows coming from a single character. All that said, the lighting is still pretty masterful and I’m very intrigued to properly analyse it. The first shot of the scene has extremely beautiful (even though it is obvious 😉 ) lighting. As the cowboy stands in the hallway you can tell that there is a strong key light coming from the left of the frame, that will light his face once he steps out of the shadows. It seems like there is another light, maybe coming from high up near the roof, lighting the right hand side of the frame, near the back of the hallway. Most likely facing towards the character to light him from his right hand side, to seperate him from the background. The lighting setup of this shot is extremely beautiful the way it enhances the various pieces of wood and props within the frame, and how they’ve managed to keep the cowboy drenched in shadows as he sneaks around, even though there is quite a lot of light within the frame. It looks like they may have used a cutter to achieve that effect as its a very specific area, essentially just the top half of the cowboy thats drenched ins shadow. Theres also this curious black circular shadow which exists at the very top of the door near the cowboys head which permanently stays extremely dark, much darker than the rest of the shadows in the frame.

Please briefly summarize this news article: COMICS SYNDICATES: As Universal editor changes titles, Trudeau, Watterson, Johnston, Thompson and Tatulli salute an influential figure SYNDICATION EXECUTIVES, by the nature of the beast, seldom gain wider acclaim in comics. They work offstage, undetected beyond the panels and unseen behind the balloons. As former senior vice president Lisa Klem Wilson underscored last year when United Media shuttered its doors, the focus is on the talent instead of the suits. Sometimes, however, a momentary exception must be made. Lee Salem, a four-decade figure at Universal Uclick, now deserves a little time in the center-spot. The Kansas City-based syndicate recently announced that Salem will move from the editorial side of the business, as the Universal Uclick president drops “Editor” from his title — as a baton is passed to capable hands and the talented John Glynn becomes Editorial Director. Since Salem joined Universal Press Syndicate in 1974, he has helped discover and/or nurture dozens of stellar strips, including Bill Watterson’s “Calvin and Hobbes,” Lynn Johnston’s “For Better or for Worse,” Richard Thompson’s “Cul de Sac” and Mark Tatulli’s “Lio” — as well as editing Garry Trudeau’s “Doonesbury,” which won a Pulitzer the year after Salem arrived. “In the strips Universal launched, the writing was paramount, and Lee had a great eye for lively writers and a real understanding of what makes a comic strip work,” Watterson tells Comic Riffs. LEE SALEM: After 38 years as part of Universal Uclick’s editorial department, the executive transitions from that side of the business. (CAVNA / The Washington Post ) . “Lee has a smart sense of humor and he understands good comic timing,” Johnston tells us. “He can be funny and fun to be with, but he can also be a tough opponent if need be.” And Trudeau tells Comic Riffs: “I’ve depended on Lee’s friendship, guidance, protection and occasional interventions for decades, and I have no intention of giving all that up.” As Salem eases into his transition with his usual wisdom and grace, Comic Riffs asked those five cartoonists to share their thoughts on his legend and legacy, his editorship and his friendship. “I’m in complete denial about his move. I’ve depended on Lee’s friendship, guidance, protection and occasional interventions for decades, and I have no intention of giving all that up. He’ll just have to keep making room for me in his schedule. This isn’t open to discussion.” I think a big part of Lee’s editorial legacy is in bringing to newspapers a new generation of cartoonists — including women — and introducing an entirely new range of subjects and voices to the comics page. In the strips Universal launched, the writing was paramount, and Lee had a great eye for lively writers and a real understanding of what makes a comic strip work. He always seemed to find strips with highly individualistic takes on the world, and a strong sense of voice. This has become more or less the standard model for newspaper comics now, but it was quite different from the plug-in-the-gag, committee-drawn strips of the ‘50s and ‘60s, and I think it brought the comics a new sharpness and relevance. Because I admired and respected so many of Universal’s strips, I completely trusted Lee’s judgment in editing my work: I never argued for a strip he questioned. Of course, his “New England reserve” took some getting used to. In the early days, I’d save a week’s mailing time by handing Lee a stack of roughs to edit whenever he swung through the area on a business trip. He’d read through a month of my cartoons in a few minutes, and he could have been reading obituaries for all the delight he radiated. I’d crawl under the couch and lie in a tight ball until he was back on the plane. You can imagine what it was like to negotiate a contract with him. But of course, that unflappable quality was a real virtue in the other part of his job, which was to step into a circle of furious readers and newspaper editors, and take all the bullets. Lee was a great defender of my work, and I’ll always be grateful for his long and vigorous support. I’ve really enjoyed having Lee as my editor all these years, and he’s been a great friend to cartooning. \\"Lee Salem changed my life. I always wanted to make comics professionally, and I had been trying for syndication for some time. But it wasn't something real until 1997, when I sent a bunch of “Heart of the City” sample strips to Lee through the mail and he called to offer me a development deal. And from then on my life changed. It was because Lee Salem, the first guy with real comic-strip power, said, “Yes.” When I first started to work with Universal Press, Lee Salem was my editor. He was the one who suggested the name “For Better or For Worse\\" for my comic strip, and I have to admit, it suited the work I did. For the first few months, he worked with me to develop something that had consistency and balance. He was an excellent editor. Writing funny stuff is a personal venture, so the editor who says, “Hey, that's not funny!” better be right ... and Lee usually was. Whenever I traveled to Kansas City, he'd come to the airport to meet me [in his car]. It was old and comfortable with evidence of kids and family still in the trunk and the door compartments. The syndicate was then headquartered on the second floor of a plain square building on Squibb Avenue. A dusty plastic jade plant was at the top of the stairs, which gave me comfort. There was a lack of pretense everywhere and a real sense of camaraderie among the staff. Lee's office was small and cramped, but orderly. He had a window with a view of the farmlands outside and a secretary who sometimes put her dresses on backwards. I was lucky enough to have been there when [co-founder] Jim Andrews was alive. In fact, I think it was Jim who went to bat for me when others might have asked me to wait until I had something worth consideration. My first impression of Lee was that he was competent, thoughtful, honest and fair. He still is! I was well out of my league with a daily comic strip, but his confidence and easygoing manner made the job so much easier. Lee has a smart sense of humor and he understands good comic timing. He can be funny and fun to be with, but he can also be a tough opponent if need be. We have disagreed, heartily at times, and yet we have never fought. ... I believe his impregnable stare and calm demeanor — when under duress — is kind of a gift. Managing cartoonists can't be easy. We are all so capable of devastating a weak superior with a withering remark or a hideous drawing that it's best, perhaps, to keep us guessing when the gloves are off! What I'm saying here is...we all appreciate authority when it comes with class. Lee is a class act and I'm grateful to have been one of “the cast.” Late in 2005, out of the blue, I got an e-mail from Lee Salem; his subject line was: “Syndication?” I’d been asking myself the same question since I was about 10 years old, and the answer had always been, “Maybe some other time.” But such is the reputation, sway and authority of Lee Salem that my immediate response was: “Sure!” In the seven years since that e-mail, Lee has gently guided me into a life-changing career in the noblest calling: newspaper comic strip cartoonist. He didn’t do it alone, of course — it’s taken a team of ace specialists to convince me I know what I’m doing. But Lee’s lower-case e-mails encouraged me like nothing else, and his dinnertime conviviality sure helped, too. I’m proud to cal him my editor and friend.” Summary:","completion":"Lee Salem, a big helper at Universal Uclick, has been in the company for 40 years and is now changing his job. He used to help pick and take care of many popular comic strips in newspapers that people love, like \\"Calvin and Hobbes\\" and \\"For Better or For Worse.\\" People who make those comic strips are saying nice things about him and telling stories about how he has helped them along the way.

Question: \\"Chen is?\\" Context: \\"The original idea of a Chinese satellite navigation system was conceived by Chen Fangyun and his colleagues in the 1980s. According to the China National Space Administration, the development of the system would be carried out in three steps:\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"Chen Fangyun is a prominent Chinese scientist, engineer, and one of the pioneers in the Chinese satellite navigation system. With his remarkable vision, technical expertise, and leadership, Chen Fangyun played a crucial role in the conception and development of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS), which has put China on the global stage in satellite navigation technology. During the 1980s, China recognized the growing importance of satellite navigation technology for both military and civilian applications. Relying on foreign systems such as GPS (United States) or GLONASS (Russia) raised concerns about national security and technological independence. To address these concerns, Chen Fangyun and his colleagues, leveraging their extensive knowledge in satellite systems and related fields, proposed the development of a homegrown Chinese satellite navigation system. Chen's plan was ambitious and consisted of a three-step development strategy to ensure the success of this monumental project. The China National Space Administration adopted this strategy, highlighting the importance of Chen Fangyun's contribution to the country's navigation satellite technology. Step 1: Experimental Satellite System In the first phase, a two-satellite experimental system was created, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of a comprehensive and operational satellite navigation system. By successfully launching two experimental satellites in 2000 and 2003, China demonstrated its capability to develop and deploy its own satellite navigation system. Step 2: Regional Satellite Navigation System The second phase focused on developing and deploying a regional satellite navigation system. This system would provide navigation, positioning, and timing services for the Chinese territory and the surrounding areas. Between 2009 and 2012, China successfully launched 10 more satellites, gradually extending the coverage of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System to the Asia-Pacific region. Step 3: Global Satellite Navigation System In the final phase, China aimed to expand the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System into a global network, offering seamless, worldwide navigation services. With the help of additional satellites, the system extended its coverage to other continents, ultimately resulting in a complete global constellation of BeiDou satellites. This ambitious goal was achieved in 2020, with the successful launch of the last BDS-3 satellite into orbit. Chen Fangyun's foresight and dedication to the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System have been instrumental in its conception, development, and successful deployment. Under his guidance, China successfully transitioned from relying on foreign satellite navigation systems to becoming a major player in the field. Today, the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System is one of the four major satellite navigation systems globally, alongside GPS (United States), GLONASS (Russia), and Galileo (European Union). This achievement is a testament to Chen Fangyun's outstanding engineering and leadership skills and his unquestionable legacy in the field of satellite navigation technology."},{"prompt":"Information: - The Office of the First Minister was a portfolio within the Scottish Government .

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the first name of the person who calculated critical mass of a sphere of uranium in a theoretical paper? ? At Birmingham, Oliphant's team had reached a different conclusion. Oliphant had delegated the task to two German refugee scientists, Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch, who could not work on Oliphant's radar project because they were enemy aliens and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance. Francis Perrin had calculated the critical mass of uranium to be about 40 tonnes (39 long tons; 44 short tons). He reckoned that if a neutron reflector were placed around it, this might be reduced to 12 tonnes (12 long tons; 13 short tons). Peierls attempted to simplify the problem by using the fast neutrons produced by fission, thus omitting consideration of moderator. He too calculated the critical mass of a sphere of uranium in a theoretical paper written in 1939 to be \\"of the order of tons\\".Peierls knew the importance of the size of the critical mass that would allow a chain reaction to take place and its practical significance. In the interior of a critical mass sphere, neutrons are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material. A very small portion of these neutrons are colliding with other nuclei, while a larger portion of the neutrons are escaping through the surface of the sphere. Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping.Niels Bohr had theorised that the rare uranium-235 isotope, which makes up only about 0.7% of natural uranium, was primarily responsible for fission with fast neutrons, although this was not yet universally accepted. Frisch and Peierls were thus able to revise their initial estimate of critical mass needed for nuclear fission in uranium to be substantially less than previously assumed. They estimated a metallic sphere of uranium-235 with a radius of 2.1 centimetres (0.83 in) could suffice. This amount represented approximately 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of uranium-235. These results led to the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which was the initial step in the development of the nuclear arms programme in Britain. This...

High speed cameras allow researchers to see things that they would normally miss, from the beating wings of a hummingbird to how a boat cuts through water. Now researchers in Japan have developed what they believe is the world’s fastest camera, which can take 4.4 trillion images a second. The device uses a new technique to take high-speed images so it can capture chemical reactions and heat conduction, which were impossible to photograph before. Researchers in Japan have developed what they believe is the world’s fastest camera, which can take 4.4 trillion images a second. The large machine contains a pulse source, temporal and spatial mapping devices and an image sensor (illustrated) to take high resolution photographs at the rate of 4.4 trillion frames a second. The new camera uses a technique called motion-based femtophotography to capture movement. It visually maps the movement of an object over time in a ‘burst stream’ of timed photographs organised in the correct sequence, to show an object’s ‘time varying spatial profile’. The device claims to be 1,000 times faster than the previous ‘fastest’ camera, while still being able to produce high resolution images. The previous fastest cameras used a ‘pump-probe process’ where light is pumped at the object being photographed and then ‘probed’ for absorption by a laser, in order to collect vital data used to construct an image. Up until now, the fastest cameras used a ‘pump-probe process’, where light is pumped at the object being photographed and then probed for absorption by a laser, in order to collect vital data used to construct an image, Phys.org reported. But this technique relies on repetitive measurements to construct an image. Instead, the new camera uses a technique called motion-based femtophotography to capture movement. The camera visually maps the movement of an object over time in a ‘burst stream’ of timed photographs organised in the correct sequence, to show an object’s ‘time varying spatial profile,’ according to the journal Nature Photonics. It was developed by scientists at the University of Tokyo and Keio University in Japan. The new camera will make it possible for scientists to capture chemical reactions and heat conduction that occurs at a sixth of the speed of light. One day it could also be used in medicine and to gain new insights into the manufacturing of computer chips (pictured) including their tiny semiconductors. The device claims to be 1,000 times faster than the previous ‘fastest’ camera. It has high pixel resolution of 450 x 450 pixels to provide scientists with a lot of detail about the object they are photographing. The new camera is called Sequentially Timed All-optical Mapping Photography (Stamp) and will be used to capture chemical reactions and heat conduction that occurs at a sixth of the speed of light. It has taken three years to develop and the next step is make the device smaller, as it measures around three square feet (one square metre). The experts who developed the machine believe it could one day be used in medicine and to gain new insights into the manufacturing of semiconductors, for example. The computer chip components are tiny and by looking at detailed images of the manufacturing process, experts might be able to spot opportunities to make efficiencies. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Researchers in Japan have created a super fast camera that can take 4.4 trillion pictures in just one second! This amazing camera is a thousand times faster than the previous fastest camera. It can help scientists see things that happen really, really quickly, like chemical reactions and heat conduction.

Hypothesis: Vacationers enjoy a day at the beach. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","completion":"If the premise is true, we know that there is a line of people carrying luggage on the side of the road; however, we cannot directly conclude that the hypothesis is true from this premise alone. The hypothesis suggests that these vacationers are enjoying a day at the beach. There are several factors to consider and additional information needed before making such a conclusion. 1. Location: The first thing to consider is the location of this line of people. Are they close to a beach, or are they in an area where access to a beach is not feasible? Knowing their location would provide more context to accurately determine if they are indeed heading to the beach. 2. Type of luggage: Analyzing the type of luggage being carried by the people can offer some clues as to the nature of their destination. If the luggage mainly consists of beach-related items such as beach umbrellas, towels, swimming suits, and sunscreen, it might be more likely that they are indeed going to the beach. Conversely, if the luggage predominantly contains non-beach related items, then the hypothesis may not hold true. 3. Season and weather: Considering the time of year and the current weather conditions can also help inform the hypothesis. If it is the summer season and the weather is warm and sunny, it might be more likely that people would head to the beach for leisure. However, if it is a cold and rainy day, it seems less plausible for vacationers to be enjoying a day at the beach. 4. Alternative explanations: Beyond assessing the location, luggage type, and weather conditions, it is essential to consider other possible explanations for the line of people carrying luggage on the side of the road. They could be waiting for a bus, a taxi, or some form of transportation for a different destination altogether. Alternatively, they could be a part of a guided tour or participating in an organized outdoor event, which requires them to carry luggage. 5. Further investigation: To obtain a more substantiated conclusion, it would be helpful to gather more data through direct observation or questioning the individuals in the line. This could reveal insights about their planned activities for the day or their intended destination, further solidifying or refuting the hypothesis. In conclusion, we cannot confirm the hypothesis \\"Vacationers enjoy a day at the beach\\" based solely on the premise \\"A line of people carrying luggage on the side of the road.\\" While the premise might provide some hints about the situation, it does not offer complete certainty.

How many hair salons are there in the world? Pick from: A). no; B). yes; The answer is:","completion":"A). no; The two questions are different as they inquire about distinct aspects of the hair styling industry. Let's delve into the differences: 1. First question: \\"How many hair stylists are there in the US?\\" This question seeks a specific answer pertaining to the number of hair stylists in the United States. Hair stylists are professionals working in the hair care industry who provide various services like haircuts, styling, and color treatments. In the context of this question, the focus is on a single country—the United States—and the number of individuals working within the profession. 2. Second question: \\"How many hair salons are there in the world?\\" This question, on the other hand, asks for the number of hair salons across the entire globe. A hair salon is an establishment where hair stylists operate and various hair-related services are provided to clients. This question does not focus solely on the individuals working in the industry but rather on the physical places where their work is conducted. Additionally, the scope of the query is much broader, encompassing the entire world instead of just one country. Given the differences between the two questions in terms of scope and the particulars being inquired about, the answer to whether these questions are the same is: A). no"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Question: The person had no car, but needed to get somewhere, where should he go? Options: - carpark - hospital - building - garage - bus stop The answer is \\"bus stop\\" because Answer:","completion":"The answer is \\"bus stop\\" because a bus stop is the appropriate location for someone without a car who needs to get somewhere. A bus stop is a designated place where buses stop to pick up and drop off passengers. This allows the person to use public transportation to travel to their desired destination without needing their own car. Other options mentioned are not suitable for this purpose: - Carpark: A carpark is a place where people park their cars, and since the person has no car, this option does not help them with transportation. - Hospital: A hospital is a location for medical care and treatment, and while one can potentially find transportation options there, it is not a primary transportation hub and does not serve all destinations. - Building: A building is a very generic term and could refer to any structure. It does not provide any specific solution for the person's transportation needs. - Garage: A garage is a place generally utilized for parking, repairing or servicing vehicles. Since the person does not have a car, visiting a garage does not address their need for transportation to another location. Thus, among the options provided, a \\"bus stop\\" is the most suitable choice for a person without a car who needs to get somewhere.

A shopaholic The answer is:","completion":"Title: The Unraveling of Rebecca Bloomwood Genre: Romantic Comedy-Drama Plot: Rebecca Bloomwood (played by a popular actress) is a young, ambitious journalist with a secret: She's a shopaholic. Her love for designer clothes, extravagant shoes, and the latest accessories has left her with a daunting pile of credit card bills and debt, but she manages to hide it from everyone successful – including Alex (played by a charming actor), her attractive and hardworking colleague with whom she shares a love-hate relationship. The story begins with Rebecca struggling to maintain her glamorous designer-filled lifestyle and her job at a reputable financial magazine called \\"Successful Saving,\\" which is edited by Alistair West (played by a famous actor). She is asked to write a piece on the dangers of consumerism and the importance of budgeting. Despite being a shopaholic, Rebecca takes on this task, hoping to use her own experiences to give depth to the story and impress her boss. Rebecca attends Shopaholics Anonymous meetings for research purposes, where she meets various characters, each with their own unique addiction to shopping. However, those meetings slowly start making her reflect upon her habits, and she realizes that she needs to change. Her shopping addiction begins to unravel at the worst possible time when a rival journalist, Janet (played by a well-known actress), starts investigating a piece to expose the hypocrisy of \\"Successful Saving.\\" Janet stumbles upon Rebecca's debt problems and blackmails her: either get her insider information on Alistair West and the magazine, or she'll expose Rebecca's secret to the world. Caught between her loyalty to her job and the fear of being exposed, Rebecca reluctantly agrees to get Janet the information she wants. During this time, Rebecca gets closer to Alex as they work together on multiple projects. Their bond strengthens, and Alex share his own struggles with Rebecca, developing a romantic interest in her. However, as Rebecca becomes more entangled in the blackmail, she starts to realize the gravity of her actions and the consequences they would have on her colleagues and the magazine. Faced with her reality, she attends a Shopaholics Anonymous meeting and, for the first time, genuinely acknowledges her addiction and the problems it has caused. Guided by her newfound clarity and determination, Rebecca decides to come clean and confess her addiction and the blackmail to Alistair and Alex. To her surprise, she is met with understanding and support. Alistair gives her a second chance and agrees to help her with her addiction. Alex admires her courage and confesses his feelings for her, sealing their romantic bond. Together, with the support of their colleagues and members of Shopaholics Anonymous, they devise a plan to outsmart Janet. They succeed in protecting the magazine and expose Janet's unscrupulous reporting. The movie concludes with Rebecca learning how to balance her love for shopping with her newfound understanding of financial responsibility. She continues to work at the magazine, and with Alex's help, she writes a heartwarming and inspiring article on her own journey as a recovering shopaholic. \\"The Unraveling of Rebecca Bloomwood\\" is a touching romantic comedy-drama that explores self-discovery, the battle with addiction, and the importance of support from loved ones.

Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles. Takeaways: Middle managers are one step above one-celled organisms. They can, and will try to get you to do non-role work, with no intention of ever paying you more. They key is to cut it off at the pass. According to the above context, answer the following question.

Answer the following question: Given the following context: Other scholar-bureaucrats were wary of Wang's heterodoxy, the increasing number of his disciples while he was still in office, and his overall socially rebellious message. To curb his influence, he was often sent out to deal with military affairs and rebellions far away from the capital. Yet his ideas penetrated mainstream Chinese thought and spurred new interest in Taoism and Buddhism. Furthermore, people began to question the validity of the social hierarchy and the idea that the scholar should be above the farmer. Wang Yangming's disciple and salt-mine worker Wang Gen gave lectures to commoners about pursuing education to improve their lives, while his follower He Xinyin (何心隱) challenged the elevation and emphasis of the family in Chinese society. His contemporary Li Zhi even taught that women were the intellectual equals of men and should be given a better education; both Li and He eventually died in prison, jailed on charges of spreading \\"dangerous ideas\\". Yet these \\"dangerous ideas\\" of educating women had long been embraced by some mothers and by courtesans who were as literate and skillful in calligraphy, painting, and poetry as their male guests.The liberal views of Wang Yangming were opposed by the Censorate and by the Donglin Academy, re-established in 1604. These conservatives wanted a revival of orthodox Confucian ethics. Conservatives such as Gu Xiancheng (1550–1612) argued against Wang's idea of innate moral knowledge, stating that this was simply a legitimization for unscrupulous behavior such as greedy pursuits and personal gain. These two strands of Confucian thought, hardened by Chinese scholars' notions of obligation towards their mentors, developed into pervasive factionalism among the ministers of state, who used any opportunity to impeach members of the other faction from court. answer the following question: What were the full names of the two people who died in prison? Answer:","completion":"The full names of the two people who died in prison were Li Zhi (李贄) and He Xinyin (何心隱).

For professors who use pre-made quizzes from their \\"instructor's edition\\" textbooks, purchase a copy. Find the correct edition of the book online and buy it. Before a quiz memorise the answers to the questions. This method is good for entry level science, foreign language and/or history classes that pull their quizzes straight from the book. This can be done by talking to an old student or by talking to other students who might have connections in the class. Study straight from the exam, or if you suspect that the exam will be the same, study the answers straight. If you know a professor or teacher will let you come back to finish a test, purposefully don't finish the exam and ask to come back on a later date. Make sure to memorise the topics or questions so that you can look up the answers before finishing the test later. Claim to be sick, go to thee bathroom towards the end of the exam until its over. Or pace yourself slowly. Be sure that your professor will let you come back before using this method as you could actually do worse if he/she doesn't let you finish. As you turn in your exam, if your professor isn't at her/his desk, use a pencil you brought up with you to change or write in answers from the test at the top of the pile. (This is a high risk!) Keep in mind that some classrooms have cameras. Avoid this if the one you are in does have a camera, because if that is the case, it’s much riskier.

Passage:The name \\"Lord Haw-Haw of Zeesen\\" was coined in 1939 by the pseudonymous Daily Express radio critic Jonah Barrington, but this referred initially to Wolf Mittler (or possibly Norman Baillie-Stewart). When Joyce became the best-known propaganda broadcaster, the nickname was transferred to him. Joyce's broadcasts initially came from studios in Berlin, later transferring (because of heavy Allied bombing) to Luxembourg and finally to Apen near Hamburg, and were relayed over a network of German-controlled radio stations that included Hamburg, Bremen, Luxembourg, Hilversum, Calais, Oslo, and Zeesen. Joyce also broadcast on and wrote scripts for the German Büro Concordia organisation, which ran several black propaganda stations, many of which pretended to broadcast illegally from within Britain. His role in writing the scripts increased over time, and the German radio capitalized on his public persona. Initially an anonymous broadcaster, Joyce eventually revealed his real name to his listeners; and he would occasionally be announced as \\"William Joyce, otherwise known as Lord Haw-Haw\\". Urban legends soon circulated about Lord Haw-Haw, alleging that the broadcaster was well-informed about political and military events to the point of near-omniscience. Links: a. Radio Luxembourg b.

Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy.

The film has a perfect opportunity for laughs, but surprisingly wanders aimlessly as we see a bizarre collection of characters such a woman who sold her soul to the devil and can shoot out flames of fire from her mouth, a man who appears to be a vampire, and a lunatic killer dressed as a woman and wears sacks over his head. You have the class president who believes he's the best thing since sliced bread(but as we see in the film, he's a coward and joke), a couple of pot smokers who don't even know they are at their own class reunion, and a man named Gary for whom know one even knew existed(and no one can seem to remember his name..this is the one running joke I enjoyed). There is a plump pervert who likes to grab women in inappropriate places, a deaf and blind woman who has a screeching holler when calling for her dog, and the cook(you know her from \\"goonies\\" and \\"Throw Mama From The Train\\")who loves to place food on people's plates with her hands! The film is essentially about a nutcase who is(or at least attempting to)taking revenge on his classmates for a gag they pulled on him(they arranged for him to sleep with his own twin sister!). The film follows the characters as they search for the killer canvasing darkened, trashed hallways of the old high school. They were told of the killer by his psychologist who seems a bit odd himself. The film has a few good gags that work(pretty much early on), but the film slowly gets worse each passing minute. The film's true problem is that it really doesn't know where to go. The film is pretty much a one-joke premise for it has unassured direction..if it really has any direction at all.

The drivers who have had the privilege of driving the prestigious number 1 car in NASCAR's history are numerous, and include plenty of talented individuals. It's important to keep in mind, however, that the drivers of the number 1 car can change frequently due to sponsorships, contractual obligations, team changes, or retirements. Let's look at a few of the notable drivers who've been behind the wheel of the number 1 car in chronological order: 1. **Bob Welborn**: Bob Welborn, mainly known for his success in convertibles, drove the number 1 car in the late 1950s. 2. **Billy Wade**: Another known driver of the car in the sixties was Billy Wade, who won 4 consecutive races. 3. **Donnie Allison**: Allison drove the number 1 car in the late sixties to early seventies. 4. **Martin Truex Jr.**: The early 2000s saw Martin Truex Jr. driving the number 1 car. He even won the NASCAR Xfinity Series Championship twice in 2004 and 2005. 5. **Jamie McMurray**: After Truex, Jamie McMurray took over the number 1 car and drove it for Chip Ganassi Racing from 2010 to 2018. 6. **Kurt Busch**: The number 1 car was driven by Kurt Busch from 2019 to 2020. He competes full-time in the NASCAR Cup Series for Chip Ganassi Racing. Kurt Busch even managed to bring victories for the team while driving the number 1 car. 7. **Ross Chastain**: Most recently, the number 1 car was taken over in 2021 by Ross Chastain, who previously raced in number 42. It's an intriguing piece of motorsports history to see how the number 1 car has passed through various teams and drivers throughout the years. Unfortunately, detailing the drivers of all the NASCAR cars is beyond the scope of this response, but I hope this gives some insight into some of the main drivers of the number 1 car in NASCAR. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, it's advisable to see the current team listings on the official NASCAR website. Please note that the information will change from season to season and sometimes even during a season, as drivers can change teams or be replaced due to injuries or other factors. NASCAR itself is a world full of ever-changing dynamics, and the legacy of the number 1 car is just one fascinating storyline among many in the sport."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a \\"a).\\" movie review (Possible answers: a). negative. b). positive.).","completion":"a). Negative Movie Review: \\"The Hyped Disappointment\\" As a movie buff, I usually look forward to new releases with an earnest anticipation. So when \\"The Hyped Disappointment\\" hit the theaters after a massive marketing campaign, I was eager to see what all the fuss was about. Sadly, I soon discovered that the movie was a prime example of how even a star-studded cast and an experienced director can't save a film with a mediocre script and problematic plotlines. Starting off with the storyline, \\"The Hyped Disappointment\\" offers a promising premise, highlighting the action-packed adventures of a group of unlikely heroes who are thrown together to save the world from an imminent, otherworldly threat. However, the writers and director severely underdelivered, leaving us with a jumbled mess of half-baked plotlines that don't build on each other and fail to make any discernible sense. The pacing of the film further derails the watching experience. Character introductions are rushed and unsatisfying, and the pacing rarely pauses for breath or for any non-action scenes. The climax of the film is reached so abruptly that it feels unnatural, like the writers were trying to force a resolution in a lackluster fashion. Unfortunately, this pacing issue hinders any character development, so we never feel invested in the heroes or their motives throughout the film, leaving us indifferent to their struggles and victories. Moreover, \\"The Hyped Disappointment\\" just can't seem to find its voice as it is riddled with comedy that falls flat, dramatic scenes that make us cringe, and action sequences that come off as uninspired. This leads to an odd blend of genre elements colliding in an unpleasant way, making viewers question the genre this film was trying to inhabit. A film's cast can make or break its success, and while this movie features a bevy of talented actors and actresses, it failed to make good use of their skills. Lackluster performances, perhaps stemming from an uninspired script, rendered characters one dimensional and dull. It appeared as if the actors, too, were disappointed with the material they were given, making it even more challenging for the audience to engage with the story. Additionally, the heavy-handed use of CGI in \\"The Hyped Disappointment\\" lent the movie an artificial feel, detracting from its visual appeal. Although it is evident that the production team invested significantly in special effects, their overuse diminished the value of practical effects and overshadowed the human elements of the story. In conclusion, \\"The Hyped Disappointment\\" falls short of expectations in almost every respect, with a weak script, poor pacing, an inconsistent tone, and a squandered cast. With so much potential, it's a genuine shame that this film turned out to be yet another costly misfire for both the fans and the production team. This lackluster offering is one to be missed, and one can only hope that the creators will learn from their mistakes and return to the drawing board for any future attempts in a similar vein."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: I watched the DVD (called BLACK WIDOW in the U.S.A.) and felt afterward that it was, indeed, a truly awful movie.

It's convenient: three or four words per exchange. It takes cleverness, concentration and quick fingers. And it requires very simple language. There's neither time nor space for explanations. Why waste valuable time telling six friends you have to leave for a moment to take care of your little brother when BRB (=\\"be\\" right back) will do? Want to enter a conversation?

Title: House of Wax Movie plot: The movie opens with title and credits over the streets of turn of the century New York City at night in the pouring rain. A solitary figure walks down the street holding an umbrella. We enter the Wax Museum with various tableaux of crimes of the past, and then enter the workshop where Prof. Henry Jarrod (Vincent Price) is working on a sculpture. His business partner, Matthew Burke (Roy Roberts) enters and walks partially upstairs when he is hailed by Jarrod. He tells Jarrod he's there to study the account books. They have a philosophical difference between their approaches to business. Jarrod proposes a buyout arrangement, and Burke either eager or desperate for the money agrees in principle. A potential investor is scheduled to see Jarrod that very evening.Bruce Allison (Phillip Tonge) and Sidney Wallace (Paul Cavanagh) arrive and are given a brief tour of the wax museum. Wallace is impressed, but Jarrod explains that he's never satisfied with certain aspects of the finished products. Wallace explains he's going to Egypt for three months, so no decision on investment can take place prior to his return. Allison and Wallace depart. Burke was eavesdropping from the upstairs room and heard everything. He is impatient for a financial settlement and proposes an insurance fire. The place is insured for 25,000--12,500 each. Jarrod is horrified by the proposal, and opposes it categorically. Burke lights the Marie Antoinette wax figure's dress with a match. It starts a fire that Jarrod quickly extinguishes. Burke starts a few more fires, with Jarrod quickly working to save his wax figures. Burke and Jarrod fight, and at one point Jarrod is knocked out. Burke douses the workroom and display area with a flammable liquid and turns on the gas light spigots. He goes upstairs as the place begins to catch fire. He returns to the workroom and continues his fight with the now revived Jarrod. Jarrod works desperately with buckets of water to douse the fire, but it is a losing battle.

They argue about the Bible but support each other during difficult times. Step 2: Identify possible reasons for contradictions Let's examine some possible reasons for why these contradictions may occur: 1. Diverse perspectives: People come from different backgrounds and have their own views, experiences, and beliefs, which can lead to different interpretations of the same text. 2. Human nature: It's a part of human nature to have some level of inconsistency in beliefs and actions. Often, people may not be aware of the contradictions in their views and actions. 3. Emphasizing personal opinions: Some people may prioritize their own opinions and experiences over official teachings of the church, leading to contradictions. 4. Lack of clear guidance on certain topics: The Bible can sometimes be vague or open to interpretation on certain issues, making it difficult for people to reach a consensus. Step 3: Formulate a concise answer Based on the analysis of the reasons mentioned above, we can now answer the question: The congregation at the church events experiences contradictions due to diverse perspectives, human nature, strong personal opinions, and, at times, the lack of clear guidance on certain topics in the Bible. People may hold different beliefs and interpretations based on their backgrounds and experiences, and this can create contradictions among the attendees.

Options: + negative. + positive.Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible .","completion":"The following phrase can be considered as predominantly negative due to a combination of various factors. Let's analyze the different elements that support this interpretation: 1. \\"trying to make head or tail of the story\\": This part of the phrase suggests that the story is difficult to understand or decipher, which is usually interpreted as a negative aspect. When something is described as challenging to make sense of, it implies that the person expressing this view does not find the content easily accessible or enjoyable. 2. \\"in the hip-hop indie snipes\\": This phrase references the context of the story, and mentioning \\"snipes\\" has a negative connotation because it suggests that there are conflicts or tensions within the hip-hop indie scene. Although this part does not directly express a positive or negative view, it provides a background for the overall negative perspective. 3. \\"is enough to give you brain strain\\": This segment explicitly conveys a negative sentiment. By stating that trying to comprehend the story causes \\"brain strain,\\" the speaker implies that the effort required to understand the narrative is so significant that it may lead to mental discomfort or exhaustion. This part is a strong indicator that the phrase should be considered negative. 4. \\"and the pay-off is negligible\\": This final part of the phrase is also negative in nature, as it conveys that the outcome or reward obtained from trying to understand the story is minimal or insignificant. In other words, the speaker believes that the effort put into making sense of the content is not worth the eventual outcome, highlighting a sense of disappointment or dissatisfaction. In summary, the phrase should be considered negative due to the presence of various elements that express disappointment, difficulty, and dissatisfaction with the story in question. Although there is a mention of the context, it does not significantly impact the overall negative sentiment expressed in the phrase."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"No, these two questions are asking about different things, but they are related in terms of economics. Let me explain it to you in a simpler way. Imagine you have a candy shop. If you have lots of candies (lots of goods in the economy), but not a lot of people buying it (not enough demand), you might lower the price to sell more candies. This is like unemployment: if there are a lot of workers but not enough jobs, then there will be more people unemployed. On the other hand, inflation is like if you decided to print more candy money that kids use to buy candies. If now there's more candy money around but the same amount of candy, each candy's price will go up. This is like inflation: if there's more money in the economy but the same amount of goods, then prices in general will go up. As for the second question, debt is like if you borrow candy from someone promising to pay them back more later. If there's inflation (if candies' prices go up), then the extra candy you have to give back won't be as big a deal. But if there's deflation (candies' prices go down), that extra candy might be harder to get. So, although these two questions are asking about two different topics (inflation & unemployment, and inflation & debt), they are both related because they discuss how inflation impacts different aspects of our economy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I don't want to do a presumed death because I don't want the story that follows to be all about Ridge. This will be a Brooke story. Ridge is a pivotal part of the show and he will be back in a matter of time...and probably not all that much time. I will continue writing for the character. I'm looking at this in two phases, really. There will be a period of time without Ridge, which is where some new, interesting avenues for Brooke will come into play. But at some point it will be necessary for Ridge to return to the show. Who will be playing the role at that point remains to be seen.\\" EW broke the news last week that Moss has decided to leave CBS soap that he's been on since its 1987 debut. He said this on his Facebook page: \\"I want to make sure, without any doubt, that you guys all know how much I love you. Your support during this time and hopefully beyond is everything.

He's not a secret agent, his job is to read, and he and his co-workers at the American Literary Historical Society read everything; books, comics, magazines, and they scan everything into a database to be cross-checked against real CIA operations. On a rainy December morning it's business as usual, so no one notices the non-descript man sitting in plain sedan across the street from Joe's building, checking off names of every employee as they enter.Inside, Joe looks for an answer to a letter he'd sent to the main CIA office at Langley. He has a theory about connections he's noticed between operations in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and other locations around the world, but so far there's no response. Noon approaches, and it's his turn to go out for lunch. Since it's still raining, he ducks out the basement door (which is against regulations) and cuts through several back alleys to the deli. Meanwhile, the sedan out front quietly pulls away after signaling to 3 men (one is a mailman) waiting in the street. They move in with quiet determination and knock on the front door. The mailman stands in view of the camera while the other two wait behind him.At the deli around the block, Joe picks up lunch for the others and then runs back. Since the rain has stopped, he goes to the front door, and buzzes the security intercom to be let in, but gets no answer. Pushing on the door, he finds it is unlocked, which it never is. Inside he finds a scene of carnage. Everyone has been murdered, shot to death in the few minutes he has been gone. Fighting down his shock and horror, he grabs a pistol from the receptionist's desk and flees.Suddenly, everyone on the street looks suspicious, and Joe realizes that whoever killed his coworkers is probably still looking for him.

Rick Snyder, left, fills jugs with filtered Flint, Mich., tap water alongside Cheryl Hill at Hill's house where he drank his first glass of the local water Monday, April 18, 2016, on the... (Associated Press) LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder will drink Flint water at home and at work for at least a month to show to residents it is safe with the use of a faucet filter, he said Monday. The Republican governor, who has apologized for his administration's role in the city's lead-tainted water crisis, visited a house owned by Cheryl Hill and Todd Canty that was confirmed to have high levels of lead. Snyder, who left with five gallons of filtered water, said he understands people feel that if officials say the water is OK, then he should drink it, too. \\"What better way to help show support,\\" said Snyder, who will get refills from other homes as needed. Hill and Canty told The Flint Journal that they appreciate the governor's visit but still have a lead service line running to their home and don't know if and when it will be replaced. \\"I wouldn't want to be in his position right now,\\" Canty said. \\"I believe this is just one of those cases where personally he just has a lot of work to do.\\" For nearly 18 months, Flint residents drank and bathed with improperly treated water that had coursed through aging pipes and fixtures, scraping away lead. By the time Snyder announced in October that Flint would return to its earlier source of treated water, the Detroit municipal system, dangerously high levels of the toxic metal were detected in the blood of some residents, including children, for whom it can cause lower IQs and behavioral problems. On Monday, Snyder again urged residents to drink the water as long as a filter is in place. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, however, says bottled water is safest for children under age 6 and pregnant or breastfeeding women. Meanwhile, a state water-quality official who told the city of Flint that a chemical wasn't needed to prevent lead corrosion from pipes has taken a different job in the state Department of Environmental Quality. Mike Prysby, who was a district engineer with the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance and had been responsible for Genesee County, home to Flint, began working in the Water Resources Division's Transportation and Flood Hazard Unit on March 28. That was the day before a supervisor at Flint's water plant, Mike Glasgow, testified at a legislative hearing that Prysby told him before Flint switched to a local river for water in 2014 that phosphate wasn't required. DEQ spokeswoman Melanie Brown said Prysby took a position that opened up when someone was promoted, and his switch was not a forced transfer. \\"The department continues to cooperate with internal investigations regarding staff actions in Flint,\\" she told The Associated Press in an email. A message seeking comment was left Monday for Prysby, who has declined previous requests for an interview. Snyder has blamed \\"career bureaucrats\\" in state and federal governments. A task force appointed by Snyder has said the DEQ was the primary culprit because regulators misinterpreted a federal rule in telling Flint water officials not to treat the Flint River for corrosion until after two six-month monitoring periods. The DEQ's director and communications director resigned in December. Snyder fired the department's top drinking water official, and a district supervisor is on paid leave after being suspended five days without pay in January for actions related to the Flint crisis — the maximum allowed under civil service rules. ___ Follow David Eggert at http://twitter.com/DavidEggert00 .

I do that in many cases.\\" The home still has a lead service line. Homeowners Cheryl Hill and Todd Canty said they appreciate the governor's visit but they are still looking for solutions. \\"I wouldn't want to be in his position right now,\\" Canty said. \\"I believe this is just one of those cases where personally he just has a lot of work to do.\\" Their home still has a lead service line and there are no details on if and when the line will be replaced. \\"It all happened now let's just fix it,\\" Hill said. \\"There's no reason to get so angry at everybody over this.

Write a question about the following article: The Bolshevik forces reached the Lithuanian territory on July 7, 1920, and continued to push the Polish troops. The Lithuanian Army moved to secure territories abandoned by the retreating Polish forces. They took Turmantas on July 7, Tauragnai and Alanta on July 9, Širvintos and Musninkai on July 10, Kernavė, Molėtai, and Giedraičiai on July 11, Maišiagala and Pabradė on July 13. On July 13 the Polish command decided to transfer Vilnius to the Lithuanians in accordance with the resolution of the Spa Conference. Lithuanians moved in, but their trains were stopped by Polish soldiers near Kazimieriškės. This delay meant that the Bolsheviks were the first to enter Vilnius on July 14. By the time first Lithuanian troops entered the city on July 15, it was already secured by the Soviets. Poland sought to have Russians in the city as it would create much less complications when Polish Army counterattacked. Despite the Peace Treaty, the Soviets did not intend to transfer the city to the Lithuanians. Indeed, there were indications that the Soviets planned a coup against the Lithuanian government in hopes to re-establish the Lithuanian SSR. Despite the setback in Vilnius, the Lithuanians continued to secure territories in the Suwałki Region. They took Druskininkai on July 17, Vištytis, Punsk, Giby, and Sejny on July 19, Suwałki on July 29, Augustów on August 8.

Review: in this dreary mess Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","completion":"The movie review sentence, \\"in this dreary mess,\\" can be understood as negative. The choice of words used to describe the movie evoke an unfavorable impression. The adjective \\"dreary\\" means dull, bleak, or lacking in excitement. Using this word to describe a movie suggests that the film was uninteresting, unappealing, or monotonous. It could imply a lack of engaging content, poor pacing, or unimpressive visual and audio components. The word \\"mess\\" in this context typically refers to a situation, event, or in this case, a movie that is disorderly, chaotic, and disorganized. This word further emphasizes that the film failed to present a cohesive and coherent narrative, potentially leaving the audience confused or frustrated. By describing the movie as a \\"mess,\\" the reviewer could be saying that its storyline, structure, character arcs, and production quality were subpar or haphazardly thrown together. Both of these words used together further reinforce the negative tone of the review, implying that the experience of watching the movie was not only dull and disheartening but also marred by disorder and lack of clarity. This tells the reader to expect an unsatisfactory and disappointing film experience if they were to watch it. Of course, it is important to keep in mind that individual opinions about movies can vary widely, and what one reviewer perceives as a \\"dreary mess\\" might be seen as an intentional artistic choice by another viewer.

After the terrible car accident, his whole world had been completely dark and quiet for almost ten years. The loss of sight and hearing made him try many times to put end to his life. His family especially his wife did their best to tend and comfort him. By and by he finally regained the courage to live on. On a hot summer afternoon he was taking a walk with a stick near his house when a thunderstorm started suddenly. He stood under a large tree in order not to get himself wet. Unfortunately he was struck down to the ground by a lightning. The witnesses thought him dead but he woke up some 20 minutes later lying face down in muddy water below the tree. He felt that he was trembling badly, but when he opened his eyes ,he didn't dare to believe that he saw a plough( )lying near the wall. When Mrs Edwards came running up to him, she shouted their neighbours for help. And he saw her and heard her voice for the first time in nearly ten years. The news of Robert's regaining his sight and hearing quickly spread in his area. And many doctors came to prove the truth of the news. Most of them said that he gained sight and hearing again obviously from the knock of lightning; none of them could give convincing reasons, however. The only reasonable explanation given by one doctor was that, since Edwards lost his sight and hearing as a result of sudden shock in a terrible accident, perhaps the only way for them to regain was by another sudden shock.

Kuten tiedämme, unionin jäsenvaltioiden väliset erimielisyydet ovat joskus haitanneet kykyämme toimia tehokkaasti ja yhtenäisenä kansainvälisellä näyttämöllä ja kehittää johdonmukaista ja vahvaa Euroopan unionia, joka pystyy puolustamaan etujaan ja perusarvojaan maailmassa. Toiseksi, vaikka me vihreät kannatamme voimakkaasti monenvälisyyttä ja rauhanomaisen konfliktinratkaisun periaatteita, emme voi olla näkemättä joitakin niistä haasteista ja uhkista, joihin Eurooppa kohtaa nykyisessä kansainvälisessä tilanteessa. Näitä ovat esimerkiksi terrorismin, joukkotuhoaseiden leviämisen, kyberhyökkäysten, hybridiuhkien ja laittoman siirtolaisuuden aiheuttamat turvallisuusriskit. Siksi kehotamme EU:ta ja jäsenvaltioita lisäämään yhteistyötään näiden haasteiden kohtaamiseksi tehokkaan yhteisen ulko- ja turvallisuuspolitiikan puitteissa. Kolmanneksi uskomme, että EU:n ulko- ja turvallisuuspolitiikassa tulisi olla vankempi ihmisoikeuksia ja demokratiaa edistävä ulottuvuus. Tämä tarkoittaa, että meidän tulisi tukea aktiivisesti kansalaisyhteiskuntaa, ihmisoikeuspuolustajia ja demokraattista oppositiota niissä maissa, joissa niiden tilaa ja toimintaa rajoitetaan ja jopa vainotaan. Neljänneksi, haluaisimme korostaa tarvetta uudistaa EU:n turvallisuus- ja puolustusarkkitehtuuria sekä tehostaa unionin yhteistyötä Naton ja muiden kumppaneiden kanssa. Tässä yhteydessä tuemme EU:n pyrkimyksiä kehittää yhteismarkkinoita ja -toimintaa puolustusalalla sekä parantaa sotilaallisia kyvykkyyksiä ja valmiuksia. Lopuksi meidän on mielestämme tarpeen päivittää EU:n globaali strategia ja tarkistaa unionin strategiset painopisteet ottaen huomioon muuttuvan maailmanjärjestyksen ja Venäjän palauttamisen kulmakivet, Kiinan nousu, Yhdysvaltain kääntyminen sisäänpäin sekä uudet teknologiset haasteet ja ympäristöön liittyvät kysymykset, kuten ilmastonmuutos ja biologinen monimuotoisuuden heikkeneminen. Tämä edellyttää aiempaa rohkeampaa ja yhtenäisempää eurooppalaista toimintaa sekä parempaa ja kestävämpää liittoutumista ja kumppanuuksia kansainvälisten toimijoiden kanssa. Arvoisa puhemies, edellä mainituista syistä osoitamme kriittisyytemme ja toivomme, että nämä kysymykset otetaan huomioon EU:n ulko- ja turvallisuuspolitiikassa tulevina vuosina."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Article: Make sure you do not walk faster than your customers. Walk slightly ahead of them, carrying menus and silverware to the table where you want them to sit. Ask if the table is okay before the customers sit down. Most customers expect to wait at least 10 minutes to be seated at a restaurant, especially if they didn’t have a reservation. If your guests have waited much longer than that, offer a sincere apology as you show them to their table. Ask management if it’s okay to comp them a free drink or appetizer (but don’t offer it to the guests until you get permission). If the restaurant is slow, try to seat guests at a table that’s not directly next to another full table. Of course, if the restaurant is very busy, guests will have to sit near other diners, but try to make sure all of your guests have enough space to be comfortable. By seating guests in rotating sections, you’ll help ensure that all of your servers are able to make money for the night. Rotating stations will also help keep servers from becoming overwhelmed by getting several tables at the same time. You never want to throw all of the menus down on a table, as this seems rude and dismissive. Instead, carefully lay a menu and silverware at each place setting, and make sure your guests are seated before you leave the table. Be prepared to get water or other small items for guests. If they request more than that, politely let them know that their server will be right with them. You’re the last person guests will have contact with, so offer a friendly farewell to guests as they walk out the door. This will help them leave feeling like they had a pleasant dining experience.

The baby liked playing with the rattle more than playing with the ball because the","completion":"sound it produced was enchanting to his little ears. The bright colors of the rattle also seemed to interest him more than the plain blue ball that lay forgotten in the corner of the playpen. His eyes sparkled with joy as he shook the rattle, listening intently to the sound it produced, creating a symphony that only he could fully appreciate. One day, as the baby sat on the carpet, shaking his beloved rattle, a tiny beam of sunlight streamed in from a small crack in the curtains. The light reflected off the rattle, casting an array of colors across the room. The baby, completely captivated by the dazzling sight, stopped shaking the rattle for a moment. He then tilted it from side to side, watching as the colors danced along the walls and ceiling. His mother, Ella, stood in the doorway with a smile as she watched her little one play. Her heart swelled with love and pride as she saw him discovering the world around him. The simple joys of a child, Ella thought, had a certain magic to them that rejuvenated even the most tired and weary soul. As the baby continued to play with the rattle and the sunlight, he suddenly noticed something peculiar. The sound of the rattle seemed to change, to take on a different quality. It was as if each shake of the rattle was forming a pattern of sound, an intricate melody that he had never heard before. The baby was fascinated by this development and began to shake the rattle even more intently, experimenting with different speeds and movements to see what sounds he could create. As he continued, he noticed that every time he created a unique melody, the colorful patterns produced by the sunlight changed too, almost as if they were responding to the music. Intrigued and delighted, he continued to play, creating an ever-changing display of colors and sounds that filled the room with a sense of wonder. As Ella watched, she couldn't help but feel amazed at the incredible luck of having such a curious and imaginative child. She had always believed that the key to a fulfilling life was to never lose one's sense of wonder and curiosity, and seeing her baby explore new combinations of sounds and lights with his simple rattle filled her with an indescribable sense of happiness. The baby's father, Jack, joined Ella in the doorway and wrapped his arms around her. Together, they watched their little one play, completely absorbed in his world of color and sound. Jack whispered into Ella's ear, \\"We made that. We created that incredible little person.\\" Ella nodded, tears welling up in her eyes as she felt the enormity of the responsibility and the love they had for their child. They both knew that their lives had changed forever the moment their baby was born, and every day since had been a new adventure filled with joy, laughter, and learning. As the sunlight slowly began to fade, the vibrant colors on the walls receded, and the once enchanting melody returned to its original simple sound. The baby eventually grew tired and let the rattle fall onto the carpet with a gentle thud. His eyes fluttered shut, and he drifted off to sleep, his mind filled with beautiful dreams of the colorful symphony he had created. Ella and Jack carefully lifted their precious baby, placing him in his crib and pulling up the soft, warm blanket. As they tiptoed out of the room, the only sound remaining was the gentle rhythm of their baby's breath. And they knew that, no matter what challenges life may bring, they would be there to guide and nurture the limitless potential that lay within their child, cultivating his curiosity and love for the world around him. And who knows what other magical adventures the baby would create when playing with his rattle and the sunlight? Only time would tell, but one thing was certain: they would be there to watch and marvel at each of those wonderful moments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"In the 2016 live-action adaptation of \\"The Jungle Book,\\" the song \\"I Wanna Be Like You\\" is performed by Christopher Walken, who voices the character King Louie. This iconic song was originally written by Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman for the 1967 animated film by Disney. The 2016 version of the song maintains the classic jazz elements and upbeat rhythm while adding a few modern twists. In this contemporary adaptation directed by Jon Favreau, King Louie is portrayed as a gigantic Gigantopithecus, an extinct species of great ape, instead of an orangutan as in the original animated film. The song \\"I Wanna Be Like You\\" is featured during the scene where King Louie tries to convince Mowgli, the human boy raised by wolves, to give him the secret of the 'red flower' (fire). King Louie believes that by obtaining the power of fire, he can become more human-like and establish his rule in the jungle. He sings this song to express his desire to be like Mowgli and harness the power that humans possess. Walken's performance adds an extra layer of depth to King Louie's character, showcasing both his ambition and charisma. The 2016 adaptation of \\"The Jungle Book\\" features a star-studded cast, including Neel Sethi as Mowgli, and voice talents such as Bill Murray as Baloo, Ben Kingsley as Bagheera, Idris Elba as Shere Khan, Lupita Nyong'o as Raksha, and Scarlett Johansson as Kaa. The movie seamlessly blends live-action with advanced CGI technology to create a visually stunning and immersive experience for its audience.

Scoop its entire body up in your hand in a single movement. When you’re holding the dragon, make sure to support its full body, including legs and tail. If you pick a dragon up suddenly from the rear, it may mistake your hand for a predator and bite you. Never pick a dragon up by its tail. Unlike other lizards, their tails do not regenerate. You could cause serious harm to your lizard by grabbing it by its tail. If your dragon becomes aggressive and tries to bite you once you have picked it up, hold its body firmly with one hand (so its jaws can’t reach your fingers) and use your other hand to stroke its back. This will soothe the dragon and teach it that human contact is not a cause for fear. If the dragon continues to act aggressively—or becomes even more aggressive—set it back in its cage. Wait 5 minutes, and pick the dragon up again. Be careful, however, as this effectively \\"rewards\\" the dragon for acting aggressively. If possible, it's better to hold the dragon until it calms down and then replace it in the cage so that it learns that calm behavior will help it get what it wants. Aggressive dragons take longer to train, but don’t give up hope. Given enough time, they’ll get used to being touched and handled. Frequent human contact is the best way for a bearded dragon to learn that you are not a threat. Hold and handle your dragon daily, for about 10 minutes at a time, and it will become increasingly tame and comfortable with your presence. Dragons will become stressed if they’re handled for long periods of time. It’s better to have multiple, short handling sessions each day rather than a single, long session. Once your dragon has become accustomed to being touched and handled by you, you can train it to eat out of your hand. Simply hold a mealworm between two fingers and extend it near the dragon’s mouth. If your dragon is very comfortable with being handled out of its cage, you can hold a mealworm in your palm and let the dragon eat out of your hand. Prior to this point, you’ll need to feed your dragon in its cage using tweezers. Use the tweezers to drop mealworms down near your dragon. Summary:","completion":"When picking up a bearded dragon, move your hand slowly and support its whole body. Don't grab its tail or scare it. If it tries to bite you, hold it firmly and gently stroke its back to calm it down. Practice holding the dragon for 10 minutes each day to help it get used to you. Once it's comfortable, you can teach it to eat from your hand. Remember not to handle it for too long, and use tweezers to feed it before it's ready to eat from your hand."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: When Jane put out the idea of homeschooling to her parents, the first reaction they gave was, \\"You are cutting the child off the world.'' \\"Did the child really get cut off or did the child socialize better?\\" The moment we hear of homeschooling, we think the child will have no opportunities to interact with peers. However, in my friend's opinion, we forget that when attending a regular school, the child is not into socializing all the while. The child is restricted to so many other activities. Studies take a major role in a child's life. The child hardly has the time to interact at school. The child might be meeting and studying along with many peers; however, how many kids interact with all the kids in a class? But in homeschooling system, as my friend mentioned, the kid has all the time and can plan his day accordingly. During the day the child studies just like other school-going kids but with no burden of homework and project work, the child has so much free time in the evening as to effectively interact and play with peers. The quality time the child spends in education is really impressive. Homeschooled kids have the opportunity to socialize more often as they have a lot of time in their hands. They can also make socializing a regular habit. Just as my friend said, her child goes to a neighboring park almost every day and has a set of friends who go there daily. Other children get back home to finish off homework and project work whereas her child who is already through with studies gets the opportunity to spend time with family members. When I heard this, I really felt how lucky the child was. Definitely the child had a better opportunity to socialize when compared with my kid. However, I might not consider homeschooling for my kid, as I am so used to the conventional schooling system and feel regular schooling the safest bet.

Add the oil to a room temperature skillet and place on the stove. Heat the oil over medium-high heat for a minute or two. Pick from: -- Stir the oil frequently until it begins to brown and become very moist. The oil should be steadily sizzling and bubbling. -- Let it remain near the heat until the oil is both heated and a translucent film forms. Alternatively, you can use non-stick skillet. -- This should keep the oil from burning throughout your rice. Using a large skillet can cause the oil to sizzle. -- The oil should be glossy and smooth, but it should not smoke at any point during the cooking process. If the oil begins to smoke, it means that the fat has begun to break down, which, in turn, means that the flavor will be thrown off.","completion":"Next, proceed with the following steps to finish making chipotle rice: 1. Prepare your ingredients: Before you start, make sure you have all the necessary ingredients handy. You'll need the following: long-grain white rice, water, chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, garlic, onion, salt, and optional ingredients like cilantro, lime juice, and frozen vegetables. 2. Rinse and drain the rice: Place the rice in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse it under cold, running water until the water runs clear. This step helps remove excess starch, which can make the cooked rice sticky. Drain the rice well to prevent adding extra moisture to the skillet. 3. Sauté the onion and garlic: Once the oil is heated and glossy, add the diced onion to the skillet. Cook the onion until it starts to soften and become translucent, about 3-4 minutes. Then, add the minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds, stirring continuously to prevent burning. 4. Add the rice and chipotle peppers: Add the rinsed and drained rice to the skillet, stirring it to coat the grains evenly with the oil, onion, and garlic mixture. Allow the rice to cook for a minute or two to toast, giving it an aromatic, nutty flavor. Then, add the chipotle peppers and adobo sauce, stirring to distribute them throughout the rice. 5. Add water and salt: Carefully pour in the measured water, ensuring that all the rice is submerged. Add salt to taste (about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon, or as desired) and stir gently. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet with a tight-fitting lid, and let the rice simmer gently. 6. Cook the rice: Allow the rice to cook undisturbed for about 15-20 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed, and the rice is tender yet firm. Do not lift the lid or stir the rice during this time, as this can disrupt the steaming process and cause unevenly cooked rice. 7. Fluff the rice and add optional ingredients: Remove the skillet from the heat and let it stand for 5 minutes with the lid still on. Then, using a fork, fluff the rice gently to separate the grains. At this point, you can mix in optional ingredients like chopped cilantro, a squeeze of lime juice, or frozen vegetables that have been defrosted and reheated. 8. Serve the chipotle rice: Transfer the rice to a serving dish and enjoy it as a flavorful side or as part of a meal, such as a burrito bowl, alongside grilled meats, or with your favorite Mexican-themed dishes."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The Battle of Leyte Gulf was arguably the largest naval battle in history and was the largest naval battle of World War II. It was a series of four distinct engagements fought off the Philippine island of Leyte from 23 to 26 October 1944. Leyte Gulf featured the largest battleships ever built, was the last time in history that battleships engaged each other, and was also notable as the first time that kamikaze aircraft were used. Allied victory in the Philippine Sea established Allied air and sea superiority in the western Pacific. Nimitz favored blockading the Philippines and landing on Formosa. This would give the Allies control of the sea routes to Japan from southern Asia, cutting off substantial Japanese garrisons. MacArthur favored an invasion of the Philippines, which also lay across the supply lines to Japan. Roosevelt adjudicated in favor of the Philippines. Meanwhile, Japanese Combined Fleet Chief Toyoda Soemu prepared four plans to cover all Allied offensive scenarios. On 12 October Nimitz launched a carrier raid against Formosa to make sure that planes based there could not intervene in the landings on Leyte. Toyoda put Plan Sho-2 into effect, launching a series of air attacks against the U.S. carriers. However the Japanese lost 600 planes in three days, leaving them without air cover.

Luckily I was not the target or victim of this road rage, but I was a first hand witness. Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction. I lived in Southern California for 10 years and now I drive a commercial truck several days a week so I have PLENTY of other “road rage stories”, but this is still the craziest one.

Based on this information, we can conclude that the answer is \\"not enough information\\" as we don't have an exact speed or time given.

Choose your answer from: + no; + yes;","completion":"First question: Since you have ruled out the battery and you mentioned that you filled up recently, there are several potential reasons why your car's engine died while driving. Here is a detailed list of some possible causes: 1. Fuel pump or fuel filter failure: It's possible that the fuel pump or fuel filter has become clogged or failed. This would prevent fuel from reaching the engine, causing it to stall. 2. Ignition switch problems: Issues with the ignition switch can cause a loss of power to the engine and other electrical components, leading to the engine suddenly cutting out. 3. Engine timing issues: If there's a problem with the timing belt or chain, it may cause the engine to stop running. An out-of-sync timing belt could result in engine misfires or piston-valve contact, both of which can lead to engine stalling. 4. Ignition system problems: Problems with the ignition system components such as the ignition coil, spark plugs, or spark plug wires can cause the engine to die while driving. 5. Electronic Control Module (ECM) malfunction: The ECM manages various engine functions, and if it malfunctions or fails, it can cause the engine to stall. 6. Sensor failure: A throttle position sensor or a mass airflow sensor might be faulty, leading to incorrect signals being sent to the engine control system and causing the engine to stall. 7. Vacuum leak: A vacuum leak in the engine can cause running issues and stalling. 8. Overheating: If the engine was overheating, it may stall as a protective measure to prevent damage. It is worth noting that this list is not exhaustive, and a professional mechanic should be consulted to diagnose and address the issue with your car. Second question: It is generally a good practice to let your car engine idle for a short period (usually around 30 seconds to a minute) after a long drive before turning it off. This allows the engine to cool down gradually and can help prevent issues such as overheating or turbocharger damage (if your car is equipped with a turbo system). It is especially important for turbocharged engines, as the turbocharger uses engine oil for lubrication and cooling, and turning the engine off immediately after a long drive can cause the oil to remain stagnant in the hot turbocharger, potentially leading to premature failure. To answer the third point, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question is asking about potential causes for an engine dying while driving, while the second question is about whether it is necessary to let the car engine idle before turning it off after a long drive. Therefore, the answer is: + no;"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456.

'Let it be an arms race': Trump appears to double down on nuclear expansion Read more Paul began with an explanation of the event, which takes its name from a holiday celebrated as an alternative to Christmas by the character Frank Costanza. “The airing of grievances” is one of the traditions of Festivus. “On the media & #fakenews,” Paul wrote, “Festivus is real, media, so don’t try 2 fact check it.” In reference to a recently suspended and rehabilitated NBC News anchor, he added: “And @TheOnion is more accurate than a Brian Williams report.” “New administration is lookin [sic] good,” he continued. “Haven’t seen this many billionaires in 1 place since I staked out Bilderbergs w/ [conspiracy theorist and Trump supporter] Alex Jones. Good times.” Subsequent tweets were critical of the tech billionaire Peter Thiel, who shares some of Paul’s libertarian views but who has been supportive of Donald Trump, and potential Trump appointments. Of the George W Bush-era UN ambassador and noted foreign intervention hawk John Bolton, much to Paul’s dismay touted as a possible undersecretary of state, the senator wrote: “I know I’ve said a lot about @AmbJohnBolton so you’re probably expecting me 2 say something nice for the holidays. Nope. #AiringofGrievances.” Of Rick Perry, who famously failed to name the Department of Energy as one he would abolish but who has now been nominated to lead it, Paul wrote: “My favorite cabinet pick is what’s his name, umm it’s that guy who wanted to eliminate the Dept of @ENERGY. Hang on I’ll think of it...” Lest proceedings become too riotous, Paul proceeded to aim a barrage of tweets at what he alleged to be examples of federal government profligacy with taxpayers’ dollars. Such targets included a state department grant to develop a Pakistani superhero, a study of Ugandan gambling practices, and a National Parks Service study of “Knowledge, Experience and Beliefs of the Supernatural Environment”. The last tweet came complete with a cat gif. Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) The national Park Service announced a grant 2 study “Knowledge, Experience and Beliefs of the Supernatural Environment.” #AiringofGrievances pic.twitter.com/8XVRwhdKe3 With what may have been a nod to another Costanza family tradition, the trials of strength, Paul also promised tweets about “nonbinding resolutions against my Senate colleagues”. Rand Paul celebrates Festivus with 'airing of grievances' against 2016 rivals Read more Subsequent targets included Tea Party Republicans Mike Lee and Ted Cruz, the New Jersey Democrat Corey Booker, and the retiring Democratic minority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada. He also took a balanced shot at a favourite bugbear of Republicans and Trump himself, the supposed failure of liberal Americans to accord the proper respect to Christmas. “I’m gonna have to stop tweeting about Festivus soon, @FoxNews just asked me to come on & talk about my own personal #WaronChristmas. Rude. “For the folks at @MSNBC, that was a joke.” Lest anyone grow too excited, the senator also had a message for members of the press looking for something to write about on the last Friday afternoon before Christmas. “For those of you ‘media’ writing serious stories about my Festivus jokes,” he wrote, “I don’t even know what to say, just stop...” ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

All she could think about, night and day, was her ultimate goal. And her dream finally came true, thanks to the death of 74-year-old Porter Strickley. She could not deny that she had learned the job well, working for that old pain-in-the-butt. He was 57 when she interviewed for the position of Assistant District Attorney. At the time, she thought he was 70. Two months ago, she had become the District Attorney. She loved seeing her name on the door. And she felt a rush of adrenaline every time a judge referred to her as 'The District Attorney' in open court. The D.A.'s office would be better than ever--now that she was running the show. There was a soft knock, and Andrea Newly opened the door just enough to peek in. \\"Come in, Andrea.\\" Angela sometimes wondered if she had made a mistake two weeks ago when she hired this timid young lady as her assistant. Angela had been impressed with her resume. But in person, Andrea was quiet, and seemed to be rather intimidated by Angela. But Andrea was enthralled with every word Angela spoke. And the new D.A. couldn't resist the prospect of being god to her assistant. She had hired her on the spot, even though she knew Andrea would stress her patience. But Angela was confident the 25-year-old could be molded into her mentor's image. And thereby, become a powerful force for justice in the D.A.'s office. Andrea took a chair across from the D.A. The furniture in the District Attorney's office was similar to that found in most old government offices-largely unchanged since the 1950s. Yet the hardwood chairs and desks were of such good quality that an exact replacement would be cost prohibitive in today's market.

Instead of lunches at Lut��ce, they caucus at the Palace Diner in Queens. Wooing clients means passing out fliers on street corners, not securing box seats at Madison Square Garden. To make ends meet, one partner stacks pipe and cleans the yard at a plumbing warehouse. Another handles urine samples in a hospital lab. A sign of failure, of a feeble economy, perhaps? Hardly. They are heeding the call of a growing pool of law schools, which are for the first time pointing graduates in a new direction and teaching them how to get there. Forget the lure of large firms, the security of a government post. Here is how to grapple \\"in the service of justice,\\" as many of the schools put it, instead. Convinced that corporate largess and government programs barely dent the nation's legal needs, the law schools are urging graduates to buck tradition, pass up big salaries and ignore mushrooming student debt to join tiny neighborhood practices or simply start their own, all with an eye toward charging no more than their clients can afford. This is not pro bono legal work; it is \\"low bono,\\" a term the schools coined to define the atypical kind of law career they are training students for. While its practitioners do charge for their services, they are also dead set on turning no one away - or at least as few as possible. \\"When you go into this kind of social justice law, it's really brutal and you're almost guaranteed to struggle for a couple of years before there's a light at the end of the tunnel,\\" said Fred Rooney, director of the Community Legal Resource Network at City University of New York School of Law, from which the lawyers of the newly formed Cates, Katalinic & Lund graduated last May. \\"But if our graduates don't do it, the millions of people who cannot access justice in this country will continue to soar.\\" The movement, primly called the consortium, started four years ago by CUNY, Northeastern University, the University of Maryland and St. Mary's Law School in Texas.

There's plenty of it and it's all around. Therefore, most aquatic plants do not need adaptations for absorbing, transporting, and conserving water. They can save energy and matter by not growing extensive root systems, vascular tissues, or thick cuticle on leaves. Support is also less of a problem because of the buoyancy of water.

It merely describes a snapshot of a moment where two dogs are gazing out into the street. The fact that they are sitting next to a bicycle might as well be coincidental and unrelated to the perceived sense of security they may provide. Secondly, we are not given any information about the dogs' temperament, behavior, or training. They might simply be relaxing and enjoying the view rather than actively watching out for potential threats. Even if the dogs were intentionally keeping a lookout, we are not offered any evidence of their ability to protect or respond to danger effectively. Additionally, the statement doesn't clarify whether the dogs are keeping an eye on their surroundings to ensure safety or merely observing passing events out of curiosity or interest. Canine behavior can have various motivations, and without further information, it's impossible to determine the exact purpose behind their actions. Lastly, the notion of a \\"good job\\" in terms of safety is highly subjective. Safeguarding entails a variety of tasks such as deterring potential intruders, alerting others to possible threats, and responding effectively in case of an emergency. With the limited information given, we cannot ascertain whether these dogs possess the necessary skills to perform these tasks or whether they have a history of successfully ensuring safety.

Here is a news article: Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption US President Barack Obama said Nelson Mandela lived \\"a life like no other\\" Tens of thousands of South Africans have joined dozens of world leaders for the national memorial service for former President Nelson Mandela. The service was held in front of a vociferous crowd in the FNB stadium in Johannesburg. US President Barack Obama said Mr Mandela was a \\"giant of history\\", describing him as the last great liberator of the 20th Century. The former South African president died last Thursday, aged 95. The country is observing a series of commemorations leading up to the funeral on Sunday. At the scene \\"It took a man like Madiba to free not just the prisoner but the jailer,\\" US President Barack Obama said, to a standing ovation. He said Nelson Mandela embodied the spirit of \\"uBuntu\\", which means \\"I am because you are\\". Thousands braved the unseasonably cold weather and rain to pay their respects to the country's first black president at the FNB stadium in Soweto. This is where he addressed the nation on the day of his release in 1990. The crowds were in high spirits but were asked to \\"behave\\" after booing President Jacob Zuma a number of times. But despite a difficult start, President Zuma delivered his message, describing Madiba as \\"truly one of a kind\\". He said Mr Mandela was a kind man but had a sharp tongue, especially when it came to something he believed in. Mr Zuma will have been relieved to hear some cheering at the end of the speech. Mandela memorial binds South Africans 'A mighty life' The memorial service, which began at about 12:00 (10:00 GMT), lasted about four hours. It was one of the biggest gatherings of international dignitaries in recent years, with more than 100 current or former heads of state or government attending. There had been fears people would be turned away. But with heavy rain, security and transport issues, and the fact that Tuesday was not declared a national holiday, areas of the 95,000-capacity stadium remained empty. Introducing the proceedings, the master of ceremonies, Cyril Ramaphosa, said that Mr Mandela's \\"long walk is over... and he can finally rest\\". Current South African President Jacob Zuma made the keynote address but was booed in some parts of the ceremony. He said Mr Mandela was \\"one of a kind... a fearless freedom fighter who refused to allow the brutality of the apartheid state to stand in way of the struggle for the liberation of his people\\". Mr Zuma announced he was renaming the Union Buildings in Pretoria, where Mr Mandela will lie in state, as the Mandela Amphitheatre. Earlier Mr Obama delivered his address, carried on the White House web site, to huge cheers. He said: \\"It is hard to eulogise any man... how much harder to do so for a giant of history, who moved a nation towards justice.\\" He said Nelson Mandela had taught the world the power of action and the power of ideas, and that it had taken a man like Mr Mandela to free not only the prisoner but also the jailer.

While I will always fall short of Madiba (Mr Mandela's clan name), he makes me want to be a better man.\\" On his way to the podium, President Obama shook hands with Cuban President Raul Castro, an unprecedented gesture between the leaders of two nations that have been at loggerheads for more than half a century. A White House official later said the two had not planned to meet. \\"This wasn't a pre-planned encounter,\\" the official said, quoted by AFP news agency. \\"Above all else, today is about honouring Nelson Mandela, and that was the president's singular focus at the memorial service.

He was one of our greatest teachers. He taught by example. He sacrificed so much and was willing to give up all he had for freedom and democracy.\\" The first speaker, friend and fellow Robben Island inmate Andrew Mlangeni, said Mr Mandela had \\"created hope when there was none\\". Many people stood in the rain waiting for several hours to get into the stadium, the BBC's Pumza Fihlani reports from the scene. She says the crowds were in high spirits - singing and dancing, stomping their feet - and the stadium had the feel of a political rally. Rather than seeing the rain as a dampener, many in South Africa have welcomed it. Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula said: \\"It's a blessing from the ancestors welcoming a son of the soil.\\" Analysis That Jacob Zuma was booed at the Nelson Mandela memorial is unfortunate. This was not an occasion to take pot shots. But it shows that South Africa is a robust democracy - such booing would not have been tolerated in many other countries. People would have been too afraid to voice their rage at the president. Nevertheless, Mr Zuma ought to be worried - will it be the death knell for his political career? He is due to lead the ANC into elections next year. A faction is bound to lobby for him to be ousted, in favour of Cyril Ramaphosa, his deputy in the party. Acting as master of ceremonies, Mr Ramaphosa received a far better reception from the crowd. He was next to Mr Mandela when he was released from prison in 1990, and was the chief architect of South Africa's democratic constitution. At the time, he was widely seen as Mr Mandela's heir but was outmanoeuvred in the political chess game within the ANC to choose the legend's successor. One of those attending, Shahida Rowe from Johannesburg, told the BBC: \\"The core of Mandela's life was humanity. That is why I am here today and the world is celebrating. \\"Thanks to him, I was recognised as a human being.\\" Mr Mandela's widow, Graca Machel, arrived at the stadium to huge cheers as she was shown on the big screen. There were cheers too of \\"Winnie! Winnie!\\" for ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, who hugged and kissed Graca Machel. Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, Chinese Vice-President Li Yuanchao, President Hifikepunye Pohamba of Namibia and Indian President Pranab Mukherjee also made speeches. The ceremony was closed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who asked the crowd to rise to their feet for a final tribute. The BBC's Mike Wooldridge in Johannesburg says the line-up of world leaders is a sign of how South Africa has seen its partners and place in the world since Nelson Mandela became president. But, he adds, today is as personal as it is political - a recognition that there are lessons for the wider world in everything Nelson Mandela sought to achieve.

How much harder to do so for a giant of history, who moved a nation toward justice, and in the process moved billions around the world. Born during World War I, far from the corridors of power, a boy raised herding cattle and tutored by the elders of his Thembu tribe, Madiba would emerge as the last great liberator of the 20th century. Like Gandhi, he would lead a resistance movement -- a movement that at its start had little prospect for success. Like Dr. King, he would give potent voice to the claims of the oppressed and the moral necessity of racial justice. He would endure a brutal imprisonment that began in the time of Kennedy and Khrushchev, and reached the final days of the Cold War. Emerging from prison, without the force of arms, he would -- like Abraham Lincoln -- hold his country together when it threatened to break apart. And like America’s Founding Fathers, he would erect a constitutional order to preserve freedom for future generations -- a commitment to democracy and rule of law ratified not only by his election, but by his willingness to step down from power after only one term. Given the sweep of his life, the scope of his accomplishments, the adoration that he so rightly earned, it’s tempting I think to remember Nelson Mandela as an icon, smiling and serene, detached from the tawdry affairs of lesser men. But Madiba himself strongly resisted such a lifeless portrait. Instead, Madiba insisted on sharing with us his doubts and his fears; his miscalculations along with his victories. “I am not a saint,” he said, “unless you think of a saint as a sinner who keeps on trying.” It was precisely because he could admit to imperfection -- because he could be so full of good humor, even mischief, despite the heavy burdens he carried -- that we loved him so. He was not a bust made of marble; he was a man of flesh and blood -- a son and a husband, a father and a friend. And that’s why we learned so much from him, and that’s why we can learn from him still. For nothing he achieved was inevitable. In the arc of his life, we see a man who earned his place in history through struggle and shrewdness, and persistence and faith. He tells us what is possible not just in the pages of history books, but in our own lives as well. Mandela showed us the power of action; of taking risks on behalf of our ideals. Perhaps Madiba was right that he inherited, “a proud rebelliousness, a stubborn sense of fairness” from his father. And we know he shared with millions of black and colored South Africans the anger born of, “a thousand slights, a thousand indignities, a thousand unremembered moments…a desire to fight the system that imprisoned my people,” he said. But like other early giants of the ANC -- the Sisulus and Tambos -- Madiba disciplined his anger and channeled his desire to fight into organization, and platforms, and strategies for action, so men and women could stand up for their God-given dignity. Moreover, he accepted the consequences of his actions, knowing that standing up to powerful interests and injustice carries a price. “I have fought against white domination and I have fought against black domination. I’ve cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and [with] equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.” Mandela taught us the power of action, but he also taught us the power of ideas; the importance of reason and arguments; the need to study not only those who you agree with, but also those who you don’t agree with. He understood that ideas cannot be contained by prison walls, or extinguished by a sniper’s bullet. He turned his trial into an indictment of apartheid because of his eloquence and his passion, but also because of his training as an advocate. He used decades in prison to sharpen his arguments, but also to spread his thirst for knowledge to others in the movement. And he learned the language and the customs of his oppressor so that one day he might better convey to them how their own freedom depend upon his. Mandela demonstrated that action and ideas are not enough. No matter how right, they must be chiseled into law and institutions. He was practical, testing his beliefs against the hard surface of circumstance and history. On core principles he was unyielding, which is why he could rebuff offers of unconditional release, reminding the Apartheid regime that “prisoners cannot enter into contracts.” But as he showed in painstaking negotiations to transfer power and draft new laws, he was not afraid to compromise for the sake of a larger goal. And because he was not only a leader of a movement but a skillful politician, the Constitution that emerged was worthy of this multiracial democracy, true to his vision of laws that protect minority as well as majority rights, and the precious freedoms of every South African. And finally, Mandela understood the ties that bind the human spirit. There is a word in South Africa -- Ubuntu -- a word that captures Mandela’s greatest gift: his recognition that we are all bound together in ways that are invisible to the eye; that there is a oneness to humanity; that we achieve ourselves by sharing ourselves with others, and caring for those around us. We can never know how much of this sense was innate in him, or how much was shaped in a dark and solitary cell. But we remember the gestures, large and small -- introducing his jailers as honored guests at his inauguration; taking a pitch in a Springbok uniform; turning his family’s heartbreak into a call to confront HIV/AIDS -- that revealed the depth of his empathy and his understanding. He not only embodied Ubuntu, he taught millions to find that truth within themselves. It took a man like Madiba to free not just the prisoner, but the jailer as well to show that you must trust others so that they may trust you; to teach that reconciliation is not a matter of ignoring a cruel past, but a means of confronting it with inclusion and generosity and truth. He changed laws, but he also changed hearts. For the people of South Africa, for those he inspired around the globe, Madiba’s passing is rightly a time of mourning, and a time to celebrate a heroic life. But I believe it should also prompt in each of us a time for self-reflection. With honesty, regardless of our station or our circumstance, we must ask: How well have I applied his lessons in my own life? It’s a question I ask myself, as a man and as a President. We know that, like South Africa, the United States had to overcome centuries of racial subjugation. As was true here, it took sacrifice -- the sacrifice of countless people, known and unknown, to see the dawn of a new day. Michelle and I are beneficiaries of that struggle. But in America, and in South Africa, and in countries all around the globe, we cannot allow our progress to cloud the fact that our work is not yet done. The struggles that follow the victory of formal equality or universal franchise may not be as filled with drama and moral clarity as those that came before, but they are no less important. For around the world today, we still see children suffering from hunger and disease. We still see run-down schools. We still see young people without prospects for the future. Around the world today, men and women are still imprisoned for their political beliefs, and are still persecuted for what they look like, and how they worship, and who they love. That is happening today. And so we, too, must act on behalf of justice. We, too, must act on behalf of peace. There are too many people who happily embrace Madiba’s legacy of racial reconciliation, but passionately resist even modest reforms that would challenge chronic poverty and growing inequality. There are too many leaders who claim solidarity with Madiba’s struggle for freedom, but do not tolerate dissent from their own people. And there are too many of us on the sidelines, comfortable in complacency or cynicism when our voices must be heard. The questions we face today -- how to promote equality and justice; how to uphold freedom and human rights; how to end conflict and sectarian war -- these things do not have easy answers. But there were no easy answers in front of that child born in World War I. Nelson Mandela reminds us that it always seems impossible until it is done. South Africa shows that is true. South Africa shows we can change, that we can choose a world defined not by our differences, but by our common hopes. We can choose a world defined not by conflict, but by peace and justice and opportunity. We will never see the likes of Nelson Mandela again. But let me say to the young people of Africa and the young people around the world -- you, too, can make his life’s work your own. Over 30 years ago, while still a student, I learned of Nelson Mandela and the struggles taking place in this beautiful land, and it stirred something in me. It woke me up to my responsibilities to others and to myself, and it set me on an improbable journey that finds me here today. And while I will always fall short of Madiba’s example, he makes me want to be a better man. He speaks to what’s best inside us. After this great liberator is laid to rest, and when we have returned to our cities and villages and rejoined our daily routines, let us search for his strength. Let us search for his largeness of spirit somewhere inside of ourselves. And when the night grows dark, when injustice weighs heavy on our hearts, when our best-laid plans seem beyond our reach, let us think of Madiba and the words that brought him comfort within the four walls of his cell: “It matters not how strait the gate, how charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul.” What a magnificent soul it was. We will miss him deeply. May God bless the memory of Nelson Mandela. May God bless the people of South Africa. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The article is a detailed account of the memorial service held for former South African President Nelson Mandela, attended by tens of thousands of South Africans and numerous world leaders.

Potential energy: This is more about the energy that an object has due to its position or form. In the context of a machine's wheels and gears, greasing won't change its potential energy. So this answer would not be considered. 2. Efficiency: The efficiency of a machine refers to how much of the input energy is converted to output energy. Greasing would actually increase efficiency by reducing wasted energy (due to heat from friction). So, this option is incorrect. 3. Output: This refers to the net work or energy produced by the machine. Greasing might increase output indirectly by improving efficiency but it primarily does not directly affect the output. Therefore, this option is not directly correct. 4. Friction: This is the resistance to motion of one object moving relative to another. It's known that machines are greased to reduce friction so that the parts can move more smoothly.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Answer for Question 1: To build or compile a Flash AS2 (ActionScript 2) Flash Lite 3.1 file for a set-top box, follow these steps: 1. Set up the development environment: a. Install Adobe Flash Professional (CS3 to CS6 have support for ActionScript 2). b. Download and install the appropriate Flash Lite 3.1 extension for Adobe Flash Professional, available on the Adobe website or by using the following link: http://download.macromedia.com/pub/flash/m/dc/flashlite31_ext_fl.zip c. In Adobe Flash Professional, go to 'Help > Manage Extensions' to install the downloaded Flash Lite extension. 2. Create a new Flash Document targeting ActionScript 2 by going to 'File > New', then selecting 'Flash Document' and ensuring the 'ActionScript 2' option is selected under Settings. 3. Build the Flash Lite AS2 content a. Start by setting up the mobile device stage size (e.g., 240x320 for a standard screen device) under 'Modify > Document'. b. Create your graphical assets, animations, and interactions for your content using the Flash drawing tools and Timeline panel. c. Write your AS2 code on separate layers or in external AS files, then import and link them to your project. d. Run a test of your content using 'Control > Test Movie', which will simulate how it will run on the set-top box. 4. Exporting the content for the set-top box: a. Go to 'File > Publish Settings', and under the Flash tab, ensure 'ActionScript 2' is selected as the script version and 'Flash Lite 3.1' as the target player. b. Under the 'Formats' tab, make sure the 'Flash (.swf)' and 'FlashLite Projector (.exe)' options are selected. c. Make sure you include any necessary font outlines if your content uses custom fonts. d. Press 'Publish' to export the content in the desired formats. 5. Convert the .swf file to a format suitable for your set-top box. Each set-top box may have different format requirements. Therefore, you should refer to the documentation provided by the set-top box manufacturer for detailed instructions on converting and deploying the content on the device. Answer for Question 2: Converting SWF files to PDF files can be done using a specialized SWF-to-PDF converter software or an online conversion service. Below is a method to convert SWF files to PDF using a versatile converter software, XabeSwfToImage: 1. Download and install XabeSwfToImage available at https://github.com/tomaszzmuda/Xabe.FFmpeg 2. Set up the command-line option by opening the Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac). 3. Use XabeSwfToImage to convert your SWF file to an image format (e.g., PNG) using the command: \`\`\` XabeSwfToImage -i input.swf -o output.png \`\`\` Replace 'input.swf' with the path to your SWF file and 'output.png' with the desired output file path. 4. Use a PDF conversion tool (e.g., ImageMagick) to convert the output image to a PDF file with the command: \`\`\` convert output.png output.pdf \`\`\` Replace 'output.png' with the path to the output image file and 'output.pdf' with the desired PDF output file path. Now, you will have a PDF file generated from your initial SWF file. No, the answers to these two questions are not the same. While both involve conversions, the first question focuses on converting a Flash AS2 Flash Lite file for compatibility with a set-top box, while the second question pertains to converting SWF files into a PDF format. The objectives and processes are different in each case."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Question: John was watching the ocean from the beach and after a long period of observation, he concluded that the less wind there is, that the waves will become Bigger or Smaller? Paragraph : The size of an ocean wave depends on how fast, over how great a distance, and how long the wind blows. The greater each of these factors is, the bigger a wave will be. The answer is:","completion":"Smaller. According to the provided paragraph, the size of an ocean wave is influenced by three factors: the speed of the wind, the distance over which it blows, and the duration of its action. It states that when these factors are greater, the waves will also become larger. Consequently, when John observed the ocean from the beach, he concluded that with less wind, the waves would likely be smaller in size. This conclusion can be deduced from the information in the paragraph, which emphasizes that greater wind speed, distance, and duration contribute to bigger waves. As such, the opposite – less wind speed and potentially shorter distance or duration – would lead to smaller waves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Premise: \\"For how many calls\\" This statement is a question by itself, without sufficient context. It doesn't provide any information about the number of calls made. It can be understood as a query asking for the number of calls made. Hypothesis: \\"Did you make a lot of calls?\\" This statement is seeking confirmation or denial about making a significant number of calls. It can be understood as a question inquiring if a large number of calls were made. Now let's examine the options provided: 1. Yes 2. It is not possible to tell 3. No These options are possible answers to the hypothesis (the question about making a lot of calls). Now, to answer the main question, \\"Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?\\" In this particular scenario, the premise is just a question asking for the number of calls made and doesn't provide any information or evidence to support the hypothesis. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis, as they are independent questions. In other words, if the premise is true, it can either confirm or deny the hypothesis, or not provide enough information to draw a conclusion.

Article: Children who see their parents drunk are twice likely to get drunk themselves, a survey of young teenagers has suggested. Poor parental supervision also raises the chances of teenage drinking, said the Joesph Rowntree Foundation. If parents don't know where their children are on a Saturday night, or let them watch films of violence, they are more likely to have had an alcoholic drink. The survey also found the behavior of friends is also a powerful factor in drinking habits. The more time teenagers spend with friends, the more likely they are to drink alcohol. In this survey of 5,700 children aged 13 to 16, carried out by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, researchers found that one in five wanted to have a drink by the time they were 14. By the age of 16, half of those questioned said they had been drunk. Pamela Bremner, scientist of the survey, said, \\"For the first time in the UK, this study shows what most influences young people's drinking behavior.\\" \\"It found that the behavior of friends and family is the most common influential factor in determining how likely and how often a young person will drink alcohol.\\" Don Shenker, Chief Executive of Alcohol Concern, said, \\"Government ministers must also look at some of the causes of why it is so easy for children to get alcohol, usually from the home.\\" \\"Governments should look to see if they've done everything they can to help the large supermarkets from continuing to sell cheap alcohol which encourages more alcohol sales and therefore results in more alcohol being stored in the home.\\" The Royal College of Physicians also said it was not surprising that being able to get alcohol easily was an important factor on current drinking problems and drunkenness of teenagers. A statement said, \\"This shows that the government needs to focus more attention on increasing the price of alcohol, and increasing education and national campaigns for both young people and their families on the dangers of alcohol.\\" Question: How many teenagers admitted that they had been drunk in the survey carried out by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation? Answer: Possible answers: [1]. About 5700.; [2]. About 1200.; [3]. About 2800.; [4]. About 4200.; The answer is:","completion":"[3]. About 2800. This is calculated based on the information from the article that said, \\"By the age of 16, half of those questioned said they had been drunk.\\" The survey was conducted on 5,700 children, so if we say that half of them admitted to having been drunk, that would be approximately 2,850 teenagers.

Hypothesis: Zale Dalen is a Canadian film director. He is proud of his film the hounds of Notre Dame","completion":"Based on the paragraph provided, the hypothesis can be divided into two parts: 1. Zale Dalen is a Canadian film director. 2. He is proud of his film, \\"The Hounds of Notre Dame.\\" For the first part, the paragraph clearly states that Zale Dalen is a Canadian film and television director. Thus, this part of the hypothesis is true. For the second part of the hypothesis, although it is established that Zale Dalen directed \\"The Hounds of Notre Dame\\" and received a Genie Award nomination for Best Director for the film at the 2nd Genie Awards in 1981, there is no direct information provided on whether he is proud of the film or not. It could be inferred that the nomination might have brought some level of pride or satisfaction for the director, as it typically reflects appreciation and recognition of his work in the film industry. However, since there is no explicit mention of his feelings towards the film in the paragraph, confirming his pride in the film would involve making an assumption based on limited information. In conclusion, the first part of the hypothesis is true, as Zale Dalen is indeed a Canadian film director. However, the second part of the hypothesis cannot be definitively confirmed as true or false based on the provided information.

Narendra Damodardas Modi (Gujarati: ['n@re:ndr@ da:mo:d@r'da:s 'mo:di:] ( listen); born 17 September 1950) is an Indian politician serving as the 16th and current Prime Minister of India since 2014. He was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, and is the Member of Parliament for Varanasi. During Modi's second term the rhetoric of the government shifted from Hindutva to Gujarat's economic development. Modi curtailed the influence of Sangh Parivar organisations such as the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), entrenched in the state after the decline of Ahmedabad's textile industry, and dropped Gordhan Zadafia (an ally of former Sangh co-worker and VHP state chief Praveen Togadia) from his cabinet. When the BKS staged a farmers' demonstration Modi ordered their eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in Gandhinagar deepened the rift with the VHP. Sangh organisations were no longer consulted or informed in advance about Modi's administrative decisions. Nonetheless, Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists. Modi wrote a foreword to a textbook by Dinanath Batra released in 2014, which stated that ancient India possessed technologies including test-tube babies. Modi's relationship with Muslims continued to attract criticism. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee (who asked Modi for tolerance in the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat violence and supported his resignation as chief minister) distanced himself, reaching out to North Indian Muslims before the 2004 Lok Sabha elections. After the elections Vajpayee called the violence in Gujarat a reason for the BJP's electoral defeat and said it had been a mistake to leave Modi in office after the riots. Questions about Modi's relationship with Muslims were also raised by many Western nations during his tenure as chief minister. Modi was barred from entering the United States by the State Department, in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission on International Religious Freedom formed under the aegis of the International Religious Freedom Act, the only person denied a US visa under this law. The UK and the European Union refused to admit him because of what they saw as his role in the riots. As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK and the EU lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election as prime minister he was invited to Washington. During the run-up to the 2007 assembly elections and the 2009 general election, the BJP intensified its rhetoric on terrorism. In July 2006, Modi criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh \\" for his reluctance to revive anti-terror legislation\\" such as the 2002 Prevention of Terrorism Act. He asked the national government to allow states to invoke tougher laws in the wake of the 2006 Mumbai train bombings. In 2007 Modi authored Karmayog, a 101-page booklet discussing manual scavenging. In it, Modi argued that scavenging was a \\"spiritual experience\\" for Dalits. However, this book was not circulated that time because of the election code of conduct. After the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, Modi held a meeting to discuss the security of Gujarat's 1,600-kilometre (990 mi)-long coastline, resulting in government authorisation of 30 high-speed surveillance boats. In July 2007 Modi completed 2,063 consecutive days as chief minister of Gujarat, making him the longest-serving holder of that post, and the BJP won 122 of 182 state-assembly seats in that year's election. As Chief Minister, Modi favoured privatisation and small government, which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS, usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. His policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state. He established financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth Rs6.6 trillion were signed. The governments led by Patel and Modi supported NGOs and communities in the creation of groundwater-conservation projects. By December 2008, 500,000 structures had been built, of which 113,738 were check dams, which helped recharge the aquifers beneath them. Sixty of the 112 tehsils which had depleted the water table in 2004 had regained their normal groundwater levels by 2010. As a result, the state's production of genetically modified cotton increased to become the largest in India. The boom in cotton production and its semi-arid land use led to Gujarat's agricultural sector growing at an average rate of 9.6 percent from 2001 to 2007. Public irrigation measures in central and southern Gujarat, such as the Sardar Sarovar Dam, were less successful. The Sardar Sarovar project only irrigated 4-6% of the area intended. Nonetheless, from 2001 to 2010 Gujarat recorded an agricultural growth rate of 10.97 percent - the highest of any state. However, sociologists have pointed out that the growth rate under the 1992-97 INC government was 12.9 percent. In 2008 Modi offered land in Gujarat to Tata Motors to set up a plant manufacturing the Nano after a popular agitation had forced the company to move out of West Bengal. Several other companies followed the Tata's to Gujarat. The Modi government finished the process of bringing electricity to every village in Gujarat that its predecessor had almost completed. Modi significantly changed the state's system of power distribution, greatly impacting farmers. Gujarat expanded the Jyotigram Yojana scheme, in which agricultural electricity was separated from other rural electricity; the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands, reducing its cost. Although early protests by farmers ended when those who benefited found that their electricity supply had stabilised, according to an assessment study corporations and large farmers benefited from the policy at the expense of small farmers and labourers. During the 2012 campaign, Modi attempted to identify himself with the state of Gujarat, a strategy similar to that used by Indira Gandhi during the Emergency, and projected himself as protecting Gujarat against persecution by the rest of India. Despite the BJP's shift away from explicit Hindutva, Modi's election campaign in 2007 and 2012 contained elements of Hindu nationalism. Modi only attended Hindu religious ceremonies, and had prominent associations with Hindu religious leaders. During his 2012 campaign he twice refused to wear articles of clothing gifted by Muslim leaders. He did, however, maintain relations with Dawoodi Bohra. His campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation, including to Afzal Guru and the killing of Sohrabuddin Sheikh. The BJP did not nominate any Muslim candidates for the assembly election of 2012. He had published a Gujarati book titled Jyotipunj in 2008, containing profiles of various RSS leaders. The longest was of M. S. Golwalkar, under whose leadership the RSS expanded and whom Modi refers to as Pujniya Shri Guruji (\\"Guru worthy of worship\\"). According to The Economic Times, his intention was to explain the workings of the RSS to his readers and to reassure RSS members that he remained ideologically aligned with them. Modi authored eight other books, mostly containing short stories for children. While campaigning for the 2012 assembly elections, Modi made extensive use of holograms and other technologies allowing him to reach a large number of people, something he would repeat in the 2014 general election. In the 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections, Modi won the constituency of Maninagar by 86,373 votes over Shweta Bhatt, the INC candidate and wife of Sanjiv Bhatt. The BJP won 115 of the 182 seats, continuing its majority during his tenure and allowing the party to form the government (as it had in Gujarat since 1995). In later by-elections the BJP won four more assembly seats and two Lok Sabha seats held by the INC, although Modi did not campaign for its candidates. In 2013, the Wharton India Economic Forum (WIEF) at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania cancelled a keynote video-conference speech by Modi following protests by Indian-Americans. After his election as prime minister, Modi resigned as the chief minister and as an MLA from Maninagar on 21 May 2014. Anandiben Patel succeeded him as the chief minister. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did he make any important laws or helped with some as Chief Minister?","completion":"Yes, during his tenure as Chief Minister, Narendra Modi made some important decisions and helped with some laws.

This is a question with answer options. Goal: how do you count? Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? Pick your answer from: (1). go upward from number 1.; (2). go downward from number 10.;...I think the answer is","completion":"I think the answer is (1). go upward from number 1. Both methods can be used to count but option (1) is more reasonable for accomplishing the goal, and here is a detailed explanation of why: 1. Natural counting process: Starting to count from the number 1 aligns with the most basic and intuitive method of counting. It corresponds to the natural progression of numbers, and hence, it is easier for people to comprehend and perform. Going upward from number 1 mimics the way we have learned to count since childhood, and it is the most commonly used method across various tasks and situations. 2. Universality: Counting from 1 upwards adheres to the standard mathematical notation and conventions used in various cultures and languages around the world. This method is universally understood, which promotes better communication and minimizes confusion. 3. Limitless counting range: When counting upward from number 1, it is easy to keep track of the ongoing count, and there is no particular limit or upper boundary on the numbers. This enables you to count an indefinite amount of items or keep track of progress without any constraints. On the other hand, counting downward from a specific number (such as 10) is limited and requires constant adjustments if the counting range exceeds the starting point. 4. Less cognitive load: Starting to count at 1 and going upwards requires less cognitive effort as opposed to counting down from a higher number. For most people, counting upwards is an automated response, whereas counting down may warrant additional mental exertion due to the need for continuous arithmetic (i.e., subtraction) and the constant updating of the initial number. 5. Practical applications: In real-life situations, counting upwards from 1 is often more practical. For instance, when counting the number of people attending an event, it is logical to start at 1 and continue counting upward as more individuals arrive. Likewise, counting from 1 is useful when measuring things like time, distance, or the amount of a particular object (e.g., inventory, money, etc.). These applications often rely on a starting point of 0 or 1, hence making the upward counting method more suitable. In summary, counting upward from number 1 is the more reasonable method to accomplish the goal of counting because it aligns with the natural counting process, has universal applicability, provides a limitless counting range, requires less cognitive effort, and is more practical for various applications. While counting downward from number 10 can still be used to count, it brings certain limitations and challenges that make option (1) the better choice overall."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Law enforcement lost public's trust after NSA leaks, says UK police chief Law enforcement agencies lost the public’s trust after disclosures on government surveillance by the whistleblower Edward Snowden and must ensure that they strike the right balance between privacy and security, the UK’s most senior police officer said on Thursday. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, commissioner of the Metropolitan police in London, told a conference of senior American police chiefs that authorities must take care “post-Snowden” to use the most intrusive surveillance tools available to them “only where necessary”, or “risk losing them altogether”. “We need to ensure that where law enforcement accesses private communications there is a process of authorisation, oversight and governance that gets the balance right between the individual’s right to privacy and their right to be protected from serious crime,” said Hogan-Howe, whose force that takes the lead on police counter-terrorism efforts in the UK. Speaking at an event in New York on Thursday, Hogan-Howe told fellow chiefs including Bill Bratton, the commissioner of the New York police department: “There is work to be done to restore the public’s trust that we are acting in their best interests.” The remarks appeared to contrast with more strident comments made by other senior British officials including David Cameron, the prime minister, who last year accused Snowden and newspapers such as the Guardian who published his disclosures of “helping our enemies”. However, Hogan-Howe also used his speech to rail against an increase in online security and encryption that has followed the revelations from Snowden, a contractor for the US National Security Agency (NSA) who leaked a cache of documents disclosing controversial electronic surveillance programs run there and at GCHQ, the NSA’s sister agency in the UK. Authorities have complained bitterly in particular about the latest update to the operating system for Apple’s iPhones, which upgraded the encryption on users’ data so as to prevent it from being accessible for handing over to law enforcement agencies. Hogan-Howe claimed that the internet was at risk of becoming a “dark and ungoverned space” because encryption and security measures on communications devices were now “beyond what any genuine domestic user could reasonably require”. Bratton told a press conference afterwards that the Islamic State (Isis) were using “increasingly sophisticated recruiting efforts” such as social media and well-produced websites “to actively recruit and successively recruit” jihadists. Hogan-Howe said that counter-terrorism officials in the UK were removing 1,000 pieces of “illegal content” from the web each week. “We cannot police the whole internet, but we will continue to do what we can.” Stressing that 500 Britons had travelled to join the conflict in Iraq and Syria, the Met police chief said that the threat of these people returning as militarised jihadists must be dealt with. However he also said that recent isolated attacks on police and military personnel in New York and Canada highlighted the need to be watchful of so-called “lone wolf” attackers. After telling the conference that “privacy is important”, Hogan-Howe was asked by the Guardian whether it was acceptable that British security were reported earlier on Thursday to be intercepting traditionally privileged communications between lawyers and their clients. Claiming not to have seen the specific reports, Hogan-Howe said he would be “amazed” if officials at MI5 and GCHQ were routinely eavesdropping on attorney-client conversations, adding: “That is very legally restricted unless the lawyer is involved with crime.” “It’s very clear what the law says, which is obviously that there is a legal privilege that exists between a lawyer and their client,” he said. And that is greatly respected.” The Met police chief said that despite the elevation in the government’s official threat level to “severe” in August this year, there was at present no direct intelligence indicating a planned attack in the near future. He declined to address when asked the likelihood of a terrorist plot being hatched using online communications to which law enforcement agencies no longer had access.

In the first statement, it says that two men are waiting on a street corner, with the additional information about the location being a street corner. The second statement simply mentions that two men are waiting outside. Since street corners are typically located outside, it can be concluded that both statements align with each other regarding the fact that two men are waiting while it is raining.

This meant that Emily was quite accustomed to their distinct personalities, their individual preferences, and their unique quirks. These adorable creatures had become an integral part of Emily's life, bringing her endless joy and companionship. Emily, over the years, had learned how to expertly care for their needs, ensuring they remained healthy, happy, and well-groomed. Megan, on the other hand, didn't share the same level of enthusiasm or experience with cats as Emily did. Having twelve cats of her own might have allowed her to familiarize herself with their world better, but that wasn't the case. Megan's interests and hobbies differed from Emily's, and the cat-combing activity was enjoyable for her but not as deeply fulfilling as it was for Emily. Additionally, caring for twelve pet cats entailed a significant level of responsibility and commitment, which Emily happily embraced. She always made sure that her feline companions received the best possible care - from nutritious meals to regular vet checkups, from playtime to cozy napping spots. Each of her cats had a special bond with her, and it was evident to anyone who witnessed their interactions. As Emily combed the fur of her beloved cats, she could identify them by their markings, size, and the feel of their fur. There was Fluffy, the giant Maine Coon with majestic fur, Ginger, the feisty and playful orange tabby, and Luna, the elegant silver-furred beauty who adored cuddling with Emily during quiet evenings. Megan, while appreciating the serene presence of these lovable creatures, didn't quite grasp the level of joy that Emily drew from these moments. Nevertheless, she still respected and admired Emily's dedication to her feline companions and participated in the cat-combing sessions, even if it meant playing a supporting role. Emily knew that Megan didn't share her passion for cats, but it never caused a rift between them. Instead, Emily felt grateful for having a friend who accepted her love for cats and joined her in taking care of them, even if sometimes it was just to keep Emily company. They had their shared interests, of course - movie nights, shopping trips, and lazy Sunday brunches - but in the end, the friendship flourished despite the differing levels of affinity towards their plushy little furballs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She managed to win the award, demonstrating her exceptional skills and influence in the Soul/R&B genre. 2. Favorite Soul/R&B Album: Rihanna's 2011 album, \\"Talk That Talk,\\" won in this category. The album was a massive hit, featuring popular tracks such as \\"We Found Love,\\" \\"You Da One,\\" and \\"Where Have You Been,\\" resonating with fans and critics alike. She competed against Chris Brown's \\"Fortune\\" and Usher's \\"Looking 4 Myself\\" in this category. In 2012, Rihanna also received nominations for the following categories but did not win: 1.

The statement implies that the name in question was unusual, peculiar, or outside the norm- it was thus able to catch the person's attention, but it does not necessarily mean that the person had never encountered the name prior to this. For instance, a person might come across an uncommon name for the second, third, or even tenth time, and still be captivated every time due to its unusualness. This means while there's a possibility that the person hasn't seen the name before (which could be one reason that it's particularly striking), there's also a decent chance that they have seen it, but are still drawn to it because of its weirdness. Also, without more information or context, we can't assess whether the name was unusual to this person due to their specific circumstances or cultural background, or because it’s universally bizarre. What is considered outlandish could differ from person to person based on their experiences or cultural contexts. A name that seems unusual in one cultural or linguistic context might be relatively normal in another.

Two Jessops stores will open today in London's Oxford Street and Birmingham, with four others opening over the Easter weekend in Manchester, Aberdeen, High Wycombe and St Albans. Up to 30 more Jessops stores are due to re-open in April, as part of a £5 million investment. Scroll down for video. Investment: Dragons' Den star Peter Jones was today opening two Jessops stores in London and Birmingham as part of a £5m relaunch. Open: Peter Jones stands outside the Jessops store in Oxford Street, central London. Relaunch: Staff pose for pictures inside the newly opened Jessops store in Birmingham. Jessops called in administrators PwC in January, leading to the closure of all 187 Jessops stores and the loss of almost 1,500 jobs. Later that month Mr Jones and other investors bought the brand and certain assets. The entrepreneur is the sole owner of the relaunched camera store chain. The company has pledged to create 500 jobs with its relaunch - with the majority going to former Jessops staff who lost their jobs when the chain collapsed. Mr Jones, who appears as an investor on the BBC reality TV series about entrepreneurs, will take the role of chief executive and chairman. He said: 'I believe Jessops is an iconic British brand which can lead the retail resurgence on Britain's high streets, powered by new innovations and world-leading, expert staff. 'Image is everything, and even in the mobile and tablet era, there's no substitute for a quality camera when it comes to taking the perfect picture.' Re-opened: Peter Jones (right) and comedian James Corden (left) pose for photographs in a re-opened branch of the Jessops camera retail chain on Oxford Street in London. Investment: Dragons' Den star Peter Jones was today opening two Jessops stores in London and Birmingham as part of a £5m relaunch. Closure: Jessops called in administrators PwC in January, leading to the closure of all 187 Jessops stores and the loss of almost 1,500 jobs. Mr Jones opened the Oxford Street store today with TV comic James Corden. The. relaunched company is forecasting sales of at least £80 million in its. first year, which it said will give it 15 per cent of the DSLR camera. market in the UK. Jessops also promised greater integration with its. online presence, including an option to collect internet orders at. store. The camera giant was. the first high-profile retail casualty of 2013, after suffering from. online competition and a boom in camera phones in recent years, which. hit demand for digital cameras. Hands-on: The relaunched company is forecasting sales of at least £80 million in its first year. At its appointment, PwC said the company's core market had seen a 'significant decline' in 2012, while forecast profits over Christmas did not materialise, squeezing its funding. Jessops had struggled since 2007, when it underwent a major overhaul with a swathe of store closures. The firm began life in 1935 when Frank Jessop opened his first shop in Leicester. Writing in The Sun today, Mr Jones said while 'so-called experts' say the High Street no future, he believes 'the facts say otherwise'. 'Devastating effect': Staff from the Warrington branch of Jessops plastered their photos in the window of the store in the hope of finding new employment after its closure was announced. Mr Jones said shopper numbers on the High Street were up by 2.7 per cent last month compared to the previous year, according to the British Retail Consortium. He said while the business could have been relaunched online, he knew there was a desire for a 'proper shopping experience'. He said: 'I also think it's time we snapped out of our negativity about the economy, and got behind the great British brands and institutions that can lead the recovery. 'That's why I've declared myself \\"in\\" to what I think will be the first step in the revival of our high streets.' He added things were looking up for British shoppers, with Blockbuster also set to re-open in the near future. The High Street has seen some turbulent times in recent years, but the latest development could be a sign of changing fortunes. December 2008: MFI, the furniture retailer, was one of the first major firms to go out of business at the start of the downturn, as retail sales began to fall following a sharp rise in unemploymentWoolworths. January 2009: Woolworths shuttered its 800 stores, bringing home to many the scale of the UK's economic collapse as the country entered recession for the first time. February 2009: Zavvi stopped trading around Christmas - and refused to honour its gift cards, leading to widespread customer anger. In trouble: Electrical giant Comet closed its doors for the last time shortly before Christmas while music chain HMV called in administrators in January. December 2009: Borders was another entertainment behemoth to go under as sale of CDs and DVDs were squeezed by digital downloads and online retailers. October 2012: JJB Sports closed all but 20 of its stores, which were taken over and re-branded by Sports Direct - leading to the death of the JJB brand and 550 employees losing their jobs. December 2012: Comet shut down just before Christmas, leaving nearly 7,000 staff out of work and forcing the taxpayer to pick up a £50million tab related to its bankruptcy, which was blamed on soaring energy prices and a reduction in the number of home buyers. January 2013: Jessops was closed by administrator PwC earlier this month after years of struggling with online competition as customers turned away from traditional photography. January 2013: HMV, which has 239 shops and 4,500 staff, announced that it was calling in administrators. The company came under fire for not honouring gift vouchers which they had been selling all over Christmas. January 2013: Blockbusters, called in administrator Deloitte who announced that 129 stores across the UK would close and 760 employees would lose their jobs. February 2013: Fashion chain Republic collapses into administration putting 2,500 jobs at risk. March 2013: Blockbuster is sold to restrucuring specialists Gordon Brothers Europe for an undisclosed sum, saving 2,00 jobs and 264 UK stores.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Have you ever had the strange feeling that you were being watched? You turned around and, sure enough, someone was looking right at you! Parapsychologists say that humans have a natural ability to sense when someone is looking at them. To research whether such a \\"sixth sense\\" really exists, Robert Baker, a psychologist at the University of Kentucky, performed two experiments. In the first one, Baker sat behind unknowing people in public places and stared at the backs of their heads for 5 to 15 minutes. The subjects were eating, drinking, reading, studying, watching TV, or working at a computer. Baker made sure that the people could not tell that he was sitting behind them during those periods. Later, when he questioned the subjects, almost all of them said they had no sense that someone was staring at them. For the second experiment, Baker told the subjects that they would be stared at from time to time from behind a two way mirror in a laboratory setting. The people had to write down when they felt they were being stared at and when they weren't. Baker found that the subjects were no better at telling when they were stared at and when they weren't. and they were no better at telling when they were stared at than if they had just guessed. Baker concludes that people do not have the ability to sense when they're being stared at. If people doubt the outcome of his two experiments, said baker, \\"I suggest they repeat the experiments and see for themselves.\\" The purpose of the two experiments is to _ . A) explain when people can have a sixth sense B) show how people act while being watched in the lab C) study whether humans can sense when they are stared at D) prove why humans have a sixth sense The answer is:","completion":"C) study whether humans can sense when they are stared at The purpose of Robert Baker's two experiments was to examine the claim purported by several parapsychologists that humans have an inherent \\"sixth sense\\" enabling them to perceive when they are being observed or stared at by someone else.

Recent research from Germany and Italy shows that heart attacks are more common on Monday mornings and doctors blame the stress of returning to work after the weekend break. The risk of having a heart attack on any given day should be one in seven, but a six-year study helped by researchers at the Free University of Berlin of more than 2, 600 Germans showed that the average person had a 20 percent higher chance of having a heart attack on a Monday than on any other day. Working Germans are particularly not protected against attack, with a 33 percent higher risk at the beginning of the working week. Non-workers, by comparison, appear to be no more at risk on a Monday than any other day. A study of 11, 000 Italians proved 8 a. m. on a Monday morning as the most stressful time for the heart, and both studies showed that Sunday is the least stressful day, with fewest heart attacks in both countries. The finding could lead to a better understanding of what is the immediate cause of heart attacks, according to Dr Stefan Willich of the Free University. \\"We know a lot about long-term risk factors such as smoking and cholesterol but we don't know what actually causes heart attacks, so we can't give clear advice on how to prevent them, \\"he said. Monday mornings have a double helping of stress for the working body as it makes a rapid change from sleep to activity, and from the relaxing weekend to the pressures of work. \\"When people get up, their blood pressure and heart rate go up and there are hormonal changes in their bodies, \\"Willich explained. \\"All these things can have an unfavorable effect in the blood system and increase the risk of a clot which will cause a heart attack.\\" \\"When people return to work after a weekend off, the pace of their life changes. They have a higher workload, more stress, more anger and more physical activities,\\"said Willich.

The reasons for this can be inferred from the context of the review. Firstly, the customer notes that his son, who the product was bought for, is not interested in playing with the toy. This indicates that the purpose for which the product was bought (to engage and entertain the child) is not being fulfilled, leading to a likely dissatisfaction. Secondly, the specific areas of dissatisfaction are also highlighted; the child is more engaged with the on/off button and cartridge insertion/removal than with the main features supposedly providing entertainment, such as the sounds and sights.

Standoff: Goerge Pickering, pictured, allegedly threatened to kill a nurse. A distraught father who caused a four-hour standoff with police in a Texas hospital allegedly pointed his gun at a nurse and yelled 'I'll kill all of y'all'. Police said George Pickering, 57, made the threats from a hospital room after becoming inconsolable over the treatment of his son - a patient in critical care at Tomball Regional Hospital, near Houston. Armed police and a SWAT team descended on the medical center - and eventually convinced Pickering to surrender after a four-hour standoff on Saturday night. Pickering was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and is being held on a 30,000 bond, a statement from the Tomball Police department said. Detectives said Pickering was in the room with his son and family, waited for a nurse to come, then aimed his 9mm pistol at her. He then allegedly barricaded the room and threatened to kill anybody who came in.

Combine 3098*k and -3128*k: (3098 - 3128)*k = -30*k Now, the simplified equation is: -30*k + 180 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable k To isolate k, let's first move the constant term to the other side of the equation by subtracting 180 from both sides: -30*k + 180 - 180 = 0 - 180 -30*k = -180 Now, we have: -30*k = -180 Step 3: Solve for k To solve for k, divide both sides of the equation by -30: (-30*k) / (-30) = (-180) / (-30) k = 6 So, the solution for the given equation 3098*k - 3128*k + 180 = 0 is k = 6."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: Passage: Maurice had to continue the war against the Persians. In 586 his troops defeated them at the Battle of Solachon south of Dara. In 588, a mutiny by unpaid Byzantine troops against their new commander, Priscus, seemed to offer the Sassanids a chance for a breakthrough, but the mutineers themselves repulsed the ensuing Persian offensive. Later in the year they secured a major victory before Martyropolis. The Sassanid commander, Maruzas, was killed, several of the Persian leaders were captured along with 3,000 other prisoners, and only a thousand men survived to reach refuge at Nisibis. The Byzantines secured much booty, including the Persian battle standards, and sent them, along with Maruzas' head, to Maurice in Constantinople. In 590 two Parthian brothers, Vistahm and Vinduyih, overthrew King Hormizd IV and made the latter's son, Prince Khosrau II, the new King. The former Persian commander-in-chief, Bahram Chobin, who had rebelled against Hormizd IV, claimed the throne for himself and defeated Khosrau. Khosrau and the two Parthians fled to the Byzantine court. Although the Senate unanimously advised against it, Maurice helped Khosrau regain his throne with an army of 35,000 men. In 591 the combined Byzantine-Persian army under generals John Mystacon and Narses defeated Bahram Chobin's forces near Ganzak at the Battle of Blarathon. The victory was decisive; Maurice finally brought the war to a successful conclusion with the re-accession of Khosrau.

The county town is Lancaster although the county's administrative centre is Preston. The county has a population of 1,449,300 and an area of . People from Lancashire are known as Lancastrians. - The metropolitan counties are a type of county-level administrative division of England. There are six metropolitan counties, which each cover large urban areas, typically with populations of 1.2 to 2.8 million. They were created in 1972 and are each divided into several metropolitan districts or boroughs. - The Borough of Sefton is a metropolitan borough of Merseyside, England and its local authority is Sefton Council. Sefton was formed by the Local Government Act 1972 on 1 April 1974, by the amalgamation of the former county boroughs of Bootle and Southport, and, from the administrative county of Lancashire, the municipal borough of Crosby, the urban districts of Formby and Litherland, and part of the Rural District of West Lancashire. It also formed part of the new county of Merseyside. The borough consists of a coastal strip of land on the Irish Sea, and extends from Bootle in the south, to Southport in the north. In the south-east, it extends inland to Maghull. The district is bounded by Liverpool to the south, Knowsley to the south-east, and West Lancashire to the east. - Liverpool, in North West England, is a major city and metropolitan borough with an estimated population of 478,580 in 2015 within the City of Liverpool. Liverpool and its surrounding areas form the fifth largest metropolitan area in the UK, with an estimated population of over 2.24 million in 2011. The local authority is Liverpool City Council, which is the most populous local government district within the metropolitan county of Merseyside and the largest within the Liverpool City Region. - Great Crosby is an area of the town of Crosby, in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton, Merseyside, England and is historically, part of Lancashire. - The Local Government Act 1972 (c 70) is an Act of Parliament in the United Kingdom that reformed local government in England and Wales on 1 April 1974. - The River Mersey is a river in the north west of England. Its name is derived from the Anglo-Saxon language and translates as \\"boundary river\\". The river may have been the border between the ancient kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria and for centuries it formed part of the boundary between the historic counties of Lancashire and Cheshire. - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns. - A metropolitan borough is a type of local government district in England, and is a subdivision of a metropolitan county. Created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, metropolitan boroughs are defined in English law as metropolitan districts. However, all of them have been granted or regranted royal charters to give them borough status (as well as, in some cases, city status). Metropolitan boroughs have been effectively unitary authority areas since the abolition of the metropolitan county councils by the Local Government Act 1985. However, metropolitan boroughs pool much of their authority in joint boards and other arrangements that cover whole metropolitan counties, such as combined authorities. - Merseyside is a metropolitan county in North West England, with a population of 1.38 million. It encompasses the metropolitan area centred on both banks of the lower reaches of the Mersey Estuary, and comprises five metropolitan boroughs: Knowsley, St Helens, Sefton, Wirral, and the city of Liverpool.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Once the test is done, the doctor will send the cell sample to a lab for testing. It usually takes 1-3 weeks for the test results to come back, but your doctor should be able to give you a more accurate estimate. Ask them if you can expect them to call you or if the results will be posted in an online chart for you to view.If you don’t hear back within 3 weeks, call your doctor’s office and ask about the results. Most of the time, pap smear test results come back normal. Sometimes, however, you might get a result of “abnormal” or “unclear.” If this happens, don’t worry! Even an abnormal test result doesn’t necessarily mean that anything is seriously wrong. Talk to your doctor about scheduling a follow-up appointment for further tests. In rare cases, abnormal cells in a pap smear can be a sign of cancer in your cervix or uterus. If your doctor suspects that your test results might indicate a serious problem, they may have you come in for more tests, like a colonoscopy or a biopsy (tissue sample). Sometimes, your doctor will recommend that you wait 6 months to a year and then have another pap smear done. If the abnormal cells are still there or if they see major changes since your last exam, they might decide to do further testing. How often you need to get a pap smear depends on a lot of things, such as your age, your medical history, and how high your risk is for problems like cervical cancer or sexually transmitted infections. Work with your doctor to figure out the best time for you to come in for your next routine pap smear and pelvic exam. Most doctors recommend that you get your first pap smear at age 21, and then follow up every 3 years (or more often if there are abnormal results). Once you’re 30, you can reduce the frequency to once every 5 years unless you have an abnormal pap smear.

Plus, the Eagles were dealing with injuries on defense to S Rodney McLeod, CB Ronald Darby and backup S Corey Graham leaving Malcolm Jenkins and Chris Maragos the only healthy safeties. Despite all of the setbacks, The Eagles hosted the 0-2 Giants who have only scored 13 points through the first 2 weeks of the season. Both teams started off in slow fashion, with no first quarter points. A LeGarrette Blount 1 yard touchdown run in the second quarter were the only points of the first half, after the Eagles stopped the Giants from reaching the end zone from 1 yard out to close out the first half. Coming out in the third quarter with a 7-0 lead, the Eagles added the only points of the third quarter with Carson Wentz finding tight end Zach Ertz for a 3-yard touchdown. The Eagles defense (who were playing a solid game) broke down in the fourth quarter allowing the Giants to score 21 unanswered points to start the fourth quarter, as quarterback Eli Manning found his all pro wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. twice for touchdowns, and second year wide receiver Sterling Shepard once for a 77-yard touchdown. Fletcher Cox left the game with a calf injury. Eagles rookie running back Corey Clement ran for a 15-yard touchdown to tie the score at 21. After exchanging field goals, Wentz and the Eagles offense took over, looking to move into field goal range. Wentz connected with Alshon Jeffery for a 17-yard pass, setting up a Jake Elliott 61 yard field goal attempt with 1 second remaining. Elliott converted on the 61 yard attempt, the longest in Eagles franchise history as time expired. Wentz was quietly efficient in the game, completing 21 of 31 attempts for 176 yards and one touchdown despite playing behind a struggling offensive line. The win came at an expense, as running back Darren Sproles was ruled out for the remainder of the season with a broken arm and torn ACL, both of which occurred on the same play. Despite this injury, the Eagles ran the ball efficiently through most of the game. With the close win, the Eagles advanced to 2-1 tying the Cowboys and the Redskins for first place in the NFC East while the Giants fell to 0-3 in the basement of the division.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Read this: In the early part of the 20th century, San Diego hosted two World's Fairs: the Panama-California Exposition in 1915 and the California Pacific International Exposition in 1935. Both expositions were held in Balboa Park, and many of the Spanish/Baroque-style buildings that were built for those expositions remain to this day as central features of the park. The buildings were intended to be temporary structures, but most remained in continuous use until they progressively fell into disrepair. Most were eventually rebuilt, using castings of the original façades to retain the architectural style. The menagerie of exotic animals featured at the 1915 exposition provided the basis for the San Diego Zoo. During the 1950s there was a citywide festival called Fiesta del Pacifico highlighting the area's Spanish and Mexican past. In the 2010s there was a proposal for a large-scale celebration of the 100th anniversary of Balboa Park, but the plans were abandoned when the organization tasked with putting on the celebration went out of business.

Nicholas Rodney Drake (19 June 1948 – 25 November 1974) was an English singer-songwriter and musician known for his acoustic guitar-based songs. He failed to find a wide audience during his lifetime, but his work has since achieved wider recognition.Drake signed to Island Records when he was 20, while a student at the University of Cambridge, and released his debut album, Five Leaves Left, in 1969. By 1972, he had recorded two more albums, Bryter Layter and Pink Moon. Neither sold more than 5,000 copies on initial release. His reluctance to perform live or give interviews contributed to his lack of commercial success. No footage of the adult Drake has been released, only still photographs.Drake is believed to have suffered from depression, reflected in his lyrics. After making Pink Moon, he withdrew from performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire. At the age of 26, Drake died from an overdose of approximately 30 amitriptyline pills, a prescribed antidepressant. His cause of death was determined as suicide.The 1979 release of the retrospective album Fruit Tree triggered a reassessment of Drake's music. By the mid-1980s, he was credited as an influence by such artists as Robert Smith, David Sylvian, and Peter Buck. In 1985, the Dream Academy reached the UK and US charts with \\"Life in a Northern Town\\", a song written for and dedicated to Drake. By the early 1990s, he had come to represent a \\"doomed romantic\\" musician in the UK music press. The first Drake biography was published in 1997, followed in 1998 by the documentary film A Stranger Among Us. In 1999, his song \\"Pink Moon\\" was used in a Volkswagen commercial, resulting in an increase in his U.S. album sales. By 2014, more than 2.4 million Nick Drake albums had been sold in the UK and the US. A:","completion":"Drake"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The director and two stars of LAURA (1944) were reteamed for this solid policier: Dana Andrews is the son of a criminal who becomes a cop to cut all ties with the past but cannot keep his inherited violent ways in check while interrogating suspects and, one night, he goes too far; Gene Tierney is the estranged wife of his victim, a decorated war hero who has become involved with the town's leading racketeer and Andrews' No. 1 nemesis, Gary Merrill (who had himself been the protégé of Andrews Snr.)! As usual with Preminger, this is a well-crafted movie with a notable opening credits sequence and enlivened by a good cast that also includes Karl Malden (as Andrews' incumbent superior), Tom Tully (as Tierney's motor-mouth taxi driver dad) and Neville Brand (as Merrill's chief thug), with notable support also coming from Craig Stevens (as the slimy, wife-beating victim), Bert Freed (as Andrews' sympathetic partner) and Robert F. Nolan (as Andrews' stern outgoing superior). Having already been warned by the latter to mend his ways or else, Andrews panics and impersonates Stevens for a couple of hours following his murder to put the police on the (in this case) wrong tracks of Merrill; however, after Tully becomes the prime suspect (by which time Andrews and Tierney are romantically involved), the cop goes by himself in Merrill's lair fully intending to get bumped off and 'frame' the racketeer for his own murder!

There is strange machinery and equations on some blackboards within the house. He talks to somebody in a building nearby, and that person promises to get in touch with him immediately. The other man says that the man with the bandaged face is approaching him. The voice leads him to the other building through a path in the grass illuminated by many lights. Héctor sees more machinery and wonders aloud what all that is for. This is the time machine. Through the window, Héctor can see the car - driven by the man with the bandaged face. He gets into the time machine and travels an hour back in time.The young man in charge of the time machine, El Joven, (Nacho Vigalondo) does not recognise Héctor. The young man explains to Hector (Héctor 2) that he must not interfere with the other Héctor (Héctor 1) so he can go into the time machine again, leaving one Héctor instead of two. Héctor can't help but phone his home, worried that Clara is with \\"a different man\\". However, he doesn't dare say anything. El Joven tells Héctor 2 off, but things still happened as they should have. Héctor 2 tries to avoid temptation and not phone his wife again. Héctor 2 leaves with the young man's car and stops when he sees the young lady riding her bike to the village nearby.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is it possible to conclude that \\"a boy runs through the puddle.\\" if \\"the kid ran through the water on the ground on his birthday\\"?","completion":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that \\"a boy runs through the puddle\\" if given the statement \\"the kid ran through the water on the ground on his birthday,\\" assuming certain elements and context are clarified and inferred. To understand the connection between the two statements, we need to analyze each element mentioned. 1. \\"A boy\\" and \\"the kid\\": Both terms refer to a young male child. While \\"a boy\\" is general and could refer to any young male, \\"the kid\\" could denote that the speaker might have specific knowledge about the child, referring to a specific boy. 2. \\"Runs\\" and \\"ran\\": These are different verb forms in the present (runs) and simple past (ran), but they are related as they belong to the same verb \\"to run.\\" Based on this information, we can understand that the child is performing the same action in both statements; the only discrepancy is the time frame. 3. \\"Through the puddle\\" and \\"through the water on the ground\\": These phrases refer to similar settings but with slight variations. A puddle is generally defined as a small pool of liquid, typically water, on the ground. \\"Water on the ground\\" is a more general description that could include a puddle or any other body of water that happens to be on the ground. 4. \\"On his birthday\\": This phrase provides a specific time frame and context in which the event occurred. The child was running through the water on his birthday, and this context was not mentioned in the first statement. Based on the elements mentioned above, we can conclude that it is possible to draw a connection between the two statements, but we must take into consideration the differences in time frame and context. If we assume the simplified action of a boy running through the water on the ground and that \\"the kid\\" is indeed a boy, we can infer that \\"a boy runs through the puddle\\" is a simplified or more generalized version of the original statement. However, it's important to note that this conclusion is based on assumptions and lacks the specifics, mainly the time frame, that the child performed this action on his birthday. So to provide an accurate and comprehensive understanding, one could say: \\"On his birthday, a boy ran through the puddle,\\" ensuring that the context is maintained in the new statement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: With almost two years left of my law degree, and with no intention of doing anything so idiotic as actually attending lectures or studying law, I had plenty of time to come up with my next bid for online fame. The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation. My days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week. And with that, The Friday Thing was born. To promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday. We created an official website explaining our demands, registered a web address - letsgetitoff.com (snigger) - and sent a press release to the media. Clearly we had tapped into a seam of strong feeling among the nation's overworked... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Michigan will lose 2 million in federal funding and 600,000 in state funding to provide legal aid to the poor in 2003, according to Deierdre L. Weir, executive director of the Legal Aid and Defender Association, Inc., the state's largest provider of legal services to the poor. Current federal funds of nearly 10.7 million from the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) will drop to 8.7 million for next year, according to Weir. She said that the reductions reflect a decline in the number of persons in the state who are living in poverty, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2000 census. LSC uses census data to determine funding across the nation, and according to the census, the state's poverty population fell from an estimated 1.2 million in 1990 to an estimated 968,000 in 2000. The state's legal aid agencies are also bracing for yet another cut in 2003 of some 600,000 of state funding. A portion of filing fees paid by litigants in the state's circuit courts, and a portion of interest on lawyers trust accounts (IOLTA) are earmarked for Michigan legal aid programs. These funds are expected to drop from currently 7.5 million in 2002 to 6.9 million when the Michigan State Bar Foundation makes distributions next year. Most of the decrease is attributed to the past year's low interest rates. \\"The irony of these funding cuts is that while there may be fewer poor people in Michigan today, the demand for service will not change because the poverty population remains so large and the legal aid funding so little that local providers will never able to serve all who need our service,\\" said Weir. \\"It's as if the poor will be victimized twice-once for being poor and again as victims of these funding cuts.\\" The U.S. Census Bureau, in spite of its best efforts, cannot locate every poor person living in a census tract, therefore the poor are also undercounted, added Weir. The brunt of these cuts will be felt most in Wayne County where according to the census some 333,000 poor people live, the largest concentration of poverty in the state. LAD will lose more than 870,000 for legal aid in Wayne County, nearly half of the state's total loss, said Weir. While difficult to measure, the loss of funds will mean that several thousand of Michigan's poor in need of legal service will not receive it, or they will receive significantly limited service. Cutbacks will include service in such civil legal matters as landlord-tenant, bankruptcy, consumer, child custody, predatory lending, mortgage foreclosure, utility shutoffs, social security, wills, and probate. \\"Local providers will have to work harder and smarter and use more technology instead of staff to provide as much service as we can with fewer dollars,\\" said Weir. \\"We will be providing more selfhelp training to clients enabling them to navigate the legal system on their own in routine matters, more assistance on the telephone, and less direct representation by attorneys in specific, high impact matters. Currently, Michigan has 13 legal aid agencies covering the state's 83 counties. Question: \\"How is Legal Aid and Defender Association planning to cope with the funding drops?\\" Answer: \\"Cutbacks in legal services\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"No, the provided answer is not a direct and detailed answer to the question. Below is a more accurate and detailed answer: The Legal Aid and Defender Association (LAD) plans to cope with the funding drops by implementing several strategies to continue providing service to as many clients as possible under the reduced budget. Deierdre L. Weir, the executive director of LAD, mentioned the following approaches: 1. Working harder and smarter - LAD will refine its processes and increase efficiency to make the best use of available resources. 2. Leveraging technology - LAD will rely more on technology to provide services instead of staff, helping to reduce overhead costs. 3. Promoting self-help - LAD will offer more self-help training sessions to clients, empowering them to navigate the legal system independently for routine matters. 4. Emphasizing telephone assistance - LAD will provide more assistance over the phone to continue supporting clients without the need for face-to-face consultations. 5. Focusing on high impact matters - LAD will prioritize direct representation by attorneys in specific, high impact matters, ensuring that scarce resources are allocated to cases with the greatest potential for positive outcomes. By implementing these strategies, LAD aims to continue supporting Michigan's poor in need of legal assistance, even in light of the significant funding cuts. The organization is committed to adapting its operations to maintain a level of service that meets the demands of their clients."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"What description was not used to describe Mary: accursed or holy?\\" is in \\"It is admitted that the doctrine as defined by Pius IX was not explicitly mooted before the 12th century. It is also agreed that \\"no direct or categorical and stringent proof of the dogma can be brought forward from Scripture\\". But it is claimed that the doctrine is implicitly contained in the teaching of the Fathers. Their expressions on the subject of the sinlessness of Mary are, it is pointed out, so ample and so absolute that they must be taken to include original sin as well as actual. Thus in the first five centuries such epithets as \\"in every respect holy\\", \\"in all things unstained\\", \\"super-innocent\\", and \\"singularly holy\\" are applied to her; she is compared to Eve before the fall, as ancestress of a redeemed people; she is \\"the earth before it was accursed\\". The well-known words of St. Augustine (d. 430) may be cited: \\"As regards the mother of God,\\" he says, \\"I will not allow any question whatever of sin.\\" It is true that he is here speaking directly of actual or personal sin. But his argument is that all men are sinners; that they are so through original depravity; that this original depravity may be overcome by the grace of God, and he adds that he does not know but that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin \\"of every sort\\" (omni ex parte).\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","completion":"Based on the text provided, the description that was not used to describe Mary is \\"accursed\\". This deduction is obtained from the phrases used in the text such as \\"in every respect holy\\", \\"in all things unstained\\", \\"super innocent\\", and \\"singularly holy\\", and \\"the earth before it was accursed\\". All these epithets show Mary in a positive light, using words like \\"holy\\", \\"unstained\\", and \\"super innocent\\". When the text says \\"she is compared to Eve before the fall, as the ancestress of a redeemed people; she is the earth before it was accursed\\", it's saying she is likened to the earth before it fell under any curse.

Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S. Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs the highest level playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University consist entirely of chairback seating.) - Basketball is a sport that is played by two teams of five players on a rectangular court. The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop in diameter and mounted at a height of to backboards at each end of the court. The game was invented in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, who would be the first basketball coach of the Kansas Jayhawks, one of the most successful programs in the game's history. - Women's basketball is one of the few women's sports that developed in tandem with its men's counterpart. It became popular, spreading from the east coast of the United States to the west coast, in large part via women's colleges. From 1895 until 1970, the term \\"women's basketball\\" was also used to refer to netball, which evolved in parallel with modern women's basketball. - The Big Ten Conference (B1G), formerly Western Conference and Big Nine Conference, is the oldest Division I collegiate athletic conference in the United States.

Write some highlights for the following article: Around 90 new pieces of gold and silver have been unearthed in the field where the Staffordshire Hoard of Anglo-Saxon treasure was found three years ago. The fresh discoveries, made in recent weeks at Hammerwich, near Lichfield, include what is thought to be a part of a helmet and an eagle-shaped object, Staffordshire County Council said. Speaking at a press conference in Stoke-on-Trent, council leader Philip Atkins confirmed that many of pieces weighed less than a gram. Newly discovered Anglo Saxon treasure is unveiled at a press conference at the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery in Stoke on Trent, Staffordshire today. Eighty-one of the items were declared treasure trove. They include part of a helmet, an eagle and a cross. The new items were found in the same. field where over 3,900 pieces of gold, silver and some copper alloy. objects were found in 2009. The first discovery was made by a metal detectorist, who had permission to scan the land. Archaeologists discovered the largest ever find of Anglo Saxon gold and. silver metal work from this country. In total the hoard included over 5kg of gold, 1.5kg of silver and thousands of small garnets. Mr Atkins said: 'The ploughing of the same field has unearthed a small number of other gold and silver finds. 'While it is far too early to say exactly what they are, or how old they are, they are certainly interesting finds.' South Staffordshire Coroner Andrew Haigh is expected to rule whether the haul of 90 items should be declared treasure at an inquest on January 4. The five hectare field was examined by a team of archaeologists - who have previously worked on battlesites at Bosworth and Hastings - once it had been ploughed at the end of November. South Staffordshire Coroner Andrew Haigh will rule at an inquest planned for January 4 if the metalwork pieces are part of the Anglo Saxon collection and should be declared treasure. Staffordshire County Council Leader Philip Atkins, said: 'The Staffordshire Hoard was an amazing discovery, and we have been immensely proud to play our part in helping to discover and tell the story of a collection of such international importance. 'We will now have to wait for the inquest, to discover if the objects are a significant part of our national history.' The new items were found in the same field where over 3,900 pieces of gold, silver and some copper alloy objects were found in 2009. The new artefacts have tentatively been dated to the 7th or 8th centuries, placing the origin of the items in the time of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia. The latest find includes parts of a helmet. The team has been using x-ray images to piece together objects they find. The first discovery was made by a metal detectorist, who had permission to scan the land. Following the discovery three years ago, English Heritage immediately recognised the exceptional significance of the finds and provided emergency funding at the start of the dig together with continued expert advice, support and funding for the research and preservation of the Staffordshire Hoard. Archaeologists working with Staffordshire County Council later carried out the excavation of the field and discovered the largest ever find of Anglo Saxon gold and silver metal work from this country. In total the hoard included over 5kg of gold, 1.5kg of silver and thousands of small garnets. Treasure is defined by the law as any gold or silver objects, or coins, more than 300 years old which were deliberately hidden. Under the 1996 Treasure Act, any treasure found in England and Wales belongs to the Crown. Anyone who finds what they suspect may be treasure must report it to the local coroner within 14 days of discovery. If they don't, they risk a three-month jail sentence or a £5,000 fine. If an inquest declares that a find is treasure, it is offered to the British Museum or a local museum who has it officially valued by an independent board of antiquities experts. If they want the find, they must pay the market value of the treasure to the finder and/or landowner. If they don't, the finder can keep it. Normally, any treasure belongs to the landowner. However, a landowner can agree to split the reward with a metal detector enthusiast. They include a bishop’s pectoral cross, a large folded cross, a helmet cheek piece, a filigree seahorse and numerous sword fittings including hilt plates and pommel caps. The pieces appear to date from the seventh century, although there is some debate among experts as to when the hoard first entered the ground. The dig was closed when archaeologists were confident they had retrieved everything that was recoverable at the time. Last month, a team of archaeologists and experienced metal detectorists from Archaeology Warwickshire returned to the field when it was ploughed and recovered further material. These are currently being examined and x-rayed at a specialist archives laboratory. After the Staffordshire Hoard was declared treasure a huge fundraising campaign was launched to bring the treasure back to the West Midlands. The discovery, circled in red, was made in the same field where the Staffordshire Hoard, the largest collection of Anglo Saxon treasure was recovered in 2009. Staffordshire County Archaeologist Stephen Dean addresses a press conference about newly discovered Anglo Saxon treasure at the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery in Stoke on Trent, Staffordshire. The Hoard was valued at £3.3m by independent experts at the British Museum - the most valuable treasure discovery ever made. The fundraising campaign was led by The Art Fund, and featured a major donation from the National Heritage Memorial Fund. The Staffordshire Hoard is the largest collection of Anglo-Saxon gold and silver metalwork ever found, anywhere in the world. The two men who fell out over £3.3million after finding Saxon treasure. could scoop another fortune - after more artefacts were found in the. same field. Terry Herbert, 57, discovered the ancient gold and silver haul on 68-year-old farmer Fred Johnson's land three years ago. Their find, dubbed the Staffordshire Hoard, was sold to museums after. becoming an international sensation after the discovery on July 5, 2009. - leaving the men rich. But the duo fell out over the cash, with Terry claiming Fred wanted it all for himself. He even said his find of 3,900 artefacts - Britain's largest ever. haul of Anglo-Saxon treasure - was a curse and blamed it on ruining his. friendship with Fred. But yesterday it emerged the pair, who have not spoken since their. rift, are set to earn hundreds of thousands of pounds more after 90. gold and silver items were unearthed close to the original find. Experts are currently examining the finds and South Staffordshire. Coroner Andrew Haigh will rule at an inquest on January 4 if the pieces. are part of the Anglo-Saxon collection. If they are ruled to be from the same collection they will be officially declared treasure before being valued. The proceeds from the sale of the treasure will then be split between Terry and Fred. Discovered in a field near the village of Hammerwich, on 5 July 2009, it consists of more than 3,900 items. The artefacts have tentatively been dated to the 7th or 8th centuries, placing the origin of the items in the time of the Kingdom of Mercia. One of the new items of Anglo Saxon treasure being examined by archaeologists. Over 90 small items were discovered. The artefacts have tentatively been dated to the 7th or 8th centuries, placing the origin of the items in the time of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia, and include part of a helmet (shown here) and an object resembling an eagle. The find includes what is believed to be part of a cheekguard from a golden helmet. The Staffordshire haul consisted of over 3,500 items that are nearly all martial in character and contains no objects specific to female uses. Highlights:","completion":"1.

This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative. This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it; although this claim has been widely disputed. Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird. According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg, Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: \\"They discussed publishing Mockingbird first, Watchman last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.\\" This assertion has been discredited however by the rare books expert James S.

Don't get me wrong, I'm a true Billie Jean King fan, but here's why I'm not joining the chorus praising Obama – or other leaders. There's no mention of Russia's human rights abuses in the US president's announcement, or any suggestion of genuine political action. Just the use of the word \\"diversity\\" twice. It hardly qualifies as a \\"strong signal\\", but that hasn't stopped the American press from spinning it that way. In the past 10 days alone, five western political leaders have said they'll be skipping the 2014 winter games in Sochi. There wasn't much response to the first public declaration, by Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk. But German President Joachim Gauck soon followed suit, as did European Union Commissioner for Justice, Citizenship and Fundamental Rights, Viviane Reding. The next day's announcement by President Obama that he was \\"unlikely\\" to attend was followed closely by French President Francois Hollande's declaration that neither he nor any high-ranking French officials would appear. None but Reding has publicly declared their decision to be a boycott of Sochi, or said anything about Russia's draconian anti-LGBT legislation. Still, the press has quickly, and perhaps mistakenly, concluded that the brutal oppression of LGBT Russians is these figures' primary concern – a conclusion that may make them seem more courageous than they really are, and handily covers for other agendas. In the absence of any declarations or salient political responses to Russia's anti-LGBT laws from Germany, the US, France, or Poland, it seems reasonable to wonder if, in fact, something else is at play here. Fear of being caught on the wrong side of history? Or a desire to humiliate and isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin for doing virtually everything imaginable to tick off the west, from sheltering Edward Snowden to jailing protestors from Greenpeace to Pussy Riot, to supporting the Syrian and Ukrainian regimes, while posing as the voice of reason in the New York Times? But why get into all of this nastiness when it's possible to stay home, remain silent, and have your behavior construed as moral rectitude? Whatever the true feelings of any of these western leaders when it comes to LGBT rights, this much is safe to say: none of them is eager to have a photo op with Putin right now. Not when his aggressive consolidation of power and quashing of any opposition is so blatant. And not at an event where there's so much potential for violence and bad press – all of it recorded in real time by dozens of broadcasters and blasted across the universe via Twitter and Facebook and through every imaginable online site. All of the signs of potential danger are flashing yellow. Months ago, Putin declared virtual martial law in Sochi, banning all protests, marches, and public gatherings for the duration of the Olympics. Unsurprisingly, the \\"protest zones\\" that Putin unveiled recently, in an attempt, one supposes, to calm increasingly anxious corporate sponsors and western nations, will be something of a joke – more of a snare for catching dissidents than a venue for free speech. And who will be the brave political advisor to tell the president that having Russian security forces kill four alleged terrorists near Sochi earlier this week may in fact not be the kind of thing that makes the average American feel better about visiting? And yes, it's a particularly bad time for world leaders to be seen with Putin, now when the true implications of Russia's anti-LGBT laws and the atmosphere of violence they've encouraged have become so readily apparent. On Monday, Tonight Show host Jay Leno conveyed to his millions of viewers the same message that LGBT journalists and activists have been trying to get across for months, and that NBC, which has paid 4bn to broadcast in the United States, has been so eager to downplay: contemporary Russia looks increasingly like early Nuremberg-era Germany, with its insistence that Jews were a threat to the purity of its bloodline and the moral fiber of its children. Each successive day's news makes it harder to ignore Russia's movement towards fascism – or the similarities between the Kremlin's venal campaign and what came to be Germany's Final Solution. Not with last week's call, by a Russian TV star before a cheering audience, for a Holocaust rerun – for his kids' sake. Ivan Okhlobystin, the star of a Russian copy of \\"Scrubs\\", told fans in the city of Novosibirsk on Sunday: I'd burn them all alive in ovens. It's Sodom and Gomorrah, as a religious person I can't be indifferent to it, it's a living threat to my children. It would be one thing if Okhlobystin were a lone outlier. But he isn't the only Russian celebrity to have made such pronouncements to an enthusiastic crowd. Last year, that honor fell to Russia's leading news anchor, Dmitry Kiselyov, who said – before a live TV audience in the run-up to the enactment of the anti-LGBT laws: I believe it is not enough to impose fines on gays for engaging in the propaganda of homosexuality among adolescents. We need to ban them from donating blood and sperm, and if they die in car accidents, we need to bury their hearts in the ground or burn them, as they are unsuitable for the aiding of anyone's life. Will Kiselyov bring his same flare for Third Reich rhetoric to Russia's TV coverage of the Sochi Olympics this winter? Viewers will have a chance to see, now that he's been appointed head of the new Kremlin-dominated network that Putin created last week, after liquidating RIA Novosti, and with it any pretense of an independent media outlet. It remains to be seen whether there will be any truly brave, outspoken political opposition to Putin's witch-hunt. Certainly Germany's Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Britain's Prime Minister, David Cameron, are now under pressure to act. But more interesting is the question of whether others will prod Western leaders from Europe and the United States into genuine political engagement with Russia over its human rights abuses. Imagine how the stakes will rise if Argentina's President, Cristina Elisabet Fernández de Kirchner – who took on her country's Catholic hierarchy and staked her reputation on making LGBT marriage legal years before Germany, France, or the United States – decides to offer political asylum to the thousands of LGBT Russians terrified that a new law will strip LGBT people with children of their parental rights? What if Chile's President-elect Michele Bachelet puts the politicians responsible for the country's draconian anti-LGBT laws on a visa ban list? It would certainly be a welcome change from what we're seeing now: these low-risk, high-gain gestures from Gaucke, Obama and Hollande. The kind that tap the gAyTM at reelection time and earn plenty of free publicity, but without the expenditure of any serious political capital. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"This news article is talking about how some world leaders, like President Obama, are not attending the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. This is because of Russia's bad treatment of LGBT people. People are happy that Obama included Billie Jean King, a famous tennis player and openly gay woman, in the US delegation, but the article says that this is not enough. Many other leaders from places like Germany, France, and Poland, are not attending the Olympics, but they are not giving specific reasons like Russia's anti-LGBT laws. The article questions if these western leaders are avoiding the Sochi Olympics for other reasons, like not wanting to be seen with Russian President Vladimir Putin or because they are worried about potential violence and bad press at the event. The article also talks about how some Russian celebrities have made terrible comments about LGBT people, and it mentions the possibility of other countries like Argentina and Chile taking stronger actions against Russia's human rights abuses. In the end, the article wants to see more genuine political engagement with Russia instead of just avoiding the Olympics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

President's party takes hits in South Korean midterm elections Candidates supporting President Lee Myung-bak, who has worked closely with the Obama administration in responding to the ship's sinking, won six out of 16 races for metropolitan mayor and provincial governor, according to the National Election Commission. The main opposition Democratic Party -- which accuses Lee of using the ship's sinking for political gain, and whose leaders have stridently criticized an investigation that blames the incident on North Korea -- won seven major races, returns showed. About 48 percent of voters supported candidates from the Democratic Party and two other opposition parties, while 40 percent voted for candidates from Lee's ruling Grand National Party (GNP), according to the election commission. In midterm elections four years ago, GNP candidates won more than 50 percent of the vote. In Seoul, the capital and largest city, Mayor Oh Se-hoon of the GNP won a narrow reelection victory, while independent candidates and small parties won the other major races. Still, the Democratic Party claimed a victory. \\"The people handed a solemn judgment to the Lee Myung-bak administration,\\" spokesman Woo Sang-ho said, calling the results a \\"public verdict against the Lee government's arrogance and self-righteousness.\\" A ruling party spokesman, Cho Hae-jin, said the GNP \\"humbly accepts the voice of the public expressed in this election.\\" Party chief Chung Mong-joon said Thursday that he would resign in the wake of the setback. Turnout was unusually high, nearly 55 percent, the highest for a non-presidential election in 15 years. \\"The public sentiment to check the GNP and keep the balance seemed to have reduced the gap between the ruling and opposition parties,\\" said Jeong Han-wool, executive director at the East Asia Institute, a Seoul-based research group. \\"The ship incident seems to have reinforced the existing conservative votes for the ruling party, but was not enough to change the minds of independent and left-leaning voters.\\" Even before the ship sank two months ago, killing 46 sailors and triggering a major international security crisis, Lee and his ruling party appeared likely to lose ground in nationwide voting to fill nearly 4,000 local positions. An international investigation -- run by South Korea with the help of experts from the United States, Australia, Sweden and Britain -- determined two weeks ago that a North Korean mini-submarine fired a North Korean-made torpedo that ripped apart the 1,200-ton Cheonan in late March. Evidence showed overwhelmingly, the investigation said, that the North Korean military plotted to sink the ship. As part of punitive measures against the North, Lee last week announced trade and transport sanctions, as well as anti-submarine exercises to be held with U.S. Navy ships in the Yellow Sea. Those exercises are scheduled to begin next week. Recent polls had shown that most voters would take the Cheonan's sinking into consideration. They also showed that Lee's move to punish North Korea had majority support and that the president's popularity had risen from the mid-40s to just over 50 percent. The main opposition Democratic Party, however, has accused Lee's party of manipulating news about the ship's sinking to win votes. Special correspondent Yoonjung Seo contributed to this report. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important aspects of this text highlight the results and implications of the South Korean midterm elections. The ruling party led by President Lee Myung-bak, the Grand National Party (GNP), faced setbacks, winning only six out of 16 mayoral and gubernatorial races. In contrast, the main opposition Democratic Party (DP) won seven major races. The total vote shares showed a drop in support for the GNP, garnering only 40% compared to 50% four years prior. The opposition Democratic Party accused the GNP of using the Cheonan ship sinking incident for political gain in the elections. The high voter turnout, the highest for a non-presidential election in 15 years, up to 55%, indicates the public's desire for a more balanced political landscape in South Korea. Although President Lee Myung-bak's popularity and support for his decision to punish North Korea had increased, it wasn't enough to sway independent and left-leaning voters. Overall, the election results demonstrate the public's dissatisfaction with Lee Myung-bak's administration and their desire for more political balance in the country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Time If Melania Trump is first lady, she'll focus efforts on putting an end to bullying on social media. In her first solo speech since the Republican National Convention, Melania Trump on Thursday called for an end to online bullying of children and teenagers, saying, it is \\"absolutely unacceptable when it’s done with no name hiding on the internet.\\" “Technology has changed our universe. But like anything that is powerful it can have a bad side. We have seen this already. As adults, many of us are able to handle mean words — even lies. Children and teenagers can be fragile. They hurt when they are made fun of or made to feel less in looks or intelligence. This makes their life hard and forces them to hide and retreat. Our culture has gotten too mean and too rough especially to children and to teenagers.” \\"We have to find a better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other,\\" she continued. She did not make any reference to the fact that her husband has engaged throughout the campaign in bare-knuckled personal attacks on his political opponents, the media, random celebrities and a host of others. Hello! We’ve got complete midterm election coverage right here. Let’s begin! Her speech in Berwyn, Pa. — a suburb of Philadelphia — was directed at suburban women, a group that could be critical if Trump wants to pull-off a win next week. \\"People have asked me, if Donald is the President, what kind of First Lady will you be?\\" Melania Trump said. \\"It will be my honor and privilege to serve this country. I will be an advocate for women and for children.\\" Trump’s wife has stayed mostly out of the spotlight since her speech at this year’s Republican National Convention, which included a section taken directly from Michelle Obama’s 2008 convention speech. She was joined on the trail Thursday by Indiana Gov. Mike Pence's wife Karen — who gave a glowing introduction. Melania Trump focused on her upbringing in Slovenia and making it to America. \\"I'm an immigrant and let me tell you no one values the freedom and value of opportunity more than me,\\" Melania Trump said. She said it took her 10 years to become a U.S. citizen. \\"Love for this country is something we immediately shared when I met Donald.\\" \\"He certainly knows how to shake things up — doesn’t he?\\" she asked, eliciting cheers from the crowd. Washington Post-ABC News tracking polls released this week have Donald Trump losing white, college-educated women by roughly two dozen points. Mitt Romney won the group by 6 points according to exit polls. One way the campaign has tried to appeal to suburban voters in Pennsylvania is to dispatch some of his less bombastic surrogates to the area. His daughter Ivanka Trump held a series of “coffee with Ivanka” events in the Philadelphia suburbs last month. Melania Trump delivers remarks at a campaign rally in Berwyn, Pa. Nov. 3, 2016. (Photo: Mandel Ngan, AFP/Getty Images) Pennsylvania is one of a handful of states critical to Donald Trump's election. Currently, Clinton leads by an average of 3 points, but polls over the last week have shown a tightening in the race. “Pennsylvania is a state that we are confident winning. It’s a state (whose) makeup fully relates to Mr. Trump’s message as well as Mrs. Trump’s message,” Boris Epsteyn, a senior adviser to the campaign, told USA TODAY on Thursday. The campaign has spent a significant amount of time in Chester County, a Philadelphia suburb, where the city of Berwyn is located. It’s a county in battleground Pennsylvania full of white, college-educated voters, a demographic with which Donald Trump has struggled. Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2eYmJvH ||||| Here is our bleak present: a time in which Melania Trump can stand before a Pennsylvania audience to denounce “mean words” and bullying on social media. In a speech on Thursday, Melania Trump—a woman who has utilized her own social media presence to encourage the harassment of journalist, and is the wife of a man who uses Twitter as a place to settle personal affronts, perceived or otherwise—described “our culture” as “too mean and too rough.” In a speech rich with apparently unnoticed irony, Trump said: Like anything that is powerful, it can have a bad side. We have seen this already. As adults, many of us are able to handle mean words, even lies. Children and teenagers can be fragile. They are hurt when they are made fun of or made to feel less in looks and intelligence. [...] Our culture has gotten too mean and too rough, especially for children and teenagers. It’s never okay when a 12-year-old child is mocked. [...] We have to find a better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other... Advertisement Trump’s speech was a carefully threaded needle that differentiated between adults, some of whom are “able to handle” mean words and lies, and children who are victims of a culture of meanness (Who created this culture? Who’s to say?). Mocking a 12-year-old is, apparently, out of bounds, but ogling teenage girls is fine. Also fine, we can assume: sexual assault, harassing female journalists, calling adult women “mean words,” boy’s talk, and unabashed racism. The only delineation is that such tactics cannot be employed against anyone under 18; once someone is old enough to vote, then go ahead. Just a quick recap: words can hurt children, but the looming threat of political correctness hurts us all. ||||| (CNN) Melania Trump says she'd work to improve a social media culture that has gotten \\"too mean and too tough\\" -- riddled with insults based on \\"looks and intelligence\\" -- if she becomes first lady. But she didn't make any mention of the Twitter activities of her husband, Donald Trump, who has relentlessly attacked his political foes, journalists, critics and other entertainers for years with demeaning comments based on their appearances and intelligence. In a rare appearance on the campaign trail -- and her first solo speech since the convention this summer -- the wife of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump discussed her vision for her role in the White House for the first time Thursday in suburban Philadelphia. \\"It is never OK when a 12-year-old girl or boy is mocked, bullied or attacked. It is terrible when it happens on the playground, and it is absolutely unacceptable when it is done by someone with no name hiding on the internet. We have to find a better way to talk to each other,\\" Melania Trump said. \\"We must find better ways to honor and support the basic goodness of our children, especially in social media,\\" she said. \\"It will be one of the main focuses of my work, if I am privileged enough to become your first lady.\\" In September, after Clinton cited Trump's reference to 1996 Miss Universe Alicia Machado as \\"Miss Piggy\\" and \\"Miss Housekeeper\\" during their first presidential debate, Trump said in a 3 a.m. Twitter rant that Machado is \\"disgusting\\" and a \\"con\\" and directed followers to check out a non-existent Machado sex tape. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Melania Trump's speech will not serve to highlight her husband's most controversial and inflammatory tweets. \\"It won't for responsible journalists who wish to cover her entire speech/life journey,\\" Conway said, adding a shot at the Democratic nominee and the FBI investigation into her private email server. \\"And under that premise, would President Hillary Clinton never be able to talk law enforcement or corruption investigations again? Would she just abolish the DOJ and FBI?\\" It was Melania Trump's first speech since her appearance at the Republican National Convention, where her remarks triggered controversy because one section plagiarized Michelle Obama's 2008 Democratic National Committee speech. A speechwriter later apologized. She cast her husband as someone who's in touch with America's working class. \\"Every time my husband learned of a factory closing in Ohio or North Carolina or Pennsylvania, I could see him get very upset,\\" she said as she made the case that the Republican nominee can fix the nation's economic woes. Trump opened the speech by discussing her youth in Slovenia before immigrating to the United States, saying that \\"America meant if you could dream it, you could become it.\\" She said she went through a 10-year process of becoming a United States citizen, which she called \\"the greatest privilege in the world.\\" \\"I'm an immigrant, and no one values the freedoms and opportunities of America more than me,\\" she said. Melania Trump hasn't had a very public role on the campaign trail and has made it clear, publicly and privately, that her first priority is raising their 10-year-old son, Barron. But her speech Thursday was the first of what Donald Trump said in an interview with ABC would be two or three major speeches before the November 8 election. The speech took place in Berwyn, Pennsylvania -- in the suburbs of Philadelphia -- and was designed to help Trump win over the middle-class women in the region who could tip the balance of Pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes for Trump or Clinton. Conway worked with Melania Trump on the speech and was in attendance Thursday. Conway, Trump advisers said, has built a positive relationship with Melania over the course of the campaign. And Melania has privately been very supportive of Conway's role as the head of her husband's campaign. Melania Trump was introduced by Karen Pence, the wife of the Republican nominee's running mate Mike Pence. \\"I know that America will fall in love with her just as much as she loves the American people,\\" Karen Pence said. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"In her first solo speech since the Republican National Convention, Melania Trump, wife of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, pledged to combat cyber-bullying as the first lady. Melania Trump called for an end to online bullying of children and teenagers, stating that technology can have a negative side, and that children and teenagers are fragile and can be hurt by mean comments. The speech comes despite the fact that her husband, Donald Trump, has frequently engaged in personal attacks on social media against his political opponents, the media, and celebrities. Melania's speech in Berwyn, Pennsylvania was aimed at suburban women, a group that could be critical for Trump to win the election."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What are the best questions to ask during an interview? What are the most interesting questions asked in any interview? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"To identify the best and most interesting questions to ask during an interview, I'll first examine the goals of those questions and then list examples for each category. Finally, I'll analyze if the two categories overlap. Step 1: Identifying the goals ====== Best questions: The goal of the best questions is to thoroughly evaluate the candidate's qualifications, experience, and fit for the job and the company culture. They should also allow the interviewee to showcase their skills, problem-solving abilities, and values that align with the company's mission. Most interesting questions: The goal of the most interesting questions is to engage the candidate in a deep conversation and reveal unique and personal traits. These questions can lead to unexpected answers and insights, allowing the candidate to think outside the box and demonstrate their creativity and intelligence. Step 2: Listing examples of the best questions ====== 1. Can you please describe your job history and significant achievements within those roles? 2. What makes you the ideal candidate for this position? 3. Can you describe a challenging situation you faced at work and how you handled it? 4. How do you stay updated with industry trends and new technologies? 5. What types of work environments do you thrive in, and how do you contribute to a positive team culture?

Article: Plastic-cutting blades have a higher tooth count than a standard wood-cutting blade. This allows for a smoother cut without having jagged edges. It also helps prevent kickback if you’re using an electric saw. Ensure you’re using a blade meant for cutting plastic. Use a thicker blade so the plastic does not melt and stick back together. If you are trying to cut out smaller windows in larger sheets or making small handheld crafts, use a craft blade to chip away small bits of plastic. Drill holes to use as starting points for the blade and shave away the plastic until you reach the guide lines. Clamp a piece of straight wood across the plastic with the line you intend to cut hanging slightly over the edge to cut a straight line. Guide the saw through the plastic sheet, keeping your hand on the wide portion of the saw shoe. Jigsaws allow for better mobility as you make curved cuts into the plastic. Using a blade with 10 teeth per inch, turn the plastic to make the shapes you need. Drill holes in the plastic along the guide lines so your blade has places to start and stop easily. Make straight relief cuts from the outside of the plastic to the curves. This will help prevent the plastic from warping and shortens the cutting distance. Leave room between the guide lines you’ve drawn and where you cut. You can always file these down later. This type of saw makes cuts only when you pull it, unlike other hand saws that cut when you push and pull it. A pull saw helps make a cleaner, smoother line in your plastic and may be easier for making shorter straight cuts than an electric saw. Use your thumb to guide the blade when you make the initial cut. From there, place the saw into the line you’ve made and pull the saw through. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article discusses the process of cutting plastic using various tools and techniques. It emphasizes the importance of using a plastic-cutting blade with a higher tooth count for smoother cuts and prevention of kickback.

Today we're going to talk about how a taxi app from London called Hailo stopped working in the United States and let two other popular apps, Uber and Lyft, run the show instead. Once upon a time, there were many taxi apps in the world, and one of them, from London, was called Hailo. Hailo was a special app that helped people find taxis really easily. All they had to do is tap on their phone, and a friendly taxi would come to take them where they wanted to go. But Hailo wanted to make even more people happy, so it decided to try working in the United States too. In the United States, there were already two very popular taxi apps called Uber and Lyft. These apps were also helping people find rides, just like Hailo. When Hailo arrived in the United States, it tried super hard to make people happy and show them that it could be as good as Uber and Lyft. But it wasn't easy because Uber and Lyft were already very popular, and they had lots and lots of friends who liked using them. Hailo tried so hard, but it wasn't easy for them. People in the United States liked Uber and Lyft more, and Hailo couldn't find enough people who wanted to use their app. As we know, even our favorite superhero needs to be strong to keep fighting the big battles. Sadly, Hailo wasn't strong enough, and it didn't win against Uber and Lyft in the United States. So, after some time, Hailo decided that it couldn't keep fighting Uber and Lyft in the United States. It decided to go back to London and other places where people liked it and used it every day. Hailo knew it just couldn't win this battle in the United States, and it was time to focus on making people happy in other countries. Even though Hailo didn't win in the United States, it still works hard every day to help people find taxis and get where they need to go in other parts of the world. Hailo learned that sometimes, it's okay not to win every battle, as long as you keep trying and doing your best where you can. And that's the story, little friends, of how the London Taxi App Hailo stopped working in the United States and let Uber and Lyft take over. But remember, just like Hailo, sometimes you'll win some, and some you'll lose, but you should always keep trying your best!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

En el pasado, el Arca ha sido el punto central de presencia divina y la comunicación entre Dios y su pueblo en el Tabernáculo y el Templo.

A: A:","completion":"Tadpoles play a vital role in their aquatic ecosystem by clearing out excess organic matter, primarily algae, detritus, and other microscopic plant debris, from waterways. Algae are microscopic plants that grow in the water and can be detrimental to the aquatic life if left uncontrolled. As tadpoles consume algae, they help maintain a balanced ecosystem, prevent algal blooms, and improve water quality. Algal blooms, when left unchecked, can lead to oxygen depletion, blocking sunlight penetration, and even producing toxins that can negatively affect other organisms and the aquatic environment. Detritus is decaying organic material, such as leaves, twigs, and dead organisms, present in water bodies. Tadpoles can feed on detritus directly or indirectly by consuming the microorganisms (such as bacteria and fungi) that break down these materials. By doing so, tadpoles contribute to the process of decomposition, recycling nutrients, and preventing the accumulation of organic waste in waterways, which otherwise could lead to eutrophication and oxygen depletion. In summary, tadpoles clear out waterways by feeding on excess algae, detritus, and other organic matter, contributing to the well-being of aquatic ecosystems and maintaining water quality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

They avoided the elite, and focused not on political events but on social forces and attitudes. They rejected both Marxism and modernization theory as alien and confining. They stressed the importance of popular energies in the development of modern Japan. They enlarged history by using the methods of social history. It was not until the beginning of the Meiji Era that the Japanese government began taking modernization seriously.

Question 2: Is it ethically right to date girls of a different caste/religion being subscribed to Hinduism? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Question 1: Hinduism is considered different than other religions because it has many unique beliefs and practices, just like other religions have their own unique beliefs and practices. Hinduism has ideas like karma, which means that good actions lead to good outcomes, and bad actions lead to bad outcomes. This belief helps people to make good choices in their lives. Hinduism also believes in an afterlife, which means that when people die, they go to a different place or are born again as a different person or animal. Sometimes, Hindus practice animal sacrifice as a way to show respect or gratitude to the gods, but this isn't something that all Hindus do. Hinduism also has many superstitions, just like other religions and cultures do. These beliefs make Hinduism special and different from other religions, but that doesn't mean it is better or worse, just different. Question 2: When it comes to dating girls of a different caste or religion while being a Hindu, it is important to remember that everyone is unique and special in their own way. It can be a good thing to learn about and understand different people, which can help us grow and become better people. As long as you treat everyone with kindness and respect, it can be okay to date someone from a different caste or religion. This decision depends on your personal beliefs and values, as well as the feelings and opinions of the other person involved.

Please answer the following question: Think outside the box, whilst inside the box (studio): As this studio is about working with constraints, I thought i’d google ‘constraints in filmmaking’ and see what comes up. One of the first links was to a journal article by Heidi Philipsen entitled ‘Constraints in Film Making Processes Offer an Exercise to the Imagination’. Interestingly enough the first sentence of her article states: “I would like filmmakers interested in thinking “outside the box” to recognize that they can benefit from being placed “inside a box.” I wonder if Paul had contemplated this whilst choosing the name for this studio. Throughout her article Philipsen challenges the notion that creativity is an intangible innate quality, existing within the mind of one source, but rather creativity arises from a multitude of sources. Alike all things shared she suggests that creativity is easier to enhance by changing environmental conditions, rather than encouraging people to ‘think more creatively’. Perceiving creativity in this way allows you to see it as an organisationally influenced phenomenon, rather than a psychological and individual phenomenon. Which enables you to have more control over creativity and to encourage creativity once being aware of how it can be environmentally enhanced. As Csikzentmihalyi (1996) states “a genuinely creative accomplishment is almost never the result of a sudden insight, a lightbulb flashing on in the dark, but comes after years of hard work”. Constraints, as Philipsen suggests is one such way to manipulate the environment to enhance creativity. Students who attended The Film School in Denmark, who were forced into working with constraints for their projects eventually considered constraints to be both useful and inspirational. Such constraints included: making a scene with a specific theme, within a specific deadline and with other specific conditions concerning the use of camera, sound, actors etc. Students stated that these constraints ultimately made them feel secure, inspired and focused and... After this passage, the writer probably A. thought about it B. researched more about it C. wrote more D. not enough information A:","completion":"The writer likely proceeded to research more about it and write more on the topic. The author seems to be in an exploratory phase of the subject, researching and analyzing various sources related to constraints in filmmaking. This is evident in how they started by searching for 'constraints in filmmaking' online, then delving into the article by Heidi Philipsen. They critically examined Philipsen's views and linked it with other sources such as Csikzentmihalyi, pointing out the correlation between the environment and creativity. The author seems intrigued by the idea of constraints positively influencing creativity by suggesting that it provides a sense of security, inspiration, and focus to those who are given a specific set of conditions to work within. The author's detailed discussion and analysis indicates they are planning to delve further into the subject. They also briefly mentioned the example of students at The Film School in Denmark, indicating a possible exploration of real-life instances or case studies where these theories are applied. Therefore, it can be inferred that the author might have researched more about the impact of constraints on creativity, especially in the context of filmmaking, before proceeding to write more about it. The author also seems to enjoy the idea of 'the box' acting as a creative enhancer rather than a restrictor. This is a potent metaphor the author could continue to explore in their writing. As the author mentioned, they were surprised by the correlation in the naming of the studio and the idea of enhancing creativity within constraints - 'inside the box'. This indicates a possible exploration of the studio environment itself as a case study or example in their writing or further research. Hence, there is a strong likelihood that the author proceeded to research more into this topic and subsequently wrote more based on their findings and analysis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Horton taught and heavily influenced most of the era's leaders. They included Martin Luther King Jr, Rosa Parks (who studied with Horton shortly before her decision to keep her seat on the Montgomery, Alabama bus in 1955), John Lewis, James Bevel, Bernard Lafayette, Ralph Abernathy, John B. Thompson, and many others. - The Southern United States, commonly referred to as the American South, Dixie, or simply the South, is a region of the United States of America. The South does not exactly match the geographic south, but is predominantly located in the southeastern corner; Arizona and New Mexico, which are geographically in the southern part of the country, are rarely considered part of the Southern United States, while West Virginia, which separated from Virginia in 1863, commonly is. Some scholars have proposed definitions of the South that do not coincide neatly with state boundaries. While the states of Delaware and Maryland, as well as the District of Columbia permitted slavery prior to the start of the Civil War, they remained with the Union. Since the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, they became more culturally, economically, and politically aligned with the industrial Northern states, and are often identified as part of the Mid-Atlantic and/or Northeast by many residents, businesses, public institutions, and private organizations. However, the United States Census Bureau puts them in the South. - James Anderson Dombrowski (January 17, 1897 - May 2, 1983) was a southern white Methodist minister and intellectual who was active in the African-American civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s. He lived in New Orleans from 1946 until his death but was involved in public affairs across the country. - DIXIE is an obsolete protocol for accessing X.500 directory services. DIXIE was intended to provide a lightweight means for clients to access X.500 directory services. DIXIE allowed TCP/IP clients to connect a DIXIE-to-DAP gateway which would provide access to the X.500 Directory Service. This design allows the client to access the directory without requiring it to support the cumbersome Open Systems Interconnection protocol stack. - New Mexico is a state located in the southwestern region of the United States of America. It was admitted to the union as the 47th state on January 6, 1912. It is usually considered one of the Mountain States.

COORD relationship: X and Y belong to the same semantic class. \\"Whale\\" is a marine mammal, while \\"accuse\\" is a verb relating to blaming someone for wrongdoing. They do not belong to the same semantic class, so the relationship is not COORD. 2. HYPER relationship: X is a specific instance of Y. \\"Whale\\" is not a specific instance of \\"accuse\\", so the relationship is not HYPER.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Bob works for the local electric power company. Part of is job involves checking the generators and transformers. His work schedule allows him to work on the generator tagged as gen A only on Mondays, and the transformer tagged as tran B only on Tuesdays. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which one would most likely be located in a power plant, gen A or tran B? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Gen A would most likely be located in a power plant. To elaborate, the primary function of a power plant is to generate electricity by converting various energy sources, such as fossil fuels, nuclear energy, or renewable sources like wind and solar power. A generator, like Gen A, is an essential component in this process, as it converts the mechanical energy produced by turbines into electrical energy. Generators typically consist of an engine, an alternator, a voltage regulator, and other necessary operating components. On the other hand, transformers, like Tran B, are typically found in electrical substations, rather than inside the power plant itself. Transformers play a crucial role in transmitting the generated electricity to homes, businesses, and other establishments by regulating the voltage levels to match the needs of the electrical grid. They can either step up the voltage levels for long-distance transmission or step down the voltage levels for safe distribution to end-users. Given the fact that Bob checks Gen A on Mondays and Tran B on Tuesdays, it can be inferred that these devices are separate components of the power distribution system. The difference in their scheduling indicates that the two are not directly related and are likely serving different functions in the electricity generation and distribution process. In conclusion, based on the information provided, Gen A is more likely to be located in a power plant because it plays a vital role in generating electricity from various energy sources. Meanwhile, Tran B is more likely located in an electrical substation since its primary function is to transmit and regulate the voltage levels of the generated electricity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the article and select the best answer. Article: St James's Palace has announced that while Miss Middleton will wear a wedding ring. Prince William has chosen not to. Rings are typically exchanged by couples during their wedding to represent commitment to each other. Does it matter if husbands don't wear a wedding ring? Prince William's father wears one, his grandfather doesn't and their decisions weren't seen as strange. But reactions to Prince William's decision show that wedding rings for husbands are now the norm. One young man, who spoke to the BBC, thinks William is setting a bad example, saying: \\"I think it's disgraceful . It's a tradition. You have to wear a ring really. And for someone of the royal family to do that, it's not right. \\" Broadly speaking, modem husbands tend to wear their wedding rings as a symbol of loyalty and faithfulness. So not wearing one can seem unusual or even dishonest to some, although men haven't always worn them. The wearing of wedding rings has been the done thing for centuries among wives but only became common practice among husbands during World War II. Men fighting overseas usually wore them as a reminder of wives and families back home. Wearing rings is a safety issue for men in certain manual jobs. But how does William explain his decision? A royal officer has said he \\"isn't one for jewelry\\". Question: What is the author's attitude towards Prince William's decision? Options: A: Subjective. B: Objective. C: Approving.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can you tell me the answer to where did the phrase have your cake and eat it too come from??","completion":"The phrase \\"have your cake and eat it too\\" is an English proverb that dates back to the 16th century. It essentially means that someone wants to have two desirable but incompatible options at the same time. It highlights the difficulty or impossibility of maintaining such a scenario where one retains the desired thing as well as its consumption. The origin and development of this phrase provide insights into its meaning and how it has evolved over time. The earliest known written instance of this phrase can be traced back to a letter by Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, in 1538, where he writes, \\"A man can not have his cake and eat his cake.\\" Although the wording varies slightly from the present form, the core meaning remains intact. The phrasing continued to evolve over time. A version appeared in John Heywood's 1546 collection of proverbs, titled \\"A dialogue Conteinyng the nomber in effect of all the Prouerbes in the Englishe tongue.\\" Here, Heywood writes, \\"Wolde ye both eate your cake, and haue your cake?\\" This publication makes it clear that by the mid-16th century, the proverb was well-known in English literature and gaining widespread usage. From the 16th to the 18th century, the phrase underwent many variations, such as \\"You cannot eat your cake and have it\\" and \\"You cannot eat your cake and keep it.\\" These variations reflect how the English language evolved, with the core meaning and essence of the idiom remaining intact. By the early 20th century, the present version of the phrase \\"have your cake and eat it too\\" began to gain prominence. It is believed that the rearrangement of the phrasing in this current form is intended to put emphasis on the idea that one cannot retain the cake after eating it. This alteration might have been made in response to the growing use of the phrase in negative contexts. The proverb's origin and development in the English language demonstrate a drive to convey the impossibility of having or maintaining two contradictory or incompatible things simultaneously. This saying has been commonly used in several areas of life, including relationships, career choices, politics, and personal decisions, emphasizing the inevitability of making a choice between two options. In conclusion, the phrase \\"have your cake and eat it too\\" is an English proverb that has deep historical roots dating back to the 16th century. Though it has undergone several transformations in wording over the centuries, the core meaning has remained consistent, emphasizing the impossibility of possessing two incompatible outcomes simultaneously. The development of the phrase reflects how the English language, society, and culture have evolved over time, while still retaining the wisdom embedded in this timeless adage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Most of the editions that followed d'Indy up to the time of the Second World War were arrangements, usually heavily truncated, that provided a basis for performances in the modern opera idiom. Many of these were the work of composers, including Carl Orff (1923 and 1939) and Ottorino Respighi in 1935. Orff's 1923 score, using a German text, included some period instrumentation, an experiment he abandoned when producing his later version.In the post-war period, editions have moved increasingly to reflect the performance conventions of Monteverdi's day. This tendency was initiated by two earlier editions, that of Jack Westrup used in the 1925 Oxford performances, and Gian Francesco Malipiero's 1930 complete edition which sticks closely to Monteverdi's 1609 original. After the war, Hindemith's attempted period reconstruction of the work was followed in 1955 by an edition from August Wenzinger that remained in use for many years. The next 30 years saw numerous editions, mostly prepared by scholar-performers rather than by composers, generally aiming towards authenticity if not always the complete re-creation of the original instrumentation. These included versions by Raymond Leppard (1965), Denis Stevens (1967), Nikolaus Harnoncourt (1969), Jane Glover (1975), Roger Norrington (1976) and John Eliot Gardiner. Only the composers Valentino Bucchi (1967), Bruno Maderna (1967) and Luciano Berio (1984) produced editions based on the convention of a large modern orchestra.

In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a 100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more than a 250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. \\"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\\" Casey said. \\"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\\" Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is 100; the maximum fine is 1,000 and up to six months in jail. Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order. Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases. She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state. \\"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\\" West said. \\"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred.

Look on the label for how much trans fat is in a product. Ideally, you should be eating a product with zero trans fat. You can find trans fat listed underneath fat and saturated fat. Manufacturers now are required to list trans fat content on their labels. Look for the phrases \\"partially hydrogenated,\\" \\"hydrogenated,\\" or \\"shortening.\\" These types of ingredients contain trans fat. If a product says 0 grams (0.0 oz) of trans fat, it might not be zero. Look for the word \\"hydrogenated\\" in the ingredients. This means the food contains trans fat. The FDA allows food manufacturers to list trans fat as 0 grams (0.0 oz) if it contains less than 0.5 grams (0.02 oz) of trans fat. Multiple servings of foods with hydrogenated oils, even if it says zero grams of trans fat, can negatively affect your health. When eating out, ask the server what oil is used to prepare your food. If possible, request a healthier oil. Another option is to skip the deep fried foods and opt instead for grilled, steamed, sauteed, or baked. Steamed and grilled items are the least likely to contain trans fats. Be careful with added items such as salad dressing and condiments, which can contain trans fats. A condiment made with olive oil is a good choice. Summary:","completion":"When you eat, it's important to check the labels on your food to see if it has any bad fat called trans fat.

Textiles were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment, value of output and capital invested; the textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and most of the important technological innovations were British. The social, economic and political changes in the previous centuries in Great Britain contributed. Whereas absolutism stayed the normal form of power execution through most parts of Europe, institutions ensured property rights and political safety to the people in the UK after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Aided by these legal and cultural foundations, an entrepreneurial spirit and consumer revolution drove industrialisation in Britain, which would be emulated in countries around the world. A change in marrying patterns to getting married later made people able to accumulate more human capital during their youth, thereby encouraging economic development. - The Province of York is one of two ecclesiastical provinces making up the Church of England and consists of 12 dioceses which cover the northern third of England and the Isle of Man.

Alan invents a story about a surprise party for Brooke and watches Paula invite Matt inside. Paula's dog attacks Alan, and he shoots it in self-defense. After returning to his car, he drives to work. At his dental practice, Alan's first appointment goes poorly when he hallucinates a child has rotten teeth and accidentally stabs him. As Detective Gibbs investigates the death of Paula's dog, Alan sees his second patient, April Reign, a beauty queen. Alan hallucinates she is his wife, and, while she is unconscious, takes off her pantyhose and fondles her before choking her. As she wakes, Alan snaps out of it and hides her pantyhose. Alan tells his manager, Steve Landers, she is still dizzy from nitrous oxide. When Steve realizes what really happened, he returns, punches Alan, and threatens a lawsuit. Alan ends the day early and sends his staff and patients home, including Sarah, a teenager who wants to have her braces removed.

The reviewer has expressed multiple unfavorable opinions about the video, suggesting that it is not a good purchase. Firstly, the review states that the video is \\"definitely not for kids,\\" indicating that the content may be inappropriate for younger audiences. This point would likely dissuade potential buyers who are looking for family-friendly content. Secondly, the reviewer claims that the video is \\"hardly a sequel of Ninja Scroll,\\" signaling disappointment with the lack of connection to a well-known title. By introducing the context of a desirable predecessor, the review implies that the video falls short of expectations that may have been set by fans of the original Ninja Scroll. Moreover, the reviewer advises others not to waste their money on this video, reinforcing the negative tone of the review. This strong statement serves to further dissuade potential buyers from investing in the video, as it implies that there is little value in the content. Lastly, the review comments on the lackluster animation quality, comparing it to \\"some Saturday American-made cartoons.\\" This comparison suggests that the video has an underwhelming visual aesthetic, as opposed to the high-quality animation that may be expected from a well-done sequel to Ninja Scroll. By criticizing this aspect of the video, the reviewer is pointing out another con that deters potential buyers from purchasing it.

Whereas in the First Great Awakening, Methodist and Baptist preachers had opposed slavery and urged manumission, over the decades they made more of an accommodation with the institution. They worked with slaveholders in the South to urge a paternalistic institution. Both denominations made direct appeals to slaves and free blacks for conversion. The Baptists particularly allowed them active roles in congregations. By the mid-19th century, northern Baptists tended to oppose slavery. As tensions increased, in 1844 the Home Mission Society refused to appoint a slaveholder as a missionary who had been proposed by Georgia. It noted that missionaries could not take servants with them, and also that the Board did not want to appear to condone slavery. Please answer a question about this article.

Expressing one's admiration for someone's beauty can bring joy and gratitude. In French culture, compliments about someone's appearance are common and well-regarded. Giving a heartfelt compliment in French will undeniably enhance your charm and charisma. In this article, we will explore various ways to say \\"you are beautiful\\" in French, understanding its nuances and proper usage in various contexts. The Different Ways to Say \\"You Are Beautiful\\" in French: 1. Tu es belle: \\"Tu es belle\\" means \\"you are beautiful\\" and is a casual way to express your admiration. It is ideal for complimenting friends, family members, or acquaintances. It is worth noting that \\"belle\\" is an adjective that agrees with the feminine gender, making this expression solely applicable when addressing a woman. 2. Vous êtes belle: When interacting with a superior, an elderly person, or someone you want to show respect, it is essential to use a formal tone. In this case, saying \\"vous êtes belle\\" is the perfect way to communicate that you find them beautiful. It is the polite version of \\"tu es belle\\" and demonstrates your good manners and respect. 3. Vous êtes belles: If you wish to compliment a group of women on their beauty, you need to use the plural form \\"vous êtes belles.\\" It is crucial to determine if the group consists of only women; otherwise, a mixed-gender group must be addressed with \\"vous êtes beaux.\\" 4. Synonyms for Beautiful: To express your admiration with more variety and flair, it is helpful to learn synonyms for the word \\"beautiful\\" in French. Some popular alternatives include: a. Magnifique: A stronger way to say \\"beautiful,\\" reserved for cases when someone looks exceptionally stunning. b. Jolie: Equivalent to \\"pretty\\" or \\"cute\\" in English, a milder compliment than \\"belle.\\" c. Ravissante: Meaning \\"ravishing\\" or \\"gorgeous,\\" usually suitable for elegant and classy beauty. d. Sublime: Reserved for instances of remarkable and awe-inspiring beauty. e. Charmante: Implies \\"charming\\" and denotes an enchanting or delightful presence. It is possible to replace \\"belle\\" with any of these synonyms to create alternative expressions, such as \\"tu es magnifique\\" or \\"vous êtes charmantes.\\" Putting it Into Practice: Now that we have outlined the various ways to say \\"you are beautiful\\" in French, it is essential to put this knowledge to good use. Remember to use informal expressions like \\"tu es belle\\" with friends and casual acquaintances, while opting for \\"vous êtes belle\\" or \\"vous êtes belles\\" in formal settings or when addressing multiple women. Understand the atmosphere and emotional context to adapt your compliments accordingly. You may choose to use synonyms for \\"beautiful\\" to enhance your language skills and express your admiration with precision and authenticity. Conclusion: The ability to compliment someone genuinely in their language is a valuable tool to build meaningful connections and foster mutual appreciation. Mastering the French etiquette of complimenting a person's beauty will provide you with the linguistic advantage and cultural understanding necessary to strengthen your relationships, both personal and professional. So go ahead and spread joy by saying \\"tu es belle\\" to that special someone, or impress your French-speaking friends with your flattering language skills."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states.

You've never seen so much walking in a movie. If this really had a 20m budget, most of it must have gone on Mr Piano's shoes, because he had to get through plenty of pairs with all the walking he does. Which explains why there's no money left for decent effects, a decent video camera or proper actors.

Write some highlights for the following article: Republican opponents of White House-backed legislation that would rein in NSA surveillance programs narrowly blocked the Senate from taking up the bill Tuesday after warning it could help terrorists escape detection. On a tally of 58 to 42, a procedural vote failed to get the supermajority 60 votes it needed to advance. Supporters of the USA Freedom Act, a rare mix of liberal Democrats and libertarian Republicans, hoped public outrage over the secret mass collection of phone and Internet records -- revealed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden -- would lead to passage of the reforms. But many opponents argued the changes would hamper the National Security Agency's ability to track nimble and elusive terrorists. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell led the charge against the bill, saying the new rules would prevent the United States from capturing the terrorists who killed Peter Kassig, a U.S. citizen doing aid work in Syria. Kassig was executed over the weekend. \\"Many of these fighters are familiar with America's intelligence capabilities, and many are savvy with communications. These are terrorists who know how to use encryption, and they how to change devices quickly,\\" he said. \\"This is the worst time to be tying our hands behind our backs.\\" \\"It basically takes us back to a pre-9/11 lack of capacity to identify terrorists making telephone calls in the United States, said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Senate Republican. \\"I think that sort of unilateral disarmament would be bad for the country.\\" McConnell also argued the measure should be debated and voted on in the new Congress next year, not by lawmakers in a lame duck session who are leaving Washington. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, the bill's principal author, disputed the critics saying that while it puts checks on the NSA's powerful capabilities, it \\"does so responsibly.\\" \\"The bill contains key reforms to safeguard Americans' privacy by prohibiting the indiscriminate collection of their data. It also provides for greater accountability and transparency of the government's surveillance programs,\\" he said. \\"The bill also ensures that the intelligence community has the tools it needs to keep our country safe.\\" Under the bill, the government could no longer store massive amounts of call information in its databases, a practice President Barack Obama said he wanted to end. That job would fall to the large telecommunication companies. But the government could get permission from a secret surveillance court to review specific call information if it could show it might be linked to terrorists. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, said this arrangement \\"solves\\" a \\"very practical problem\\" raised by those who are uncomfortable with the government storing calling records of Americans. But Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said the public's privacy would be better protected by strict federal government safeguards of that information than by the thousands of employees at private phone companies. In a statement Monday, the White House urged passage of the bill. \\"This legislation will help strengthen Americans' confidence in the government's use of these important national security authorities. Without passage of this bill, critical authorities that are appropriately reformed in this legislation could expire next summer. The administration urges Congress to take action on this legislation now, since delay may subject these important national security authorities to brinksmanship and uncertainty.\\" The bill is supported by a coalition of technology companies, including Google, Apple, AOL, Microsoft and Yahoo, who have deep concerns that their customers' privacy is being violated by the current NSA techniques. Supporters suffered a setback last week when Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, who had favored the measure, announced he would not back it. However, other like-minded Republicans such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah voted to advance the bill.","completion":"1.

Phillip Alpert is a registered sex offender as a result of sending a nude photograph of his 16-year-old girlfriend. The National Campaign to Prevent Teen & Unplanned Pregnancy, a private nonprofit group whose mission is to protect children, and CosmoGirl.com, surveyed nearly 1,300 teens about sex and technology. The result: 1 in 5 teens say they've sexted even though the majority know it could be a crime.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person whose death could not be determined to be accident or suicide?, using the article: In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in..., what would be the answer ? A:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"What is the last name of the person whose death could not be determined to be an accident or suicide?\\" is Heseltine, as mentioned in the article.

If you're a Gowalla user and love the service the way it is, it's almost certainly bad news. When Facebook acquires a company, it rarely keeps the original product intact. Instead, it voraciously devours these smaller startups to get to the talented developers housed within. Beluga, a recent acquisition, is in the process of shutting down while Facebook works instead on Facebook Messages, a similar service.

Summarize this article: The Hatters led after just five minutes when Luke Gambin's clipped pass was controlled by Danny Hylton and he fired in his 18th of an impressive season. Alan Sheehan was denied by goalkeeper Joe Fryer before the home side doubled their advantage after just 10 minutes, Gambin driving into the area and finding the bottom corner to score his first Luton goal. It took Pools 30 minutes to register an attempt of note, defender Scott Harrison heading narrowly wide from a corner. In the second half, Hartlepool winger Nathan Thomas fired wildly off target for the visitors, while Hylton should have doubled his tally only to fire wastefully over the top. Isaac Vassell was denied by a good low stop from Fryer, before Pools almost had one back, Michael Woods firing inches over. Town wrapped up the points late on as Ollie Palmer came off the bench and when the ball ricocheted back into his path, he beat Fryer to open his account for the Hatters.

It contains the westernmost islands of the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. The largest island is Hirta, whose sea cliffs are the highest in the United Kingdom. Three other islands (Dùn, Soay and Boreray) were also used for grazing and seabird hunting. The islands are administratively a part of the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar local authority area.The origin of the name St Kilda is a matter of conjecture. The islands' human heritage includes numerous unique architectural features from the historic and prehistoric periods, although the earliest written records of island life date from the Late Middle Ages. The medieval village on Hirta was rebuilt in the 19th century, but illnesses brought by increased external contacts through tourism, and the upheaval of the First World War contributed to the island's evacuation in 1930. The story of St Kilda has attracted artistic interpretations, including Michael Powell's film The Edge of the World and an opera.Permanent habitation on the islands possibly extends back at least two millennia, the population probably never exceeding 180 (and certainly no more than 100 after 1851). The entire remaining population was evacuated from Hirta (the only inhabited island) in 1930. The islands house a unique form of stone structure known as cleitean. A cleit is a stone storage hut or bothy; whilst many are still to be found, they are slowly falling into disrepair. There are known to be 1,260 cleitean on Hirta and a further 170 on the other group islands. Currently, the only year-round residents are military personnel; a variety of conservation workers, volunteers and scientists spend time there in the summer months.The entire archipelago is owned by the National Trust for Scotland. It became one of Scotland's six World Heritage Sites in 1986, and is one of the few in the world to hold mixed status for both its natural and cultural qualities.... Guess a valid title for it!

Multi-instrumentalists who play closely related instruments, a practice known as doubling are common in orchestra (e.g., flute players who double on piccolo and percussion players, who play snare drum, cymbals, bass drum, etc.), in jazz (e.g., saxophone players who double on clarinet or flute; or double bass players who also play electric bass); in music theatre pit orchestras (e.g., reed players who are required to play numerous reed instruments); and in other areas of classical music (e.g., church piano players are often expected to play the church's pipe organ or Hammond organ as well). Popular music composers and songwriters are often multi-instrumentalists. In pop and rock, it is more common than in classical or jazz for performers to be multi-instrumentalists on instruments that are not from the same family: it is common for pop and rock musicians to play both guitar and keyboards. Many bluegrass musicians are multi-instrumentalists. Some musicians' unions or associations specify a higher rate of pay for musicians who double on two or more instruments for a performance or recording. - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers. - RBD was a Mexican musical group that gained popularity from Televisa's teen series \\"Rebelde\\", and found international success from 2004 until their separation in 2009.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students. Question: After this story is over the author probably: Options: A. Will continue to do self portraits in the classes they teach. B. Will teach more English Language Learners C.

Here is a goal: garlic press Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of obtaining a garlic press, there are various ways to go about it. These methods are dependent on factors such as your budget, available utilities and resources, and how urgently you need the garlic press. Below are three different approaches that make sense for acquiring a garlic press: 1. Purchasing a Garlic Press: The most straightforward and efficient approach is to buy a garlic press from a store or online marketplace. Here are the steps for going about it: a. Research: Start by gathering information on the best garlic presses available in the market. Look for reviews and compare prices to ensure you get the best value for your money. Consider factors such as material, easy cleaning, durability, and ease of use. b. Select a Platform: Once you have gathered sufficient information, choose whether to buy from a physical store or an online marketplace. Online marketplaces tend to offer a wider variety of products and allow you to read reviews from previous buyers. Physical stores, on the other hand, enable you to examine the product in person before purchasing. c. Make a Purchase: Place your order or buy the garlic press in-store, and pay for it using your preferred payment method. d. Use the Garlic Press: After receiving the product, follow the manufacturer's guidelines to clean and use the garlic press effectively. 2. Borrowing a Garlic Press: If you only require the garlic press for a short while or on a one-time basis, borrowing from a friend or family member may be the most practical solution. Here are the steps to follow: a. Identify Contacts: Get in touch with friends, family, or neighbors who may have a garlic press that they are willing to lend. b. Borrow the Garlic Press: Arrange to pick up the garlic press at a time that works for both parties. Be sure to express your gratitude and clarify the duration for which you will need the press. c. Clean and Use the Press: Before using the borrowed garlic press, clean it thoroughly, then follow the necessary guidelines while cooking. d. Return the Press: After using the garlic press, clean it again, and return it to the owner within the agreed time frame, preferably sooner than expected to show your appreciation. 3. DIY Garlic Press: If you are unable to purchase or borrow a garlic press, you may consider creating a makeshift garlic press using readily available materials. Here are some ideas: a. Fork and Cutting Board: Place the unpeeled garlic cloves on a cutting board and use the back of a fork to press down on them. Then, scrape the crushed garlic from the fork and use it as required. b. Chef's Knife: You can also use the side of a wide blade chef's knife to crush individual garlic cloves. Place the clove on a cutting board, lay the knife blade flat on it, and using the heel of your hand, press down on the blade until the garlic is crushed. Be sure to exercise caution while handling the knife. Each of these methods has its advantages and drawbacks. Purchasing a garlic press is straightforward but may incur an additional expense; borrowing is cost-effective but relies on the availability of a lender; and DIY solutions may be resourceful but not as effective or convenient as using an actual garlic press. Choose the method that best aligns with your needs and circumstances to accomplish your goal of obtaining a garlic press."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Scientists think that the earliest flowers attracted insects and other animals, which spread pollen from flower to flower. This greatly increased the efficiency of fertilization over wind-spread pollen, which might or might not actually land on another flower. To take better advantage of this “animal labor,” plants evolved traits such as brightly colored petals to attract pollinators. In exchange for pollination, flowers gave the pollinators nectar. I am facing a new situation today: Joy had a field full of flowering plants , that he used for medicinal and honey making purposes.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the background article you provided, Jill's field attracted fewer insects compared to Joy's field.

Глобализация несет в себе множество вызовов, и одним из них является то, что она подпитывает все более широкие расслоения между своими участниками. Например, если сравнить Колумбию и Афганистан или Чили и Судан, становится очевидно, что разрыв между этими странами основан на многих и разных факторах. Разнообразие в уровне экономического развития, политической стабильности и культурных особенностей этих стран создают ряд проблем для интеграции и взаимодействия на мировой арене. Одним из следствий глобализации является увеличение числа стран, которые активно участвуют в мировой экономической и политической жизни. Однако большое количество участников в современной мировой системе на самом деле может затруднять превращение численного превосходства в конкретное и влиятельное действие. Для преодоления этого разрыва и установления согласованных отношений между странами требуется тесное сотрудничество и кооперация на многих уровнях – начиная с более эффективной системы международной торговли и заканчивая углубленными двусторонними переговорами о взаимовыгодных проектах. К сожалению, на нашем пути к согласованному влиянию ряд препятствий. Во-первых, экономические различия между развитыми и развивающимися странами могут привести к проблемам, таким как социальное неравенство, миграции и конфликты. Во-вторых, политические разногласия между странами может затруднить установление конструктивного диалога и принятие коллективных решений в области решения международных проблем. Наконец, культурные различия и непонимание между нациями могут порождать стереотипы, предубеждения и даже враждебность, что, в свою очередь, вредит налаживанию взаимовыгодного и крепкого сотрудничества. В заключение можно сказать, что глобализация ставит перед мировым сообществом сложные задачи, требующие принятия согласованных усилий, и только факт наличия большого количества стран-участников мирового сообщества не гарантирует превращение этой связи в сильное международное влияние. Важной задачей для каждого участника глобализации является создание путей для тесного сотрудничества, учет разнообразия интересов и обеспечение равных возможностей для участия в мировом развитии и решении проблем, стоящих перед нашей планетой."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: At the end of the 16th century, England and the Netherlands began to challenge Portugal's monopoly of trade with Asia, forming private joint-stock companies to finance the voyages—the English, later British, East India Company and the Dutch East India Company, chartered in 1600 and 1602 respectively. The primary aim of these companies was to tap into the lucrative spice trade, an effort focused mainly on two regions; the East Indies archipelago, and an important hub in the trade network, India. There, they competed for trade supremacy with Portugal and with each other. Although England ultimately eclipsed the Netherlands as a colonial power, in the short term the Netherlands' more advanced financial system and the three Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th century left it with a stronger position in Asia. Hostilities ceased after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 when the Dutch William of Orange ascended the English throne, bringing peace between the Netherlands and England. A deal between the two nations left the spice trade of the East Indies archipelago to the Netherlands and the textiles industry of India to England, but textiles soon overtook spices in terms of profitability, and by 1720, in terms of sales, the British company had overtaken the Dutch.

How is the theory of plate tectonics different from a hypothesis regarding a certain aspect of plate movement?","completion":"The theory of plate tectonics and a hypothesis regarding a certain aspect of plate movement are fundamentally different in terms of their scope, scientific acceptance, validation, and the extent of evidence supporting them. In order to better understand the differences, let's first define the terms and then explore the disparities in detail. 1. Definition: a. Theory of Plate Tectonics: The theory of plate tectonics is a comprehensive and widely accepted scientific theory that explains the large-scale movements of Earth's lithosphere. It describes how the Earth's outer shell, known as the lithosphere, is divided into a number of large, rigid plates that move over the partially molten and ductile asthenosphere. These plates interact with each other at their boundaries, resulting in various geological processes, such as the creation of mountains, earthquakes, and volcanic activity. b. Hypothesis Regarding a Certain Aspect of Plate Movement: A hypothesis is a proposed explanation for a specific phenomenon or observation, which can be tested through experiments, observations, or other investigative means. A hypothesis regarding a certain aspect of plate movement would be a provisional explanation of a specific feature or process related to the movement or interaction of tectonic plates. 2. Scope and Focus: a. The theory of plate tectonics is comprehensive and provides a general framework for understanding various aspects of Earth's geological processes and history. It encompasses the movement, interaction, and behavior of tectonic plates, and covers a wide range of geological phenomena. b. A hypothesis regarding a certain aspect of plate movement is focused on an individual feature or process, and its predictions and implications are limited to the specific aspect of plate tectonics being studied. This hypothesis aims to provide a detailed explanation or prediction for a particular observation related to plate movement. 3. Scientific Acceptance: a. The theory of plate tectonics is well-established and widely accepted by the scientific community. Developed over several decades, it incorporates evidence from multiple disciplines such as geology, geophysics, and paleontology, and is now considered the unifying theory of Earth sciences. b. A hypothesis regarding a certain aspect of plate movement, on the other hand, is a proposed explanation that has not yet been proven or disproven. It must undergo rigorous testing, and only after accumulating substantial evidence and withstanding critical assessment by the scientific community, may a hypothesis advance to the status of an accepted theory or become part of a larger theory. 4. Validation and Evidence: a. A significant amount of evidence supports the theory of plate tectonics, including the global distribution of earthquakes and volcanoes, the age and distribution of the oceanic and continental crust, and paleomagnetic data from ancient rocks. Multiple lines of converging evidence from various scientific fields reinforce and validate this theory. b. A hypothesis for a certain aspect of plate movement needs to provide specific predictions that can be tested and validated. The available evidence for a hypothesis may be limited at the outset, and it might require additional data collection and experimental results to confirm or refute the proposed explanation. In conclusion, the theory of plate tectonics represents a widely accepted, comprehensive framework explaining the large-scale movement and interaction of the Earth's lithosphere, with a substantial body of evidence to support it, whereas a hypothesis regarding a certain aspect of plate movement is a focused, provisional explanation for a specific observation that requires further testing and validation before being integrated into the broader scientific understanding of plate tectonics."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Life-long learning is the concept that \\"It's never too soon or too late for learning.\\" -- a philosophy that has taken root in a larger number of different organizations. Life-long learning is an attitude -- learners believe that one can and should be open to new ideas, decisions, skills or behaviors. Life-long learning throws the well-known rule \\"You can't teach an old dog new tricks\\" out of the door. Life-long learning provides the general public with learning opportunities at all ages and in different ways: at work, at home and through leisure activities, not just through formal channels such as school and higher education. Life-long education is often achieved through distance learning or e-learning, continuing education, home schooling, etc. It also includes training programs for those who want to improve their qualifications, bring their skills up to date or retrain for a new line of work. In later life, especially in retirement, continued learning takes various forms, crossing traditional academic limits. One of the reasons why life-long education has become so important is the rapid progress of modern science and technology. Although the period of primary, secondary and university education is increased, the knowledge and skills gained there are usually not _ for a professional career spanning three or four decades. Question: What is the main idea behind life-long education? Answer: Answer:","completion":"The main idea behind life-long education is centered around the concept that learning is a continuous process, and one should always be open to acquiring new knowledge, skills, and ideas throughout their entire life, regardless of age or stage in their career. This approach emphasizes that individuals and societies can benefit from fostering a culture where learning does not stop once formal education is completed, but rather continues across various aspects of life such as work, home, and leisure activities. Life-long learning encourages people to remain adaptable and to pursue self-improvement by enhancing their qualifications, staying updated with new advancements, and retraining themselves when necessary. This idea is particularly significant in today's fast-paced world, where the rapid progress of science and technology demands that individuals continuously update their knowledge and skills to maintain relevance and competency in their professional careers and personal lives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The movie is set in 1985, in the fictional town of Quatssack, New Hampshire. Quatssack seems like a nice, ordinary town, but it harbors a dark and deadly secret: it is the home of the Children of the Yeti, an evil cult that worships a yeti that lives in the woods. The yeti was captured in the Himalayas and brought to the town as an old man′s sideshow, but had escaped, and is reportedly the last of its kind. Each night, Debra, one of its members, lures young men to the cult with the intention of offering it up to the yeti as a means of keeping it sexually sated. The movie opens up with such an example, with Debra and Raymond, the cult′s leader, looking on while laughing sadistically. Five college students—fraternity brothers Adam and Dick, their girlfriends Sally and Emily, and a fifth member named Joe—are coming to Quatssack on a camping trip, unaware of the town′s secrets. On their first night, Joe is killed while going to the bathroom in the woods, and since he was the one who had the car keys, the remaining four cannot leave town. The old man, who now owns a hideous-looking creature called \\"Tentacle Boy\\" and displays it as a sideshow, informs them of the yeti that he used to own now living somewhere in the woods. Emily goes into a nearby church to pray for Joe′s safety, and while she is in there, she is discovered by a priest as a \\"Chosen One\\" that was prophesied to take down the Children of the Yeti. She accepts her destiny, and the priest gives her supplies for her mission. Meanwhile, Adam, Dick, and Sally, who are waiting for Emily outside, are ambushed by a redneck demanding the whereabouts of the Chosen One. Emily emerges from the church and shoots the redneck with a crossbow, and despite his seemingly near-fatal wound, demands that the redneck take them to the cult′s location. Only Adam and Emily follow the redneck; Sally is sent back to their campsite, while Dick had left earlier, having met Debra.

I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over. In an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky. Two coats, completely opaque and streak free. If you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States.

Under the draft proposal, the president would be able to serve up to two additional five-year terms, officials who saw the draft told Reuters. The president would have sweeping power and would not need to consult his parliament on most executive matters. ISRAEL APPOINTS FIRST AMBASSADOR TO TURKEY SINCE GAZA SPAT The report said the party was looking to hold a referendum next spring and was searching for support to win approval. Any constitutional change would need at least 367 out of 500 deputies in the assembly to give the OK, Reuters added. “We will continue to seek a base for consensus with the other parties,” Prime Minister Binali Yildirim told a conference of AKP provincial heads in Ankara. “After that, the decision lies with the people.” SYRIAN PRESIDENT ASSAD CLAIMS TRUMP COULD BE A 'NATURAL ALLY' The report said Erdogan has benefited from nationalist support after the failed military coup in July, and has cracked down on dissent in big ways. Close to 37,000 people have been arrested, more than 100,000 people dismissed or suspended from government jobs, and 170 media outlets and scores of businesses and associations have been shut down over alleged ties to a movement led by Fethullah Gulen, the Pennsylvania-based Muslim cleric whom Turkey accuses of masterminding the coup attempt. Turkish police detained the chief editor and at least 11 senior staff of Turkey's opposition Cumhuriyet newspaper last week. The detentions involving Cumhuriyet — one of Turkey's oldest newspapers — come amid accusations by opposition parties and human rights groups that Turkey's government is using the state of emergency imposed following a failed military coup to clamp down not only on alleged coup plotters, but on all government critics.

Brad did some blood tests and found out he has very high cholesterol levels, while his partner Dale had normal cholesterol levels, and was very healthy. Brad got scared and started worrying. Which friend was more at risk for heart disease? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, Brad seems to be at a higher risk for heart disease due to his elevated cholesterol levels compared to Dale's normal cholesterol levels. Cholesterol is an essential substance that the body needs to function properly. However, having too much cholesterol in the blood, particularly low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or \\"bad\\" cholesterol, can lead to the buildup of fatty deposits, also known as plaques, in the arteries. This condition is known as atherosclerosis. Over time, atherosclerosis can cause narrowing of the arteries, which reduces blood flow to vital organs, including the heart. When blood flow to the heart is restricted, it can cause chest pain (angina) or ultimately result in a heart attack (myocardial infarction) if the blood supply to a part of the heart muscle is blocked. High cholesterol levels often don't cause any signs or symptoms, which is why regular check-ups and blood tests, as Brad and Dale did, are essential for identifying potential cardiovascular risks. It is important to note that high cholesterol is only one of many risk factors for heart disease. Other factors include age, gender, family history of heart disease, hypertension (high blood pressure), smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, diabetes, and an unhealthy diet. It's crucial to consider one's overall risk profile rather than solely focusing on cholesterol levels. Although Dale has normal cholesterol levels, it doesn't mean he is immune to heart disease, as other risk factors may still play a role in his overall risk. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, which includes exercising regularly, eating a balanced diet, not smoking, and controlling blood pressure and blood sugar levels, is essential for both Brad and Dale to minimize their chances of developing heart disease. In conclusion, based on the information provided, Brad is at a higher risk for heart disease due to his elevated cholesterol levels.

Both Alabama and Florida boast great wetlands. The State of Alabama has experienced extensive drainage system due to expansion of farmlands. Their neighboring state Florida had similar system. But recently Florida had dismantled many of their drainage systems, mostly because of pressure from different environmental groups. Hint: Ecologically, the expansion of drainage systems has had tremendous negative effects. Hundreds of thousands of wetland species experienced significant population declines as their habitat was increasingly fragmented and destroyed. Although market hunting within the Central Flyway was a contributing factor in the decline of many waterfowl species' numbers in the early decades of the twentieth century, loss of breeding habitat to agricultural expansion is certainly the most significant. Early maps of midwestern states depict many lakes and marshes that are either nonexistent or significantly reduced in area today.

HERTA MULLER'S third novel begins in a women's university dormitory in Nicolae Ceausescu's Romania, where Lola, a poor girl from the provinces, has come to study Russian. In a Communist country short on consumer goods, Lola and her roommates dream of ''whisper-thin'' nylon stockings while making do with what they have: ''Under the pillows in the beds were six pots of mascara. Six girls spat into the pots and stirred the soot with toothpicks until the black paste grew sticky. Then they opened their eyes wide. The toothpicks scraped against their eyelids, their lashes grew black and thick. But an hour later gray gaps began to crack open in the eyelashes. The saliva dried up and the soot crumbled onto their cheeks.'' Lola, unprepared for city life by her village childhood, has brutal sexual encounters, hangs herself with a belt and is posthumously expelled from the Communist Party. The narrator of the novel is one of her roommates, soon herself an object of political suspicion, so that when she finally leaves the university, packing her pot of mascara, she finds an unpleasant surprise in her bed: ''When I picked up the blanket to pull off the cover, I found a pig's ear in the middle of the sheet. That was the girls' way of saying farewell. I shook the sheet but the ear didn't move, it was sewn on in the middle like a button.'' ''The Land of Green Plums'' is a novel of graphically observed detail in which the author seeks to create a sort of poetry out of the spiritual and material ugliness of life in Communist Romania. The book was not, however, written in Romanian. Herta Muller is a German writer who lived in Romania as part of that country's German minority; in 1987, she left Romania for Germany, where her novels have been published and acclaimed. In the 18th century, the Hapsburg rulers in Vienna encouraged German settlers to pioneer the Hungarian lands that had recently been regained from the Ottoman Empire. Some of these lands, with their descendant German communities, passed to Romania after World War I, and the German minority there, receiving special protection during Romania's alliance with Hitler, maintained its distinctive national character into the era of Communist rule. Ceausescu, seeking to mobilize Romanian nationalism around his dictatorship, perpetrated the general harassment of the German minority, which Ms. Muller experienced as a young woman in the 70's and 80's, and which she has worked into fiction in this novel about relentless persecution in a police state. ''My mother tongue is German,'' Ms. Muller said in a 1989 interview with Amnesty International. Like Kafka writing German in Prague, Ms. Muller in Romania found in her mother tongue the painfully direct expression of profound alienation. Michael Hofmann has produced a powerful English translation, though since an important purpose of the novel is to represent cultural survival through the German language, any translation necessarily obscures some of the work's significance. Furthermore, the issue of Germanness in the novel is very much attuned to the national sensitivities of German readers today. The narrator and her friends, persecuted as dissidents in Romania, must also confront their own family histories of sentimental loyalty to Hitler. ''My father was a member of the SS; I know what I'm talking about,'' Ms. Muller commented in the 1989 interview. In the novel, the narrator feels inevitably awkward in relation to Romania's Jewish survivors: ''It was Herr Feyerabend. He was shuffling his feet and pulled a white handkerchief out of his pocket. I withdrew my head, as if the white handkerchief could feel that someone like myself was staring at a Jew.'' While the narrator may look away from the handkerchief, Ms. Muller unflinchingly confronts the complexity of the 20th century in Eastern Europe, with its terrible permutations of persecution from generation to generation. The narrator watches the Romanian police guards in the streets of the city as they greedily pocket green plums. She herself had been warned as a child, by her father, that it was dangerous to eat green plums, but the guards do not hesitate: ''They knew where the plum trees were in every precinct they policed. . . . The plumsuckers were peasants. The green plums made them stupid. They ate themselves away from their duty. They reverted to childhood, stealing plums from village trees.'' Ms. Muller's vision of a police state manned by plum thieves reads like a kind of fairy tale on the mingled evils of gluttony, stupidity and brutality. The narrator watches the guards as they grab at young women in the streets. It might have been one of these men who followed Lola and mauled her, with ''the greedy desire of a starved dog.'' As the narrator ponders Lola's pathetic fate, the novel encompasses not only the political persecution of dissidents and the harassment of a national minority but also the particular kinds of oppression and vulnerability that women experience under a regime of policemen. Most of the literary accounts of Communist Eastern Europe have come from male writers, and it is especially interesting to have from Ms. Muller this work composed in a woman's voice. In the end, the narrator decides not to kill herself, as Lola did, but to immigrate to Germany, as most of Romania's Germans have done, both before and since the fall of Ceausescu in 1989. This marks the end of many communities that had survived from the 18th-century reign of the Empress Maria Theresa into our own less enlightened century. Ms. Muller conveys a certain sadness over the historical implications of emigration, the impending doom of her own native culture and society. She also offers a potent and repellent depiction of the world she left behind in Romania. A friend of the narrator works as an engineer in a slaughterhouse: ''Kurt told me every week about the slaughterhouse. The workers drank warm blood when they slaughtered the animals. They stole organ meats and brains. . . . Their wives and children are accomplices, Kurt said. The wives use the stiff cow tails for bottle brushes, and the children get the supple ones to play with.'' ''The Land of Green Plums'' addresses issues of vampirish complicity in the bloody rituals of an oppressive regime, whose hungry subjects, whether stealing fresh offal or green plums, ingest political poisons with historically protracted, corrosive consequences. What was this article about?","completion":"This article is a review of Herta Muller's third novel, \\"The Land of Green Plums,\\" which is set in Nicolae Ceausescu's Romania and begins in a women's university dormitory. The book is a detailed portrayal of life in Communist Romania, replete with graphically observed details, through which the author seeks to create a sort of poetry out of the spiritual and material ugliness of living under an oppressive regime. The novel sheds light on the relentless persecution in a police state, the harassment of the German minority, and the specific kinds of oppression and vulnerability experienced by women. Herta Muller is a German writer who lived in Romania as part of the country's German minority and wrote the novel in her native language rather than Romanian. The issues of \\"Germanness\\" in the novel resonate with the national sensitivities of German readers today, as the protagonist and her friends must confront their own family histories of loyalty to Hitler while simultaneously suffering from political persecution in Romania. Through the experiences of the female protagonist, \\"The Land of Green Plums\\" addresses issues of complicity in the rituals of an oppressive regime and the consumption of political poisons with far-reaching, corrosive consequences. The novel ultimately depicts a potent and repellent picture of the world left behind in Romania, while mourning the impending doom of the author's native culture and society as a result of emigration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, self-weighing on a regular basis is one of the most important. Select from: (A). Many studies have shown that getting on the scale at least once a week is important for weight maintenance long-term. Those who were more regular with weigh-ins had an easier time maintaining their weight and could maintain it long-term.. (B). Measuring yourself every day or two on a regular basis is perfectly fine. That is to say, for each week that you weigh yourself, stick to a reasonable weight.. (C). You should do regular, consistent weigh ups (ipt) twice each week. Consider putting a scale on your chest instead of your stomach to get an idea of how much weight you need to lose.. (D). Spend 30 to 60 minutes weighing yourself each day and then consider consulting a registered dietitian. This can help your weight change gradually rather than indefinitely..","completion":"(A). Many studies have shown that getting on the scale at least once a week is important for weight maintenance long-term. Those who were more regular with weigh-ins had an easier time maintaining their weight and could maintain it long-term. In addition to weighing yourself, it's crucial to track your progress and adjust your habits if you see any fluctuations in your weight. First, it's essential to maintain a well-balanced, nutritious diet. Consistently consuming wholesome foods, including lean proteins, whole grains, healthy fats, and plenty of fruits and vegetables, can help you preserve that lean physique. Furthermore, practicing mindful eating habits, such as eating slowly, chewing thoroughly, and paying attention to hunger cues, can also contribute to managing your weight effectively. Second, make regular physical activity a part of your lifestyle. Combining cardiovascular exercise with strength training can help build and maintain lean muscle mass, which contributes to a higher metabolic rate, ultimately helping in weight maintenance. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, along with strength training exercises for all major muscle groups at least two days per week. Getting enough rest and recovery is another critical factor to maintaining a lean physique. Sleep plays a vital role in weight management, as it affects your appetite-regulating hormones, ghrelin, and leptin. Strive for at least 7 to 8 hours of quality sleep each night to keep your hormones in check and prevent overeating or making poor food choices. Addressing stress management is also integral. High stress levels can lead to emotional eating and a disrupted hormonal balance, causing weight gain. Incorporating stress-reducing activities such as meditation, yoga, or engaging in relaxing hobbies can help you handle stress effectively and keep your weight in check. Lastly, accountability and support are crucial for maintaining a lean physique. Connect with friends, family, or online communities to share experiences, seek advice, and ultimately stay accountable for your actions. In conclusion, maintaining a lean physique involves a holistic approach that includes regular weigh-ins, a balanced diet, consistent exercise, adequate sleep, stress management, and social support. By incorporating these strategies, you'll be well-equipped to sustain a healthy, lean body in the long run."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Although she wrote \\"went off very well\\" in her diary, Ferrier was disappointed with her performance, and concluded that she needed further voice training. She approached the distinguished baritone Roy Henderson with whom, a week previously, she had sung in Mendelssohn's Elijah. Henderson agreed to teach her, and was her regular voice coach for the remainder of her life. He later explained that her \\"warm and spacious tone\\" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat: \\"one could have shot a fair-sized apple right to the back of the throat without obstruction\\". However, this natural physical advantage was not in itself enough to ensure the quality of her voice; this was due, Henderson says, to \\"her hard work, artistry, sincerity, personality and above all her character\\". Ferrier's performances in the Glyndebourne run, which began on 12 July 1946, earned her favourable reviews, although the opera itself was less well received. On the provincial tour which followed the festival it failed to attract the public and incurred heavy financial losses. By contrast, when the opera reached Amsterdam it was greeted warmly by the Dutch audiences who showed particular enthusiasm for Ferrier's performance. This was Ferrier's first trip abroad, and she wrote an excited letter to her family: \\"The cleanest houses and windows you ever did see, and flowers in the fields all the way!\\" Following her success as Lucretia she agreed to return to Glyndebourne in 1947, to sing Orfeo in Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice. She had often sung Orfeo's aria Che farò (\\"What is life\\") as a concert piece, and had recently recorded it with Decca.

The greater advances of the Soviet space program at the time allowed their space program to achieve other significant firsts, including the first EVA \\"spacewalk\\" and the first mission performed by a crew in shirt-sleeves. Gemini took a year longer than planned to accomplish its first flight, allowing the Soviets to achieve another first, launching Voskhod 1 on October 12, 1964, the first spacecraft with a three-cosmonaut crew. The USSR touted another technological achievement during this mission: it was the first space flight during which cosmonauts performed in a shirt-sleeve-environment. However, flying without spacesuits was not due to safety improvements in the Soviet spacecraft's environmental systems; rather this innovation was accomplished because the craft's limited cabin space did not allow for spacesuits. Flying without spacesuits exposed the cosmonauts to significant risk in the event of potentially fatal cabin depressurization. This feat would not be repeated until the US Apollo Command Module flew in 1968; this later mission was designed from the outset to safely transport three astronauts in a shirt-sleeve environment while in space.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Steven Norman Carlton (born December 22, 1944), nicknamed \\"Lefty\\", is a former Major League Baseball left-handed pitcher. He pitched from 1965 to 1988 for six different teams in his career, but it is his time with the Philadelphia Phillies where he received his greatest acclaim as a professional and won four Cy Young Awards. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994. Carlton has the second-most lifetime strikeouts of any left-handed pitcher (4th overall), and the second-most lifetime wins of any left-handed pitcher (11th overall). Carlton slumped in 1973, losing 20 games. The media's questioning of his unusual training techniques led to an acrimonious relationship between them and Carlton. In 1976, upon the advice of his lawyer Edward L. Wolf, decided to sever all ties with the media, and refused to answer press questions for the rest of his career with the Phillies. This reached a point where, in 1981, while the Mexican rookie Fernando Valenzuela was achieving stardom with the Los Angeles Dodgers, a reporter remarked, \\"The two best pitchers in the National League don't speak English: Fernando Valenzuela and Steve Carlton.\\" Media charges of bigotry and anti-Semitism In 1994 he agreed to an interview with writer Pat Jordan at his home in Durango, Colorado. The result was the story \\"Thin Mountain Air\\" in the April 1994 issue of Philadelphia magazine. This article was noted by the New York Times as being the source of numerous claims about Steve Carlton's political and social beliefs: \\"According to Pat Jordan, the writer of the article, Carlton alternately said that the world is ruled or controlled by the Russian and United States Governments, which 'fill the air with low-frequency sound waves,' the Elders of Zion, British intelligence agencies, '12 Jewish bankers meeting in Switzerland' and 'a committee of 300 which meets at a roundtable in Rome.' Not only that, but Carlton also charges, according to Jordan, that President Clinton has 'a black son' he won't acknowledge and that the AIDS virus was created at a secret Maryland biological warfare laboratory to get rid of gays and blacks.'\\" This same New York Times article notes that teammate Tim McCarver defended Carlton against charges of being a bigot and an anti-Semite, though he acknowledged \\"If he's guilty of anything, it's believing some of the material he reads. Does he become confused with his reading about radical things? Yes. I've told him that. Does that translate into him being anti-Semitic? No.\\" what was he view on the media","completion":"Steven Norman Carlton, widely known as \\"Lefty,\\" and celebrated as a former Major League Baseball left-handed pitcher, held a complicated relationship with the media. His relationship with the press was marked by contention and resistance, especially after 1973. Carlton’s performance deteriorated notably in that year, during which he lost 20 matches. The press seized the opportunity to scrutinize his unorthodox training techniques, leading to friction-filled interactions between Carlton and the media. Consequently, he sought legal counsel from his lawyer, Edward L. Wolf, who advised him to break away from all engagements with the media. Heeding this advice, Carlton stopped responding to press questions for the remainder of his career with the Philadelphia Phillies. This decision apparently created an intense situation to the extent that in 1981, a reporter commented about him and fellow pitcher Fernando Valenzuela, \\"The two best pitchers in the National League don't speak English: Fernando Valenzuela and Steve Carlton.\\" A decisive shift in Carlton’s view on the media seemed to occur in 1994. He agreed to participate in an interview with writer Pat Jordan at his home in Durango, Colorado. The discussion unfolded into the feature story \\"Thin Mountain Air\\" in the April 1994 issue of Philadelphia magazine. The narrative would soon earn a mention in The New York Times for the controversial insights it offered into Carlton's social and political beliefs. These claims, disputable in nature, generated a backlash and led to allegations of bigotry and anti-Semitism against Carlton. Notwithstanding these charges, former teammate, Tim McCarver, stoutly defended Carlton, asserting that the accusations against him were baseless. In McCarver's view, Carlton's flaw lay in his gullibility towards radical thoughts and ideas, which often led to confusion, but that did not translate into him being anti-Semitic. In summary, Carlton demonstrated a complex perspective regarding the media. His dealings with the press evolved from initial resistance and avoidance to a brief period of détente before being marred by controversy following the revealing 1994 interview. Despite these ups and downs, his reputation as one of the greatest left-handed pitchers in Major League Baseball has remained intact."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Solution 2: You find a little bush with tiny branches that are not very high from the ground. The branches don't seem very strong, and they could break if you hang the big swing on them. Also, the space between the ground and the branches is too small, so your legs will touch the ground when you swing. Which solution is better? The first one, right? Because in that one, you found a tall tree with a strong branch at a good height for the swing. That's the more sound solution, as it makes the most sense and is safer for you to enjoy swinging without problems."},{"prompt":"Pick one category for the following text.

A transsexual who had a £10,000 sex change on the NHS to become a woman now wants the taxpayer to foot the bill for a further £14,000 of surgery so she can become a man again. Chelsea Attonley, 30, who was born a boy and called Matthew, said she now finds being a woman 'exhausting', is tired of putting on make-up and wearing heels, and now accepts that she should always have stayed a man. Chelsea said she had struggled with her identity while growing up in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, and as a child she would dress up in women's clothes. In her twenties she became a drag queen known as Miss Malibu, drawing on glamour model Katie Price's look for inspiration. Scroll down for video. Chelsea Attonley, 30, who was born a boy and called Matthew, had a £10,000 sex change on the NHS to become a woman. She now wants the taxpayer to foot the bill for a further £14,000 of surgery so she can become a man again. An initial bid for a sex change to become a woman was turned down by a doctor, sending Chelsea into a spiral of depression, she said. But then the former drag queen, who copied Jordan's style by wearing a blonde wig, mini skirts and stilettos, had a chance meeting with her idol in a nightclub in 2007. The glamour model told her to 'go for it' and her words inspired Chelsea to return to her GP and push once again for the gender reassignment surgery, costing £10,000. But now, seven years after surgery to become a woman, Chelsea wants to go back to being a man - and wants the taxpayer to foot the bill. Chelsea, who lives on welfare benefits, told a magazine yesterday she finds dressing and acting as a girl 'exhausting' and feels she has never been fully accepted as a real woman. She is aiming to have a breast reduction on the NHS and painful gender reassignment surgery to give her back a penis at a total cost of £14,000. Chelsea, who changed her name by deed poll from Matthew in 2008 after a £5,000 boob job in Thailand partly funded by benefit money, says she gradually began having doubts about the sex change. Chelsea, now living in London, said: 'I have always longed to be a woman, but no amount of surgery can give me an actual female body and I feel like I am living a lie. 'It is exhausting putting on make-up and wearing heels all the time. Even then I don't feel I look like a proper woman. 'I suffered from depression and anxiety as a result of the hormones too. 'I have realised it would be easier to stop fighting the way I look naturally and accept that I was born a man physically.' Chelsea, who spoke on ITV's This Morning earlier this year about Katie Price's encouragement, says she does not feel guilty about asking the taxpayer to pay for her reversion. 'Now I have decided I want to live as Matthew, I am desperate to have my FF-cup boobs removed,' she said. 'I can't afford to have them done privately, so I am hoping to have the op on the NHS. 'I can't work at the moment because I am too upset after what I have been through. 'I am considering having penis reconstruction too. I don't feel bad about the NHS paying for the surgery as I don't consider it a choice. 'I need to have these operations for the sake of my mental health. I am lucky enough to live in a country where there is free health care.' Chelsea, who changed her name by deed poll from Matthew in 2008 after a £5,000 boob job in Thailand partly funded by benefit money, says she gradually began having doubts about the sex change. She said: 'I thought the surgery would make me feel complete, but it didn't. 'I knew deep down that, even though I had had surgery, I had still been born a man. 'But I tried my best to block out my feelings.' Chelsea said living as a woman is exhausting. 'No matter how much make-up I put on or how I dressed, I knew people would not know me as a real woman. Chelsea, now living in London, said: 'I have always longed to be a woman, but no amount of surgery can give me an actual female body and I feel like I am living a lie' 'It was draining to constantly think about how to walk and speak like a girl. 'I was fighting a losing battle. When people found out about my past, they treated me like a liar and a fake. I suffered from anxiety and depression.' She said she lost the support of her mother when she died from a heart attack. She said : 'I could not keep up the act of pretending to be a woman any more. It was making me miserable. 'I had to go back to living as Matthew.' She said she had always struggled with her identity while growing up in Chesterfield, Derbyshire. As a child she would dress up in women's clothes, and in her twenties she became a drag queen known as Miss Malibu. Chelsea has already had testosterone injections to begin her transition to becoming a man again. She has also had testosterone injections to stimulate hair growth and has cut his hair. She added: 'If people criticise me for wanting treatment on the NHS, it does not bother me. 'I know I need these changes to make me happy and no one should deny me that.' The TaxPayers' Alliance yesterday insisted the NHS should not be expected to pay out again. Research director Alex Wild said: 'The NHS must prioritise crucial frontline services over ridiculous vanity operations. 'This whole saga has simply cost far too much. If the Health Service is to be properly funded, this sort of waste must be cut out.'

If you don't have the perfect pair, take a trip to the thrift shop! Jeans, khakis, chinos, slacks -- all types will work. If the pants are too big, you'll need to rip up the side seam, cut out the unnecessary fabric, and sew it back together to match your waistline. Make sure it lies flat; you don't want any material bunching or bubbling -- it should naturally lie flush to the table. If your cut isn't perfectly straight, that's fine! As long as it's a clean line, it doesn't matter what angle it's at. In fact, a steeper angle can give your skirt a more refined, less patched-together look.

Using your 1/2\\" seam allowance, pin your fabric to the edge of the skirt, leaving the extra on the inside, rendering it invisible. Flip the skirt inside out and begin either hand stitching or blazing through with a sewing machine. If your fabric requires it, create a seam on the bottom edge, too. Just don't make it too short!

'well, good luck' and i headed back to my desk. 2:05pm: i got through the last 2 hours, keeping my head down, just waiting for them to get access to the camera system. they never got access to it and seemed to have given up. also people had started to make funny names for the culprit: midnight bomber, phantom pooper, and lucky logger are some of the names. everyone was trying to figure out who laid a steamer on the toilet seat. finally the day was over and i left the office...what a hectic, 'shitty' day. next few days: the next few days people in the office were still referencing the shit. 'who do you think was the midnight bomber?' hr had added a sign to both bathrooms stating to please clean up after yourself, no standing on the toilets, and no soiling the toilet seats. fast forward two weeks and the cto fires rod miller. i don't know why he was fired, but i wanted to stay as far away as possible. this happened 4 years ago, and to this day i've only told some close friends. they love this story and make me tell it all the time. at work people still make references to the midnight bomber and the phantom pooper...little do they know i am still amongst them. edit: some people asking what it looked like. i found one on ebay that looks similar: http://www.ebay.com/itm/realistic-fake-human-turd-poop-gross-gag-gift-prank-joke-crap-toilet-trick-/111384263608 Student:","completion":"\\"Steve\\", under a pseudonym, caused a hilarious situation at his workplace by placing a realistic-looking fake poop on a toilet seat, triggering an office-wide investigation, including examination of security footage and building access logs, which ended with a colleague being unfairly suspected and later dismissed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The text states that a parallelogram is a quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides. It also mentions that the opposite or facing sides of a parallelogram are of equal length. This information implies that while the opposite sides have the same length, the adjacent sides can have different lengths. To clarify, let's consider a parallelogram with sides AB, BC, CD, and DA. In this case, side AB must be parallel to side CD, and side BC must be parallel to side DA. The lengths of the opposite sides are equal, so AB = CD and BC = DA, but the lengths of AB and BC (or any adjacent sides) may not be equal. In a special case, when all four sides of the parallelogram have the same length, the parallelogram is called a square or a rhombus.

Here is a question about this article: The roots of hard rock can be traced back to the 1950s, particularly electric blues, which laid the foundations for key elements such as a rough declamatory vocal style, heavy guitar riffs, string-bending blues-scale guitar solos, strong beat, thick riff-laden texture, and posturing performances. Electric blues guitarists began experimenting with hard rock elements such as driving rhythms, distorted guitar solos and power chords in the 1950s, evident in the work of Memphis blues guitarists such as Joe Hill Louis, Willie Johnson, and particularly Pat Hare, who captured a \\"grittier, nastier, more ferocious electric guitar sound\\" on records such as James Cotton's \\"Cotton Crop Blues\\" (1954). Other antecedents include Link Wray's instrumental \\"Rumble\\" in 1958, and the surf rock instrumentals of Dick Dale, such as \\"Let's Go Trippin'\\" (1961) and \\"Misirlou\\" (1962). What is the answer to this question: Who recorded \\"Rumble\\"?","completion":"\\"Rumble\\" is an instrumental rock song recorded by Link Wray in 1958. Born as Fred Lincoln Wray Jr., Link Wray was an influential American rock and roll guitarist who pioneered new techniques and sounds with his instrument, helping to shape the future of hard rock and other genres. \\"Rumble\\" is a prime example of his innovative approach to guitar playing, featuring a menacing, raw sound that would later become a significant influence on the development of hard rock."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have considered various alternatives: A joint committee on the old model of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy is one. A single committee in each house of Congress, combining authorizing and appropriating authorities, is another. The new committee or committees should conduct continuing studies of the activities of the intelligence agencies and report problems relating to the development and use of intelligence to all members of the House and Senate. We have already recommended that the total level of funding for intelligence be made public, and that the national intelligence program be appropriated to the National Intelligence Director, not to the secretary of defense. We also recommend that the intelligence committee should have a subcommittee specifically dedicated to oversight, freed from the consuming responsibility of working on the budget. The resolution creating the new intelligence committee structure should grant subpoena authority to the committee or committees. The majority party's representation on this committee should never exceed the minority's representation by more than one. Four of the members appointed to this committee or committees should be a member who also serves on each of the following additional committees: Armed Services, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, and the Defense Appropriations subcommittee. In this way the other major congressional interests can be brought together in the new committee's work. Members should serve indefinitely on the intelligence committees, without set terms, thereby letting them accumulate expertise. The committees should be smaller-perhaps seven or nine members in each house-so that each member feels a greater sense of responsibility, and accountability, for the quality of the committee's work. The leaders of the Department of Homeland Security now appear before 88 committees and subcommittees of Congress. One expert witness (not a member of the administration) told us that this is perhaps the single largest obstacle impeding the department's successful development. The one attempt to consolidate such committee authority, the House Select Committee on Homeland Security, may be eliminated. The Senate does not have even this. Congress needs to establish for the Department of Homeland Security the kind of clear authority and responsibility that exist to enable the Justice Department to deal with crime and the Defense Department to deal with threats to national security. Question: \\"In what ways is it recommended that the new committee could be more transparent?\\" Response: \\"Give back money to the tax payers\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","completion":"No, the response to the question is not factually correct based on the paragraph.

David Hogg, one of the most outspoken survivors of the Valentine’s Day bloodshed which left 17 dead, first gained headlines after it emerged he interviewed class mates while the massacre was taking place. The teenager has since become a prominent voice in the debate around gun control and addressed a crowd of thousands at the Washington DC March For Our Lives rally last month. He welcomed demonstrators to the “revolution” for stricter gun laws and called for politicians who are supported by the National Rifle Association to get their “resumes ready”. Stallone, an actor who is the younger brother of Sylvester Stallone, has provoked a ferocious backlash for his remarks about Mr Hogg. \\"This David Hogg p***y is getting a little big for his britches. I'm sure someone from his age group is dying to sucker punch this rich little b****,” Stallone said in a now-deleted tweet. “Watch him run home like the coward he is.

Stallone also lashed out at Emma Gonzalez - a fellow gun activist and student survivor from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. ”Emma Gonzalez is another headline grabbing clown. She thinks she it she ain’t s***,” he said. Despite the fact both tweets have been deleted and his account is now protected - so only visible to certain users - screenshots of the tweets have circulated on Twitter.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).

I was eight years old at the time with a severe heart problem and I needed heart surgery. My Mom did not have the money, and without the surgery there was a real good chance I would not live to be thirteen years old. After contacting several organizations Dr. Vincent was able to get financial help for me through United Way, a Crippled Children's Organization. Dr. Vincent was a handsome man; he was also very gentle and caring. I remember being in the hospital for an Angiogram test, and during the procedure I was crying terribly, so the medical staff called in Dr. Vincent to calm me down, and he was able to comfort me when no one else could. Then the time came for me to have heart surgery; there was a fifty- percent chance that I would not make it through the surgery because it was experimental. At the time I was only the second or third person to have this procedure done. I was absolutely terrified, and again Dr. Vincent reassured me he would see to it that everything would be all right. I had a lot of confidence and trust in Dr. Vincent; He came to see me after the surgery, which was extremely painful but very successful, and brought me a stuffed animal. I was so surprised to get this gift from Dr. Vincent; I gave him a hug. I guess Dr. Vincent must have known I was feeling very lonely and scared.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: United States has varied geographical characteristics. Take for example, the Mississippi Delta. The delta has vast wetland that gets inundated every year. On the contrary, farther west, the Mojave Desert in Nevada sees very little precipitation or floodwater. Both places are beautiful in their own right, and attract many tourists every year. But I can use this background: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. What is an answer for this question: Would Mojave Desert be less or more prone to hypoxia than Mississippi Delta? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the context of the two geographical areas mentioned - the Mississippi Delta and the Mojave Desert.

By Jack Crone for MailOnline Controversial footage claiming to show the wreckage of an Israeli drone shot down near an Iranian power plant has been aired on television in Iran. The video has prompted questions about how a plane with limited range could have penetrated so deeply into the country and whether it is indeed what Tehran says it is. The brief clip showed what the channel described as parts of the battleship-gray drone scattered in an unidentified desert area. The unmanned device was identified as a Hermes 450, a known Israeli model. Scroll down for video This photo, released by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, claims to show the wreckage of an Israeli drone shot down by Iran near a nuclear site, 150 miles south of Tehran Israel is about 620 miles away from Iran's westernmost boundary and OPTIONS: - Foreign Ministry is about 370 miles inland from the closest border point in Iran. - Hermes is about 370 miles inland from the closest border point in Iran. - Iran is about 370 miles inland from the closest border point in Iran. - Iranian is about 370 miles inland from the closest border point in Iran. - Iranian Revolutionary Guards is about 370 miles inland from the closest border point in Iran. - Israel is about 370 miles inland from the closest border point in Iran. - Israeli is about 370 miles inland from the closest border point in Iran. - Jack Crone is about 370 miles inland from the closest border point in Iran. - MailOnline is about 370 miles inland from the closest border point in Iran. - Natanz is about 370 miles inland from the closest border point in Iran. - Tehran is about 370 miles inland from the closest border point in Iran.","completion":"Natanz is about 370 miles inland from the closest border point in Iran. The other options are wrong because they mention various other words that do not make sense in this context. The passage is talking about the location of a nuclear site in Iran, and Natanz is the correct option as it refers to the nuclear site in question. The other words used in other options are either people, organizations or unrelated locations, which make the other options incorrect."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Realising that Henry III had been right and that there was no prospect of a Protestant king succeeding in resolutely Catholic Paris, Henry agreed to convert, reputedly stating \\"Paris vaut bien une messe\\" . He was formally received into the Catholic Church in 1593, and was crowned at Chartres in 1594 as League members maintained control of the Cathedral of Rheims, and, sceptical of Henry's sincerity, continued to oppose him. He was finally received into Paris in March 1594, and 120 League members in the city who refused to submit were banished from the capital. Paris' capitulation encouraged the same of many other towns, while others returned to support the crown after Pope Clement VIII absolved Henry, revoking his excommunication in return for the publishing of the Tridentine Decrees, the restoration of Catholicism in Béarn, and appointing only Catholics to high office. Evidently Henry's conversion worried Protestant nobles, many of whom had, until then, hoped to win not just concessions but a complete reformation of the French Church, and their acceptance of Henry was by no means a foregone conclusion. How many years after Henry was received into the Catholic Church was he crowned at Chartres?","completion":"Just one year after Henry was received into the Catholic Church in 1593, he was crowned at Chartres in 1594."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer??","completion":"I will solve the given linear equation 43*o + 36 = -7 for the variable 'o' step-by-step: Step 1: Our main goal is to isolate the variable 'o' to one side of the equation. To do this, first, we will subtract 36 from both sides of the equation: 43*o + 36 - 36 = -7 - 36 Step 2: After simplifying both sides, we now have: 43*o = -43 Step 3: Now, we will divide both sides of the equation by 43 to isolate the variable 'o': 43*o / 43 = -43 / 43 Step 4: After simplifying both sides, we have found the value of 'o': o = -1 So the solution to the equation 43*o + 36 = -7 is o = -1."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would \\"Pluto in approximate true colour based on Hubble Space Telescope albedo data\\" be a reasonable answer? Available options: 1). No 2). Yes Answer:","completion":"1). No A dwarf planet is defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) as a celestial body that meets the following criteria: 1. It orbits the Sun or another star (not another planet). 2. It has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces and achieve a hydrostatic equilibrium shape (i.e., it is nearly spherical in shape). 3. It has not cleared its orbit of other debris (unlike planets, which have cleared their orbits of other debris). 4. It is not a satellite (or moon) of another celestial body. As for the phrase \\"Pluto in approximate true color based on Hubble Space Telescope albedo data,\\" it does not explain what makes a dwarf planet. Instead, this statement refers to an image or representation of Pluto showing its approximate true colors based on the reflectivity (albedo) data obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope. Albedo refers to the proportion of sunlight that reflects off a celestial object, giving an indication of the object's composition and surface properties. However, this information does not provide a definition or explanation about the features of a dwarf planet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Born in Scotland on 15 June 1792, he was son of John Mitchell of Carron Works and was brought up from childhood by his uncle, Thomas Livingstone of Parkhall, Stirlingshire. On the death of his uncle, he joined the British army in Portugal as a volunteer, at the age of sixteen. On 24 June 1811, at the age of nineteen, he received his first commission as 2nd Lieutenant in the 1st Battalion 95th Rifles (later the Rifle Brigade / Royal Green Jackets). Utilising his skills as a draughtsman of outstanding ability, he was occasionally employed in the Quartermaster-General's department under Sir George Murray. Mitchell's fourth expedition was into Queensland in 1845-46. He was convinced that a significant river must flow north-west into the Gulf of Carpentaria, this being the main thrust of the endeavour. On 15 December 1845 Mitchell started from Boree (Buree in Mitchell's journal) with a large party including Edmund Kennedy as second in command (later speared to death at Escape River near Cape York). He struck the Darling River above Fort Bourke then continued to the Narran River, the Balonne, and the Culgoa. On 12 April 1846 he came to a natural bridge of rocks on the main branch of the Balonne which he called St.George Bridge, now the site of the town of St George. Kennedy was left in charge of the main body here, and was instructed to follow on slowly while Mitchell pushed ahead with a few men. Mitchell followed the Balonne to the Maranoa, and the Cogoon (now called Muckadilla Creek, near Roma). This rivulet led him to a magnificent pastoral district in the midst of which stood a solitary hill that he named Mount Abundance. He then crossed a low watershed to the Maranoa and awaited Kennedy's arrival. Kennedy rejoined Mitchell on 1 June 1846. Leaving Kennedy for a second time, he set out on an extensive excursion of more than four months. Mitchell traversed the country at the head of the Maranoa and discovered the Warrago River. Keeping north over the watershed, he traversed the Claude and Nogoa rivers, then reached the Belyando River, an upper reach of the Burdekin River. This had already been discovered by Ludwig Leichhardt on his expedition to Port Essington on 2 April 1845. Intensely mortified to find that he was on a tributary of the Burdekin River, and approaching the ground already trodden by Leichhardt, he returned to the head of the Nogoa and struck west, after dividing his party and forming a stationary camp. He continued west, making a new discovery which he was certain was the fabled north-west river. In honour of the sovereign of the time he decided to call it Victoria River. Having run out of time, he turned back towards the main party. It was here that Mitchell first noticed the well known grass that bears his name. On the homeward journey he trekked along the Maranoa River to St.George Bridge, arriving in Sydney 20 January 1847. Later that year, Kennedy proved beyond doubt that the Victoria did not continue north-west, but turned south-west and joined Cooper Creek. He renamed the watercourse the Barcoo River from a name mentioned by local Aborigines.

Write highlights for this article: A strong odor from an unidentified gas led firefighters to evacuate 151 homes in a Philadelphia-area community, a fire department said. Firefighters began evacuating homes from part of Skippack Township after a resident complained of an odor early Sunday evening, the township's fire department said. With the help of meters, firefighters learned a gaseous volatile organic compound was coming from the basement sump pumps in several homes, the department said. They didn't immediately know what the gas was. Samples were taken to two labs for tests, and results are expected Monday afternoon, Skippack Township Fire Chief Haydn Marriott said. Volatile organic compounds cover a wide range of gases that can come from thousands of products, such as paints and lacquers, paint strippers, cleaning supplies, pesticides and permanent markers, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The Red Cross opened a shelter at an elementary school for evacuated residents who needed a place to stay, the fire department said. Firefighters were testing homes' gas levels again Monday, and evacuated residents were being allowed to return to homes where levels were low, Marriott said. Skippack Township is about 25 miles northwest of Philadelphia. United flight diverted due to odor. CNN's Haimy Assefa contributed to this report. Highlights:","completion":"1.
