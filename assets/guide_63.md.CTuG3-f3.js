Please answer this question: What is the claim to fame of the US millionaire Dennis Tito who soared high and achieved a first of sorts on April 28, 2001?","completion":"Dennis Tito, a US millionaire and entrepreneur, is best known for becoming the world's first self-funded space tourist on April 28, 2001. Born in Queens, New York on August 8, 1940, Tito made his fortune through his investment management firm, Wilshire Associates. His fascination with space began during his early years when he studied astronautics and aeronautics at New York University and later at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, earning a degree in Astronautics and Aeronautics in 1962, and a Master's in engineering science in 1964. Tito later worked at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California for five years as an aerospace engineer, where he was involved in planning trajectory for numerous Mars missions by NASA Mariner spacecraft. Although Tito had a successful career in finance, his dream of going to space never faded. In 1999, he turned to the Russian Space Agency, Rosaviakosmos (now called Roscosmos), to fulfill his spacefaring aspirations. Initially, Tito agreed to pay 20 million to visit the Russian space station Mir, but when the station was slated for de-orbiting in 2001, the plans were changed, and he was offered a seat on a Soyuz mission to the International Space Station (ISS). His decision to become a space tourist received mixed reactions from the public, the media, and space agencies worldwide. NASA and other ISS partners initially opposed Tito's participation, citing concerns over his insufficient training, his impact on the crew's safety, and the potential commercialization of space travel. Despite these concerns, Tito underwent nearly eight months of rigorous cosmonaut training at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia, to prove his competence. Eventually, an agreement was reached, and Tito became a crew member on Soyuz TM-32 mission to the ISS, alongside Russian cosmonauts Talgat Musabayev and Yuri Baturin. On April 28, 2001, the Soyuz TM-32 spacecraft successfully lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, with Tito aboard, making him the first private individual to venture into space. During his 8-day mission, Tito orbited the Earth 128 times and spent nearly 48 hours on board the ISS, fulfilling his lifelong dream. Dennis Tito's journey to space marked the beginning of a new era of space tourism, opening up opportunities for a limited number of wealthy individuals to experience space travel. Following Tito's successful mission, six more space tourists have made the journey to the ISS and back, with the latest being Guy Laliberté, the founder of Cirque du Soleil, in 2009. Today, organizations such as SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic are working on commercial space travel projects aiming to make space tourism more affordable and accessible to a wider audience."},{"prompt":"John designed a hypothetical lever that would have ideal mechanical advantage.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In 1834, Illinois voted whether to adopt Christmas as a legal holiday. Among those voting \\"nay\\" was the young Abraham Lincoln. In 1834, Lincoln had not yet grown out of his atheist phase, but the young Lincoln's lack of faith in God -- and his lifelong disbelief in the divinity of Christ -- does not explain his vote. In 1834, a vote against Christmas was a safe, even a conventional vote. Not a single state in the Union closed its offices for Christmas on December 25 in 1834. Lincoln marked his first Christmas as President, in December 1861, by holding a Cabinet meeting in the morning and a dinner party in the evening. The Lincoln family never had a White House tree and sent no Christmas cards. Nobody was much shocked by these omissions. The public Christmas as Americans know it today did not take form until late in the 19th century. George Washington issued a proclamation on Thanksgiving, but he never made any statement about Christmas (or Easter for that matter). The first state to recognize Christmas as a holiday was Alabama, in 1836, but the North and especially New England resisted. Not until 1856 did Massachusetts accept Christmas as a holiday. The federal government took until 1870 to follow. There's debate on the point, but it seems that Benjamin Harrison was the first president to allow a Christmas tree inside the White House in 1889. The tradition of lighting a tree on the White House grounds commenced with Calvin Coolidge in 1923. Dwight Eisenhower sent the first White House Christmas cards. Eisenhower's cards, however, were always determinedly \\"seasonal.\\" It waited until John F. Kennedy in 1963 to send a card that depicted a nativity scene. This late flowering of Christmas observance reflects two facts about Christmas that seldom get much attention in our public debates about the \\"war on Christmas.\\" In its first century, the national government practiced a separation of church and state far sharper than anything Americans would accept today. One example: From its founding in 1775, the federal post office delivered mail on Sundays. As evangelical forms of Christianity spread after 1800, the new denominations demanded an end to this desecration of the Sabbath. Some postmasters took it upon themselves to close operations. In response, Congress voted in 1810 to require all postmasters to work at least one hour on Sunday, on pain of losing their positions. The Americans of the founding generations insisted upon separation of church and state not because they were irreligious, but precisely because so many of them were so very intensely religious. Because religion mattered so much to early Americans, so did religious differences. Calvinists and Baptists, Methodists and Catholics, the grandest Boston rector and the rawest frontier preacher disagreed, sometimes to the point of outright violence. Anti-Catholic riots ripped apart Boston, Philadelphia and Bath, Maine, between the 1830s and 1850s. These contending denominations could, however, agree at least that they did not want a remote government in Washington favoring some religious practices over others. Better to deliver the mail on Sunday than debate who was right about the Sabbath. Better to issue no religious proclamations than let presidents pick and choose which holy days to mark and how to mark them. A second fact also explains the coolness of the early national government to Christianity: the keen awareness of many 19th century Christians of the non-Christian origins of many Christmas traditions. Christmas is celebrated near the date of the old Roman holiday of Saturnalia. Gift-giving on the day was also a Roman tradition. The Christmas tree, the hanging of wreaths and house-to-house caroling hark back to the pre-Christian German holiday of Yule. Calvinists had abandoned their outright ban on Christmas observance on the late 17th century. But many Protestant denominations retained a lingering suspicion of the holiday until deep into the 19th century. Two changes made possible the coalescing of an official Christmas holiday over the 40 years from Calvin Coolidge's outdoor Christmas tree to John F. Kennedy's sacral Christmas card: The fading of distinctions between Christians and the decline of theology within Christianity. The once all-crucial distinctions between Calvinists and Arminians (whose beliefs came from Dutch reformist Jacobus Arminius) and between even Protestants and Catholics have blurred. The once-vivid mistrust of trees and tinsel and burning logs has vanished, as American Christianity evolved away from a creed in which people believed and into a set of practices that people did. If Christians decorate trees, then tree decorating must be Christian -- no matter how or why the custom started and what the custom meant to the people who started it. Devout Christian believers can still be counted in the millions of course. Surrounding them, however, is a larger and more nebulous group for whom what was once a faith has become a folkway. For them, a Christmas tree or a nativity scene is less a declaration of individual belief than it is an expression of group identity. Many Americans feel this group identity to be under threat by changes in recent years. When they champion \\"Christmas as it was,\\" they do not mean \\"Christmas as it was for George Washington or Abraham Lincoln\\" and much less \\"Christmas as it was for Martin Luther or Jonathan Edwards.\\" They mean, \\"Christmas as it was when I was young.\\" That is why we have eruptions such as last week's flap over the whiteness of Santa Claus. If your Christmas celebrates the appearance of God Himself in the form of a human baby, it won't have a lot of room for a gift-giving elf and flying reindeer. But if Santa is at most tangential to the Christmas of faith, he is utterly central to the Christmas of folkway. It is the Christmas of folkway that is the Christmas so passionately defended by those who talk about \\"the war on Christmas.\\" The Christmas of Santa and Rudolph, and trees and stockings, and candy canes and \\"Merry Christmas\\" greetings began to be most publicly celebrated in the United States only after -- and only because -- the religious impetus for the holiday had already dwindled away. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"The article discusses the historical aspect of Christmas celebrations in the United States and how it evolved through time. In the past, Christmas celebrations were not as widely accepted, with states like Massachusetts only recognizing it as a holiday in 1856 and the federal government following in 1870. The late adoption of Christmas as an official holiday by various states can be attributed to two factors: a stricter separation of church and state and awareness of non-Christian origins of the holiday. The shift to accept and celebrate Christmas as a universal holiday became possible when the distinctions between different Christian denominations faded and theology declined within Christianity. The modern celebration of Christmas also leans more towards being a cultural event rather than purely religious, with practices like having a Christmas tree and Santa Claus being more about group identity than individual beliefs."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

It was established in 1998 as the Mitteilungen aus dem Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Geowissenschaftliche Reihe and originally published on behalf of the Museum für Naturkunde by Wiley-VCH; since 2014 it has been published by Copernicus Publications. The editors-in-chief are Martin Aberhan, Dieter Korn, and Florian Witzmann (Museum für Naturkunde). - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - Naval warfare is combat in and on the sea, the ocean, or any other major body of water such as a large lake or wide river. - The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The U.S. Navy is the largest, most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage. The U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with ten in service, two in the reserve fleet, and three new carriers under construction. The service has 323,792 personnel on active duty and 108,515 in the Navy Reserve. It has 274 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 aircraft in active service . - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\". - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - A reserve fleet is a collection of naval vessels of all types that are fully equipped for service but are not currently needed, and thus partially or fully decommissioned. A reserve fleet is informally said to be \\"in mothballs\\" or \\"mothballed\\"; an equivalent expression in unofficial modern U.S. naval usage is \\"ghost fleet\\". In earlier times, and especially in British usage, these ships were said to be \\"laid up in ordinary\\". - An aircraft carrier is a warship that serves as a seagoing airbase, equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft. Typically, it is the capital ship of a fleet, as it allows a naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations. Aircraft carriers are expensive to build and are critical assets. Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century from wooden vessels used to deploy balloons to nuclear-powered warships that carry numerous fighter planes, strike aircraft, helicopters, and other types of aircraft. - Sturgeon is the common name for the 27 species of fish belonging to the family Acipenseridae. Their evolution dates back to the Triassic some 245 to 208 million years ago. The family is grouped into four genera: \\"Acipenser\\", \\"Huso\\", \\"Scaphirhynchus\\" and \\"Pseudoscaphirhynchus\\". Four species may now be extinct. Two closely related species, \\"Polyodon spathula\\" (paddlefish) and \\"Psephurus gladius\\" (Chinese paddlefish, possibly extinct) are of the same order, Acipenseriformes, but are in the family Polyodontidae and are not considered to be \\"true\\" sturgeons. Both sturgeons and paddlefish have been referred to as \\"primitive fishes\\" because their morphological characteristics have remained relatively unchanged since the earliest fossil record. Sturgeons are native to subtropical, temperate and sub-Arctic rivers, lakes and coastlines of Eurasia and North America. Sturgeons are long-lived, late-maturing fishes with distinctive characteristics, such as a heterocercal caudal fin similar to that of sharks, and an elongated spindle-like body that is smooth-skinned, scaleless and armored with 5 lateral rows of bony plates called scutes. Several species can grow quite large, typically ranging 712 feet (2-3 m) in length. The largest sturgeon on record was a Beluga female captured in the Volga estuary in 1827, weighing and long. Most sturgeons are anadromous bottom-feeders which migrate upstream to spawn but spend most of their lives feeding in river deltas and estuaries. Some species inhabit freshwater environments exclusively while others primarily inhabit marine environments near coastal areas, and are known to venture into open ocean. - Scaphirhynchus is a genus of sturgeons native to the United States of America. All species in this genus are considered to be threatened. The pallid sturgeon is Endangered and the Alabama sturgeon is Critically Endangered. - Acipenseriformes is an order of basal ray-finned fishes that includes the sturgeons and paddlefishes, as well as some extinct families. - An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines. - The lead ship, name ship, or class leader is the first of a series or class of ships all constructed according to the same general design. The term is applicable to military ships and larger civilian craft. - In biology, a common name of a taxon or organism (also known as a vernacular name, English name, colloquial name, trivial name, trivial epithet, country name, popular name, or farmer's name) is a name that is based on the normal language of everyday life; this kind of name is often contrasted with the scientific name for the same organism, which is Latinized. A common name is sometimes frequently used, but that is by no means always the case. - Pseudoscaphirhynchus is a genus of fishes in the Acipenseridae family. The three species, all of which are threatened, are restricted to Central Asia. - FOSSIL is a standard protocol for allowing serial communication for telecommunications programs under the DOS operating system. FOSSIL is an acronym for \\"Fido Opus SEAdog Standard Interface Layer\\". \\"Fido\\" refers to FidoBBS, \\"Opus\\" refers to Opus-CBCS BBS, and \\"SEAdog\\" refers to a Fidonet compatible mailer. The standards document that defines the FOSSIL protocol is maintained by the Fidonet Technical Standards Committee. - USS Sturgeon ( SSN - 637 ) , the lead ship of her class of nuclear - powered attack submarines , was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the sturgeon . - The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code. - A ship is a large buoyant watercraft. Ships are generally distinguished from boats based on size, shape and cargo or passenger capacity. Ships are used on lakes, seas, rivers, and oceans for a variety of activities, such as the transport of people or goods, fishing, entertainment, public safety, and warfare. Historically, a \\"ship\\" was a sailing vessel with at least three square-rigged masts and a full bowsprit. - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which entity is they this sentence? Raccoons constantly play dead when people come near because they frighten them.","completion":"In the sentence \\"Raccoons constantly play dead when people come near because they frighten them,\\" the first entity mentioned is raccoons, which are medium-sized mammals native to North America, known for their distinct black mask-like facial markings and bushy, ringed tails. They are highly adaptable creatures and can be found in various habitats, including forests, wetlands, agricultural areas, and urban environments. The second entity mentioned in the sentence is people or humans. This is referring to the Homo sapiens species, which are the dominant and most advanced beings on planet Earth. People are known for their intelligence, ability to communicate using complex languages, tool-making skills, and social structures. In this sentence, raccoons are depicted as engaging in an interesting and unusual behavior: playing dead when people come near. The act of \\"playing dead\\" is also known as thanatosis and is an adaptive behavior exhibited by some animals in order to prevent themselves from being attacked or eaten by predators. By appearing dead, the animal might be perceived as unappetizing or even dangerous to the approaching predator, causing the predator to lose interest and move on. The reason provided for this behavior in raccoons is that they are frightened by humans. This fear might stem from past experiences with people, such as being hunted, harassed, or disturbed in some way. It could also be an innate response to seeing large, unfamiliar creatures like humans approaching their territory. Furthermore, the sentence implies a constant behavioral factor, meaning that raccoons may exhibit this behavior repeatedly when they encounter humans. This indicates that playing dead might be a successful strategy for these animals in avoiding harm and maintaining their safety in the presence of potential threats. In conclusion, the main entities in the sentence are raccoons and people. The raccoons are portrayed as playing dead consistently when in close proximity to humans, presumably to protect themselves from potential harm due to fear or past experiences with people. This adaptive strategy has likely evolved over time to help raccoons survive encounters with the dominant and sometimes aggressive human species."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This idea is dangerous. Science can be a force for evil as well as for good. Its applications can be channeled either way, depending on our decisions. The decisions we make, personally or collectively, will determine the outcomes of science. But here is a real danger. Science is advancing so fast is so strongly influenced by businesses that we are likely to believe whatever decisions we come to will make little difference. And, rather than fighting for the best possible policies, we may step back and do nothing. Some people go even further. They say that despite the moral and legal objections , whatever is scientifically possible will be done ----somewhere, sometime. They believe that science will get out of control in the end. This belief is dangerous too, because it a fuels sense of hopelessness and discourages them from making efforts to build a safer world. In our interconnected world, the lack of agreement in and of the world of science can lead to the failure to control the use of science. Without a common understanding, the challenges of \\"controlling\\" science in this century will be really tough. Take human cloning for example. Despite the general agreement among scientists on its possible huge impact on traditional moral values, some countries still go ahead with the research and development of its related techniques.

Article:","completion":"Title: A Disturbing Look into the Mind of Alyssa Bustamante: A Teenage Killer In 2009, the small community of St. Martins, Missouri, was shattered by a gruesome crime that has continued to haunt its residents. Alyssa Bustamante, a 15-year-old girl, brutally murdered her 9-year-old neighbor, Elizabeth Olten. What followed was a horrifying testimony from the killer, who showed no remorse and even admitted to finding the act of taking a life \\"enjoyable.\\" The chilling details of this case bring to light the question of how such a young person could commit such a heinous crime, and the events surrounding the murder raise serious concerns about the effect of psychological disorders on the actions of teenagers. At the time of Elizabeth's death, Alyssa was in the midst of a downward spiral. Although she attended church regularly with her family, underneath the façade of piety, Alyssa was dealing with severe mental health issues. An excerpt from her personal diary revealed her disturbed mindset as she wrote, \\"As soon as you get over the \\"ohmygawd I. can't do this\\" feeling, it's pretty enjoyable... Kay, I gotta go to church now.\\" Following the murder, Alyssa was not able to hide her dark side from authorities, and her true nature became the center of attention during her trial. Elizabeth's mother, understandably angered and distraught by her daughter's untimely death, voiced her opinion of the killer, stating that Alyssa was \\"not even human.\\" To comprehend how a teenager like Alyssa could become so detached from reality and engage in such a horrific act, it is important to consider the possible factors that contributed to her mental state. Mental health professionals have pointed to childhood trauma, unstable home environments, and the inability to form healthy relationships as potential contributors to the development of severe behavioral issues in teenagers. The tragedy of Elizabeth Olten's senseless murder is a stark reminder of the need for early intervention and proper treatment for at-risk youth. If the warning signs of Alyssa Bustamante's escalating behavior had been recognized and addressed sooner, perhaps Elizabeth's life could have been spared. In conclusion, the case of Alyssa Bustamante sends a chilling message about the importance of identifying and treating mental health issues in young people. As a society, we must be vigilant in recognizing the symptoms of psychological distress and provide support to help prevent more innocent lives from being taken at the hands of troubled teenagers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The scoring began early in the first quarter when Pittsburgh's Tyler Matakevich blocked a Britton Colquitt punt, knocking the ball into the end zone where it was recovered by Anthony Chickillo for a touchdown. The Browns were able to tie the score by the end of the first quarter, however, as rookie quarterback DeShone Kizer orchestrated a 12-play drive that ended when he scored on a 1-yard touchdown run. The game stayed at 7-7 through most of the second quarter, until the Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger connected with tight end Jesse James on a 4-yard touchdown with 45 seconds left in the first half. The 7-play, 91-yard scoring drive was highlighted by a 50-yard reception by Antonio Brown on a tipped ball. After a Zane Gonzalez field goal brought the Browns within 14-10 early in the third quarter, the Steelers drove down the field again. Roethlisberger threw a second touchdown pass to James to put them up by 11, 21-10. The drive was boosted by a 41-yard pass interference penalty on Browns cornerback Jamar Taylor on a deep pass intended for Brown. The score remained 21-10 until under four minutes remained in the game, when Kizer was able to throw his first career touchdown pass to Corey Coleman. A two-point conversion run by Isaiah Crowell brought the Browns to within a field goal, 21-18. The Browns did not get a chance to score again, however, as the Steelers were able to run out the clock after a long pass from Roethlisberger to Brown. Browns head coach Hue Jackson challenged the ruling; however, the catch call on the field was upheld.

The family discovers a duck in the wild that carries an unusual secret: it lays golden eggs. The Robertsons embark on an unexpected journey as they protect their newfound fortune while evading the US Treasury Department, which insists on turning over the duck for reasons unknown. As the story begins, the Robertson family has recently moved to a small town in Northern California to escape the busy city life. During one of their hikes, Lucy stumbles upon an ordinary-looking duck that appears to be injured. The compassionate family takes the duck home, nursing it back to health. They decide to call the duck \\"Goldie.\\" Over time, the Robertson family begins to notice that their duck is unlike any other. Miraculously, Goldie starts laying golden eggs! Initially, the family doesn't know what to make of it, but they quickly realize the eggs are valuable and can change their fortunes. News of Goldie and her extraordinary ability spreads throughout the town, eventually catching the attention of the US Treasury Department. The Treasury contacts the family and demands them to turn over the duck, citing the Gold Reserve Act. According to the agents, Goldie's ability to lay golden eggs compromises the stability of the country's gold reserves and the economy. However, the US Treasury Department and Agent Stevens - a determined but comically bumbling agent - have ulterior motivations for acquiring Goldie. Stevens is secretly working on behalf of a mysterious organization that aims to harness Goldie's abilities for their economic profiteering and world domination. The Robertson family refuses to turn in their beloved Goldie and, in response, they go on the run, evading the Treasury agents while trying to uncover the true intentions behind their pursuit. They utilize Goldie's gifts to obtain resources needed to stay one step ahead of the determined yet inept Agent Stevens and his team. Throughout their journey, the Robertsons explore jaw-dropping locations, meet unexpected allies - including a friendly zoologist and a secretive hacker who helps them expose the corruption in the Treasury Department - and face dangerous and comic misadventures.

Write a summary based on this article: Senator John McCain passed documents to the FBI director, James Comey, last month alleging secret contacts between the Trump campaign and Moscow and that Russian intelligence had personally compromising material on the president-elect himself. The material, which has been seen by the Guardian, is a series of reports on Trump’s relationship with Moscow. They were drawn up by a former western counter-intelligence official, now working as a private consultant. BuzzFeed on Tuesday published the documents, which it said were “unverified and potentially unverifiable”. Explainer: what is in the Trump-Russia dossier John McCain passed to the FBI? Read more The Guardian has not been able to confirm the veracity of the documents’ contents, and the Trump team has consistently denied any hidden contacts with the Russian government. A spokesman for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Wednesday denied Russia has collected compromising information on Trump and dismissed news reports as a “complete fabrication and utter nonsense”. Dmitry Peskov insisted that the Kremlin “does not engage in collecting compromising material”. Trump’s transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but late on Tuesday, Trump tweeted: “FAKE NEWS – A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!” He made no direct reference to the allegations. An official in the US administration who spoke to the Guardian described the source who wrote the intelligence report as consistently reliable, meticulous and well-informed, with a reputation for having extensive Russian contacts. Some of the reports – which are dated from 20 June to 20 October last year – also proved to be prescient, predicting events that happened after they were sent. One report, dated June 2016, claims that the Kremlin has been cultivating, supporting and assisting Trump for at least five years, with the aim of encouraging “splits and divisions in western alliance”. It claims that Trump had declined “various sweetener real estate deals offered him in Russia” especially in developments linked to the 2018 World Cup finals but that “he and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.” Most explosively, the report alleges: “FSB has compromised Trump through his activities in Moscow sufficiently to be able to blackmail him.” The president-elect has not responded to the allegations. The story of the Trump dossier: secret sources, an airport handoff, and John McCain Read more CNN reported on Tuesday that the FBI was still investigating the credibility of the documents but added that the intelligence chiefs had included a summary of the material in a secret briefing on Russian interference in the election delivered last week to Barack Obama and Donald Trump. The emergence of the documents is potentially explosive, 10 days before Trump’s inauguration and on the eve of his first planned press conference since July last year. Despite glowing references from US and foreign officials who have worked with the source, there are some errors in the reports. One describes the Moscow suburb of Barvikha as “reserved for the residences of the top leadership and their close associates”, but although it is a very expensive neighbourhood, there are no restrictions on who can own property there. The document also misspells the name of a Russian banking corporation. The FBI does not normally make any comment on ongoing counter-intelligence investigations but was under increasing pressure from Democrats and some Republicans to act before the inauguration, particularly because of Comey’s announcement of a continuing investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server 11 days before the election, which many of her supporters believe cost her the presidency. The reports were initially commissioned as opposition research during the presidential campaign, but its author was sufficiently alarmed by what he discovered to send a copy to the FBI. It is unclear who within the organisation they reached and what action the bureau took. The former Democratic Senate leader, Harry Reid, has lambasted Comey for publicising investigations into Hillary Clinton’s private server, while allegedly sitting on “explosive” material on Trump’s ties to Russia. Another Democratic senator, Ron Wyden, questioned Comey insistently at a Senate intelligence committee hearing on Tuesday on whether the FBI was pursuing leads on Trump campaign contacts with Russia. “Has the FBI investigated these reported relationships?” Wyden asked. Comey replied: “I would never comment on investigations … in a public forum. The Guardian can confirm that the documents reached the top of the FBI by December. Senator John McCain, who was informed about the existence of the documents separately by an intermediary from a western allied state, dispatched an emissary overseas to meet the source and then decided to present the material to Comey in a one-on-one meeting on 9 December, according to a source aware of the meeting. The documents, which were first reported on last year by Mother Jones, are also in the hands of officials in the White House. James Comey refuses to tell Senate if FBI is investigating Trump-Russia links Read more McCain is not thought to have made a judgment on the reliability of the documents but was sufficiently impressed by the source’s credentials to feel obliged to pass them to the FBI. The Senate armed services committee, which Senator McCain chairs, launched an inquiry last week into Russian cyber-attacks during the election. McCain was reluctant to get involved, according to a colleague, for fear the issue would be dismissed as a personal grudge against Trump. He pushed instead for the creation of a special Senate committee to look into connections between campaign staff and Moscow, but the proposal was blocked by the Republican leadership. McCain told the NBC programme Meet the Press on Sunday: “I would like to see a select committee. Apparently that is not in agreement by our leadership. So we will move forward with the armed services committee and I’m sure foreign relations and intelligence committee will as well.” But the senator added: “It is possible if enough information comes out, that that decision could be reversed. I still think it’s the best way to attack the issue.” Asked on the same programme on whether an investigation was ongoing into campaign links to Moscow, Senator Lindsey Graham, another conservative Republican said: “I believe that it’s happening.” According to the report passed to Comey, Russian intelligence allegedly gathered compromising material during Trump’s stay in Moscow in November 2013, when he was in the city to host the Miss Universe pageant. Another report, dated 19 July last year said that Carter Page, a businessman named by Trump as one of his foreign policy advisers, had held a secret meeting that month with Igor Sechin, head of the Rosneft state-owned oil company and a long-serving lieutenant of Vladimir Putin. Page also allegedly met Igor Divyekin, an internal affairs official with a background in intelligence, who is said to have warned Page that Moscow had “kompromat” (compromising material) on Trump. Two months later, allegations of Page’s meetings surfaced in the US media, attributed to intelligence sources, along with reports that he had been under FBI scrutiny. Page, a vociferous supporter of the Kremlin line, was in Moscow in July to make a speech decrying western policy towards Russia. At the time he declined to say whether he had been in contact with Russian officials, but in September he rejected the reports as “garbage”. The Guardian has learned that the FBI applied for a warrant from the foreign intelligence surveillance (Fisa) court over the summer in order to monitor four members of the Trump team suspected of irregular contacts with Russian officials. The Fisa court turned down the application asking FBI counter-intelligence investigators to narrow its focus. According to one report, the FBI was finally granted a warrant in October, but that has not been confirmed, and it is not clear whether any warrant led to a full investigation. A month after Trump’s surprise election victory, Page was back in Moscow saying he was meeting with “business leaders and thought leaders”, dismissing the FBI investigation as a “witch-hunt” and suggesting the Russian hacking of the Democratic Party alleged by US intelligence agencies, could be a false flag operation to incriminate Moscow. Another of the reports compiled by the former western counter-intelligence official in July said that members of Trump’s team, which was led by campaign manager Paul Manafort (a former consultant for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine), had knowledge of the DNC hacking operation, and in return “had agreed to sideline Russian intervention in Ukraine as a campaign issue and to raise US/Nato defence commitments in the Baltics and Eastern Europe to deflect attention away from Ukraine”. A few days later, Trump raised the possibility that his administration might recognise Russia’s annexation of Crimea and openly called on Moscow to hack Hillary Clinton’s emails. In August, officials from the Trump campaign intervened in the drafting of the Republican party platform, specifically to remove a call for lethal assistance to Ukraine for its battle against Moscow-backed eastern rebels. Trump campaign denies report of Trump Organization tie to Russian bank Read more Manafort stepped down in August as campaign manager and the campaign steadily distanced itself from Page. However, Trump’s praise of Putin and defence of Moscow’s actions in Ukraine and Syria remained one of the few constants in his campaign talking points. Manafort has denied secret links with Moscow calling the allegation “an outrageous smear being driven by Harry Reid and the Clinton campaign”. Since then, Trump has consistently cast doubt on Russian culpability for hacking the Democratic National Committee, defying a consensus of 17 national intelligence agencies. After Obama deported 35 Russian diplomats in retaliation for Moscow’s intervention, Trump praised Putin for not carrying out tit-for-tat deportations of US diplomats. “I always knew he was very smart,” he tweeted. An FBI spokesman declined to comment after the CNN report. ||||| Normally, Twitter loses its mind over something President-elect Donald Trump has tweeted. This evening, it’s losing its mind over an unverified, leaked report that supposedly details the ways in which Russia has been alternately teaming up with Trump and working to collect compromising information about him. The allegations contained in it are startling. Among them: Trump has been filmed with Russian prostitutes, knew about Russian hacking, and changed his policy on the Ukraine for Russia, and on and on. US intelligence agencies and multiple journalists haven’t verified these claims to a sufficient degree that they feel comfortable publishing them. And yet here we are, reading them anyway. And making jokes about golden showers on Twitter related to our next president. What is even going on here? Let’s start with what has taken this report out of the realm of gossip and allegation amongst in-the-know reporters and into your Twitter feed. According to CNN, both Trump and President Obama were given a briefing that included a synopsis of this larger, 35-page report. The ostensible reason for the two-page synopsis that they received was “to make the President-elect aware that such allegations involving him are circulating among intelligence agencies, senior members of Congress and other government officials in Washington,” according to CNN. The New York Times reports that “Intelligence officials were concerned that the information would leak before they informed Mr. Trump of its existence.” In other words: people are talking about it, you should know about it. That took the newsworthiness of the report up a level, and so BuzzFeed followed an almost identical logic and published the 35-page report itself. Its justification for doing so, knowing that the allegations contained therein are unverified, is “so that Americans can make up their own minds about allegations about the president-elect that have circulated at the highest levels of the US government.” In other words: people are talking about it, you should know about it. That reason for publishing is often not only enough, but more than enough to merit publication (cf. this very article). According to BuzzFeed, “the documents have circulated for months, and acquired a kind of legendary status among journalists, lawmakers, and intelligence officials.” It seems likely that it was going to leak one way or another, so a report that Trump and Obama had been briefed on it was as good a time as any for that to happen. BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith tweeted out an email he sent to his staff detailing why BuzzFeed chose to publish the document: Here's the note I sent to @buzzfeednews staff this evening pic.twitter.com/OcAloWzVzb — Ben Smith (@BuzzFeedBen) January 11, 2017 Smith’s take here is more nuanced than simply “people are talking about it.” He’s right that it seems clear that this report is behind some of the more serious allegations that have been thrown around by people at the highest levels of US government. Smith’s line of reasoning is defensible — but not every reporter agrees. The report itself was apparently compiled by a former British intelligence agent “whose past work US intelligence officials consider credible,” CNN says. We know only that the report is being taken seriously by serious people. But the work of corroborating the allegations in it hasn’t been finished yet, so other journalists who had seen it chose not to publish it. 1. For those asking, I didn't publish the full memos from the intelligence operative because I could not confirm the allegations. — David Corn (@DavidCornDC) January 11, 2017 But now that it’s out there, published as a PDF with yellow highlights from an unknown reader, it’s out there. I myself tweeted out one of the most explosive allegations (while also noting one of the most salacious parts), and my Twitter notifications are blowing up. The report seems custom-designed to spread on Twitter. It practically begs you to screencap and Tweet whatever part outrages you the most (or makes you titter the most). These soundbites have been weaponized by Twitter, made all the more powerful because they appeal to the deepest desires and fears of Trump’s critics. After months — and years — of watching damning leaks about Hillary Clinton, finally there’s a leak for the other side to share and spread, provenance be damned. FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017 It’s not “Fake News,” as Donald Trump just declared on Twitter, because the real news here is that Trump himself was briefed on the contents of this report. It’s unverified news, which is an entirely different thing that requires that you pay attention to where it came from, why, and how. It’s not necessarily bad that this report is out there — but we should keep in mind that lots of people have been reading and trying to verify these claims for months now. But as it spreads on Twitter, screenshot by gleefully outraged screenshot, it’s going to be stripped of nuance and context. But we’ll still share and reply and retweet and joke. Because people are talking about it, and that’s the way we talk now. ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — Top intelligence officials last week told President-elect Donald Trump about an unsubstantiated report that Russia had compromising personal and financial information about him, a U.S. official said Tuesday. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not allowed to publicly discuss the matter. The briefing about the document was first reported by CNN. A summary of the allegations was separate from a classified assessment of Russia's attempts to meddle in the U.S. presidential election. Trump and President Barack Obama were briefed on the intelligence community's findings last week. Shortly after news reports were published about the briefing, Trump tweeted: \\"FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!\\" Trump was expected to hold a previously scheduled news conference Wednesday to discuss his future plans regarding his role with the Trump Organization. The unsubstantiated dossier on Trump was compiled by a former Western intelligence operative as part of an opposition research project originally financed by a Republican client who opposed Trump, and later funded by Democrats, according to Mother Jones, which published an article about the report in October and said the operative had turned over the report to the FBI. The New York Times reported the operative had previously worked for British intelligence. The Associated Press has not been able to substantiate the information in the dossier, which misspelled the name of Russia's largest bank. It's unclear why the intelligence officials decided to brief the president and Trump on the uncorroborated information at this time, but lawmakers and others have repeatedly noted that Russia collects intelligence on both Democrats and Republicans. \\"The Russians also hacked systems associated with the Republicans. They just chose not to release that material yet,\\" Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, said Tuesday. \\"There's nothing that prevents them from doing so at a time of their choosing in the future.\\" Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said in an interview Tuesday on NBC's \\"Late Night with Seth Meyers\\" that \\"nobody has sourced it. They're all unnamed, unspoken sources in the story.\\" She said it may have originated with a Russian investigator or groups that wanted Hillary Clinton to win the White House. The report had been circulating in Washington for months. In October, former Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid wrote the FBI asking the bureau to publicly disclose what it knew about the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. Reid was aware of the dossier before he wrote the letter, according to a person knowledgeable about the subject who spoke on condition of anonymity because this person was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. FBI Director James Comey refused earlier Tuesday to say whether the FBI was investigating any possible ties between Russia and Trump's presidential campaign, citing policy not to comment on what the FBI might or might not be doing. Comey was pressed by Democrats on the committee about whether the FBI was conducting an investigation. There was no mention during the hearing about the summary of the dossier, which was attached to the classified hacking assessment. \\"I would never comment on investigations — whether we have one or not — in an open forum like this so I can't answer one way or another,\\" Comey told the panel during his first public appearance before Congress since the election. In late October, Comey angered Democrats when he announced 11 days before the election that the FBI was looking at more emails as part of its investigation of Hillary Clinton. Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden said the American people had a right to know about whether there is an FBI investigation into the Trump campaign's ties with Russia. An active FBI investigation of the next president for ties between his campaign and a nation accused of meddling in the presidential election could further stoke mistrust in the legitimacy of the democratic process. It could also put Trump's own FBI in the awkward position of examining the conduct of those closest to the commander-in-chief. The FBI was among three U.S. intelligence agencies that collaborated on last week's report on Russia's election activity. It tied Russian President Vladimir Putin to the hacking of email accounts of the Democratic National Committee and individual Democrats like Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta. It said there was no evidence the Russians tampered with vote tallies; the agencies said they couldn't assess if Russia succeeded in influencing Americans to vote for Trump. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who opposed Trump in the GOP primary, said Russia's activity wasn't guided by its support for Trump, but rather \\"to influence and to potentially manipulate American public opinion for the purpose of discrediting individual political figures, sowing chaos and division in our politics, sowing doubts about the legitimacy of our elections.\\" Democrats at the committee hearing focused their toughest questions on Comey, who was widely criticized for breaking FBI policy in his decision to notify Congress about additional information that came up related to Clinton. He is in the fourth year of a 10-year term, meaning he is expected to stay on in the Trump administration. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said Comey set a new standard by discussing the bureau's activity related to Clinton's private email server. That standard, she said, is the FBI discusses ongoing investigations when there is a \\"unique public interest in the transparency of that issue.\\" The intelligence agencies' findings on Russian hacking fit that standard, she argued. \\"I'm not sure I can think of an issue of more serious public interest than this one,\\" Harris said. \\"This committee needs to understand what the FBI does and does not know about campaign communications with Russia.\\" Sitting beside Comey, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said, \\"Fair point.\\" ___ Associated Press writer Kathleen Hennessey contributed to this report. ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. President-elect Donald Trump was not told about unverified reports that Russia has compromising information on him during last week's intelligence briefing, according to a senior intelligence official with knowledge of preparations for the briefing. A summary of the unverified reports was prepared as background material for the briefing, but not discussed during the meeting, the official said. During Trump's press conference Wednesday morning, the president-elect said he was made aware of the information \\"outside that meeting.\\" A 35-page memorandum published by BuzzFeed on Tuesday includes claims that the Russian government has been cultivating, supporting and assisting Trump for five years — even obtaining compromising information in an effort to blackmail him. (BuzzFeed is partially funded by the parent company of NBC News.) The document, which was not prepared by the U.S. government, contains obvious errors. It was originally generated as part of opposition research by anti-Trump Republicans and then shopped by Democrats. Related: Seth Meyers Confronts Conway Over Trump Allegations Two U.S. officials told NBC News that materials prepared for Trump in advance of last week's intelligence briefing included damaging allegations from the memorandum — unverified by American intelligence agencies — about his dealings with the Russians. Officials prepared a two-page summary of the memo for Trump's briefing Friday at Trump Tower in New York. The summary was an \\"annex,\\" or addendum, included in the \\"supporting documents\\" that accompanied the classified briefing report. While multiple officials say the summary was included in the material prepared for the briefers, the senior official told NBC News that the briefing was oral and no actual documents were left with the Trump team in New York. During the briefing, the president-elect was not briefed on the contents of the summary. “Intel and law enforcement officials agree that none of the investigations have found any conclusive or direct link between Trump and the Russian government period,” the senior official said. According to the senior official, the two-page summary about the unsubstantiated material made available to the briefers was to provide context, should they need it, to draw the distinction for Trump between analyzed intelligence and unvetted “disinformation.” The briefers also had available to them unvetted “disinformation” about the Clinton Foundation, although that was not orally shared with Trump. The Russian government on Wednesday denied reports that it has compromising information about Trump, dismissing the claims as a \\"total hoax.\\" Amid increased interest in the dossier Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected all of the allegations out of hand. Trump later blamed intelligence agencies for allowing the dossier to leak, tweeting: \\"Are we living in Nazi Germany?\\" \\"The Kremlin does not have compromising information about Trump,\\" Peskov said, according to Russian state-run news agency TASS. \\"It's a total hoax, absolute fabrication and utter nonsense. The Kremlin does not collect compromising information.\\" Peskov also called the reports \\"pulp fiction.\\" Trump did not respond to the reports directly but sent a tweet appearing to refer to it on Tuesday night. Early Wednesday, he sent several others that followed Peskov's comments. Trump has repeatedly cast doubt over findings by American intelligence officials that Russia interfered in the U.S. election with the aim of helping him win. NBC News reported last week that the gulf between Trump and U.S. intelligence agencies had grown so wide that the two camps couldn't even agree on the scheduled date of a briefing Trump had been due to receive. Related: Putin's Sassy Trolling Sent Message to Trump, Experts Say Peskov mentioned Trump's initial tweet, and went on to say that some people were “boosting the hysteria and go to any lengths to maintain this state of 'witch hunting.'” Michael McFaul, who was ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014, told NBC News he was sure Russian officials were \\"thrilled\\" to see Americans bickering about the leaked memo. \\"It doesn't make us look like we are a healthy democracy.\\" McFaul also said that Trump had contributed to an atmosphere in which \\"fake news\\" could flourish because of his past promotion of the unfounded \\"birther\\" conspiracy theory about President Barack Obama's birthplace. In an interview with NBC News before his farewell address Tuesday night in Chicago, Obama said he had not seen the news accounts of Trump's Russian ties but noted that \\"as a matter of principle and national security, I don't comment on classified information.\\" Last month, Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats as punishment for Russia's alleged cyberattacks in the run-up to the Nov. 8 election. The CIA has concluded that the interference was intended to help Trump win, and intelligence officials told NBC News that they believe \\"with a high level of confidence\\" that Russian President Vladimir Putin was personally involved in the covert campaign. Trump has been skeptical about the alleged Russian hacks, even as he repeatedly praised Putin. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Documents allegedly showing secret contact between Moscow's intelligence and US President-elect Donald Trump's election campaign have been passed to FBI director James Comey by Senator John McCain, according to The Guardian. The papers, which were commissioned as opposition research, were first reported by Mother Jones last year and have also been viewed by the Obama administration. The contents of the papers have not been verified, but their source has previously been described as having a reputation for Russian contacts.

I was a very confused 17 year old, and she took an interest in me, and we would talk about all my problems with my own family, and everything that was going wrong with me. I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’. We separated after about 8 years, when our daughter was 7 years old, and I told her why. I just couldn’t go on living the lie. I hate myself for doing it to her. Selfishly, I wouldn’t change things though, as I have my daughter and I love her, and I love being a parent.

Police In contrast, the police are entitled to protect private rights in some jurisdictions. To ensure that the police would not interfere in the regular competencies of the courts of law, some police acts require that the police may only interfere in such cases where protection from courts cannot be obtained in time, and where, without interference of the police, the realization of the private right would be impeded. This would, for example, allow police to establish a restaurant guest's identity and forward it to the innkeeper in a case where the guest cannot pay the bill at nighttime because his wallet had just been stolen from the restaurant table. Q: What could be impeded without police interference?","completion":"A: Without police interference in certain situations, the realization of the private right would be impeded.

First question: \\"Is IAS above the level of DM just a glorified clerk to a politician?\\" IAS stands for Indian Administrative Service, and DM means District Magistrate.

IAS officers are like big helpers, and they work with politicians (people who make rules), but they are not just glorified clerks. They have many more responsibilities, like taking care of the community's needs and solving problems. Second question: \\"How long does an IAS officer serves as DM?\\" An IAS officer, who is like a big helper, can be a DM, or District Magistrate, for different amounts of time. Sometimes, they are DM for few years, and sometimes for a little longer. It depends on how good they are at their job and whether they need to move to a different job to help more people.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Wait until the leaf buds begin to swell, then use a sturdy, sharp blade to ensure a clean cut. Prune by cutting at a 45-degree angle, just above an outer-facing growth bud. Growth buds are small raised or discolored triangular shaped areas on the rose stem. They are where the new stem will grow. Pruning above an outer-facing growth bud encourages the roses to grow outward, rather than inward, which can reduce air circulation and lessen the visual appeal of the bush. Avoid pruning your new rose for the first two years after you have planted it. Your rose bush will only need to be pruned after it has developed old growth or mature stems. If you wish to maintain the same size rose bush each year, trim back about ⅓ of the plant. If you want it smaller, trim more, and for a larger plant, trim less. Cut this back until you see a healthy white center to the stem. Your aim is to have a plant where growth is well spaced out to encourage the flow and circulation of air. Remove close growing stems and any that cross or are tangled. On older plants you can cut back any old wood growth that no longer produces any new stems. Summary:","completion":"Wait until the small parts of the tree where new branches grow (we call these leaf buds) start to get bigger, then cut these using a sharp tool. Cut at a diagonal, or slanted, angle above a spot on the rose stem that's going to grow outwards. This helps the roses to grow outwards and not inwards, making the rose bush look nicer and healthier. Do not cut your new rose bush for the first two years after you've planted it. Only cut the rose bush once it has grown a lot. Depending on how big or small you want your rose bush to be, you should cut a little or a lot of it. Always cut until you see the inside of the stem is white and healthy. Your goal is to have a bush where branches are not too close to each other, this helps the air to move around the plant better. Also, remove branches that are too close or tangled with other branches. On older plants, you can cut branches that don't have new growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Long after its introduction into the New World, American English was still considered non-standard English. According to some people of the 1780s American English was a peasant's language that a \\"gentleman\\" will not speak. Considered in a bilingual point of view, British English was the dominant language linked to prestige and language purism . The belief in the authority or say in the superior of British English, has remained to the twentieth century, especially in the former British Empire or in the fields of British influence. Thus, it is reported that in prefix = st1 /China, teachers and school textbooks refer to and recommend Received Pronunciation as the model, as well as standard British sentence structures, spelling and words. British English is also encouraged and accepted as the criteria of some major official examinations, for example, College English Test and Test for English Majors which are conducted by government. Similar situations could be found in countries, for example, in Africa, the West African Examination Council and Joint Admission accepts the British English as the standard English. Report can also be found that inCairosome university students received lower grades if they used American spellings instead of British English. In Europe, we find teachers, British people as well as natives of the country in which they work, who follow the British English standard, and laugh at the American English. However, the above attitudes are nothing but the last influence of a long-gone period of British supermacy . The beginning of a clear lead of American English can be traced to the decades after World War II. This coincides with the simultaneous rise of the US as a military and technological power and the decline of the British Empire, which drove many to American English. And from then on, American English has continuously sent its influence to every corner of the planet. Where do the students get poor mark if they use American spellings? A) In China. B) In Cairo.

I have brought visiting family members here for everything from t-shirts to expensive jewelry items. The staff is helpful and friendly. The owner, \\"Hong\\", however - is not. She has a major attitude and has been rude and insulting on more than one occasion. I have had her follow me around like a suspected shoplifter when needing to try on a \\"Double D Ranchwear\\" t-shirt. It isn't my fault the only dressing room is in another area of the store, and \\"Lucita\\" already knew who I was/what I was trying on. Further, if a store owner is following a customer - the proper approach is to offer service: \\"How are you doing? Can I get you a different style or size?\\" Hong does not offer service if her subordinates are present. Hong has also insulted the jewelry I was wearing at the time - a 500 item. Her insult was in response to the fact I asked the source of the turquoise on an item in her case. My grandfather was Native American and I have an extensive collection and have worked with turquoise, so I do know the characteristics between the turquoise produced by the domestic mines and how it differs from Mexican and Chinese turquoise. I have truly made an effort to practice more graciousness than she clearly possesses by NOT observing that I could easily identify types of turquoise decades before she married into the Bischoff family. Further, I have heard her misrepresent some of her products to tourists. (Native Americans will usually identify their jewelry by the terms \\"Native American\\", \\"Zuni\\", \\"Navajo,\\" etc - not \\"Indian Made.\\") Further, a majority of her earrings - particularly the Repousse- can be found on eBay.....identical product - 60% less. If one purchases here, I would definitely ask for proof of authenticity. (and they do have some real works of art, but their inventory is a mix). There's another issue: pricing.

Information: - Hugo Christiaan Hamaker ( 23 March 1905 , Broek op Langedijk , North Holland -- 7 September 1993 , Eindhoven ) was a Dutch scientist , who was responsible for the Hamaker theory which explains the van der Waals forces between objects larger than molecules . His 1937 paper was heavily cited . He completed his doctorate at the Universiteit Utrecht in 1934 . His dissertation was labelled : Reflectivity and Emissivity of Tungsten ; with a Description of a New Method to Determine the Total Reflectivity of Any Surface in a Simple and Accurate Way . His adviser was Leonard Ornstein . From 1934 to 1967 he was employed in the Physical Laboratory of Philips in Eindhoven , and from 1960 to 1972 he was Professor at the Eindhoven University of Technology . - After the explanation of van der Waals forces by Fritz London several scientists soon realised that his definition could be extended from the interaction of two molecules with induced dipoles to macro-scale objects by summing all of the forces between the molecules in each of the bodies involved. The theory is named after H. C. Hamaker who derived the interaction between two spheres, a sphere and a wall, and presented a general discussion in a heavily cited 1937 paper. - A molecule is an electrically neutral group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. Molecules are distinguished from ions by their lack of electrical charge. However, in quantum physics, organic chemistry, and biochemistry, the term \\"molecule\\" is often used less strictly, also being applied to polyatomic ions. - The Netherlands is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament. The name \\"Holland\\" is used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. - The Dommel is a stream in Belgium and the Netherlands, left tributary of the Dieze. It rises in north-eastern Belgium near Peer and flows into the southern part of the Netherlands. The Dommel takes in water from the Keersop, Tongelreep, Run, Gender and Kleine Dommel streams and merges at 's-Hertogenbosch with the Aa stream to form river Dieze, which subsequently flows towards the Meuse. The main cities and towns along the Dommel's course are Peer, Neerpelt, Valkenswaard, Dommelen, Eindhoven, Son en Breugel, Sint-Oedenrode, Boxtel, Sint-Michielsgestel and 's-Hertogenbosch. The most original part and natural state of the Dommel can be found between Eindhoven and Boxtel. Here the Dommel has still its original winds and meanders and forms a cultural-historical and valuable landscape area called the Dommelbeemden. - Fritz Wolfgang London (March 7, 1900 March 30, 1954) was a Jewish-German physicist and professor at Duke University. His fundamental contributions to the theories of chemical bonding and of intermolecular forces (London dispersion forces) are today considered classic and are discussed in standard textbooks of physical chemistry. With his brother Heinz London, he made a significant contribution to understanding electromagnetic properties of superconductors with the London equations and was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry on five separate occasions. - Friesland (official) or Frisia is a province in the northwest of the Netherlands. It is situated west of Groningen, northwest of Drenthe and Overijssel, north of Flevoland, northeast of North Holland, and south of the North Sea. In 2010, the province had a population of 646,000 and a total area of . - Broek op Langedijk (West Frisian: \\"Broek op Lengedìk\\") is a town in the Netherlands, located in the municipality of Langedijk in the province of North Holland. - North Holland (, West Frisian: \\"Noard-Holland\\") is a province in the northwest of the Netherlands. It is situated on the North Sea, north of South Holland and Utrecht, and west of Friesland and Flevoland. As of 2015, it has a population of 2,762,163 and a total area of . - In physical chemistry, the van der Waals forces (or van der Waals interaction), named after Dutch scientist Johannes Diderik van der Waals, are the residual attractive or repulsive forces between molecules or atomic groups that do not arise from covalent bonds, nor ionic bonds. It can be shown that van der Waals forces are of the same origin as the Casimir effect, arising from quantum interactions with the zero-point field. The resulting van der Waals forces can be attractive or repulsive. - Eindhoven is a municipality and a city in the south of the Netherlands, originally at the confluence of the Dommel and Gender streams. The Gender was dammed short of the city centre in the 1950s and the Dommel still runs through the city. The city has a population of 223,220 in January 2015, making it the fifth-largest municipality of the Netherlands and the largest in the province of North Brabant. - Noord Brabant, also unofficially called Brabant, is a province in the south of the Netherlands. It borders the provinces of South Holland and Gelderland to the north, Limburg to the east, Zeeland to the west, and the Belgian provinces of Antwerp and Limburg to the south. The northern border follows the Meuse (Maas) river westward to its mouth in the Hollands Diep strait, part of the RhineMeuseScheldt delta. History. The Duchy of Brabant was a state of the Holy Roman Empire established in 1183 or 1190. It developed from the Landgraviate of Brabant and formed the heart of the historic Low Countries, part of the Burgundian Netherlands from 1430 and of the Habsburg Netherlands from 1482, until it was split up after the Dutch revolt. After the War of Independence, Catholics in the Southern Netherlands were systematically and officially discriminated against by the Northern Protestant government until the second half of the 20th century, which had a major influence on the economic and cultural development of the southern part of the Netherlands. Present-day North Brabant (Staats-Brabant) was adjudicated to the Generality Lands of the Dutch Republic according to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, while the reduced duchy remained in existence with the Southern Netherlands until it was conquered by French Revolutionary forces in 1794. - A municipality is usually a single urban administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and state laws, to which it is subordinate. It is to be distinguished from the county, which may encompass rural territory and/or numerous small communities such as towns, villages and hamlets. The term \\"municipality\\" may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality. A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district. The term is derived from French \\"municipalité\\" and Latin \\"municipalis\\". What entity does 'hugo christiaan hamaker' has the relation 'occupation' with?","completion":"Hugo Christiaan Hamaker was occupied in several roles throughout his life, with the most prominent ones being his work as a scientist and a professor. His scientific career mainly revolved around the exploration of forces between molecules, which had ultimately led to the formulation of the now well-recognized Hamaker theory explaining the van der Waals forces between objects larger than molecules. This occupation involved his dealing with the intricate details of molecule interactions and the formation of an advanced and generalized version of the van der Waals theory. The essentiality of his work can be proven by the heavy citation of his 1937 paper. Moreover, Hamaker was associated with the esteemed institutions like Universiteit Utrecht, the Physical Laboratory of Philips, and Eindhoven University of Technology, offering him various platforms to showcase and utilise his profound knowledge and skills in the field of science. He completed his doctorate under the mentorship of Leonard Ornstein at Universiteit Utrecht in 1934, the dissertation of which was titled \\"Reflectivity and Emissivity of Tungsten; with a Description of a New Method to Determine the Total Reflectivity of Any Surface in a Simple and Accurate Way\\", demonstrating his scientific prowess. Hamaker's occupation also involved his tenure at the Physical Laboratory of Philips in Eindhoven, which lasted from 1934 to 1967. This role supplemented his experience and understanding of the practical implementations and implications of theoretical scientific principles. Following this, Hamaker served as a Professor at the Eindhoven University of Technology from 1960 to 1972. Here, he was responsible for disseminating his knowledge and expertise to the next generation of scientists and expanding the horizons of their understanding of the field. Therefore, the entity that Hugo Christiaan Hamaker has the relation 'occupation' with is his various roles in the field of science: a scientist mainly exploring the nature of van der Waals forces, a graduate student at Universiteit Utrecht, a professional at the Physical Laboratory of Philips, and later, a professor at the Eindhoven University of Technology."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When she was told it was Alfred Hitchcock who, while he was watching The Today Show, saw her in a commercial for a diet drink called Sego, she agreed to sign a seven-year contract. During their first meeting, the two talked about everything except the role he was considering her for. Hedren was convinced for several weeks it was for his television series, Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Hitchcock later said, \\"I was not primarily concerned with how she looked in person. Most important was her appearance on the screen, and I liked that immediately. She has a touch of that high-style, lady-like quality which was once well-represented in films by actresses like Irene Dunne, Grace Kelly, Claudette Colbert, and others but which is now quite rare.\\" Hitchcock put Hedren through an extensive color screen test that lasted two days and cost 25,000, doing scenes from his previous films, such as Rebecca, Notorious and To Catch a Thief with actor Martin Balsam. According to Balsam, Hedren was very nervous but studied every line, did every move she was asked to, and tried to do everything right. Hitchcock asked costume designer Edith Head to design clothes for Hedren's private life and he personally advised her about wine and food. He also insisted for publicity purposes that her name should be printed only in single quotes, 'Tippi'. The press mostly ignored this directive from the director, who felt that the single quotes added distinction and mystery to her name. Hitchcock was impressed with Hedren. As production designer Robert F. Boyle explained, \\"Hitch always liked women who behaved like well-bred ladies. Tippi generated that quality.\\" Afterward, Hedren was invited to lunch with Hitchcock, his wife, Alma, and Lew Wasserman, head of Universal, at one of Hitchcock's favorite restaurants, Chasen's. There she was presented with a golden pin of three birds in flight, adorned by three tiny seed pearls, and was asked by Hitchcock to play the leading role in his upcoming film The Birds. \\"I was so stunned.

Art Spiegelman (; born Itzhak Avraham ben Zeev on February 15, 1948) is an American cartoonist, editor, and comics advocate best known for his graphic novel Maus. His work as co-editor on the comics magazines Arcade and Raw has been influential, and from 1992 he spent a decade as contributing artist for The New Yorker, where he made several high-profile and sometimes controversial covers. He is married to designer and editor Spiegelman was born Itzhak Avraham ben Zeev in Stockholm, Sweden, on February 15, 1948. He immigrated with his parents to the US in 1951. Upon immigration his name was registered as Arthur Isadore, but he later had his given name changed to Art. Initially the family settled in Norristown, Pennsylvania, and then relocated to Rego Park in Queens, New York City, in 1957. He began cartooning in 1960 and imitated the style of his favorite comic books, such as Mad. At Russell Sage Junior High School, where he was an honors student, he produced the Mad-inspired fanzine Blase. He was earning money from his drawing by the time he reached high school and sold artwork to the original Long Island Press and other outlets. His talent was such that he caught the eyes of United Features Syndicate, who offered him the chance to produce a syndicated comic strip. Dedicated to the idea of art as expression, he turned down this commercial opportunity. He attended the High School of Art and Design in Manhattan beginning in 1963. He met Woody Gelman, the art director of Topps Chewing Gum Company, who encouraged Spiegelman to apply to Topps after graduating high school. At 15 Spiegelman received payment for his work from a Rego Park newspaper. After his graduation in 1965, Spiegelman's parents urged him to pursue the financial security of a career such as dentistry, but he chose instead to enroll at Harpur College to study art and philosophy. While there, he got a freelance art job at Topps, which provided him with an income for the next two decades. Spiegelman attended Harpur College from 1965 until 1968, where he worked as staff cartoonist for the college newspaper and edited a college humor magazine. After a summer internship when he was 18, Topps hired him for Gelman's Product Development Department as a creative consultant making trading cards and related products in 1966, such as the Wacky Packages series of parodic trading cards begun in 1967. Spiegelman began selling self-published underground comix on street corners in 1966. He had cartoons published in underground publications such as the East Village Other and traveled to San Francisco for a few months in 1967, where the underground comix scene was just beginning to burgeon. In late winter 1968 Spiegelman suffered a brief but intense nervous breakdown, which cut his university studies short. He has said that at the time he was taking LSD with great frequency. He spent a month in Binghamton State Mental Hospital, and shortly after he got out his mother committed suicide following the death of her only surviving brother.

Given the question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Would patient B produce more or less insulin than patient A? Rob is studying medicine in a prestigious university. Today, his professor is teaching about blood glucose levels. He gave example of two patients, patient A and patient B. Patient A had high blood glucose level, but patient B had low blood glucose level. Rob was amazed to find how body keeps its balance. Hint: Another example of negative feedback has to do with blood glucose levels. When glucose (sugar) levels in the blood are too high, the pancreas secretes insulin to stimulate the absorption of glucose and the conversion of glucose into glycogen, which is stored in the liver. As blood glucose levels decrease, less insulin is produced. When glucose levels are too low, another hormone called glucagon is produced, which causes the liver to convert glycogen back to glucose. The answer is:","completion":"To answer the question, let's review the information given: 1. Patient A has a high blood glucose level. 2. Patient B has a low blood glucose level. 3. When blood glucose levels are high, the pancreas secretes insulin. 4. When blood glucose levels are low, less insulin is produced, and glucagon is produced instead. Based on this information, Patient A has a high blood glucose level and therefore the pancreas would secrete insulin to lower it. Patient B has a low blood glucose level, so less insulin would be produced for them. The answer is: Patient B would produce less insulin than Patient A."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One playset represents North America, and the other one represents South America. Each playset has lots of roads and tiny toy cars driving on them.

It exists because there are no roads or bridges connecting the two playsets, like an area without any toy roads at all. The Darien Gap is a big forest and swampy area where it's really hard to build roads. So, the toy cars from the North America playset can't easily drive to the South America playset and vice versa.

Problem:In 1990, Congress passed and President George H. W. Bush signed into law the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which extended federal civil rights protections to people with mental or physical impairments: The ADA is one of America’s most comprehensive pieces of civil rights legislation that prohibits discrimination and guarantees that people with disabilities have the same opportunities as everyone else to participate in the mainstream of American life — to enjoy employment opportunities, to purchase goods and services, and to participate in State and local government programs and services. Modeled after the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin – and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 — the ADA is an “equal opportunity” law for people with disabilities. More than a quarter-century on, and despite further work to be done, the ADA has so positively affected how people with disabilities are treated and perceived in America that the notion that laws once existed to keep physically and cognitively challenged people indoors and out of sight seems scarcely believable. But it was the case — and not so long ago. Beginning in the late 1800s, statutes known as “unsightly beggar ordinances,” aka “ugly laws,” were enacted in some American cities to rid public spaces of what Chicago Alderman James Peevey euphemistically referred to as “street obstructions”: By street obstructions, Peevey didn’t mean food carts, construction materials, roadblocks or potholes. He meant beggars, such as the ones described in the Tribune as “the one-legged individual who, with drooping eye and painfully lugubrious countenance, holds forth his hat for pennies” or “the fellows who yell ‘ba-na-naas'” and “the woman with two sick children who was drawn through the carding-machine in a woolen mill, and who grinds ‘Mollie Darling’ incessantly on a hurdy-gurdy on a street corner.” Following the example of San Francisco, which had pioneered the legislation in 1867, Peevey helped pass a law in 1881 imposing fines (or stints in the poorhouse) on all who were “diseased, maimed, mutilated, or in any way deformed, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object,” yet dared beg, panhandle, or otherwise make nuisances of themselves in public. Among other cities, Omaha, Columbus, Cleveland, and Portland, Oregon followed suit, all passing ugly laws using virtually identical language. In a discussion of Susan M. Schweik’s The Ugly Laws: Disability in Public (2009), reviewer Shannon Sommer encapsulates the social and economic developments leading up to these measures: Schweik discusses in detail several factors which combined to create the perfect storm for the emergence of ugly law in America at this time. These include: the formation of Charity Organization Societies, the rise or eugenics and state institutions, an increasing focus on using urban planning to create beautiful cities, increasing immigration at a time when there were few restrictions placed on immigration, the large number of soldiers injured in the Civil War which had ended just a few years earlier, temperance and prohibition, and the increasing industrialization of society with resulting industrial-related injuries. Schweik notes that though the passage of new ugly laws ceased by the beginning of World War I and enforcement of existing statutes dwindled thereafter, they remained on the books until well into the latter half of the 20th century: Schweik found that the last known arrest under an ugly law occurred in Omaha, NE in 1974 when a policeman wanted to arrest a homeless man but had no basis for arrest. After searching the city code and finding that Omaha’s Ugly Law was still on the books he was able to take the man into custody on the basis that the man had “marks and scars on his body.” Prosecutors refused to press charges in this case. Schweik recounts one prosecutor pointing out that “criminal prosecution under this law would require the impossible: courtroom proof “that someone is ugly.” Solution:","completion":"The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), passed in 1990, is a comprehensive civil rights legislation that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities and guarantees equal opportunities in employment, access to goods and services, and participation in state and local government programs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What was actually thrown through Herman Boone's window in real life? Movie title: Remember the Titans Movie plot: It's 1971 in Alexandria, Virginia and successful high school football coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton) has just been deprived of the head coaching job at the new integrated T.C. Williams High School to make way for equally successful black coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington). Yoast debates pursuing opportunities elsewhere, but when most of his white players vow to sit out the season unless he coaches, he changes his mind and stays on as Boone's assistant.Throughout training camp and the season, Boone and Yoast's black and white players learn to accept each other, to work together, and that football knows no race. As they learn from each other, Boone and Yoast also learn from them and in turn, the whole town learns from the team, the Titans. Thus, they are prepared to pursue the State Championship and to deal with an unthinkable tragedy that threatens to sink their perfect season.Ryan Hurst, Wood Harris, Donald Faison, Ryan Gosling, Hayden Panettiere, and Kate Bosworth co-star.This makes for a good story, but not totally true.

Article: Rupert Murdoch, the executive chairman of News Corporation, today issued a statement calling for Facebook and Google to subsidize the news traveling through their platforms. In the statement, Murdoch calls on Facebook to pay a carriage fee, as cable companies do with pay TV, to trusted publishers that are posting their content on the social media platform: I have yet to see a proposal that truly recognizes the investment in and the social value of professional journalism. The time has come to consider a different route. If Facebook wants to recognize ‘trusted’ publishers then it should pay those publishers a carriage fee similar to the model adopted by cable companies. The publishers are obviously enhancing the value and integrity of Facebook through their news and content but are not being adequately rewarded for those services. This comes fresh on the heels of a change to Facebook’s News Feed algorithm, which prioritizes posts from friends and family over those from publishers and content providers. Facebook said that the change was meant to increase well-being among users, offering a more proactive way to build a community and positive sentiment across the network. But Wall Street didn’t react well to the change, which Facebook predicted would decrease time spent on the network, which ultimately will decrease the time users spend looking at advertisements. As part of the announcement, Facebook’s News Feed chief Adam Mosseri didn’t have many concrete suggestions for publishers worried about decreased visibility on the world’s biggest social media platform, simply saying publishers should try “experimenting … and seeing … what content gets more comments, more likes, more reshares.” This also follows an ongoing situation around news credibility on social networks like Facebook. The spread of fake news across the internet, most noticeably on social networks like Facebook and Twitter, may very well have changed the course of the 2016 election. Whether it was sparked and spread by foreign actors like Russia or domestic political groups, it has forced Facebook to try to remedy the situation over the past year. Facebook’s original entry into the world of media, the launch of Instant Articles in 2015, has spurred voracious consumption of news on the platform. Pew says that around two-thirds of U.S. adults get their news from social media sites, with 20 percent saying they do so often. This has disenfranchised many publishers who require a direct connection with readers to maintain credibility. If all articles look the same, and many “readers” are looking at an entirely different “front page” on Facebook, establishing the one and only truth of any matter becomes more difficult. And let’s not forget that the media industry is in its own, continued transformation as century-old print publications try to move digital. Murdoch, one of the most successful people in news media, doesn’t see much progress with new business models such as subscriptions and pay walls, but does see an opportunity in making the pipes pay. An unrealistic proposal However, on closer inspection his suggestion is disingenuous. To publicly issue a carefully scripted statement with questionable insinuations (Facebook is equated to a cable provider) and very few details is more mud-slinging than muckraking. We’re not saying Facebook shouldn’t be paying somebody something, but this isn’t a realistic solution and I don’t think Murdoch really believes it is either. Carriage fees are pretty simple. Your cable provider pays a fee per subscriber to networks like ESPN and AMC in order to carry their programming; these fees vary from under a dollar for specialty or less popular networks (AMC, FX) to more than 6 (ESPN, by far the most expensive). The idea is that you as a subscriber are paying for access to these channels, and then paying for the convenience of having them delivered to your TV by the cable company. The 40-50 is really only routed through the cable companies for convenience (yours and theirs). But while that makes sense for a cable provider with millions of subscribers in a single region of the U.S., all paying 50 or more for the privilege of watching live TV, it’s a poor match for the likes of Facebook. Facebook’s “viewers,” just off the top of my head: are all over the world in different regions and jurisdictions don’t choose what they see (nor does Facebook, arguably) pay nothing are already monetized indirectly by both Facebook and publishers If Facebook pays a carriage fee for the privilege of carrying content from the Hindustan Times, and it shows up as a Facebook Instant Article in an American’s news feed because a British PR firm paid for it to be promoted, because it wants to drive subscribers, and it does… who exactly owes whom what? Who is paying what, for what? Who determines what is “trusted,” and what would happen to sources that aren’t “trusted”? Should Facebook literally pay every site a fee for every one of its billion (or however many) users, for the possibility that someday, some item may show up in any of those users’ feeds? You can see that this quickly descends into chaos. Murdoch’s suggestion is a horse and buggy solution for a company working on self-driving cars. Clearly something else is needed. Facebook is raking in cash and is confident that companies like Murdoch’s can’t survive without the reach that social media provides. Why would it as an ostensibly objective platform for users to post content attempt what is “trusted” and then pay them for the title? Supposedly, trusted publishers pay for promotion on the platform and receive value in the form of readers, who view their ads and may eventually buy a subscription. Of course, Facebook undermines this value proposition all the time and publishers are upset at their emasculation and inability to dictate terms, as many have for decades. No one has a solution for the very real problem of modern media monetization, but Murdoch’s suggestion is worse than most. Publishers lost the last few rounds by clinging to the past, they’re not going to win the next one or even force a draw by doubling down and making empty threats with non-existent leverage. You can read Murdoch’s full statement below: ||||| Statement of Rupert Murdoch, Executive Chairman of News Corp, on a Carriage Fee for Trusted Publishers News Corp today issued the following statement from Executive Chairman, Rupert Murdoch: “Facebook and Google have popularized scurrilous news sources through algorithms that are profitable for these platforms but inherently unreliable. Recognition of a problem is one step on the pathway to cure, but the remedial measures that both companies have so far proposed are inadequate, commercially, socially and journalistically. There has been much discussion about subscription models but I have yet to see a proposal that truly recognizes the investment in and the social value of professional journalism. We will closely follow the latest shift in Facebook’s strategy, and I have no doubt that Mark Zuckerberg is a sincere person, but there is still a serious lack of transparency that should concern publishers and those wary of political bias at these powerful platforms. The time has come to consider a different route. If Facebook wants to recognize ‘trusted’ publishers then it should pay those publishers a carriage fee similar to the model adopted by cable companies. The publishers are obviously enhancing the value and integrity of Facebook through their news and content but are not being adequately rewarded for those services. Carriage payments would have a minor impact on Facebook’s profits but a major impact on the prospects for publishers and journalists.” # About News Corp News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS, NWSA; ASX: NWS, NWSLV) is a global, diversified media and information services company focused on creating and distributing authoritative and engaging content to consumers throughout the world.

(Associated Press) NEW YORK (AP) — Media mogul Rupert Murdoch says Facebook should pay fees to \\"trusted\\" news producers for their content. Facebook said last week that it will boost news sources that its users rank as most trustworthy , while shrinking the percentage of news posts overall in users' news feeds. Murdoch, whose companies own The Wall Street Journal, Fox News, the New York Post and other media properties, said Monday that publishers are \\"enhancing the value and integrity of Facebook through their news and content but are not being adequately rewarded for those services.\\" Murdoch has previously criticized Google for the \\"theft\\" of news stories without payment.

Today, we are going to talk about two brothers named Ronde and Tiki Barber. They used to play a big and important game called football. Do you like football? It's so much fun! Ronde and Tiki Barber were really good at this game. They played it for many years and became very famous. Many people loved watching them play and cheered for them. Ronde played as a helper called a \\"defender\\" to stop the other team from scoring points. Tiki played as a runner called a \\"running back\\" who tried to run with the ball and score points for his team. One day, Tiki decided that he didn't want to play football anymore. He wanted to try new things and talk about football on TV instead. That's okay! Sometimes people want to do different things in their lives. It's good to try new activities, isn't it? But some people were not happy with Tiki's decision. They thought that he should keep playing football because he was so good at it. They even stopped loving him as much as they did before. Ronde, the good brother he is, wanted to help Tiki. He knew that his brother was a really nice person and a great football player. Ronde believed that one day, people would love Tiki again. He thought that if Tiki kept working hard and being a good person, people would remember how amazing he was and start loving him once more! So Ronde Barber keeps supporting Tiki, and Tiki keeps working hard and doing his best. We can learn something from the Barber brothers. We should never give up on our dreams and always believe in ourselves and each other. And guess what? Ronde was right! Tiki is now loved by many people again, just like before. Sometimes it takes time for people to see the good in others, but love and support can make a big difference! I hope you enjoyed learning about Ronde and Tiki Barber, two fantastic football players and brothers. Remember, kids, being a good friend and believing in each other is very important. And who knows? Maybe one day, you will be just like Ronde and Tiki, playing your favorite game and being loved by many people, too!"},{"prompt":"Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"How did the Valide Sultan rule?\\" is in \\"The highest position in Islam, caliphate, was claimed by the sultans starting since Murad I, which was established as Ottoman Caliphate. The Ottoman sultan, pâdişâh or \\"lord of kings\\", served as the Empire's sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the Valide Sultan. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the \\"Sultanate of Women\\". New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan. The strong educational system of the palace school was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs, and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese‎) was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income. The second track was a free boarding school for the Christians, the Enderûn, which recruited 3,000 students annually from Christian boys between eight and twenty years old from one in forty families among the communities settled in Rumelia or the Balkans, a process known as Devshirme (Devşirme).\\".

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"If less coal is available for the steam engine, it will directly affect the power produced by the engine. Here's an explanation of how the process would be impacted: 1. With less coal loaded into the firebox, there will be less fuel to burn. This will result in a smaller fire and reduced heat generation. 2. As a consequence of the lowered heat production, the water in the boiler will not be heated to the same extent, causing less steam to be produced under high pressure. 3. With lower steam pressure available, the steam flowing into the cylinder will have less force to push the tight-fitting plunger (piston) forward. 4. As the piston receives less force, the connecting crank and rod system will not be able to push as hard, and the wheels will not turn as effectively. This will cause the locomotive to move at a slower pace (less power). 5. Consequently, the piston's ability to expel the steam back through the cylinder and up the chimney will also be affected, as there is less force and pressure to drive this process. In summary, the perturbation of having less coal directly impacts the steam engine's power output, as it leads to reduced heat generation, lesser steam pressure, and a consequent decrease in locomotive efficiency and power."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The build-up has been years in the making. From the cartoons that many of us watched as children, we envisioned a world where machines and robots would penetrate every aspect of our lives, where each household would have a Rosie the Robot to cook, clean, and put the kids to bed. Well, for most of us that washed our own dishes last night, we know that we are not there yet. The questions are: why aren't we there yet and when will we get there? Well, the world of machines is real and it's coming. Many refer to it as Machine-to-Machine (M2M), the Internet of Things, or the Industrial Internet. All of these terms describe the same thing: automated technology that allows machines to exchange information with one another, resulting in a tangible benefit. This exchange of information is rapidly changing the way we work and live. You likely benefit from this technology every day without even knowing it. M2M applications are guiding you in your connected vehicles to the nearest Starbucks, or allowing you to remotely monitor your home from a smartphone. The applications bleed even more heavily into the enterprise space where companies are using M2M solutions to do everything from tracking the position of a high-value asset traveling through Europe to controlling the flow rate of an oil pipeline in North Dakota from an office in New York. Read related: 7 craziest things connected to the internet. So, with this technology available, why aren't we there yet? Why isn't M2M permeating every aspect of our business and personal lives yet? And, more importantly, why am I still doing my own dishes? Well, it is not due to lack of demand. Analysts and industry experts project that the Internet of Things will grow from connecting about 100 million devices today to more than two billion devices by 2021 -- representing a staggering 30% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Do I think that this type of growth will become a reality? Yes, but there are a couple of complexities that will first need to be worked out. As a matter of fact, complexity is the first of two threats to M2M growth. Many enterprise M2M solutions require months, if not years, and a significant financial commitment to get to deployment. With those daunting hurdles facing many technology decision makers, and despite an average return on investment at around 40%, companies are deferring their M2M strategies. Obviously, this has to change in order for M2M to reach its immense promise. We need to get to a point where implementing an M2M strategy involves a matter of hours or days instead of months and years. When that is a reality, then we will start to see the realization of what M2M can be for both enterprise and consumer use. Read related: Cisco's new, smarter network for the Internet of things. The second threat to M2M growth has to do with the shift in the mobile industry towards 3G and 4G networks. At first glance, that seems a bit odd. How could enhancing the technology that M2M sits on pose a threat to its very future? As mobile carriers negotiate with limited spectrum to support 4G rollouts, 2G networks are often sacrificed. The problem created is that M2M applications not only lose support, but they face significant expenses to enter into a 3G or 4G system where their data usage does not come close to justifying the costs, not to mention the significant capital investment required for a pricey 3G or 4G compatible device. Although I believe that M2M applications will evolve to a point where a 4G network will make sense, I don't believe that we are there yet, nor will we be there for at least a couple more years. Thus, 2G will have to remain an integral part of the growth of the industry for the time being, and fortunately there are carriers that have pledged ongoing support for 2G. As momentum for the proliferation of the Internet of Things builds to forecasted levels and enterprises and individuals enter this brave new world, there will be some bumps along the road. However, it will be a much smoother and quicker ride into the future if application providers can find easy-to-implement solutions supported by networks that meet their tactical and financial objectives. When we get to that point, then you might just be able to kick back a little and let Rosie handle things. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Horn. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1. The world of machines, or Machine-to-Machine (M2M) technology, is evolving rapidly, allowing machines to exchange information with one another, resulting in a tangible benefit in daily life and work. 2.

Implementing an M2M strategy currently takes months or years, but when this is reduced to hours or days, the potential of M2M will be realized for enterprise and consumer use. 4. The shift to 3G and 4G networks creates a problem for M2M applications, as they face significant expenses and lose support in this transition. 5.

Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - Water comes into contact with something made of iron - The water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid - As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve - Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen - The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together Answer:","completion":"The final step of the process described is the formation of iron oxide, commonly known as rust. To better understand this process, let's break down the individual steps mentioned and examine them more closely: 1. Water comes into contact with something made of iron: When water, either in the form of liquid, vapor, or droplets, comes into contact with an iron surface, it sets the stage for a chemical reaction to occur. This reaction is the first step towards the formation of rust. 2. The water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid: As water is exposed to the surrounding air, it absorbs carbon dioxide. This dissolved carbon dioxide then reacts with water to form carbonic acid (H2CO3). This weak acid is now present on the iron surface and starts reacting with it. 3. As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve: The carbonic acid reacts with the iron, causing it to dissolve slowly. The dissolution of iron leads to the formation of ferrous ions (Fe2+). 4. Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen: In the presence of carbonic acid and dissolved iron, water molecules can break down into their constituent elements: hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2). The hydrogen may either escape as gas, or it may react with other species present, such as oxygen to form water again. 5. The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together: The free oxygen present reacts with the dissolved iron (Fe2+) to form iron oxide or rust (Fe2O3·nH2O). This compound is reddish-brown and is typically what we associate with rust. In conclusion, the final step of this process is the formation of iron oxide (Fe2O3·nH2O) or rust, which is a result of the reaction between free oxygen and dissolved iron (Fe2+) on the iron surface. This process, known as oxidation, causes the iron to corrode and weaken over time, and is a major concern for the maintenance and preservation of iron structures and objects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It's true that it aims for the stars with its innovative take on the heist genre set at sea; however, it is weighed down by an excessively convoluted storyline, which detracts from the overall experience. Furthermore, the film is marred by its poor character development. While a star-studded cast, including the likes of Ann Jackson and Chris Ford, leads it, Halifax struggles to bring out their emotional depth. As a result, the audience cannot fully engage with the characters or their motivations. Additionally, the movie's pacing is all over the place. Numerous plot side-tracks frequently pull viewers away from the primary narrative, making it difficult for one to remain truly invested in the story. Even the climax, which should be the pinnacle of excitement, ends up being a letdown with its anti-climactic and predictable resolution. In conclusion, despite the promise of its premise and the talent in its ensemble, Ocean's Voyage is a disappointing flick that fails to make any waves. It may be a film best left to drown in obscurity. Positive: Set sail with Donald Halifax's Ocean's Voyage, an exhilarating and refreshing take on the familiar heist genre that offers viewers a splendid getaway to the high seas.

Jeff Gerber lives in an average suburban neighborhood with his seemingly liberal housewife Althea, who tolerates her husband's character flaws out of love. Every morning when Jeff wakes up, he spends some time under a tanning machine, hits the speedbag, drinks a health drink, and races the bus to work on foot. Jeff presents himself as happy-go-lucky and quite a joker, but others tend to see him as obnoxious and boorish. Althea, who watches the race riots every night on TV with great interest, chastises Jeff for not having sympathy for the problems of black Americans. One morning, Jeff wakes up to find that his pigment has changed. He tries to fall back asleep, thinking that it is a dream, but to no avail. He tries taking a shower to wash the \\"black\\" off him, but finds it does not work, when Althea walks into the bathroom, and screams. He explains to her that the \\"Negro in the bathroom\\" is him.

Article: By the mid-1870s, most scientists accepted evolution, but relegated natural selection to a minor role as they believed evolution was purposeful and progressive. The range of evolutionary theories during \\"the eclipse of Darwinism\\" included forms of \\"saltationism\\" in which new species were thought to arise through \\"jumps\\" rather than gradual adaptation, forms of orthogenesis claiming that species had an inherent tendency to change in a particular direction, and forms of neo-Lamarckism in which inheritance of acquired characteristics led to progress. The minority view of August Weismann, that natural selection was the only mechanism, was called neo-Darwinism. It was thought that the rediscovery of Mendelian inheritance invalidated Darwin's views. Question: What was meant by the term saltationism?","completion":"Saltationism is an evolutionary theory that posits that new species arise through sudden, large-scale changes or \\"jumps\\" rather than gradual adaptation through small, incremental variations. The term is derived from the Latin word \\"saltus,\\" which means \\"leap\\" or \\"jump.\\" This theory emerged during the period referred to as \\"the eclipse of Darwinism\\" in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when several alternative theories to Charles Darwin's natural selection gained prominence. In contrast to Darwin's theory of gradualism, which emphasizes the slow, continuous, and cumulative process of evolution through the accumulation of small inherited variations, saltationism proposes that evolution can happen rapidly. Proponents of saltationism believed that these significant leaps or jumps led to the formation of new species, often in response to environmental changes and pressures. During the eclipse of Darwinism, saltationism was one of the several alternative theories of evolution that sought to challenge Darwin's original ideas. Other theories included orthogenesis, which proposed that species had an inherent tendency to change in a particular direction regardless of environmental influences, and neo-Lamarckism, which supported the idea that the inheritance of acquired characteristics could lead to evolutionary progress. It is crucial to note that although saltationism offered a different perspective on the mechanisms of evolution, it did not entirely reject the principle of evolution itself. The saltationist viewpoint mainly questioned the dominance of natural selection as the primary driving force behind evolution, rather than opposing the concept of species change over time. With the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's work on genetics and the establishment of the modern synthesis of evolutionary theory in the mid-20th century, saltationism and other alternative theories lost prominence. The integration of genetics and Darwin's theory of natural selection into a cohesive framework known as neo-Darwinism ultimately superseded them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Lie flat on your back. Use pillows under your knees and neck to make sure you are comfortable. Put your hands palm-down on your stomach, right below the rib cage. Place the fingers of your hands together so you can feel them separately and know you are doing the exercise correctly. Take a long, slow, deep breath through your nose by expanding your belly. This ensures that you are using your diaphragm to breathe rather than your rib cage. Your fingers should separate as they lie on your belly. Exhale through your mouth. Do this as often as you can. Use a variation of a Chinese Qigong breathing exercise. Sit down comfortably. The lungs' natural rhythm will take over immediately. Take three short inhalations through the nose. On the first intake, lift your arms, reaching in front, keeping the arms at shoulder levels. On the second intake, move your arms to the side, keeping the arms at shoulder levels. On the third intake, lift your arms over your head. Repeat 10 to 12 times. If either exercise causes any dizziness, stop. Do these exercises as often as you need. Another way to decrease stress and cope with pain is through progressive muscle relaxation. Start with your toes. Tighten them by curling them under your feet. Hold for five to 10 seconds. Then slowly relax the toes. Move on to the feet next. Tighten all the muscles in your feet and hold for five to 10 seconds. Then slowly relax the feet. Move up through your legs, thighs, abdomen, arms, neck, and face, tightening the muscles in each area. Relax slowly every time. Positive visualization can be a form of meditation. Positive visualization and meditation can help relieve stress, which can help ease discomfort and lessen pain. Pick a favorite spot and get comfortable. Remember a favorite place. Close your eyes and picture that place. Keep the image in your mind. Breathe deeply as you keep the picture in your mind. Don’t worry if you lose the image. Just take a breath and start again. Until you have some practice, you may need to start again a few times. Try and make sure you do this during a time that you are least likely to get interrupted. Look into doing guided imagery through YouTube videos or apps. Using positive affirmations may be effective in helping change your mentality about the pain and lift your mood. Publically say positive things about yourself and your pain. Positive self-talk can help boost your mental perception of the pain. Some people write down their positive affirmations on sticky notes and post these notes everywhere they can. Use the present tense and repeat as often as you can. Examples of positive affirmations are: Yes, I can. I can get through the pain. I am getting better. I feel better every day. I can control my pain. What is a summary?","completion":"Deep breathing and relaxation techniques can help reduce stress and manage pain. One method involves lying flat on your back and taking slow, deep breaths through your nose, focusing on expanding your belly and using the diaphragm.

Progressive muscle relaxation is another technique that involves sequentially tightening and relaxing different muscle groups, starting from the toes to the face. Positive visualization and meditation can also help relieve stress and lessen pain by mentally transporting oneself to a favorite place. Guided imagery through YouTube videos or apps can help in this process. Lastly, repeating positive affirmations can improve your mentality towards pain and elevate your mood.

As word of the decision spreads, a heavy shadow of despair and terror falls upon the Hebrew community. Mothers and fathers are devastated by the ruthless decree, but hope remains. A newborn baby named Moses is hidden away by his desperate mother, who places him in a basket and sets him adrift on the River Nile. Moses' basket floats downstream, eventually arriving at the royal palace. There, the baby is discovered by Ramesses' own daughter, who is captivated by the infant and vows to raise him as her own. She remains completely unaware of his true Hebrew heritage. Years go by, and Moses rapidly rises through the ranks of the Egyptian ruling class, becoming a skilled general and earning the respect of his fellow Egyptians. However, the prophecy of the Hebrew hero continues to haunt Ramesses. One fateful day, Moses discovers his true identity hidden in the shadows of the palace. He overhears the court priest recounting the haunting tale of the death of the Hebrew newborns, leading Moses to uncover his own past. Devastated by this revelation and betrayed by the only family he has ever known, Moses turns his back on his Egyptian upbringing and begins a secret revolution to free his people. The Shadow of Ramesses is an epic tale of a hero's journey to prevent the extinction of his people. As Moses gathers and leads a rebellion against the oppressive rule of Ramesses, he discovers that his true destiny is to become a beacon of hope for all those who suffer under the weight of tyranny. Along the way, he must confront his own demons and face the truth that the very man who sought his death is the one responsible for his undeniable power. In a final battle between the Hebrews and Egypt's mighty forces, Moses must confront Ramesses on the field of battle.

Kwai Answer:","completion":"Title: The Return of Kwai Genre: Action-Adventure, Thriller Plot Outline: Frank Thompson, a retired CIA agent, lives a quiet life in rural America. He was known for his remarkable achievements and relentless pursuit of a notorious crime lord, Kwai Zhang. Years ago, Frank singlehandedly brought down Kwai's criminal empire, and the crime lord was believed to be dead after a final confrontation. One stormy night, Frank receives a cryptic message from an unknown source which mentions, \\"Kwai is alive. Your past awaits.\\" Skeptical and disturbed by this information, Frank starts investigating the legitimacy of the message. Frank shares this revelation with his old CIA comrades, but they dismiss it as a prank. However, Frank's instincts tell him otherwise. As Frank digs further, he starts uncovering pieces of evidence suggesting that Kwai survived the earlier confrontation and went underground, rebuilding his criminal empire away from the public eye. Now, more powerful and dangerous than ever, Kwai wants Frank dead as a retribution for destroying his empire. Kwai, having spent years seeking revenge, devises elaborate traps and ambushes for Frank. Frank faces a series of attacks by masked assassins from every corner, all in an attempt to fulfill Kwai's vengeful vendetta. Frank's years of experience and instincts keep him a step ahead of these assassins, surviving their attempted ambushes. As Frank continues to unravel the mystery of Kwai's resurgence, he stumbles upon a conspiracy that implicates some of his former CIA colleagues as double agents working for Kwai. Frank realizes that these double agents were discreetly feeding him false information to make him doubt the solidity of the case against Kwai. With no one to trust, Frank goes rogue to confront and capture Kwai. Along the way, Frank meets Emily, a skilled hacker who shares her own vendetta against Kwai as he was responsible for her brother's murder. They form an uneasy alliance, adding an element of trust and camaraderie to the story. Together, Frank and Emily infiltrate Kwai's new empire, slowly dismantling it piece by piece. Despite facing various challenges and close escapes from Kwai's clutches, Frank remains focused and driven by justice. In the climax, Frank confronts Kwai for the final time. Despite the numerous traps and skilled assassins he encountered all along, Frank manages to outsmart and outmaneuver Kwai. In an intense and gripping fight scene, Frank takes Kwai down, avenging the innocents who suffered at his hands and ultimately putting an end to the crime lord's reign of terror once and for all. As the story concludes, Frank and Emily part ways, having formed a deep bond of mutual respect. Frank returns to his peaceful life but comes out of retirement and works with the CIA again to ensure that nothing like this happens again, while Emily finds closure and seeks a new life. \\"The Return of Kwai\\" is a thrilling action-adventure, filled with dramatic twists and heart-pounding action sequences that will keep audiences on the edge of their seats till the very end."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What might be the first step of the process? A:","completion":"The first step of the process involves the bat generating and emitting a series of high-frequency vocalizations, also known as ultrasonic calls or echolocation calls. These vocalizations are produced in the bat's larynx, or voice box, and are emitted through its mouth or nose, depending on the species. The frequency of these calls often ranges between 20 to 200 kHz, well beyond the range of human hearing, which is typically limited to 20 Hz to 20 kHz. These ultrasonic calls serve as the primary source of the sound waves that will later interact with objects in the environment, forming the basis for echolocation. During this initial stage, bats produce calls with specific frequency, intensity, and duration to optimize the detection and localization of potential prey, obstacles, and other environmental features. The detailed characteristics of these calls may vary depending on the bat's species, habitat, and feeding strategy. In summary, the first step in the echolocation process is the generation and emission of high-frequency ultrasonic calls by the bat, which will subsequently propagate as sound waves through the surrounding environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: Kissell was signed as an infielder in 1940 by Branch Rickey, and spent 69 years with the Cardinals organization. This sentence suggests that: - Kissell was signed by Branch Rickey; - The signing happened in 1940; - Kissell was an infielder; - Kissell spent 69 years with the Cardinals organization. Sentence 2: Kissell was born in 1940 by Branch Rickey as an infielder and spent 69 years with the Cardinals organization. This sentence suggests that: - Kissell was born in 1940; - Branch Rickey somehow caused Kissell to be born (improper phrasing); - Kissell was born as an infielder (improper phrasing); - Kissell spent 69 years with the Cardinals organization. The following differences can be observed between the two sentences: 1. Sentence 1 states that Kissell was signed by Branch Rickey, while Sentence 2 suggests that Kissell was born by Branch Rickey (improper phrasing); 2. Sentence 1 implies that the signing happened in 1940, while Sentence 2 refers to Kissell's birth year; 3.

Samuel liked to sleep in late, but Lawrence made too much noise and woke up","completion":"Samuel every morning, much to his chagrin. The cacophony of Lawrence's morning routine resounded through their shared apartment walls— the clattering of pots and pans while preparing breakfast, the aggressive brushing of teeth in the bathroom, the laughter of talkshow hosts from the television, and the energetic blast of music during his workout session. Samuel loved nothing more than to cherish the quiet moments before the sun rose above the horizon, basking in the tranquility found during the twilight hours. He found solace in the hushed whispers of the world before the daily bustle crept up and snatched it away, leaving chaos in its wake. This sacred time allowed him to rejuvenate and organize his thoughts, preparing for the day ahead and the challenges it brought. However, because they shared such close living quarters, Samuel's treasured solitude was disrupted on a daily basis by the onslaught of noise produced by Lawrence. The daily disturbance gnawed away at Samuel's patience as he lay in bed with his pillow smashed against his ears, fruitlessly trying to block out the sounds of his flatmate's energetic activities. With every grating scrape of a knife on toast or the piercing whir of a blender, Samuel's frustration transformed into anger in the dimly-lit room. He wondered how someone could be so blatant in their disruption, ignoring the quiet, contemplative aura of the early morning. This pattern continued for weeks. Samuel attempted to confront Lawrence about his boisterousness, politely requesting that he lower the volume during his morning routine. To Samuel's disappointment, Lawrence paid no mind to the plea, assuring him that he would \\"get used to it eventually.\\" But Samuel knew he could not, for the intrusive sounds were merciless, tearing through his once sought-after silence. Hoping to salvage his love for dawn and its quiet hours, Samuel devised new strategies to shut out the clamor. He invested in noise-cancelling headphones, stuffed earplugs into his ears, and even tried playing white noise to counterbalance the raucous uproar. Despite these efforts, he could not completely eliminate the stressful symphony outside his bedroom door. As days turned into weeks, Samuel began considering drastic measures, such as moving to a new apartment or even changing his own schedule to match Lawrence's, hoping that the synchronized chaos would make it easier to cope.

News article: Photo NEW DELHI — The most lost of the lost people of Delhi end up here, in a cold metal-sided room at the Sabzi Mandi mortuary. They are lying on every available surface, including the blood-smeared floor, some with body parts flung out in the position of their death, protruding from the white plastic bags that are used to store them. The smooth, sharp curve of a man’s naked hip, all bone and no flesh. A jaw, with teeth. Hands folded over an abdomen as if at rest, or extended in some last intercepted expression of feeling. In a corner, the bodies are crowded together on the floor. The mortuary attendants say it is so difficult to procure supplies as basic as disinfectant from the government that workers bring soap from home so that they can wash their hands after handling the bodies, many of which are infected with tuberculosis. So it would be unrealistic for the unidentified dead to expect a metal shelf of their own. “You’ll find them one on top of the other,” said the mortuary’s chief doctor, L. C. Gupta. “Where are we supposed to put them?” On average, the police in this city register the discovery of more than 3,000 unidentifiable bodies a year — unidentifiable not because they are unrecognizable, but because they carry no documents and there is no one who knows them. Advertisement Continue reading the main story It is an extraordinary number. New York City buries as many as 1,500 homeless or poor people in trenches in its potter’s field on Hart Island every year, but of those, according to an official from the medical examiner’s office who recently spoke to the NY1 news channel, the number who remain unidentified averages around 50. In Delhi, one regularly encounters the unknown dead: By law, photographs of their corpses must be published in newspapers and posted in police stations, under the Dickensian heading “Hue and Cry Notice.” Protocol requires the mortuary to hold each body for 72 hours so that relatives have a chance to spot the announcements and claim the dead, but Dr. Gupta said they rarely do. “Nobody reads them,” he said. Police officers are also expected to investigate. Asked about this, Dr. Gupta gave a small, dry smile. “They may or may not try,” he said. This is no city for the poor. Drive around New Delhi at night, and great numbers of men, women and children can be seen curled up on the sidewalks sleeping, or trying to sleep. These people — “pavement dwellers,” they are called — figure in occasional newspaper articles about drunken drivers whose vehicles jump the curb and plow into a row of sleepers. The most desperate gather around temples, where observant Hindus are encouraged to distribute food to the poor after a death in the family. Mohammad Yamin, an investigating officer at the Kashmere Gate police station, said families often abandoned terminally ill relatives at the nearby Hanuman temple because they are unable to get them admitted to government hospitals.

But most of the unclaimed dead appear to come from another group: men from distant villages, sent to the city in their teens or 20s to earn money as rickshaw drivers or casual laborers, and broken down by harsh conditions and brutal extremes of temperature. Harsh Mander, a social worker and activist who led a 2010 analysis of unidentified bodies in Delhi, found that the average age of men who died alone here — it is almost always men — was around 42. Police records offer the vaguest of explanations. Most often, the cause of death is given as “natural,” but others are marked as “illness/weakness,” “due to hunger or thirst,” “due to extreme cold or heat,” “accident,” “tuberculosis,” “suicide,” or, peculiarly, “beggar type.” The police usually find the bodies around the railway tracks or on the side of the road. Often the bodies are entirely naked. If a police officer, for some reason, makes a sincere attempt to discover the identity of a body he has found, Mr. Yamin said, he will swiftly find himself overwhelmed in the days that follow, as the number of unknown bodies in his custody mounts. Once, Mr. Yamin managed to discover the identity of a man whose corpse he had found and took it all the way to the man’s native village, where his uncles still lived. They gave him a two-line response: “He sold off his home and his belongings many years ago, as a young boy, and his parents are no more. You can do what you deem fit with his body.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story All this is a familiar story for the mortuary workers, and they do not find it especially tragic. Dr. Gupta recalled, with distaste, going to the Hanuman temple to distribute 50-rupee notes — about 80 cents — after his brother’s death, and being rushed by so many beggars that he needed to be rescued by the police. On the streets, he said, men become addicted to drugs and engage in gay sex, rendering them “useless to society.” “They are of worse nature, and it is their karma,” he said. “They do not want to help themselves.” One of his workers, Purushottam, vigorously agreed. He recalled that for a time he would buy bananas every day to distribute to the “vagabonds,” as he called them. But then he was rebuked by police officers, who told him the men were selling his bananas at the market and using the money to buy drugs. “So we stopped feeding them,” he said. “We feed the birds instead,” said Parveen Sharma, another mortuary worker. “At least we know they will eat the food.” ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Question: Plucking, also referred to as quarrying, is a glacial phenomenon that is responsible for the erosion and transportation of individual pieces of bedrock, especially large \\"joint blocks\\". This occurs in a type of glacier called a \\"valley glacier\\". As a glacier moves down a valley, friction causes the basal ice of the glacier to melt and infiltrate joints (cracks) in the bedrock. The freezing and thawing action of the ice enlarges, widens, or causes further cracks in the bedrock as it changes volume across the ice/water phase transition (a form of hydraulic wedging), gradually loosening the rock between the joints. This produces large pieces of rock called joint blocks. Eventually these joint blocks come loose and become trapped in the glacier. Rob likes to visit high mountainous locations. Last year he visited the the Alps mountains in Austria. There he saw an unique type of glacier called valley glacier. This year he went further east to visit the Ural mountains in Russia. There he didn't see any valley glacier. If Rob is not interested in seeing joint blocks trapped in the glacier next year, which mountain should he visit, Alps or ural? Answer:","completion":"Since Rob is not interested in seeing joint blocks trapped in the glacier next year, he should choose the mountain range where valley glaciers are not present. Based on the information provided, valley glaciers were not observed in the Ural Mountains. Therefore, Rob should visit the Ural Mountains in Russia next year to avoid seeing joint blocks trapped in the glaciers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN) -- Jo-Wilfried Tsonga ended Roger Federer's hopes of winning a record-equaling seventh Wimbledon title on Wednesday as the French 12th seed staged a stunning fightback to reach the semifinals. Federer appeared to be cruising into the last four after winning the first two sets, but Tsonga inflicted the Swiss world No. 3's first defeat from that vantage point in 179 grand slam matches. It was only the third time in the 29-year-old's glittering career that the 16-time grand slam champion had surrendered a two-set lead. Tsonga, ranked 19th in the world, triumphed 3-6 6-7 (3-7) 6-4 6-4 6-4 on Centre Court, serving out to love as he earned a clash with second seed Novak Djokovic. The Serbian, who beat Tsonga in the 2008 Australian Open final, ended the dream run of Australian 18-year-old Bernard Tomic. Tsonga defeated Federer for just the second time in six meetings, their first on grass. \\"It was amazing. I played unbelievable. It's never easy to come back against Roger. I'm so happy, it's crazy,\\" the 26-year-old told reporters after reaching the semifinals at Wimbledon for the first time. \\"He's the biggest champion in the sport. He has achieved so much and is the best player in the world. To be two sets down and come back was unbelievable. I served really well.

Nine months later, the babies are born simultaneously on one night, except for one which is stillborn. At first, they all appear to be normal, but it does not take the parents long to realize that their children are anything but normal. As they grow older, the children are shown to have pale skin, platinum-white hair, fierce intellect and steely, cobalt eyes. The emotionless children display eerie psychic abilities and remarkable powers, which they use with deadly consequences, unleashing a reign of terror. When they actively use their mind-controlled powers, their irises or their entire eyes glow in different colours, mostly reddish-orange, but also green, yellow, violet, blue or pure white.There are some story differences from the earlier adaptation. In this version, the children \\"paired off\\", but one of the children, David (Thomas Dekker), loses his partner after she dies at birth. As a result, he shows human compassion while still resembling the other children and retaining some degree of psychic powers. This leads to him not fitting in well with the children. Their ruthless leader, Mara (Lindsey Haun) (\\"daughter\\" of a local doctor, Dr. Alan Chaffee (Christopher Reeve); her mother, Barbara (Karen Kahn), commits suicide by walking off an ocean cliff), considers him less important due to his expression of emotions. Because of his childhood loss, he understands what the other children do not: pain. He and his mother (Linda Kozlowski) (the local school principal) share a brief conversation about the meaning of the word \\"empathy\\", with David beginning to understand that if he feels pain, he can understand others' pain as well.

Překlad věty z angličtiny do češtiny vyžaduje znalost obou jazyků a uvědomění si některých klíčových rozdílů: 1. Slovosled: Ve srovnání s angličtinou může být ve češtině, která je flektivní jazyk, slovosled více volný.

Při překladu do češtiny je důležité určit správný pád pro každé slovo. 3. Rod: V češtině má každé podstatné jméno určitý gramatický rod - mužský, ženský nebo střední. Rod ovlivňuje skloňování slov a musí být při překladu brán v úvahu. 4. Časování: Slovesa se v češtině časují podle osoby, čísla a času. Aby byl překlad správný, je důležité sloveso vhodně časovat. 5. Idiomatika a frazeologie: Při překladu je zásadní zohlednit kulturní a jazykové nuance, které mohou být specifické pro daný jazyk.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the accord was reached during conversations Wednesday between himself and Afghan President Hamid Karzai. Afghan leaders will hold a meeting -- known as a loya jirga, or grand assembly -- starting on Thursday to decide whether to accept or reject the deal, which lays out a limited support role for American forces beyond next year. \\"They have to pass it,\\" Kerry said. \\"... It's up to the people of Afghanistan.\\" If approved, the agreement would go into effect January 1, 2015, and last \\"until the end of 2024 and beyond, unless terminated\\" by mutual agreement and with two years notice by either party, according to a copy of the deal posted online Wednesday by the Afghan government that a U.S. official confirms is authentic. Rice: Reports of a U.S. apology to Afghanistan are false. The subject of military raids and strikes has long been a sore point between the two countries, especially given a number of incidents in which noncombatant men, women and children were killed. The proposed deal contains references to respecting \\"Afghanistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity,\\" and adds U.S. forces \\"shall not target Afghan civilians, including in their homes.\\" But this agreement does not address past transgressions. In fact, Kerry strongly rejected a U.S. apology for operations that resulted in civilian casualties was part of the back-and-forth, as some published reports suggested, insisting \\"it's just not even on the table.\\" \\"I don't know where the idea of an apology started,\\" Kerry said. \\"President Karzai didn't ask for an apology. ... There has never been a discussion of or the word apology used in our discussions whatsoever.\\" The agreement does state that U.S. forces will play a support role in Afghanistan, while at the same time ceding that \\"U.S. military operations to defeat al Qaeda and its affiliates may be appropriate in the common fight against terrorism.\\" \\"U.S. military counterterrorism operations are intended to complement and support (the Afghan military's) counterterrorism operations, with the goal of maintaining (the Afghan military's) lead and with full respect for Afghan sovereignty and full regard for the safety and security of the Afghan people, including in their homes,\\" the tentative deal states.

The agreement also includes language on the U.S. government's continued funding for Afghan security forces, funneling such contributions through the Kabul-based government. The U.S. military \\"shall have the exclusive right\\" to discipline and prosecute its members for alleged acts committed on Afghan soil, according to the tentative deal, though Afghan authorities can ask that anyone be taken out of the country. U.S. troops first deployed to Afghanistan after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, which were coordinated by al Qaeda leaders then based in the south Asian nation. Since taking office, President Barack Obama has promised -- and, in some cases, acted -- to reduce troop levels there, in addition to stating the goal of ending the U.S. combat mission by the end of 2014. The approval of a security agreement would pave the way for Americans troops to remain on the ground in Afghanistan beyond that. Speaking on Wednesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney stressed that any U.S. forces would have \\"a very limited mission\\" and would not be \\"patrolling cities or mountains.\\" \\"The war in Afghanistan will end next year, as the president has promised,\\" Carney said. \\"The combat mission will be over.\\" Kerry used similar language in calling the U.S. military's role in Afghanistan \\"very limited,\\" adding \\"it is entirely (to) train, equip and assist\\" Afghan forces. The language in the proposed security agreement, in fact, speaks to that point: \\"Unless otherwise mutually agreed, the United States forces shall not conduct combat operations in Afghanistan.\\" Report: Opium poppy cultivation rises to new levels in Afghanistan.","completion":"1.

The song becomes a poem, almost like a thesis.\\" She considered her music as a form of poetry, citing the album track \\"Hazy Shades\\" as an example of a poem turned into a song.Pru stated that she wanted her songs to bring variety to contemporary R&B, and described the material as the opposite of the formulaic music typically found on radio. On her official website, the singer identified her style as connected with the soul. Though AllMusic gives the singer songwriting credit on twelve of the tracks, Pru is only credited for co-writing \\"Aaroma\\" on the album's liner notes. The record was completed at Studio 57 and Weight Room in New York City, with mixing handled by Mike Shipley and Tony Maserati. Following release of the album, Pru spoke highly of her experiences with the producers and felt that they \\"la[id] a good bed around the lyrics and the melodies\\".

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? If you live in a place with mild winters - growing zone 10-12 or higher - you should be able to plant the poinsettia directly in the ground, where it will grow as a perennial and get larger with each passing year. If you're in a place where the temperature dips to freezing temperatures during the winter, you're better off keeping it in the pot as a houseplant. Poinsettia are native to Mexico, and they need a warm climate to thrive. If you bought the poinsettia during the winter as a decoration, keep the plant in the pot until spring, even if you live in a place with mild winters. If it came in foil remove the wrapper so water can drain from the pot. It needs to stay potted until the weather gets warm enough to transplant it. Water it whenever the soil starts to dry out. At the beginning of spring, in March or April, cut the poinsettia back to about 8 inches. This will encourage it to begin a new growing cycle and get it ready for transplanting. Keep it watered and fertilize it once a month or so until early summer, when it's time for transplanting. Look for a place where the poinsettia will get morning sun as well as light or partial shade during the heat of the afternoon. Till the soil and loosen it to a depth of 12 to 16 inches (30 to 40 cm). Enrich the soil by adding organic compost if necessary. Poinsettias prefer rich, well-drained soil. Dig a hole as wide as the poinsettia's root ball and plant the poinsettia. Pat soil gently around the base of the stem. Mulch the area around the base of the plant with 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7 cm) of organic mulch. This keeps the soil cool and helps it retain moisture. You can apply a 12-12-12 or 20-20-20 compound at the start of the growing season or fertilize the plant with compost. If your soil is not very rich, you may need to fertilize the plants once a month. Water the plant at the base whenever the soil around the plant feels dry to the touch. Avoid overhead watering, which could cause fungal disease to form on the leaves of the plant. Pinch small growing shoots from poinsettias occasionally throughout the growing season to encourage the plants to flower. You can discard the shoots or use them to propagate new plants. Cut back old growth in late fall or early winter to encourage strong new growth the following spring. You can take 8 inch (20 cm) cuttings from the soft growing tips of poinsettia stems or 18 inch (45 cm) cuttings from the woody stems of the plant to create new poinsettia. Dip the ends of each cutting into a rooting hormone, then insert it into a pot filled with potting soil or a vermiculite mix. Keep the soil in the pot moist, but not wet, for several weeks while the cuttings make roots. Add fresh mulch around the base of the plant to keep the soil warm for the winter months. Poinsettia can winter over in areas where soil temperatures do not fall below 45 degrees Fahrenheit (7 Celsius). Dig the plants up and bring them indoors if you live in a climate where winters are cold and soil temperatures fall below 45 degrees Fahrenheit (7 Celsius). Summary:","completion":"This article provides guidance on planting poinsettias in warm climates as perennials and maintaining them as houseplants in colder climates, emphasizing the importance of proper watering, sunlight, soil enrichment, and pruning to ensure healthy growth and flowering."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You don’t need to be at a big party to talk—you can do it in the hallway between classes. Even if they’re with a group, walk with them and chime in. If you see a couple of cool kids by themselves, go up and small talk to learn some basic interests. Ask if they’ve heard about the theme for homecoming. Tell them about your weekend. Bring up a class you have in common. Lunch is a very important time for socializing in school. It’s one of the few times of the day you actually have time to chat about absolutely anything for more than a moment or two. Don’t overthink it—simply walk up and ask if you can sit with them. They’ll probably control the conversation but tune in when you can.If nothing else—you can talk about the food. Cafeteria food is always an open ended conversation. Put together a hangout to get everyone together. It can be a study party for a big test, an evening hangout, or a spot to prepare for the game or dance that weekend. Make sure you ask your parents before you invite a lot of people to your house. The cool kids, as most people you’ll encounter in your life, will find it easier to relate to you if you have a sense of humor. When they start asking you questions, answer with some humor. You could also do this by telling them about a good time you had that made you laugh. Don’t make it inappropriate. Until you have a close relationship with them, this might lead them to be offended.

Abstract: The purpose of the present experiment was to study frequency changes in gastric myoelectric activity of healthy human subjects and the development of symptoms of motion sickness as brought about by vection or illusory self-motion. Fifteen fasted healthy human subjects were seated inside a circular vection drum, the rotation of which produces visual signals of self-motion that are in conflict with vestibular signals (i.e., mismatched sensory input). An electrogastrogram was obtained for three 15-min. periods: baseline, rotation, and after drum rotation stopped. Respiration, symptoms volunteered by subjects, and a continuous measure of intensity of symptoms were recorded. Five subjects showed a continuation of normal 3-cycles/min. activity during drum rotation and reported no symptoms of motion sickness. Ten subjects showed a shift of their dominant gastric frequency from 3 cycles/min. to 4-9 cycles/min. during drum rotation and reported symptoms of motion sickness.

Q: What is the only substance on earth that is stable in all three states? Choices: - carbon - mercury - air - water A: The answer to this question is:","completion":"Water. Based on the given paragraph, it states that water is the only substance on Earth that is stable in all three states. Let's elaborate further on this topic to understand why water is indeed the correct choice among the other options provided: The three fundamental states of matter are: solid, liquid, and gas. Water, as a substance, can exist in all three states under the normal range of temperatures and pressures on Earth. 1. Solid State: In the solid state, water forms ice. This occurs at temperatures below its freezing point, which is 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) at standard atmospheric pressure. Ice is a common occurrence in colder regions and during the winter months. 2. Liquid State: In the liquid state, we are most familiar with water as it serves as the basis of life on Earth, and it covers 71% of the Earth's surface in the form of rivers, lakes, and oceans. Water is a liquid at temperatures between its freezing point (0 degrees Celsius) and boiling point (100 degrees Celsius, or 212 degrees Fahrenheit) under standard atmospheric pressure. 3. Gas State: Water in its gaseous state is known as water vapor or steam. It occurs when water reaches its boiling point or when it evaporates from an open surface at lower temperatures. Water vapor is an essential component of Earth's atmosphere and the water cycle, as it facilitates the transport of water from one location to another in the form of clouds and precipitation. Now let's briefly examine the other options provided in the question: - Carbon: Carbon is an element that can exist in various forms, such as graphite, diamond, and fullerenes. While it can exist in different forms, it does not generally exist in the three states of matter (solid, liquid, and gas) under normal Earth conditions. Carbon can sublimate directly to gas without passing through a liquid state in certain conditions, but it does not exhibit a stable liquid state. - Mercury: Mercury is a unique metal that is liquid at room temperature, and it is used in applications such as thermometers and barometers. However, at standard atmospheric conditions, mercury cannot be found in a stable solid state, as it solidifies at -38.83 degrees Celsius (-37.89 degrees Fahrenheit). It can also become a gas when it reaches its boiling point of 356.73 degrees Celsius (674.11 degrees Fahrenheit), but it does not exist stably in all three states. - Air: Air is a mixture of gases and cannot be considered a single substance. Even when considering individual components of air, such as nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, they do not transition into stable solid and liquid states at standard conditions on Earth. In summary, water is the only substance among the given choices that is stable in all three states (solid, liquid, and gas) under the normal range of temperatures and pressures on Earth. This unique property of water plays a significant role in various natural processes and contributes to the sustenance of life on our planet."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water.

Report a Typo ||||| New York City and Long Island will institute gas rationing starting tomorrow, officials announced, to help ease long gas-station lines, in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The new rules will allow cars to fuel up, only if the last number of the license plate matches the day’s date. For example, tomorrow will be Nov. 9, so only cars with an ending odd number can buy gas. Saturday will be Nov. 10, when even numbers will be allowed to fuel up, and so on. License plates with no numbers — as in cheesy vanity plates — will be considered odd-number for this program. The new, temporary rules goes into effect at 5 a.m. on Long Island and 6 a.m. in the city. “This is designed to let everybody have a fair a chance [to buy gas so] lines [are not] too oppressive,” Mayor Bloomberg said “But we have to do something and this is something that is practical and enforceable and understandable.” He added: “Doing something is a lot better than doing nothing.” The mayor said he took the idea from New Jersey, where gas lines went from two hours to 45 minutes once the odd-even system was put in place. “We’ll keep it in for a while, [at least until] sometime next week,” Bloomberg said. “If you think about it, it’s not any great imposition once you get used to it so there’s no reason to take it out right away.” NYPD cops will be at all city gas stations to enforce the rule. Bloomberg warned New Yorkers that cops can tell if you switch license plates “The police can easily look at your registration,” he said, “so don’t try to be cute.” The gas rationing plan is the latest blow, suffered by New Yorkers, struggling to overcome Hurricane Sandy last week and a powerful nor’easter that blew through town yesterday afternoon and overnight. This latest sucker punch from Mother Nature complicated efforts to repair Hurricane Sandy-damaged neighborhoods throughout New York and New Jersey. By this morning, there were 108,000 Nassau County customers without power, Gov. Cuomo said. There were also still huge numbers of darkened homes and business in Suffolk County [79,000], Westchester County [35,000] and Queens [23,000]. By this morning, there were 108,000 Nassau County customers without power, Gov. Cuomo said. There were also still huge numbers of darkened homes and business in Suffolk County [79,000], Westchester County [35,000] and Queens [23,000]. “Last night was half a step back in Nassau and Suffolk with an increase in number of people who lost power,” Cuomo said. “Progress is slow because in impacted areas, you have to go building by building because you have to find out what buildings can take the power. That’s a labor-intensive activity.” The governor reiterated his beef with power companies, who have been slow to restore light to all. “I believe the system is archaic and is obsolete in many ways. No, I don’t believe what they did was adequate,” he said. “Part was system design, part was performance, part because they are a monopoly. At least with government, you can fire the person in charge. You’re unhappy with the utility company – who can you fire? They’re this nameless, faceless bureaucracy that is a monopoly that operates with very little incentive or sanction.” A Con Ed rep said customers who lost power to Hurricane Sandy would get priority over those who lost service from this latest storm. “I think we’re going to be able to power through. Our objective was to get power restored to everyone by the weekend and we’re still working with that goal,” said Alfonso Quiroz, a spokesman for the utility. Meanwhile in New Jersey, more than 390,000 customers had no power as of this morning, officials said. Gov. Chris Christie said he believes virtually every Garden State resident — outside hardest hit zones near Point Pleasant and Seaside Heights — should have lights on by this weekend. “I think most people l will have power by Saturday. This [nor’easter] set us back a day, 24 hours, 36 hours,” Christie said, after visiting with National Guard in Somerset. “This pushes back to late Saturday, early Sunday at the latest.” Getting from Point A to Point B around the tri-state area remained a challenged today — though delivered a bit of good news to commuters, announcing that the Queens-Midtown Tunnel would be open and going both ways by 6 a.m. tomorrow. Life at New York’s three nearby airports slowly got back to normal today, as workers cleared snow and planes went wheels up this morning. A majority of flights — especially to short-haul destinations — were able to take off. But many cross-country and international flights were cancelled this morning. That added to an already huge list of travelers trapped in town by this nor’easter that slammed Gotham and forced cancellation of thousands of flights from JFK, LaGuardia and Newark. Storm-battered New Yorkers were just grateful late night’s weather didn’t lead to any more floods. “The good news, thank goodness, is except for maybe two inches of snow, there were no other problems,” said Randi Savron, 51, a schoolteacher who lives in the Rockaways, one of the areas that flooded badly last week. Storm survivors from the Rockaways to Red Hook and Staten Island endured frigid temperatures in blacked-out homes last night with no heat — choosing not to evacuate and risk break-ins and looting. Temperatures hovered around the freezing mark through the night, with wind chills in the teens. “The wind, the snow and the cold is just rubbing salt in the wounds that were already open as a result of Sandy,” said AccuWeather meteorologist Erik Pindrock. The storm dumped more than half a foot of snow in some areas and causing another round of power outages. The National Weather Service reported this morning that the highest snowfall total from yesterday’s storm is in Armonk in Westchester County, where nearly 8 inches of snow has fallen. Parts of the city have received 4 to 7 inches of snow, with the highest totals in Queens and Staten Island. Snowfall totals in Suffolk, Nassau and Putnam counties range from 4 to nearly 7 inches. About a dozen schools in Westchester are opening two hours late because of the storm. The city warned residents of the most at-risk areas to leave, but many people were already gone or refused to come to the door, Mayor Bloomberg said. Staten Islanders were fed up with Mother Nature’s wrath. “It stinks. It’s a torture chamber,” said Freddy Ariemma, 45. “It took us a whole week to get ready for the last storm. Now I have to get rid of all this snow.” Sandy’s city death toll rose to 41 yesterday after William McKeon, 78, died Tuesday night from storm-related injuries. He was found unconscious at the bottom of a set of wet and sandy stairs in the Rockaways. Residents in Red Hook housing projects stocked up on blankets and coats to prepare for the new storm. “I’m just trying to get blankets to stay warm,” said Ileen Carrillo, 35, who was in her 10th day without electricity or heat. “We keep the pilot stove on, which is dangerous, and we moved the couches together for body heat.” Rockaway residents without heat or power stood out in the cold yesterday waiting for volunteers to dole out flashlights, batteries, diapers and baby formula. “We are going to have to stay here. We have no choice,” said Gloria Almond, 51, who lives in a bungalow on Beach 26th Street. “We just got over Sandy, and now another one is hitting us. It’s sad. We’re cold. We all got flooded out.” The storm brought down electrical wires in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, causing them to spark and leaving residents nearby without power Driving sleet and high winds of up to 50 mph yesterday compounded Long Island’s misery. “This is becoming unbearable,” said Kristi McAllister of Island Park, shielding her eyes from driving sleet as her flood-destroyed belongings sat in a snow-coated pile in front of her home. “This is the last thing we needed. I don’t even want to think about how much longer we have to go through this.” Additional reporting by David Seifman, Selim Algar, Joe Tacopino, Dana Sauchelli, Lorena Mongelli, Dan MacLeod ||||| Nor'easter Wraps Up in Philadelphia, New York City By Courtney Spamer, Meteorologist November 09, 2012; 3:40 AM Share | While the nor'easter is not completely finished and is still causing trouble in the Northeast, it has finally wrapped up across the mid-Atlantic. The southern portion of the Northeast had most of their rain, snow and wind from this storm by 5 a.m. Wednesday alone, Newark, N.J. received 5.7 inches of snow. This broke the old daily record snowfall of only a trace set back in 1981. Most of New York City's precipitation also fell as snow, picking up 4.3 inches Wednesday with a storm total of 4.7 inches. The Wednesday total broke yet another daily record, previously 0.10 of an inch from the year 1878. New York City and Newark were not the only cities across the Northeast that set daily snowfall records. Many impacts were felt along all of the mid-Atlantic states with this storm. Pennsylvania: The highest Pennsylvania wind gust was 31 mph at the Northeast Philadelphia Airport. Thankfully, this was a far cry from the intense winds that affected the area during Hurricane Sandy. The amount of snow that fell in The Keystone State was also relatively tame. The highest recorded snow amount was in Lower Makefield Township which came in at 2 inches. New Jersey: New Jersey, however, was a completely different story. Some of the highest snow totals have been recorded in central New Jersey. Freehold, for one, recorded 13 inches of snow through early Thursday morning. Manchester Township, just one county farther south, recorded 12 inches of snow. Even the more coastal areas of New Jersey had some snow yesterday. Atlantic City, one of the many towns devastated by Sandy early last week, received 2.5 inches of snow on top of more than a quarter of an inch of rain. This broke the previous daily snow record of 2.0 inches from 1953. New York: Snow showers are expected to continue this morning over Long Island as wrap-around moisture pushes through. New York state is also about done seeing snow from this storm. Warwick recorded 4.7 inches of snow, and Kent Cliffs in Putnam County had 6.5 inches of snow. Flushing, in Queens County, accumulated 7 inches of snow as of 8 a.m. EST Thursday and Malverne tallied up 6.5 inches. ||||| Loading Photo Gallery When the day started in New Jersey, temperatures were hovering as high as the mid 40s and snow seemed out of the question — until a little atmospheric physics came into play. As expected, a nor’easter skirted the New Jersey coast today, buffering the shore with high winds and surf at a time when it needed it least, following the devastation left by Hurricane Sandy. As recently as Tuesday afternoon, forecasters were largely downplaying the threat of snow. But by this afternoon, snow was quickly becoming the story of the storm. \\"All last winter, it was darn hard to get it to snow in New Jersey. Here we are back in early November and it snowed from the get go with this storm,\\" said David Robinson, the state climatologist at Rutgers University. \\"That’s three straight years now we’ve seen snow in the fall, October (2010), October (2011) and now again this November. That’s pretty unusual.\\" As day progressed, temperatures crashed statewide, and heavy snow was reported from Newark to Atlantic City. By 3 p.m., the warmest part of the state was what is typically the coldest, as temperatures remained near 40 in Warren and Sussex counties while the mercury in much of the Garden State plunged toward freezing. According to experts, the reason for this was two-fold. First, ahead of the storm New Jersey was extremely dry. As precipitation began to fall, it evaporated, soaking up heat as liquid turned to gas in the lower levels of the atmosphere. \\"The key there is it takes energy to evaporate moisture,\\" Robinson said. \\"That will lower the temperature as it occurs.\\" This started the cooling process, Robinson said. After that, the nor’easter’s strength itself took over, said Joe Miketta, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Mount Holly. \\"When you start to get heavier precipitation falling, it (was) actually dragging some of that cold air down from the atmosphere,\\" Miketta said. \\"Where that happens, that’s where you start to see the heaviest snow.\\" By this evening, several inches had fallen in parts of Atlantic County and was piling up elsewhere, causing growing concern for additional power outages in a state where hundreds of thousands remain in the dark following Sandy. Up to six inches was expected to fall in some areas before the storm pulls away. While the nor’easter is the latest headache for the storm-weary state, New Jersey finally appears poised to break out of the weather pattern that led to Sandy’s devastation and and earlier than usual first snowfall, forecasters say. Temperatures could reach the 60s this weekend and quieter weather is forecast to overtake the region for the coming week. \\"We’re just finding different ways to amaze,\\" said Robinson, referring to New Jersey’s recent run of wild weather. \\"But it appears we will thankfully see a mid-month break.\\" Related coverage: • Nor'easter live blog: Latest updates for the post-Sandy storm • Barrier island officials fear nor'easter could complicate recovery efforts • More than 363K N.J. customers still without power as crews handle nor'easter • Rough riders: Nor'easter has commuters bracing for another tedious trek ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"This news article is about a big storm called a nor'easter that brought lots of snow, rain, and strong winds to a place called New England.

Here is a premise: This may be less of a prophecy than a reflection on the town's tumultuous history. Here is a hypothesis: Maybe this is not so much a prediction for the future than a reflection on the town's troubled past. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Let's analyze the premise and hypothesis step-by-step. 1. Identify the core message of the premise: The premise states that a particular statement might not be a prophecy but rather a reflection of the town's tumultuous history. 2. Identify the core message of the hypothesis: The hypothesis states that the statement in question might not be a prediction for the future, but rather a reflection on the town's troubled past. 3. Compare the core messages: Both the premise and hypothesis have the same core idea - that the statement in question is more likely to be a reflection of the town's past rather than a prediction of the future. The only difference in wording is the use of \\"tumultuous\\" in the premise and \\"troubled\\" in the hypothesis. 4. Draw the conclusion: Based on the comparison, it is reasonable to conclude that if the premise is true (the statement is a reflection of the town's tumultuous history), then it supports the hypothesis (the statement is not so much a prediction for the future but a reflection on the town's troubled past). The two statements are very similar in meaning and the difference in wording does not significantly affect their congruence.

The woman keeping score turns to the newcomer with a hint of curiosity, scrolling through her notes to confirm his name. As the atmosphere in the room shifts to anticipation, the other players pause and watch the new contender. It is evident that he has earned a respectable reputation among his fellow players. He takes a deep breath and, with a fluid, carefully practiced motion, he sends his first dart flying. It lands precisely in the treble twenty, eliciting murmurs of appreciation from the onlookers. Emboldened by the impressive throw, the man's demeanor changes to one of confidence and purpose.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Derek Cho, the film's protagonist, tells the audience about the ID-7 virus, or \\"Red Eye\\" virus, that has been spreading throughout the world. It infects neural pathways, removing all inhibition and moral integrity, and in turn, causing people to act out their darkest impulses. While the virus is not lethal, those infected by the virus may find themselves driven to kill.

Derek, a lawyer at Towers and Smythe Consulting, works for the firm that handled Reed's case; he began his job full of optimism, but ended up back-stabbing, cheating, and finding loophole after loophole in order to work his way up the corporate ladder and get a corner office. One morning, Derek goes into work to find that his favorite mug is missing, and meets with a furious client - Melanie Cross - who needs more time on a loan, but thinks he's unable to help her. After discovering that a bungled legal case for massive company Vandacorp has been pinned on him by his superior Cara (called \\"The Siren\\", as she always has the boss's ear), Derek confronts her and finds that she has taken his mug.

Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: There are three different ways to store fish. Two ways to store fish for future use are canning and freezing. Two other methods are drying and smoking. Today we have the first of the two reports describing, step by step, how to prepare dried fish. Begin with the fish that are just out of water. If the fish are small, leave their heads on. Cut off the heads if the fish are longer than twenty centimeters or weigh more than one hundred fifteen grams. Now clean the freshly caught fish. Cut off the scales and cut open the stomach. Remove everything inside. Then wash the fish in clean water and rub salt into them. Next, put the fish in a container with a solution of three hundred grams of salt and one liter of water. This will remove the blood from the meat. Keep the fish in the salt water for about thirty minutes. After that, wash them again in clean water. Next, put the fish in a solution that has more salt in the water. The water should be salty enough so that the fish float to the top. If the fish sink to the bottom of the container, add more salt to the water. Cover the container with a clean piece of wood. Place a heavy stone on the wood to hold it down. Leave the fish there for about six hours. After that remove them from the salt water and place them on a clean surface. Cover the fish with a clean piece of white cloth and let them dry. Another method of preparing fish is called dry salting. Wooden boxes or baskets are used for drying salting. After cleaning the fish, put a few of them on the bottom of the box or basket. Cover them with salt, then put more fish on top. Cover them also with salt. Continuing putting fish and salt in the container until it is full. Do not use too much salt when using the dry salting method. You should use one part salt to three parts fish. For example, if you have three kilograms of fish, you should use one kilogram of salt. Remove the fish after a week or ten days. Wash them in a mixture of water or a small amount of salt and let them dry. We have talked a lot about...

It took a long time for Mary to heal from her fallout with Tanya as","completion":"the depth of their friendship had made the betrayal even more painful. Mary could still remember the day when Tanya revealed her true colors, leaving her in utter shock. The first step in moving forward was for Mary to fully grasp the situation and come to terms with the fact that Tanya was not the person she thought she knew. Step 1: Acceptance In order to heal, Mary had to accept that Tanya was a completely different person from the loyal friend she had trusted for so long. It was challenging as she went over the countless memories they had shared, wondering if Tanya had been pretending the entire time. The process of acceptance was slow and difficult, but it was essential in order for Mary to let go and find closure. Step 2: Emotional Expression Mary found it crucial to express and release the hurt, anger, and sadness that she felt as a result of Tanya's actions. She chose to write in a journal, where she could vent her feelings honestly and privately, without the fear of judgment from others. This outlet allowed her to process her emotions and gain a clearer understanding of her thoughts and experiences. Step 3: Seeking Support As Mary worked through her feelings, she reached out to her friends and family for support. They provided her with the much-needed love, encouragement, and a sense of belonging as she faced her challenging emotional journey. Their presence acted as a reminder that despite the loss of one friendship, she still had others who cared for her deeply. Step 4: Forgiveness Although it took a considerable amount of time, Mary eventually reached a point where she was able to forgive Tanya. Forgiveness didn't mean that she condoned Tanya's actions, but rather, she let go of the resentment and negative emotions she had been holding onto. Forgiving Tanya allowed Mary to free herself from the hold that the betrayal had on her life, and in turn, regain her emotional well-being. Step 5: Moving Forward With forgiveness achieved, Mary began to rebuild her life without Tanya. She focused on strengthening her relationships with her existing support network, and even forged new connections along the way. While the betrayal was painful, it ultimately pushed Mary towards personal growth and lessons that she would carry with her throughout her life. In the end, the long and intertwining road towards healing taught Mary several valuable lessons about trust, friendship, and resilience. As she closed the chapter on her fallout with Tanya, Mary emerged stronger and more self-aware, ready to embrace new experiences and authentic connections with those who truly deserved her trust."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Possible answers: (I) yes; (II) no;","completion":"(I) yes; Humbert of Romans, a prominent figure in the Dominican Order during the 13th century, was deeply passionate about languages. He sought to advance linguistic studies, particularly in the field of Arabic, as a means to support the Dominican Order's missionary efforts. These efforts were focused on engaging with the Muslim population in the Middle East who had either strayed from Christianity or had been forced to convert to Islam. Humbert's dedication to linguistic learning served to bridge cultural gaps and facilitate communication, understanding, and religious outreach. By embracing and promoting the study of Arabic and other languages, Humbert was able to help Dominican missionaries in their quest to spread Christian teachings and bring the lost souls back to the faith. Aside from Arabic, Humbert also encouraged the study of other languages that were relevant to the mission fields at the time, such as Hebrew and Greek. This broad interest in diverse languages highlights the depth of Humbert's love for languages and his commitment to using them as essential tools in the service of the Church and its evangelizing missions. In summary, the subject Humbert loved very much was languages, with particular emphasis on Arabic, due to its relevance to the missionary work the Dominicans were undertaking in the Middle East. His passion for linguistic studies extended to other languages too, thereby empowering the friars in their mission to engage with different communities across cultural and linguistic borders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: To the north of Africa the Tethys Sea continued to narrow. Broad shallow seas advanced across central North America (the Western Interior Seaway) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds. At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged. The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic. Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton. These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous formations from North America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation. Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in Europe and China. In the area that is now India, massive lava beds called the Deccan Traps were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene.","completion":"In India during the Cretaceous, there were massive lava beds called the Deccan Traps."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The city of Oklahoma City has designated Santa Fe railway station as the location for intermodal transit for the city and the greater area .","completion":"These two sentences from Wikipedia share a similar meaning, but they are not identical due to differences in wording and focus. Both sentences highlight the designation of a location for intermodal transit in a city and its surrounding area. However, the first sentence emphasizes the involvement of Santa Fe, while the second emphasizes Oklahoma City. The first sentence states that Santa Fe has designated the Oklahoma City station as the location for intermodal transit for the city and the conurbation area. In this sentence, \\"the city of Santa Fe\\" is the subject making the decision, and \\"the Oklahoma City station\\" is the designated location for intermodal transit. Furthermore, the surrounding area referred to in this sentence is described as \\"the conurbation area\\" which implies a densely populated urban area. The second sentence, on the other hand, states that Oklahoma City has designated the Santa Fe railway station as the location for intermodal transit for the city and the greater area. Here, \\"the city of Oklahoma City\\" is the subject making the decision, and \\"Santa Fe railway station\\" is the designated location. Additionally, the surrounding area is referred to as \\"the greater area,\\" which is a more general term that encompasses the broader region around the city.

Its most prominent outburst made Eta Carinae the equal of Sirius; it brightened to magnitude −1.5 in 1843. However, since 1843, Eta Carinae has remained relatively placid, having a magnitude between 6.5 and 7.9. However, in 1998, it brightened again, though only to magnitude 5.0, a far less drastic outburst. Eta Carinae is a binary star, with a companion that has a period of 5.5 years; the two stars are surrounded by the Homunculus Nebula, which is composed of gas that was ejected in 1843. How many years after Eta Carinae brightened to magnitude −1.5 did it brighten to magnitude 5.0?","completion":"Eta Carinae brightened to magnitude -1.5 in 1843 and then brightened to magnitude 5.0 in 1998. To determine the number of years that passed between these events, we need to subtract the earlier year from the later year: 1998 - 1843 = 155 years Therefore, it took 155 years from when Eta Carinae brightened to magnitude -1.5 for it to brighten to magnitude 5.0."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please briefly summarize this news article: British tabloid names Diana 'killer' In a front-page splash on the day Britain opened an inquest into Diana's death,Â The MirrorÂ named the person she had claimed was \\"planning an accident\\" in a chilling prediction of her own death in a car crash in August 1997. She made the allegation in a letter she gave to her butler and confidant, Paul Burrell, before she died. The former wife of heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles died at the age of 36, along with her lover Dodi al-Fayed and their chauffeur Henri Paul in a Paris road tunnel. The Mirror appeared to be risking an aggressive legal response from Buckingham Palace to its story on Tuesday. The rest of the normally competitive British media omitted the name, apparently to avoid legal action under Britain's tough defamation laws.Â TheÂ tabloid printed a copy of the letter Diana wrote just 10 months before her death on its inside pages. Although it identified the person in its own story, the name was blanked out in the reproduction of the handwritten letter. \\"This particular phase in my life is the most dangerous,\\" it quoted the letter as saying. \\"(...) is planning 'an accident' in my car, brake failure and serious head injury.\\" \\"This particular phase in my life is the most dangerous... (...) is planning 'an accident' in my car, brake failure and serious head injury\\"Excerpt from Princess Diana's letter to her butlerÂ Sensational headlines \\"This particular phase in my life is the most dangerous... (...) is planning 'an accident' in my car, brake failure and serious head injury\\"Excerpt from Princess Diana's letter to her butlerÂ Burrell, who gave The Mirror access to the letter as part of a serialisation of excerpts of his book which was published late last year, reacted angrily to news the name had been revealed. \\"I am not very happy about it... I only learnt about it late last night. And it was always my intention never to publish that name,\\" he told reporters on Tuesday. Britain's tabloid newspapers have been engaged in an almost daily battle in the years since Diana's death to produce the most sensational headlines about Diana, Charles and other members of her family and former household. Tuesday's revelation came as Royal Coroner Michael Burgess was due to open and adjourn inquests into the deaths of Diana and Dodi. Hundreds of journalists from around the world gathered for the start of the inquests in central London - the first official public hearings into the crash to be held on British soil. An inquiry by French authorities in 1999 ruled the accident was caused by Diana'sÂ chauffeur being drunk and driving too fast. The Mirror said Burrell was prepared to hand over the Diana letter to the coroner as part of the inquest. It said that in doing so, he would be \\"honouring a long-standing promise to cooperate fully with the inquiries\\". After a 15-year marriage, Charles and Diana divorced in 1996 after both had admitted to having adulterous affairs.","completion":"The British tabloid The Mirror published a person's name who Princess Diana claimed was planning a car accident for her in a letter given to her former butler, Paul Burrell, prior to her death in 1997.

Translate this to English?","completion":"Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic stated that Slobodan Milosevic's \\"death squads\\" still exist. Vuk Draskovic, the Foreign Minister, has expressed concerns about the ongoing presence of what he refers to as \\"death squads\\" connected to the former Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic. These death squads were allegedly used by Milosevic during his time in power to carry out various brutal acts, including acts of violence and mass killings, as part of a larger campaign of state-sanctioned terror and repression against opposition groups and certain ethnic communities. The reference to the \\"death squads\\" reveals a significant concern on Draskovic's part that the current state of affairs in the region may not have changed much since Milosevic's time in power. The fact that these groups still exist suggests that there continues to be a great deal of unrest, political instability, and potential for violence in the region. In making this statement, Draskovic may be attempting to draw attention to the seriousness of the situation, and to the importance of pursuing reform and measures aimed at breaking down the remnants of Milosevic's brutal regime. This could include efforts to apprehend and bring to justice individuals who were involved in the \\"death squads\\" and their activities, as well as broader actions aimed at promoting political stability, reconciliation, and peace in the region. Additionally, the Foreign Minister's statement highlights the need for increased international attention and support in order to address these ongoing security challenges. This could involve providing assistance in the areas of counter-terrorism and organized crime prevention, as well as offering support for legal and institutional reforms in order to ensure that those responsible for past crimes are held accountable. In summary, the statement by Foreign Minister Draskovic serves as a stark reminder of the brutal legacy left by Slobodan Milosevic and his regime. It highlights the ongoing presence and potential threat posed by these so-called \\"death squads\\" and underlines the urgency of addressing these issues in order to bring about meaningful change, stability, and peace in the region."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So: 44 * f + 27 - 27 = -105 - 27 44 * f = -132 Now, we need to find the value of 'f', so we will divide both sides of the equation by 44: (44 * f) / 44 = (-132) / 44 f = -3 So the value of 'f' is -3. If we replace 'f' with -3 in our original equation, we'll see that it balances: 44 * (-3) + 27 = -105"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What's the most logical way to complete this passage? Cover-up claims: Former MP and Lib Dem presidency candidate Liz Lynne at the party's conference in Glasgow last week A leading candidate for the Lib Dem presidency was yesterday accused of helping cover up Cyril Smith’s vile catalogue of child sex abuse. Liz Lynne, who succeeded Smith as MP for Rochdale, allegedly ordered her PA to destroy several pages of notes containing a stream of allegations against the paedophile. They detailed a litany of abuse at the Knowl View children’s home in Rochdale, which closed in the mid-1990s. The PA, Deborah Doyle, said she had taken the notes during a 1996 telephone conversation with a former manager of the home, Martin Digan. Last night Miss Lynne said: ‘I have no recollection whatsoever of anybody contacting me about allegations against Cyril Smith or child abuse at","completion":"Knowl View children's home. If any such allegations were brought to my attention, I would have taken the appropriate steps to ensure they were thoroughly investigated. It is crucial to protect the welfare of all children, and any claims of abuse need to be treated with the utmost seriousness.' One possible course of action would be to launch an independent investigation into the cover-up claims. The investigation should be led by an impartial third party with no connections to the individuals involved. This would involve gathering all relevant evidence, including statements from Deborah Doyle, Martin Digan, and any other potential witnesses. Additionally, any documents, recordings, or other materials related to the allegations should be collected and preserved. Step 1: Appoint an impartial investigator. To ensure a fair examination of the claims, an unbiased investigator with experience in handling similar cases should be assigned. This individual should possess legal expertise, investigative experience, and familiarity with child abuse cases and their potential impact on the victims. Step 2: Gather evidence. The investigator should collect all pertinent evidence, including the allegedly destroyed notes, any existing records, and statements from those involved or potentially aware of the situation. This should involve interviews with the former PA, the former manager of the home, and any other relevant individuals who may have information about the allegations or the handling of the case. Step 3: Analyze the evidence. The collected evidence should be carefully reviewed, and the credibility of the witnesses should be assessed. The investigator should consider any potential biases, inconsistencies, and other factors that may impact the integrity of the evidence. Step 4: Present the findings. Based on the gathered evidence and analysis, the investigator should present the findings to all relevant parties, taking into account the potential implications for the individuals involved and the need to ensure justice and accountability. This may include reporting the findings to the Lib Dem party, law enforcement authorities, and any organizations responsible for the care and protection of children. Step 5: Take appropriate action. If the investigation concludes that there is sufficient evidence to support the cover-up claims, the responsible individuals should be held accountable, and appropriate measures should be taken to address the situation. This may involve sanctions or disciplinary action against the accused party, as well as steps to prevent future instances of abuse and cover-ups. If the evidence is inconclusive or does not support the claims, further monitoring or inquiries may still be warranted in order to protect the welfare of all children involved. By following these steps, the most logical and thorough response to the allegations can be achieved, ensuring that any potential cover-up is uncovered and that those involved are held accountable for their actions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Looking for signs of post-injection inflammatory reactions can help you figure out the best way to relieve your pain or if you need to see your doctor. Common symptoms are: Itching Redness radiating from the injection site Warmth Swelling Tenderness Pain Put an ice or cold pack over the injection site. This can relieve itching, swelling, and pain by constricting blood flow and cooling your skin. Leave the ice on the site for 15 – 20 minutes. Do this three to four times per day until the pain eases. Use a bag of frozen vegetables if you don’t have an ice pack. Put something like a towel between your skin and the ice or cold pack to minimize the risk of frostbite. Put a clean, cool, wet washcloth over the injection site if you don’t want to use ice. Avoid applying heat to your injection site. This can increase swelling as it brings more blood to infected area. Over-the-counter medications can relieve pain and swelling. Consider taking these medications if you have a lot of pain or inflammation at the injection site. Take pain relievers including ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB), naproxen sodium (Aleve) or acetaminophen (Tylenol). Do not give aspirin to children or teenagers under 18, as it increases the risk for Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal condition. Minimize swelling with NSAIDs (non-steriodal anti-inflammatory drugs) like ibuprofen and naproxen sodium. Avoid taxing the area where you had an injection, especially if it was a cortisone shot. This can give the injection site time to heal and may prevent further pain or discomfort. Keep heavy lifting to a minimum if you got a shot in the arm. Stay off of your feet if you got an injection on your leg. If you have received a steroid shot, avoid heat for 24 hours to ensure the injection will have maximum response. In some cases, injections can cause allergic reactions or prolonged pain.

Question: Process: - Humans are born as babies - Babies become infants - Infants become children - Children learn skills - Children become teenagers - Teenagers undergo puberty - Teenagers become adults - Adults have children - Adults become elderly - Elderly humans die. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more children die young happens, how will it affect more adults have children. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if more children die at a young age, it will have an impact on the \\"more adults have children\\" step in the process. The perturbation would indeed have both direct and indirect effects on that step in the process. Direct effect: If more children die young, the number of people who are able to grow into adulthood and become parents will be reduced. As a result, there will be fewer adults to have children, which directly impacts the number of new babies being born. This decrease in population growth could lead to a decline in the overall population if the number of children dying is significant. Indirect effects: 1. Societal impact: An increase in child mortality could induce psychological and social stressors on families and communities. This might lead to a societal shift where adults decide to have more children to counterbalance the premature loss of young lives. In this case, the perturbation could indirectly cause an increase in births. 2. Healthcare improvements: If the increased rate of child mortality is due to insufficient healthcare services or preventable diseases, societies might invest more in healthcare and preventative measures. This could lead to better health outcomes and survival rates for children, eventually resulting in a higher population of adults having children. 3. Economic impact: Higher child mortality could influence economic policies, allocation of resources, and even education systems as each nation tries to address the underlying causes of the increased mortality. These changes could subsequently influence family planning decisions, either positively or negatively, depending on the specific circumstances. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis that supposes an increase in child mortality will have direct and indirect effects on the \\"more adults have children\\" phase of the human lifecycle process. While the direct effect is straightforward, the indirect effects depend on various factors such as societal norms, healthcare systems, and economic influences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I can use this background: All of these animal behaviors are important. They help the animals get food for energy, make sure their young survive, or ensure that they, themselves, survive. Behaviors that help animals or their young survive, increase the animals’ fitness. Animals with higher fitness have a better chance of passing their genes on to the next generation. If genes control behaviors that increase fitness, the behaviors become more common in the species. This occurs through the process of evolution by natural selection. Now, I have a new situation: David is a biologist. He was in the African savanna to study different species. Especially, he was interested in two species, rhinos and impalas. He noticed that in response to constant human encroachment of wildlife habitats, impalas have acquired some behaviors that help them and their young.

Dallas Chief of Police David Brown told CNN Sunday that the slain gunman told police negotiators he wanted to \\"kill white people, especially white officers.\\" Bomb making materials and a journal were found at Johnson's home during a search Friday. \\"The material were such that it was large enough to have devastating effects throughout our city and our North Texas area,\\" Brown said. Micah Xavier Johnson, 25, was killed by police in the deadly attack Thursday night during a protest against police killings of African American men. Since the shooting deaths of two black men by white police officers over two days last week, protests have been held across the country. Scores of demonstrators have been arrested, with one flash point being the southern city of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where DeRay McKesson, one of the most prominent activists linked to the police reform protest movement Black Lives Matter, live streamed his own arrest. Police defended his arrest as a matter of public safety, but demonstrators told U.S. news outlets they believe McKesson was targeted.

Article: Mr. Harris used to work in Dover, but then he changed his work, and he and his wife moved to another town. They did not have many friends there, but they soon met a lot of interesting people, and after a few weeks, they often went to dinner or to parties at other people's houses. Then Mrs. Harris said to her husband, \\"We've been to a lot of other people's houses, and now we must invite them to our house, mustn't we?\\" \\"Yes, certainly,\\" answered her husband, \\"A big party will be the easiest thing, won't it? Then we can start to invite people to dinner in small numbers next month.\\" So Mrs. Harris said, \\"Yes, I'll invite all our friends here to a big party on 5th December.\\" \\"How many will that be?\\" Mr. Harris asked. \\"Don't invite too many.\\" Mrs. Harris was beginning to write the invitations when her husband saw that she was writing, \\"Party. 6.30 to 8.30 p.m.\\" \\"That isn't very nice, is it?\\" he said. \\"You're telling our guests that they must go at 8.30.\\" So Mrs. Harris just wrote \\"Party. 6.30 p.m.\\" A lot of guests came, and they all had a good time, so they did not go home at 8.30. In fact they were still there at mid-night when the door bell rang and a policeman arrived. He said, \\"You must stop making a noise, because someone has complained.\\" Mr. Harris said he did not want to quarrel with the policeman, so everyone went home. They were sorry to have to go. When Mr. and Mrs. Harris were alone again, she said to him. \\"That was a surprise, wasn't it? Who complained about the noise?\\" \\"I did,\\" Mr Harris answered in a tired voice.

Problem:(CNN) -- A Nebraska \\"hate crime\\" that targeted an openly gay woman and that triggered responses from candlelight vigils locally to Facebook postings of support nationwide was staged by the alleged victim, authorities said Tuesday as they charged the woman with lying to police. Charlie Rogers -- a former basketball player for the University of Nebraska who identifies herself as lesbian -- told police that three masked men entered her home on July 22, stripped her, tied her down, and carved homophobic slurs into her body before attempting to set her and the house on fire. But the Lincoln Police Department said Tuesday that \\"the physical evidence conflicted with Charlie Rogers' version of events\\" and that \\"extensive investigation revealed numerous inconsistencies.\\" Previously on CNN.com: Woman speaks out after alleged hate crime . Rogers was arrested Tuesday, police said. Her attorney, Brett McArthur, told CNN Tuesday night that Rogers had agreed as part of an arrangement to turn herself in, in exchange for a personal recognizance bond. \\"She did not have to post any money\\" to be released, McArthur said, adding that his client pleaded not guilty to the charge of lying to police. \\"She maintains her innocence. This has been kind of a kick in the gut as a victim to turn around and be charged,\\" McArthur said. In a news release, police cited DNA and pathologists' examinations that did not substantiate Rogers' original statements, and changes in her story during the investigation. \\"These were serious allegations that garnered national attention and spread fear among local citizens,\\" the police statement said. \\"A great deal of time and resources were spent investigating Charlie Rogers' claims in hopes of identifying and arresting the three suspects in this case.\\" Beth Rigatuso, president of Heartland Pride based in Omaha, organized a vigil that attracted over 1,000 people in the aftermath of the reported attack. For her, the news that it may have been a hoax is \\"a pretty big blow.\\" \\"I don't feel betrayed as much as I feel sad for how, if this is really true...there is a lot of things going on with her,\\" Rigatuso said. \\"It leads to a bigger problem in our society that someone would do this.\\" Rigatuso said she hopes people would not turn their backs on Rogers now. The vigil she put together in Omaha raised more than 1,800, all of which was deposited in an account for Rogers. \\"We'd like to get the funds returned to us so we can establish our own fund to support victims of anti-gay violence.\\" Rigatuso said Tuesday. McArthur, Rogers' attorney, said he \\"knows nothing\\" about the fund or how much money might be in it. He said it was in place before he became Rogers' lawyer. According to the Lincoln Police Department complaint, Rogers, 33, provided information \\"she knew to be false\\" with the intent to \\"instigate an investigation of an alleged criminal matter.\\" Rogers reported to police that she was lying on her bed when the alleged attackers held her down and carved \\"derogatory words\\" into her arms and abdomen and \\"a cross\\" in her chest. She told police she was then rolled onto her stomach where more cuts were made. But according to a deposition from Lincoln police investigator Lynette Russell filed as part of the complaint, Rogers bedspread was \\"evenly placed on the bed and no apparent sign of a struggle.\\" A DNA lab test found no evidence of blood on the bedspread. Russell also described a pair of white gloves found at the scene that Rogers had said were not hers. \\"Ms. Rogers DNA profile was the major contributor to the DNA located on the inside of the gloves,\\" Russell said. Furthermore, the deposition said, the FBI sent photos of Rogers' cuts to a forensic pathologist, who believed the wounds to be self-inflicted. \\"This opinion is based partially on the fact that the cuts appeared superficial and symmetrical, avoided sensitive areas of the body,...are accessible to the victim and follow the victim's frame of reference for reading and writing,\\" the deposition said. Rumors had been circulating in recent weeks in Lincoln and on the Internet due to the fact that police had yet to pinpoint any suspects. The urge to respond to rumors prompted Rogers to give her one and only interview. \\"For people to think this doesn't happen here, it does,\\" Rogers told CNN affiliate KETV on July 27. \\"It did.\\" She refused to discuss the incident itself during that interview. Rogers' attorney at the time, Megan Mikolajczyk, told CNN her client was ready for a full interview early last week, but canceled saying \\"things have changed.\\" Mikolajczyk said Tuesday that she is no longer Rogers' attorney. According to neighbor Linda Rappl, Rogers' showed up on her doorstep bloodied in the early morning hours immediately following the alleged attack last month. \\"I was in shock,\\" Rappl said soon after the incident. \\"She was naked, her hands were tied with zip ties. All I could see was a cut across her forehead and blood running down.\\" Rappl said she took the sobbing Rogers inside and wrapped her in a blanket before calling 911. Solution:","completion":"A Nebraska \\"hate crime\\" targeted at an openly gay woman has been deemed staged by the alleged victim, Charlie Rogers. The inconsistencies in her version of events led the Lincoln Police Department to charge her with lying to police. Rogers, a former University of Nebraska basketball player, claimed three men had entered her home, assaulted her, and attempted to burn her house down.

We're given the equation: -180*y + 1118 = -266*y Step 2: Isolate the variable term on one side.

In order to see and discover the true soul of Scotland today and what formed the character of this splendid region, we have to go towards the northern regions, to the Grampian Mountains , beautiful and plain. The Scots conquered the environment with simple spades and strong arms, for it was difficult to farm.

Perhaps the most exciting moment for Scottish autonomy is _ experienced inside this ancient church of Arbroath, where, in 1320, the Declaration of Independence was celebrated, at the instigation of King Robert the Bruce. He carried out the plan for autonomy drawn up by the great popular hero William Wallace, for whom cinema has designed the wonderful film Brave Heart, the winner of the five Oscars.

The show was created by Gy Waldron and Jerry Rushing, and it was inspired by Rushing's experiences as a \\"moonshine runner\\" during the 1950s and 1960s. The main characters of the show include Bo Duke (played by John Schneider), Luke Duke (played by Tom Wopat), Daisy Duke (played by Catherine Bach), their wise Uncle Jesse Duke (played by Denver Pyle), and their trusty car, the General Lee (a 1969 Dodge Charger). Many storylines revolve around the Dukes' attempts to outsmart the corrupt county commissioner, Boss Hogg (played by Sorrell Booke), and his bumbling sidekick, Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (played by James Best). Although set in Georgia, the show was predominantly filmed in California, specifically in the Santa Clarita area and on the Warner Bros. studio backlot. Occasionally, the show's producers would use stock footage of the southeastern United States to give the appearance of being filmed on location. Some episodes were also filmed at the Disney Ranch in Newhall, California, where they created a replica of part of the Hazzard town square. The Southern setting of the show played an essential role in developing the show's themes. One of the most iconic aspects of The Dukes of Hazzard is the General Lee's paint job, which features the Confederate flag on its roof, a nod to the cultural heritage of the South. As a result, the show incorporates various elements of Southern culture, such as country music, car racing, and rural living, into its storylines. Despite the show's fictional setting, it managed to captivate audiences with its blend of action, humor, and family values. Ultimately, The Dukes of Hazzard became a cultural phenomenon, with its influence stretching beyond its original run and solidifying its place in television history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The United States covers a large part of the North American continent. Its neighbours are Canada to the north and Mexico to the south. Although the United States is a big country, it is not the largest in the world. In 1964, its population was over 185,000,000. When this land first became a nation, after winning its independence from England, it had thirteen states. Each of the states was represented on the American flag by a star. All these states were in the eastern part of the continent. As the nation grew toward the west, new states were added and new stars appeared on the flag. For a long time, there were 48 stars. In 1959, however, two more stars were added to the flag, representing the new states of Alaska and Hawaii. Indians were the first people of the land which is now the United States. There are still many thousands of Indians now living in all parts of the country. Sometimes it is said that the Indians are \\"the only real Americans\\". Most Americans come from all over the world. Those who came first in greatest numbers to make their homes on the eastern coast of North America were mostly from England.

How did you think your parents shaped your character? M: Well, it's hard to estimate entirely. I was quite fond of my parents and considered them very good people. My mother was a kind of very feminist and a well-known Jewish poet. She became internationally known. My father was a lawyer. And though it's hard to say how much they influenced me, I liked them, I respected them and I'm sure I was influenced to some degree by them. W: You were educated in the public schools?

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: The things you say to the guy, or even the things you talk about when you're not around the guy, can be a big indication of whether or not you have a crush on the guy. Here's how to know if the things you say mean that you have a serious crush: If you find yourself always teasing the guy. If you always end up poking fun at the guy without meaning to, it means you have a crush. If you talk really fast or stutter when you say anything to the guy, it means you have a crush. If you're careful about not saying anything that might make you look like a ditz or dumb in front of the guy, then you have a crush. And if you feel like everything you say to him does make you sound like a ditz, then you probably have a crush. If you can't talk to one of your friends for more than ten minutes without mentioning the guy, then you have a crush. If you have a crush, your friends may be able to pick up on it before you do. You can learn a lot about whether or not you have a crush on the guy based on how you act around him, or even how you act when he's miles away. Here are a few ways to know if your actions mean you've been bitten by the crush bug: If you go out of your way to hang out with him, then you have a crush on him. If you've never watched baseball in your life but are suddenly going to all the school games because you know he'll be sitting in the bleachers, then you have a crush. If you want to be near him whenever you do hang out. If you find yourself drifting toward him when you're in a group of friends, or even touching him in a playful way whenever you can, then you have a crush. If you can't stand being around him when he's flirting with other girls, then you have a crush. If your heart falls when you show up to a place where you thought he'd be and he isn't there, then you have a crush. It may not be a coincidence that you're suddenly spending twice as much time in front of the mirror whenever you know you'll see the guy. Here's how to know if your grooming habits and attention to your looks say that you have a crush on the guy: If you try twice as hard to look good if you know you'll see him. If you wear your best outfit, best hairdo, and most amazing eye makeup when you know he'll be there, then you have a crush. If you find yourself experimenting with new makeup looks or jewelry to see if he notices, then you have a crush. If you find yourself not caring at all about how you look if you go somewhere where you know you won't see him, then you have a crush. Let's say this guy is the athletic, typical-boy type. You might find yourself practicing basketball and soccer, or buying Nike shoes, so your guy can get interested in you. And if you want your guy to get interested in you, that basically means you have a crush on him and will kind of do anything for him.

Olivia Dunham is a fictional character and the main protagonist from the science fiction television series Fringe, which aired on the Fox Broadcasting Company in the United States from 2008 to 2013. The character was created by series' co-creator J. J. Abrams, and is portrayed by actress Anna Torv. Olivia is the series' protagonist, and was introduced as an FBI Special Agent, working for a multi-agency task force of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security called the Fringe Division, dealing with supernatural events that are linked to experimental occurrences. Having grown up with an abusive stepfather, Olivia struggles with the unexpected changes in her life, following her encounter with mentally unstable scientist Walter Bishop, and his son and an eventual love interest for her, Peter Bishop. The character of Olivia has been described as \\"an incredibly driven, incredibly brilliant agent with her own complicated past that will be peel[ed] back over time.\\" She is a loner and dedicates almost all of her time to her work. She has a strong sense of justice, which drives her to solve a case by any means necessary. It is this quality which both impresses and irritates Broyles, as it makes her a good agent but also makes her prone to biting off more than she can chew when it comes to pursuing suspects. Olivia had an abusive stepfather, and shot him several times in defense of her mother and herself. She was unable to finish him off, and so he recovered and disappeared, leaving her to blame herself for not exacting retribution against him, contributing to her determination to bring criminals to justice. She was nine years old when she shot her stepfather, and she states in an earlier episode that she knew what she wanted to do for a career \\"pretty much since [she] was nine\\", indicating a direct link between the childhood abuse and her job. In the reset timeline for the series' fourth season, Torv explained that \\"The Olivia we meet and know has known about Fringe Division and had all this time to get used to it and work out that this is her life,\\" rather than becoming familiar with it after the attack on John Scott. Consequently, \\"when Lincoln comes in, she's a little more open to him [than she was with Peter] and working with someone again.\\" Olivia has few close relationships. She has little family, as her mother died when she was in her early teenage years. Olivia's is close to her sister Rachel, and Rachel's daughter Ella. Olivia was involved in a serious relationship with fellow FBI agent John Scott, and his supposed betrayal and death was something she dealt with for much of the first season. In the second season finale, Olivia and Peter Bishop finally admit their feelings for each other and kiss. Fauxlivia was involved in a serious relationship with Frank Stanton and eventually became engaged, but the two broke up when he discovered she was pregnant by Peter. Olivia was in a relationship with Peter after they mended things in episode 6B But shortly after that Peter built a bridge wiping himself from existence, causing Olivia to forget who he was. But through the cortexiphan and the power of their love, she soon remembered her life with him. They were married and have a daughter.

How do you do this: To cut a metal bar into two equal sizes.","completion":"To cut a metal bar into two equal sizes, you can follow these simple steps: 1. Measure the length: First, you need to measure the total length of the metal bar using a measuring tape. Let's say, it's 10 inches long. 2. Find the middle: To find the middle point, you need to divide the total length by 2. So, for our 10-inch metal bar, the middle point is 10 ÷ 2 = 5 inches. 3. Mark the middle: Next, take a marker and make a clear mark on the metal bar at the 5-inch spot. This is where we will cut it. 4. Put on safety gear: When cutting metal, it's important to wear safety gear like gloves, and if necessary, protective glasses. 5. Use a tool to cut: With the help of an adult, use a metal cutting tool like a hacksaw or a metal-cutting saw to cut the metal bar at the middle point that we marked earlier. 6. Sand the edges: After cutting, there might be some sharp edges. Use a metal file to gently smooth them down. And there you have it! You've cut a metal bar into two equal pieces.

Mr. Children (misutachirudoren, Misuta Chirudoren), commonly referred to by their contracted nickname \\"Misu-Chiru\\" (misuchiru)) is a Japanese pop rock band formed in 1989 by Kazutoshi Sakurai, Kenichi Tahara, Keisuke Nakagawa, and Hideya Suzuki. They made their major debut in 1992. As a group, they are one of the best selling artists in Japan and one of the most successful Japanese rock artists, having sold over 50 million records and creating the \\"Mis-chil Phenomenon\\" (misuchiruXian Xiang ) in the mid-1990s in Japan. They held the record for the highest first week sales of a single in Japan for 15 years, with 1.2 million copies of their 10th single \\"Namonaki Uta\\" (Ming monakiShi ), have 30 consecutive number 1 singles, replaced Glay as the all-male band (with 3 or more members) to have the most number 1 albums on the Oricon charts, and won the Japan Record Award in 1994 for \\"Innocent World\\" and in 2004 for \\"Sign\\". On February 11, 1998, they released their 14th single \\"Nishi e Higashi e\\" (nishiehigashie), theme song to the Japanese drama Kira kira Hikaru (kirakirahikaru). The group was still on hiatus during this time and made no live performances to promote the single and did not appear in the music video for the song. Finally on October 21, 1998, Mr. Children officially re-grouped and released their 15th single, \\"Owarinaki Tabi\\" (Zhong warinakiLu ) with the Japanese drama Naguru Onna (Ou ruNu ) using it as their theme song. The song remains a public favorite in voting polls, Oricon citing its inspirational lyrics as the reason. On January 13, 1999, \\"Hikari no Sasu Hou E\\" (Guang noShe suFang he), their 16th single, was released, followed by their seventh album, Discovery, on February 3, 1999. Sakurai compared his approach to the songwriting for the record to surfing: Eleven days later they began the Discovery Tour '99, from February 14 to July 12, where the group visited 16 cities and held 42 shows. During the tour, Mr. Children released their 17th single \\"I'll Be\\" on May 12, which was used in Shiseido's (Zi Sheng Tang ) Sea Breeze commercials. Though originally released on the Discovery album, the song was re-released as a single with a lighter beat. The single was not a success and became Mr. Children's lowest selling single since \\"Cross Road\\". During the Discovery Tour '99, an idea for a live album was brought up. It was released as a 500,000 copy limited edition on September 8, 1999 and called 1/42 (referring to one of the 42 shows in the tour). Most of the tracks were recorded on June 16, 1999 at the Makomanai ice arena, while the bonus track \\"Dakishimetai\\" was recorded at the Okinawa Ginowan-Shi seaside park. At the beginning of a new century \\"Kuchibue\\" (Kou Di ), released on January 13, 2000 became the group's 18th single. While \\"I'll Be\\" failed to be a success, \\"Kuchibue\\" proved to be a hit selling 724,070 copies. On August 9, 2000, their 19th single \\"Not Found\\" was also used as the theme song to the Japanese drama Bus Stop (basusutotsupu), followed a month later by their 9th original album Q on September 27, 2000. The band went to New York to record this album, where they re-recorded some of their old indie material and for the first time, producer Takeshi Kobayashi performed with the band on a recording. The cover for the album was shot bought Size, Inc. at the Bonneville Salt Flats in the United States. The album was not a favorite amongst fans for various reasons and became their first album since Atomic Heart to not sell over one million copies.

Mr. Children's impressive sales records and their impact on the Japanese music scene: The fact that they have sold over 50 million records and created a phenomenon in the 1990s highlights their significant influence on the Japanese music industry. 2. The group's hiatus during the release of their 14th single: Mr. Children took a hiatus and made no live performances to promote their 14th single. This shows the band's resilience in overcoming challenges and eventually re-grouping to continue their success. 3. Their connection to Japanese dramas: Several of their singles were used as theme songs for popular Japanese drama series, highlighting their contributions to not just the music industry but also the entertainment sphere in Japan. 4. The live album 1/42: This album was born out of an idea during the Discovery Tour '99 and featured recordings from various concerts during the tour. The limited edition release of 500,000 copies and the fact that it represents just one of the 42 shows gives it an exclusive appeal. 5. Experimentation and change in their musical style: Throughout their career, Mr. Children has tried different styles and worked with various music producers. Their willingness to experiment and adapt has likely contributed to their longevity as a successful band. 6. International recording experience: Mr. Children recorded their 9th original album, Q, in New York and collaborated with producer Takeshi Kobayashi, who also performed with the band for the first time on a recording. This demonstrates the band's efforts to broaden their music horizons and work with international talent."},{"prompt":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: I grew up in a small town. My father raised chickens and ran a construction company. I was barely 10 years old when my dad gave me the responsibility of feeding the chickens and cleaning up the stable. He believed it was important for me to have those jobs to learn responsibility. Then, when I was 22, I found a job in Natchbill at a country music club called the Natchbill Palace, I washed dishes and cooked from 4: 00 pm to 9: 00 pm and then went on stage and sang until 2:00 in the morning. It wasn't long before I became known as a singing cook. I had been rejected so many times by record companies that it was hard not to be discouraged. One night, a woman executive from a company named Warner Brothers Records came to hear me sing. When the show was over, we sat down and talked and after she left, I said to myself it was one more rejection. A few weeks later, my manager received a phone call -- Warner Brothers wanted to sign me to a record deal. Soon after, I released my first record in June 1986. It sold over 2 million copies. My best efforts had gone into every job I've ever held. It was the sense of responsibility that made me feel like a man. Knowing that I had done my best filled me with pride.

As the Marines leave, one Marine remains and makes his way towards the exit. The Marine's name is Jesse Rodriguez (Freddy Rodriguez). The film cuts to a house where a man, Edy Rodriguez (Alfred Molina) is on a ladder nailing up a welcome home sign for Jesse. The woman, his wife, Anna Rodriguez (Elizabeth PeÃ±a) gives him a rather disgruntled look before leaving to prepare for Jesse's return. Edy then travels to his store, a small neighborhood supermarket, called Bodega. Along the way, and even in the store, Edy appears to be quite popular with the ladies. Back at the airport, Jesse finally meets up with his friend and cousin Johnny (Luis Guzman) and Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), who have come to pick him up. On the way to his fathers store, Jesse takes off his eye-patch to reveal that he can still see, but the area around his eye is badly injured. After some prompting from Johnny and Ozzy, he reveals that he was the lucky one, as his friend Lenny was not as lucky and Jesse feels some guilt for this. On the way, the three pass a park and Jesse tells them to stop. The park was their childhood playground and the three take a little time off to play a game of baseball and reminisce. While at the park, Ozzy spots Alexis (Manny PÃ©rez), the man who killed his brother, recently been released from prison. Ozzy stares at Alexis, and Alexis stares back, however, before Ozzy is able to make his way to Alexis, both Jesse and Johnny hold him back then they make their way to Edy's store. Jesse's sister Roxanna (Vanessa Ferlito) arrives by taxi, although everyone assumes she came in a limo because they all assume that she made it big in Hollywood as an actress.

Please answer the following question: The collaborative process between me and Claire Bridge has been good so far. Upon finding out her email address we had a brief email exchange culminating in me sending her a list of potential questions for the interview. Claire quite liked a lot of the questions, but overall there were too many, so we proceeded to reduce the number of questions to six main questions. These questions would then form the basis of the artist portrait, with an attempt to limit answers to no more than a minute, so little had to be cut for the final edit. The six questions we arrived at are as follows: How would you define creativity? What does it mean to you to be an artist? Do you feel a painting or piece of art can house an energy/a feeling from the original artist? Do you feel that your own works house this energy? Change and transformation are recurrent themes in your work. What are you exploring and why do these fascinate you? And recently we saw a change in your medium too, incorporating video works and photography. You seem to draw on many influences in your work, from quantum physics, astrophysics, to environmental ecology, psychology, philosophy and metaphysics. With titles like “Dark Matter”, “Touching Infinity”, “We are made of Stars”, “Rising tides” and “A drop in the ocean” or “Alchemy”. Can you tell us something more about the convergence of these ideas and influences? What continues to motivate and inspire you as an artist? We both felt these questions addressed the initial topic of exploring creativity, explored why Claire became an artist, gives insight into Claire’s work and practise and looks toward the future of Claire’s practice. After refining the questions, we proceeded to organise a day to film, which will be on the 16th September. Hopefully if all goes well we will both have an artist portrait that lives up to our expectations. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

As I mentioned in my previous post on Sacré-Coeur, one of the other places I didn’t get a chance to see when I was in Paris last summer was the catacombs so I wanted to be sure to fit in a visit this time around. Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€.

Please answer the following question: This article: By the time Etty exhibited Musidora, the theme was becoming something of a cliche, such that by 1850 it was described by The Literary Gazette as \\"a favourite subject for a dip of the brush\\". As interest in studies of Musidora waned, its role as a pretext for nude paintings by English artists was replaced by Lady Godiva, who had become a topic of increased interest owing to Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem Godiva. After the death of William Wordsworth in 1850, James Thomson ceased to be a major influence on writers. From the 1870s his popularity with readers waned, and by the end of the 20th century his works other than Rule, Britannia! were little known.When Etty died in 1849, despite having worked and exhibited until his death, he was still regarded by many as a pornographer. Charles Robert Leslie observed shortly after Etty's death that \\"[Etty] himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\\". Interest in him declined as new movements came to characterise painting in Britain, and by the end of the 19th century the value of his paintings had fallen. It is likely that the composition and style of John Everett Millais's controversial The Knight Errant was influenced by Musidora, but other than Millais, and Etty's admirer and imitator William Edward Frost, few other artists were directly influenced by Etty's work. In 1882 Vanity Fair commented on Musidora that \\"I know only too well how the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather. I have seen the gangs of workmen strolling round, and I know that their artistic interest in studies of the nude is emphatically embarrassing.\\" By the early 20th century Victorian styles of art and literature fell dramatically out of fashion in Britain, and by 1915 the word \\"Victorian\\" had become a derogatory term. Frederick Mentone's The Human Form in Art (1944) was one of the few 20th-century academic works to favourably view Musidora. contains an answer for the question: What work was a pretext for nude paintings by English artists?, what is it ?

Although both the IRS and the SSA are government agencies, they have different functions, and studies conducted on them do not necessarily overlap. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is the revenue service for the United States federal government responsible for collecting taxes and administering the Internal Revenue Code, which is the primary body of federal statutory tax law. The IRS has various regional offices throughout the United States, providing services and enforcing tax laws. On the other hand, the Social Security Administration (SSA) is the government agency responsible for administering social security benefits, including retirement, survivors, and disability benefits. It also plays a significant role in the administration of the federal government's health insurance programs, such as Medicare. The given example of the GGD study indicates an efficient combination of careful specification of the purpose and matching it with appropriate site selection, concentrating on the SSA's regional operations. This would suggest that the GGD study was well-planned and targeted to achieve its desired objectives. However, this does not provide enough information to draw a conclusion about the focus of the IRS study or if it was even related to the SSA study. It is possible that the IRS study has a different scope, purpose, or area of focus within or outside the context of the SSA.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). I am facing a new situation today: Two sister cities were both situated on plate boundaries, close to volcanoes, on different continents. Red city was 10 miles from a volcano, while Tree city was 60 miles away. Red city experienced many earthquakes, Tree city few and far between. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which city experienced more convection within the Earth causing the plates to move? A:","completion":"A: Based on the information provided in the background article and the given situation, it is not possible to definitively determine which city experienced more convection within the Earth causing the plates to move. However, we can analyze and compare the factors that could potentially influence convection and plate movement experienced by the two cities. It is important to understand that all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries and are a result of the stresses that build up due to convection within the Earth, causing the plates to move. In the case of the two sister cities, Red city and Tree city, both are situated on plate boundaries, and therefore, are susceptible to earthquakes. As Red city is closer to a volcano (10 miles away) compared to Tree city (60 miles away), it may suggest that Red city is closer to an active subduction zone or a divergent boundary, where significant convection currents may cause the plate movement, leading to more earthquakes. The closer proximity to a volcano could also indicate that the subduction process or the upwelling of magma from below is more intense in Red city's location, which would result in greater tectonic activity and more earthquakes. On the other hand, Tree city experiences fewer earthquakes, which could imply that the convection currents and plate movement in its location are relatively more moderate. This is not to say that Tree city doesn't experience any tectonic activity, but rather, the intensity may be lower as compared to Red city's location. However, it is essential to acknowledge that there are numerous factors at play when determining the occurrence and frequency of earthquakes. The types of rocks, the overall geological setting, fault zones, and the history of seismic activity in the surrounding area all play a vital role. As such, even though we can infer possible correlations between the proximity to volcanoes and tectonic activity based on the given information, it does not provide a direct conclusion about which city experienced more convection within the Earth causing the plates to move. In summary, while we cannot directly answer which city experienced more convection causing plates to move, we can infer that Red city experiences more earthquakes, possibly due to its closer proximity to a volcano, and thus might be subject to stronger convection currents and more plate movement. However, this estimation is not definitive without considering other geophysical factors and analyzing the detailed geological setup of each location."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Get friends involved. Stalk him (just a little). Drop hints. Ask him out. Article:","completion":"Title: How to Let That Special Someone Know You're Interested in Them: A Comprehensive Guide Introduction At some point in your life, you're bound to have a crush on someone - the butterflies in your stomach, the daydreaming, and the eye contact that seems to linger just a little too long. But what do you do when you're ready to take it to the next level and let them know you're interested? This article lays out a comprehensive guide on how to effectively and appropriately let that special someone know you're interested in them. We'll cover everything from communication cues to getting friends involved and even stalking (but just a little). So, buckle up, put on your best smile, and let's dive right in. 1. Let Him Know You're Available The first step in letting someone know you're interested in them is making sure they're aware that you're available. If you're currently seeing someone or have a strong commitment to another person, it's important to remain honest and open about your status. However, if you're single, it's important to ensure the person you're interested in knows this as well. This can be done through casual conversation, or even by dropping subtle hints when talking about your weekend plans or personal life. 2. Send Clear Signals Communication is key in any relationship, and it's especially important when trying to convey your interest. Instead of being passive or hoping they'll pick up on your vibes, be bold by sending clear signals. This can include making an extra effort to laugh at their jokes, maintaining eye contact, or finding ways to touch their arm or shoulder lightly during conversation. Remember that your body language speaks volumes, so pay attention to maintaining open and relaxed body posture. 3. Invite Him to Join You One of the easiest ways to let someone know you're interested is by inviting them to join you in a group or casual setting. This could be anything from asking them to join you at a coffee shop, inviting them to a party, or suggesting they join you at a sports game. Keep the atmosphere relaxed and pressure-free to allow them to feel comfortable and make a connection. 4. Get Friends Involved If you're not comfortable or confident enough to approach your crush on your own, you can always enlist the help of your trusted friends. Let your friends know about your feelings and ask them to help create opportunities for you to engage with your crush. They can casually invite both you and your love interest to a gathering or an event where you can exchange conversations and get to know each other better. 5. Stalk Him (Just a Little) We're not condoning obsessive behavior here, but doing a little bit of social media research on the person you're interested in can help you gain valuable insight into their likes, dislikes, and hobbies. This will give you excellent conversation starters and help you find common ground, allowing you to relate to them on a deeper level. However, be cautious not to reveal too much knowledge of their profile during conversations, as this may come across as intrusive and creepy. 6. Drop Hints If you've gotten to know your crush better, it's time to become a bit more forward about your intentions. You can start dropping hints about your feelings by casually mentioning that you think they're attractive, or by giving them compliments on their skills or achievements. You could also find more playful ways to engage with them, such as light teasing or joking banter, which can help create a sense of closeness and rapport. 7. Ask Him Out Finally, if you've tried all the above strategies and you're still unsure whether your crush is aware of your feelings, it's time to make a bold move and ask them out. You can simply ask them if they'd like to go out for a drink, dinner, or another date-worthy activity. Be confident and assertive in your approach, and remember that the worst thing that can happen is that they'll say no. Even in this scenario, at least you'll have the satisfaction of knowing that you tried and put yourself out there. Conclusion All in all, letting someone know you're interested in them does not have to be an intimidating or complex endeavor. Simply follow the steps outlined above, adapt them based on your comfort levels and individual situation, and remember to remain genuine, patient, and respectful of the other person's feelings. By doing so, you'll increase your chances of success and may just find yourself in the company of that special someone you've had your eye on."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Article: The passport photographs of the future could turn out to be more than just another pretty picture if a new computer technique developed by Israeli scientists catches on. Researchers at Ben-Gurion University, in Israel, have invented a way to hide information such as a fingerprint or signature in color images. They believe this could improve passport safety or be used to produce product bar codes or designs that cannot be seen. \\"The papers can be faxed, scanned and reprinted without hidden data disappearing,\\" New Scientist magazine said last week. Joseph Rosen and a team of scientists worked out the new instrument by creating a mathematical model. The model turns a fingerprint or signature into a series of numbers which are used to shape the dots that make up a color picture. \\"Each dot can be forced out of the usual place slightly without noticeably changing the final appearance of the image,\\" the magazine said. Several images that can be hidden in a single picture are scanned into a computer which does the work. The hidden images or fingerprints cannot be shown until the picture is scanned again. The computer rebuilds the fingerprint by measuring the displacement of the dots in the picture. The magazine said that if he model is used for passport checkpoints the picture can be unscrambled to show the fingerprint or signature and checked against the person holding the passport. The researchers are now working on a handheld, and instrument which could make unscrambling the hidden information easier. Question: The new passport photos will probably contain all EXCEPT _ .

Chris was working fine with the computer but was maladaptive to the tablet because the OPTIONS: + computer was easy to use.; + tablet was easy to use.;","completion":"Chris had always been well-acquainted with using a computer, finding it easy to navigate through various programs and applications. From browsing the internet to working on an important presentation, Chris was confident in his computer skills. However, things took a turn when he was introduced to a tablet. While many people believed that tablets were easy to use, like the second storyline suggests, Chris found it challenging to adapt to this new device. The touch interface and the change in screen size were simply too different from his computer experience, leading him to be maladaptive to this new technology. There was a lot to learn, and Chris felt overwhelmed by it all. In his struggle to adapt to the tablet, Chris started researching articles and blog posts to better understand its functionalities. He even went as far as watching YouTube tutorials in an attempt to build his confidence and get used to the entirely new interface. One significant drawback he experienced with using the tablet was the touch-based keyboard, which made typing much more challenging for him. Unlike the tactile feedback on a computer, he struggled to type accurately, and it took longer for him to produce any written content. Chris also found it difficult to navigate between applications on the tablet. He missed the convenience of having multiple windows open simultaneously, which enabled him to work on several tasks at once. The tablet demanded a more linear approach, causing him to feel less productive and efficient with his work. At the same time, Chris realized that the tablet had its advantages. It was portable and lightweight, allowing him to work from practically anywhere. The battery life was also considerably better than that of his laptop. He noticed that more and more people were opting for tablets, especially for on-the-go work or entertainment. Their user-friendly interface made them approachable and accessible to a broad range of people, including those new to technology. Determined to overcome the challenges, Chris started by practicing his typing skills on the tablet, opting for a Bluetooth keyboard to replicate a more familiar computer keyboard experience. He also made an effort to explore different applications and learned how to use cloud-based storage to ensure seamless file synchronization between his computer and his tablet. With time, Chris saw considerable improvements in his ability to use the tablet for various tasks. He actively sought advice and recommendations from friends and colleagues who were proficient tablet users and even joined online forums for tips and tricks to maximize his device's potential. He slowly started to appreciate the convenience and versatility that tablets had to offer. In the end, Chris managed to find a comfortable balance between using both his computer and tablet for different tasks. He continued using his computer for tasks that required more extensive keyboard input, while the tablet became his go-to device for meetings and remote work situations. Chris had learned that both technologies had their unique benefits, and mastering both was the key to staying productive in an ever-advancing technological world. So, the story that continues from Chris's situation is that although the computer was comfortable and easy for him to use, he faced challenges adapting to the tablet initially. However, his persistence in learning and adapting to the new device eventually led to becoming proficient and productive, tailoring each technology to his unique needs. The story demonstrates that with patience, effort, and determination, anyone can overcome obstacles to adapt to new technologies."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. As academic work is becoming arguably more precarious and competitive, shorter contracts are becoming the norm, and the number of people completing PhDs in the UK is increasing, the risks associated with researching academia are high. This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women’s lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher. My PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) – a weighty force in UK academia – the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda. There is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world. Before embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants. Reflection is and was an important element in the research process for me, as it allowed me to reflect on the effects of the self on the research process and, ultimately, also on the data, as well as the various power dynamics discernible during interviews for my study.

The duration of a PhD program varies depending on the field of study, specific program requirements, and the progress of individual students. However, in the UK, a PhD typically takes around three to four years for full-time students and up to six years for part-time students to complete. This time frame includes the research, writing, and submission of the thesis or dissertation. Please note that this is a general estimate, and actual completion times may vary depending on various factors such as personal circumstances, funding, and the complexity of the research project.

With 43 full-time drivers on NASCAR's elite Sprint Cup circuit and 36 races each season, it means lot of traveling across the country every year. So in order to avoid constantly checking in-and-out of confined, expensive hotel rooms, many of the drivers have invested in a 'home away from home' on wheels. They can also park them at the speedway. 'This is where you spend all your weekends,' Darrell Waltrip , a NASCAR Hall of Fame driver, told The Orlando Sentinel. The motor homes cost anywhere from 1.2 million to more than 2 million. Scroll down for video. Sleek: Many of the RV's are custom-built to tailor to the needs of the drivers and their families, who usually travel with them to competitions. here are 43 full-time NASCAR drivers and 36 races each season all over the country. 'It's our home away from home': NASCAR Hall of Fame driver Darren Waltrip is one of many race men scooping up elaborate motor homes. He has been using motor homes since the 1980s, and recalls the days when he would park in among the fans. Modern: The motor homes come equipped with state-of-the-art, luxury features, such as motel-style beds and temperature settings. The only problem can be the noise, since they are parked so close to the speedways where NASCAR stage their races. Impressive: The kitchens allow the drivers and their families to self-cater and not rely on restaurants while on the road, including elaborate fridges, freezes and other cooking appliances. Being able to cook eliminates having to rely on restaurants for the drivers and their families. Essentials: Even the bathrooms come with quality finishings, such as luxury showers with marble tiling and even a step. Some showers are a little more rudimentary than others, and like other motor homes are held up above the toilet. Comfortable: Usually the NASCAR stars hire a driver, who ferries the motor coaches around the country, or will captain the vehicle themselves. The drivers and their families are then able to fly ahead and meet the motor coach, rather than spend so much time on the road. Decadent: The RV's are built as 'homes away from home'. Seen here is an office-style study with a leather armchair. NASCAR drivers earn a salary of between 1 million to 20 million, not including endorsement deals. Relaxing: There are 36 races a season, meaning the driver's use the motor homes frequently, parking outside the speedways. A good couch is essential after a long day in a race car. State-of-the-art: The company that produces many of the motor homes, Featherlite Coaches, describes the finish as 'yacht-like'. They hail themselves the 'official NASCAR provider' when it comes to motor coaches. Classy: The RV's are built to be 'houses on wheels' and come complete with living rooms and even studies, like the one seen here. Luxury: The motor homes cost anywhere from 1.2 million to more than 2 million. Pre-owned vehicles start at around 200,000. Seen here is a smaller model, however fitted with the same luxury inclination, with white leather seats. Family-oriented: Older, pre-owned models sell for between 200,000 and 800,000. Seen here is a diner-style booth for meals and for sitting while traveling between races. Chauffeur: The NASCAR star's usually hire drivers to captain the vehicles so they can relax, fastening into comfortable chairs like these. Important: The motor homes are completely self-contained, built to be on the road for long periods. Some showers are less elaborate, like this one. Self-catered: The kitchens resemble those of a modest apartment, with finer details. This particular home has a Las Vegas-like hotel theme. Older, pre-owned models sell for between 200,000 and 800,000. A NASCAR driver, generally, earns a yearly salary between 1 million and 20 million, not including endorsements. The motor homes are often custom-built to suit the requests of the driver's and their families, who usually travel with them, including features like baby rooms, plush carpeting and proper kitchens. 'During the season, I probably spend at least three days a week in my motor home,' NASCAR icon Richard Petty told The Sentinel. 'So it's not only my home away from home, it's my home.' Typically, the NASCAR drivers hire motor home drivers to ferry the RV's across the the country, while they fly ahead. A company called Fetherlite Coaches, which is based in Suffolk, Virginia, cater to many of the NASCAR drivers. On their website they describe the finishings of the motor coaches as 'yacht-like'. They can feature up to four sliding rooms. Veteran: Driver Richard Petty (left) has been living in motor homes since the 1980s, starting with a simple caravan-style, and now upgrades every few years. He is seen here in 2002. At-home: The coaches are usually parked outside the speedways where the drivers will be racing, in what they call 'motor home row' Child-friendly: Bunk beds are fairly standard sleeping arrangements, outside the master suite, with many having at least three. Driver David Ragan (right) owns a similar motor coach to the one seen here, which he travels in with his family. Novelty: The motor homes usually provide for space for children to play than a hotel room. It's not unusual for adults to sleep in the bunks, too. Practical: The kitchens could easily be mistaken for something from a regular apartment, with stove, fridge, microwave, oven and sizable sink. Spacious: The larger-sized motor homes can cost up to 2 million, but eradicate expensive hotels and flights. The master suites are quite spacious. Amenities: The motor coaches can fit even a large family of five, although typically only feature one bathroom to share. Beautiful: The newer motor homes have plenty of space and stunning finishings. Seen here is a model-style sink in the bathroom. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"NASCAR drivers have to travel a lot for their races, so instead of staying in small hotel rooms, they buy big, fancy motor homes to live in during race weekends. These motor homes cost between 1.2 million and 2 million and have special features, like baby rooms and nice kitchens, to make them feel like a real home. The drivers usually hire someone to drive the motor home to the race while they fly there. These big motor homes are like a house on wheels and can be a more comfortable place to stay for the drivers and their families."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:Information: - A persona (plural personae or personas), in the word's everyday usage, is a social role or a character played by an actor. The word is derived from Latin, where it originally referred to a theatrical mask. The Latin word probably derived from the Etruscan word \\"phersu\\", with the same meaning, and that from the Greek (\\"prospon\\"). Its meaning in the latter Roman period changed to indicate a \\"character\\" of a theatrical performance or court of law, when it became apparent that different individuals could assume the same role, and legal attributes such as rights, powers, and duties followed the role. The same individuals as actors could play different roles, each with its own legal attributes, sometimes even in the same court appearance. According to other sources, which also admit that the origin of the term is not completely clear, \\"persona\\" could possibly be related to the Latin verb \\"per-sonare\\", literally: \\"sounding through\\", with an obvious link to the above-mentioned theatrical mask. - Paul Daniel \\"Ace\\" Frehley (born April 27, 1951) is an American musician, singer and songwriter best known as the former lead guitarist and founding member of the rock band Kiss. He invented the persona of the \\"Spaceman\\" or \\"Space Ace\\" and played with the group from its inception in 1973 until his departure in 1982. After leaving Kiss, Frehley embarked on a solo career, which was put on hold when he rejoined Kiss in 1996 for a highly successful reunion tour. - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards. - Casablanca Records is an American recording label owned by Universal Music Group and operated under Republic Records. The label became most successful as a disco label in the 1970s and currently operates as an Electronic dance music label under the direction of Tommy Mottola. - Love Gun is the sixth studio album by American hard rock band Kiss, released on June 30, 1977 by Casablanca Records. The album was remastered in 1997. It is notable for being their first album to feature a lead vocal performance from Ace Frehley, making it the first Kiss album to feature lead vocal performances from all four band members. It was also the last studio album to feature Peter Criss on every song, as he was replaced by session drummer Anton Fig for all but one song on 1979's \\"Dynasty\\". \\"Love Gun\\" was certified platinum on June 30, 1977. - Anton Fig (born 8 August 1952 in Cape Town, South Africa), known as \\"The Thunder from Down Under\\", is a South African/American session drummer, noted for his work in David Letterman's house band, the CBS Orchestra. Letterman often refers to Fig as \\"Anton Zip\\" or \\"Buddy Rich Jr.\\" - \`\` Shock Me '' is a song by American hard rock band Kiss on their 1977 album Love Gun .

Normally, only traces of protein are found in urine, and when higher amounts are found, damage to the glomeruli is the likely basis. Unusually large quantities of urine may point to diseases like diabetes mellitus or hypothalamic tumors that cause diabetes insipidus. The color of urine is determined mostly by the breakdown products of red blood cell destruction (Figure 25.2). The “heme” of hemoglobin is converted by the liver into water-soluble forms that can be excreted into the bile and indirectly into the urine. This yellow pigment is urochrome. Urine color may also be affected by certain foods like beets, berries, and fava beans. A kidney stone or a cancer of the urinary system may produce sufficient bleeding to manifest as pink or even bright red urine. Diseases of the liver or obstructions of bile drainage from the liver impart a dark “tea” or “cola” hue to the urine. Dehydration produces darker, concentrated urine that may also possess the slight odor of ammonia. Most of the ammonia produced from protein breakdown is converted into urea by the liver, so ammonia is rarely detected in fresh urine. The strong ammonia odor you may detect in bathrooms or alleys is due to the breakdown of urea into ammonia by bacteria in the environment. About one in five people detect a distinctive odor in their urine after consuming asparagus; other foods such as onions, garlic, and fish can impart their own aromas! These food-caused odors are harmless. Q: Normally, only traces of protein are found in urine, and when higher amounts are found, damage to what is the likely cause?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How to search for a location on Google Maps","completion":"Both of the following solutions will allow you to effectively search for a location on Google Maps, but one method might be more comfortable or convenient for you depending on your personal preferences and your device. Here is a detailed explanation of each method: Solution 1: Using the Google Maps website or app 1. Open the Google Maps website or mobile app: - For desktop, open your preferred web browser and navigate to https://www.google.com/maps - For mobile devices, download the Google Maps app from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, then launch the app. 2. In the search field at the top of the page or app, type the name or address of the location you are searching for. You can search for specific addresses, landmarks, businesses, or even general areas. 3. As you type, the search bar will display a drop-down list with suggestions. Navigate through the suggested options, and click or tap on the desired result. 4. Google Maps will then display the location on the map. You can zoom in or out and move around the map for a closer look. To get more information about the location, such as contact info, directions, street view, and reviews, click or tap on the name or icon of the location displayed on the map. 5. If you’d like directions to the location, click or tap on “Directions” (on the website) or the “Directions” icon (in the app).

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) Question: What is the author's profession? Options: A. not enough information B. Doctor. C. Journalist. D. Pharmacist.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. The perfect trip: The Seychelles Splendidly isolated in mid-ocean between Africa and India, the Seychelles are perfect island-hopping territory; hop aboard a local ferry to access rainforest walks, gin-clear waters ripe for snorkelling, and some of the world’s oldest animals. Mahé: Best for walking Spears of sunlight slice through the forest canopy as Terence Belle tramps into the jungled heart of Mahé, the largest and most mountainous of the hundred-odd islands that make up the Seychelles. He picks his way along the overgrown trail, hacking through ferns and palm fronds, stopping only to squeeze past a granite boulder or step across a brook. Overhead, unseen birds screech and hoot among the treetops, and palm leaves rattle like paper in the breeze. ‘I haven’t walked this trail for six months,’ explains Terence, who runs botanical walks around the island. ‘And in that time the forest has already changed so much. Everything grows so fast that if we don’t walk the trails regularly, before too long we can’t find them again!’ He steps off the path into a thicket of bamboo stalks as thick as drainpipes. ‘This bamboo is only a few years old,’ he says laughing. ‘And look at the size of it! I think if you just stood still and waited, you could almost see it grow.’ A spine of craggy granite peaks runs along the centre of Mahé, crossed by a network of trails tramped by generations of Mahélois. Some are packhorse routes that date back to the days of the early settlers. Others were cut by spice traders during the 17th and 18th centuries, who planted tea, cinnamon, cloves and ginger, long since abandoned and now growing wild on the hillsides. Mahé’s trails open up the island’s secret corners. While much of the coast has been cleared for agriculture, at higher altitudes large tracts of virgin rainforest survive. Here, geckos and skinks dart through the foliage, and pitcher plants dangle among moss-covered palms. Some of the islands’ most endangered flora and fauna is found here, including the Gardiner’s Seychelles frog, tinier than a human fingernail, and the fabulously rare jellyfish tree, which gets its name from its starfish-like flowers. ‘Most people never explore beyond the beaches,’ says Terence, as the trail emerges onto a plateau overlooking the misty summit of Morne Seychellois, the island’s highest mountain. ‘But it’s in the forest where you find the greatest treasures. You just have to know where to look.’ As he begins the tramp back down the trail, and is soon swallowed up by the jungle, the holler of bulbul birds booms from the treeline, and white clouds spill over Mahé’s jagged peaks. Ste-Anne Marine Park: Best for island-hopping A skein of spray arcs over the boat’s prow as it sculls across the waves, heading for a chain of islands framed against the afternoon sky. Beneath the keel, the water flashes through a kaleidoscope of ocean colours: lime-greens, aquamarines, cobalts, china-blues. Sometimes it’s like peering through frosted glass; at others, it’s as pure as crystal. As he nears one of the islands, captain Eric Lafortune cuts the motor and lets the boat drift on the swell, allowing his cargo of snorkellers to slip into the water without the faintest trace of a splash. Situated just off Mahé’s northeast coast, the Ste-Anne Marine Park encompasses six islands spread across five square miles of the Indian Ocean. In previous centuries these islands were home to just a few scattered residents – as well as a leper colony and a prison – but since 1973 the underwater habitat around them has been protected as a marine reserve. Each island has its own topography: Ile Cachée and Round Island are little more than specks of scrubby land peeping out above the ocean, while Long Island and Ste-Anne Island are jungled and hilly. They are divided by channels filled with coral banks and meadows of sea-grass, providing the perfect habitat for all kinds of underwater life: spiny sea urchins, striped sergeant majors and shiny parrotfish.

Beijing (CNN) -- A Chinese journalist, whose work exposed alleged human rights abuses of the government, has been detained by secret police in Beijing, said a close friend and human rights groups. Du Bin released a feature-length documentary on the notorious Masanjia labor camp in May. He vanished later that month, says Hu Jia, an activist and friend of Du. Hu says the last time Du's friends heard from him was 10 p.m. on May 31. Friends went to his apartment to look for him the next day but no one answered the door. Hu says family members found two copies of an unsigned police subpoena at Du's residence in Beijing.","completion":"The situation surrounding Du's disappearance has raised concerns among international human rights organizations, prompting them to demand answers from the Chinese government. Investigations into the matter revealed that Du's detention is likely a direct result of his work exposing the human rights abuses occurring within the Masanjia labor camp, which has long been criticized for its harsh conditions, forced labor, and physical abuse of detainees. The unsigned police subpoena found at Du's residence is viewed as further evidence of the government's efforts to silence critical voices. As international pressure mounts, the Chinese government initially remained tight-lipped on Du's whereabouts, neither confirming nor denying his detention. This silence led to growing protests both within and outside China, with journalists and human rights activists demanding transparency and the immediate release of Du Bin. In response to this increasing pressure, the Chinese government eventually acknowledged Du's detention, stating that he had been charged with \\"disseminating state secrets and endangering national security.\\" Rights groups and Du's friends, however, continue to denounce these charges as baseless and politically motivated. The case of Du Bin highlights the broader issue of deteriorating press freedoms and human rights under authoritarian regimes. Despite the Chinese government's claims that they have been actively working to improve the country's human rights conditions, Du's detention clearly paints a different picture. With strict censorship laws and a crackdown on dissent, journalists like Du face a continuous struggle in their pursuit of truth and justice. Amid global outcry and ongoing efforts from human rights organizations, Du Bin's legal team works tirelessly to secure his release. Ultimately, after serving a lengthy prison sentence, Du is finally freed, though his career and reputation have been significantly tarnished under the shadow of his ordeal. Upon his release, Du remains resolute in his work for human rights in China and continues to advocate for press freedom, despite the risks posed to his own safety. Du's story serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of a free press and the need to protect human rights activists around the world. The tenacity of individuals like Du Bin and those who support them ensures that the fight for truth and justice continues in the face of adversity and authoritarian restrictions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Skunk Anansie are a British rock band whose members include Skin (lead vocals, guitar), Cass (guitar, bass, backing vocals), Ace (guitar, backing vocals) and Mark Richardson (drums and percussion). Skunk Anansie formed on 12 February 1994, disbanded in 2001 and reformed in 2009. The name \\"Skunk Anansie\\" is taken from Akann folk tales of Anansi the spider-man of Ghana, with \\"Skunk\\" added to \\"make the name nastier\\". They have released six studio albums: Paranoid & Sunburnt (1995), Stoosh (1996), Post Orgasmic Chill (1999), Wonderlustre (2010), Black Traffic (2012) and Anarchytecture (2016); one compilation album, Smashes and Trashes (2009); and several hit singles, including \\"Charity\\", \\"Hedonism\\", \\"Selling Jesus\\" and \\"Weak\\". Mark Richardson confirmed reports that the band was reforming in an interview with Drummer Magazine (November 2008 issue), and said that the band planned to release a \\"best of\\" compilation as well as new material. Ace later set up an official page for the band on MySpace. On 2 and 3 April 2009, two shows took place at the Monto Water Rats (the former venue of the Splash Club) in London, under the alias SCAM (Skin, Cass, Ace, Mark) and sold out in 20 minutes. The band began their \\"Greatest Hits\\" tour on Friday, 9 October 2009 at the Ancienne Belgique in Brussels, with other dates across Europe. It was their first actual tour in eight years. A \\"greatest hits\\" album, Smashes and Trashes, was released 2 November 2009. It is a 15-track career-embracing album and includes three brand new tracks: \\"Because of You\\", \\"Tear the Place Up\\" and \\"Squander\\". A best-of remixes companion album was also released digitally. On 3 July 2009, the music video for \\"Tear the Place Up\\" was presented exclusively on MySpace, before on 10 August 2009, a new video for \\"Because of You\\" was presented exclusively on Kerrang.com. It was released 14 September 2009 in the UK and was the first single to be released from Smashes and Trashes. The single was a top 10 hit in Italy, before its follow-up \\"Squander\\" was a top 75 success in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium. Their fifth album Wonderlustre was released internationally on 13 September 2010, preceded by the first single \\"My Ugly Boy\\", which was released in the UK on 16 August 2010 and in Europe July/August. The video for \\"My Ugly Boy\\" was presented exclusively on Kerrang.com on 23 July 2010. Wonderlustre reached number one on the Italian albums chart on 1 October 2010 and placed in the top 10 in charts all over Europe including in Germany, the Netherlands, France and Poland. In May 2010 they were a supporting act for Rammstein, during two concerts in Berlin. The second single from Wonderlustre, \\"Over the Love\\" was released internationally in November 2010.

By 1912, his future Antarctic plans depended on the results of Scott's Terra Nova Expedition, which had left Cardiff in July 1910, and on the concurrent Norwegian expedition led by Roald Amundsen. The news of Amundsen's conquest of the South Pole reached Shackleton on 11 March 1912, to which he responded: \\"The discovery of the South Pole will not be the end of Antarctic exploration\\". The next work, he said, would be \\"a transcontinental journey from sea to sea, crossing the pole\\". He was aware that others were in the field pursuing this objective. On 11 December 1911, a German expedition under Wilhelm Filchner had sailed from South Georgia, intending to penetrate deep into the Weddell Sea and establishing a base from which he would cross the continent to the Ross Sea. In late 1912 Filchner returned to South Georgia, having failed to land and set up his base. However, his reports of possible landing sites in Vahsel Bay, at around 78° latitude, were noted by Shackleton, and incorporated into his developing expedition plans.News of the deaths of Captain Scott and his companions on their return from the South Pole reached London in February 1913. Against this gloomy background Shackleton initiated preparations for his proposed journey. He solicited financial and practical support from, among others, Tryggve Gran of Scott's expedition, and the former Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, but received no help from either. Gran was evasive, and Rosebery blunt: \\"I have never been able to care one farthing about the Poles\\".Shackleton got support, however, from William Speirs Bruce, leader of the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of 1902–1904, who had harboured plans for an Antarctic crossing since 1908, but had abandoned the project for lack of funds.

For example, they could give a detailed explanation about what they liked or disliked, how it met their expectation, its functionality, design, and usability, or how valuable it was compared to its cost, etc. A star rating is a visual representation of a user's satisfaction with a product or service. The amount of stars given can vary, but most commonly, a five-star scale is used, with one star being the lowest rating and five stars being the highest. However, the statement \\"Free dating apps 51single\\" merely states a fact without providing any opinion, experience, or evaluation. It notes that the app related to dating is free and may be directed towards individuals that are 51 years old and single. Therefore, without additional information about the user's experience, such as whether they found the service helpful, easy to use, met their expectations, among other variables that would typically inform a rating, it's impossible to assign a star rating based on the text \\"Free dating apps 51single\\". It would be beneficial to have more comprehensive feedback to provide a rating accurately. For instance, the user could share information about the dating app's functionality, its user interface, the quality of its matches, its customer service, or its overall value, among other aspects. Then we could fairly determine a star-based rating."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Information: - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history. - Gregory III Laham (born Lutfy Laham, December 15, 1933, in Darayya, Syria), Patriarch of Antioch and All the East, and Alexandria and Jerusalem, is the spiritual leader of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, elected on November 29, 2000, succeeding Patriarch Maximos V Hakim. - Athanasius IV Ignace Michael Jawhar ( or Jahouar or Jauhar or Giohar , 1733 -- 1794 ) was Patriarch of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church from 1788 to 1794 . He previously claimed to be patriarch from 1759 to 1764 and from 1765 to 1768 . - Antioch on the Orontes (also Syrian Antioch) was an ancient Greco-Roman city on the eastern side of the Orontes River. Its ruins lie near the modern city of Antakya, Turkey, and lends the modern city its name. - Syria, officially known as the Syrian Arab Republic (\\"\\"), is a country in Western Asia, bordering Lebanon and the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east, Jordan to the south, and Israel to the southwest. Syria's capital and largest city is Damascus. - The Melkite (Greek) Catholic Church (\\"\\") is an Eastern Catholic Church in full communion with the Holy See as part of the worldwide Catholic Church. The Melkites, Byzantine Rite Catholics of mixed Eastern Mediterranean (Levantine) and Greek origin, trace their history to the early Christians of Antioch, formerly part of Syria and now in Turkey, of the 1st century AD, where Christianity was introduced by Saint Peter. It is headed by \\"His Beatitude\\" Patriarch Gregory III Laham. - The Holy See is the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Catholic Church in Rome, the episcopal see of the Pope, and an independent sovereign entity. It serves as the central point of reference for the Catholic Church everywhere and the focal point of communion due to its position as the pre-eminent episcopal see of the universal church. It traces its origin to the 1st century during the apostolic era, when Saint Peter arrived in Rome to evangelise and formed a significant early Christian community of believers there. Today, it is responsible for the governance of all Catholics, organised in their Particular Churches, Patriarchates and religious institutes. - The Levant (Arabic: \\"\\") is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean. In its widest historical sense, the Levant included all of the eastern Mediterranean with its islands, that is, it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores, extending from Greece to Cyrenaica. The term \\"Levant\\" entered English in the late 15th century from French. It derives from the Italian \\"Levante\\", meaning \\"rising\\", implying the rising of the sun in the east. As such, it is broadly equivalent to the Arabic term \\"Mashriq\\", meaning \\"the land where the sun rises\\".

Write a title for this article: New York Times reporters are investigating the devastating fire that killed 36 people this month at a warehouse called the Ghost Ship in Oakland, Calif. We’re also doing something new: providing regular updates on our findings. Do you have information, advice or feedback? Send an email to oaklandfire@nytimes.com. The first update can be found here. The second is here. As reporters from The Times’s graphics department, we wanted to visualize what had happened and give readers a sense of the space where the disaster unfolded. To do this, we began to recreate a 3D model of the interior of the warehouse. One of the key things we discovered was that concertgoers trying to escape the deadly fire had to negotiate a narrow, makeshift staircase, and then a circuitous path through a jumble of furniture and found objects. Below are just a few of the factors we found that contributed to making the inferno one of the worst structure fires in the United States in over a decade. 1 The performance space was often used by underground musicians. On the night of the disaster, a crowd was attending an electronic music performance. 2 Survivors told of a sudden onslaught of smoke and heat, and a dash to the narrow staircase that opened off to the dance floor. 3 Derick Ion Almena, the leaseholder of the Ghost Ship, who rented space to others, lived in this area with his wife and three children. They were at a hotel the night of the fire. Steel roof trusses were covered with wood sheathing. Door to restroom in building next door. Steel roof trusses were covered with wood sheathing.

It would have put survivors far from an exit. 6 Ms. Brito’s loft, near where she said she saw the fire start. Investigators said the fire began in the back of the building.

A critical issue to us was why more people didn’t get out. Omar Vega, the proprietor of the automobile shop next door, told us that the front stairway had actually been built by the residents. That space was once occupied by a conveyor belt when the building was used as a warehouse. 7 The front stairway exited into an open space, a kind of living room in the communal interior of the warehouse, with no direct route to the front door. 8 The path to the front door led around three pianos, requiring two left turns and a right turn to the street and safety. 9 Survivors reported confusion as they crawled along the floor to escape choking smoke, searching for the front door. Some said they had been saved by someone who kept shouting the exit location from the door. 7 The front stairway exited into an open space, a kind of living room in the communal interior of the warehouse, with no direct route to the front door. 8 The path to the front door led around three pianos, requiring two left turns and a right turn to the street and safety. 9 Survivors reported confusion as they crawled along the floor to escape choking smoke, searching for the front door. Some said they had been saved by someone who kept shouting the exit location from the door. A website contained numerous photos of the cluttered interior of the Ghost Ship before it burned. We needed a guide to help us sort through them, and we reached out to Ms. Brito and Nikki Kelber, both of whom had lived there. They described the ornate, bohemian interior in the pictures and gave us a clear idea of the layout. The stage had musical instruments, amplifiers and a screen, seen on the left, for electronic shows. The green louvered doors in the center led to the back staircase, and to a hole in the wall that gave access to a bathroom in the building next door. The route from the stairway to safety was a maze. “I got lost there the first time I went in,” Ms. Brito said. This photo shows part of the route from the stairs to the front door, which is to the left of where the photographer is standing. A Garuda statue faces the entrance. Ms. Brito, 28, lived in a space in the southwest corner of the first floor. From her bed at the top left corner of this photo, she could see a floor-to-ceiling fire near the white door. She ran to safety. On Friday, she went through the building and said her loft was still largely intact. The building had few real interior walls, but working and sleeping lofts were partitioned using window sashes, pallets and furniture that one visitor had called a “tinderbox.” Organs and pianos were scattered around the warehouse. This area was on the second floor, off the performance space. The stairs were just to the right, out of the frame. Ms. Brito emphasized how difficult it would have been for anyone who didn’t know the place to find the exit in the best of circumstances. And survivors who told their stories to reporters described difficulty on the twisting route to the stairs, down them and then out. We’re still looking for survivors’ stories of their trail to safety, and who they lost on the way.","completion":"Title: \\"Inside the Ghost Ship: Tracing the Maze of a Deadly Fire in Oakland Warehouse\\""},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

You might find a tear-jerking tragedy is just the thing you need to brighten your day. A team of researchers at Ohio State University, US, has found sad movies can make people happier, Science Daily reported last month. Many people find tragedies make them realize how good their own lives are, the study showed. \\"People seem to use tragedies as a way to reflect on the important relationships in their own lives,\\" said Silvia Knobloch-Westerwick, leader of the study. \\"Tragic stories often focus on themes of eternal love, and this leads viewers to think about their loved ones and count their good and helpful things.\\" In the study, researchers gathered 361 college students and showed them the 2007 movie, Alonement. The movie is about two lovers who are separated and finally die during Worid War II. Before and after the movie, the students were asked questions measuring how happy they were with their lives. Researchers also asked them before, afier and three times during the movie to measure various emotions, including sadness. Researchers found that the sadder students felt while watching the movie, the more likely they were to think about real people they had close relationships with in life. This increased their happiness afier watching the movie. Knobloch-Westerwick explained that negative moods make people more thoughtful. \\"Positive emotions show that everything is fine, you don't have to worry, you don't have to think about problems in your life,\\" she said. \\"But negative emotions, like sadness, make you think more critically about your situation. So seeing a tragic movie may make you sad, but that will make you to think more about your own close relationships and appreciate them more.\\" The link between watching a tragic story and feeling better has long been recognized.

Title: In the Land of the Head Hunters Movie plot: Original advertising for the film describes it as a drama of primitive life on the shores of the North Pacific. The action takes place during the time of the first exploration of the Coast; an early scenario has the film opening with Vancouvers ship coming into the bay, though that part did not make it into the final film.The story overlays three plot elements onto each other: a melodramatic love triangle; an equally melodramatic series of aboriginal battles (from which the Head Hunting title is drawn); and a full range of Kwakwakawakw ceremonial performances in regalia fully restored for the film. The hero, Motana, falls in love with the maid of his dreams, Naida, while on a vision quest. Unfortunately for him, Naida is betrothed to an evil sorcerer. After completing his quest, Motana embarks on a battle to win Naida by killing the evil sorcerer. As might be expected, the sorcerers equally unsavory brother, Yaklus, is outraged. He takes his revenge by ransacking Motanas village, killing his father, and stealing Naida for himself. Strangely, the most magnificent Kwakwakawakw dance ceremonies in the film come in celebration of Yakluss success. But then, Motana and his crew stage a dramatic rescue of Naida from the bedside of Yaklus.

After the American Revolutionary War broke out in 1776, the Connecticut colonial government ordered the construction of Black Rock Fort (to be built on top of an older 17th-century fort) to protect the port of New Haven. In 1779, during the Battle of New Haven, British soldiers captured Black Rock Fort and burned the barracks to the ground. The fort was reconstructed in 1807 by the federal government (on orders from the Thomas Jefferson administration), and rechristened Fort Nathan Hale, after the Revolutionary War hero who had lived in New Haven. The cannons of Fort Nathan Hale were successful in defying British war ships during the War of 1812. In 1863, during the Civil War, a second Fort Hale was built next to the original, complete with bomb-resistant bunkers and a moat, to defend the city should a Southern raid against New Haven be launched.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. This movie starts out promisingly, with an early scene in which Frank Morgan advises against Gary Cooper's marriage to his daughter, Anita Louise. Frank Morgan, playing an unabashed gold-digger, loudly complains to Cooper about his perceived penury at the hands of his family - including his daughter, Anita Louise. I am a fan of all 3 actors. Frank Morgan is (to my mind) a Hollywood treasure, Cooper a legend, and Louise a very lovely, versatile and under-appreciated actress seldom seen in the leading role. I also have nothing against Teresa Wright, and while not blessed with great range, she usually delivers heart-warming performances. From a promising opening, the story slides downhill all the way to the end. I found nothing humorous about burning down the home of Cooper's would-be in-laws. The butler in such a fastidious, non-smoking household would never just blithely walk away, allowing Cooper to continue smoking, or alternatively he would certainly supply him with some means of disposing of his ill-timed cigarette. Moreover, nobody with any common sense would permit himself to be left holding a lit cigarette without asking for some means of disposing of it. And finally, nobody in his right mind crushes out a cigarette in a handkerchief and sticks it in his pocket! This whole sequence just made Cooper seem foolish and gauche. It is a poor contrivance - ill conceived and filmed in a way that induces ridicule not laughter. The forced medical examination of Cooper is equally contrived. Nobody lets himself undergo a complete medical examination without his being advised of its purpose or giving his consent! That Cooper did so is too removed from reality to be funny - it's absurd! Stealing babies from hospitals is a serious legal offense, and that, too, is nothing to laugh about. Finally, the scenes of Cooper's overly fastidious, neurotic attention to his baby's feeding and weight may have struck a nerve with a few people who have experienced anxiety over their own newborn babies. But to me they just seem tedious and slow. The wardrobe and prop departments went over the top in those scenes, while paradoxically, the script writer went to sleep. The lines are just not in the script to generate humor. They just miss on all cylinders. The laughs come not a mile-a-minute, but more like a light year-a-minute. The only time the movie has any energy or humor is when Frank Morgan is on camera. The scene that is totally wasted is when both of Cooper's love interests and their respective fathers are cooped up in the same hotel room together. There is probably a rich vein of humor somewhere in that mine, but none of it was extracted. In the end, one of the two very likable girls is going to get hurt. Predictably, it is the Anita Louise character, who gets jilted on her would-be-wedding night! While it is not on camera, that is her fate, and it is not particularly funny - even as a loose end. She hadn't done anything in this film to make me unsympathetic (unlike Gail Patrick, say, in My Favorite Wife). Consequently, I was expecting (perhaps \\"hoping\\" is a better word in the context of the film!) for Anita Louise to enjoy a happy ending, too. The fact that such a nice character is essentially wiped out at the movie's end really undermines the effect of the \\"happy ending\\" for Cooper and Wright. I kept waiting for something to happen, for the witty dialog so characteristic of movies of the era... And it never delivered.

We will present Max as a curious and adventurous young man, initially unhappy about being uprooted from his life in LA. Step 2: Establish the Reason for the Move Max's family moved to Salem due to his father receiving a better job offer in the town. His mother, keen on exploring their family history in Salem, also supports the move. Unbeknownst to them, their new home is located close to a mysterious and haunted site. Step 3: Introduce Friends and/or Love Interest Once in Salem, Max befriends two local siblings, Sam and Lucy, who share his interest in exploring their town's history. Lucy becomes a potential love interest for Max, further giving him motivation to uncover the town's secrets. Step 4: Introduce a Mysterious, Supernatural Element As the kids explore their town, they learn that the haunted site near Max's house is linked to an ancient legend of witches’ coven that returns every Halloween night. They find an old witch’s spell book and gain knowledge about the history of the witches and their powers.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Foursquare, Facebook and Gilt Groupe embrace hackathons NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Throw a bunch of programmers into a room with laptops, Red Bull and pizza for a hours at a stretch and what do you get? Creative breakthroughs. That's the idea behind \\"hackathons,\\" where groups of engineers band together for marathon coding sessions. The term \\"hacking\\" tends to come with negative connotations, but in the tech world, it simply means cranking out code for a cause. \\"Hacking really doesn't mean I'm going to break into a system and steal people's identities,\\" says Gilt Groupe engineer Mark Wunsch. \\"It means we're going to try and come up with clever solutions for problems.\\" Hackathons are typically off-the-cuff events with loose guiding goals, and open-source developers are among their biggest evangelists. But lately, companies have been adopting the idea. Online fashion retailer Gilt Groupe recently held its second hackathon to invent and improve on features for its website. Armed with coffee and snacks, staff engineers set up shop at 11 a.m. on a Thursday morning and prepared to spend 24 straight hours coding. \\"It gave us a chance to actually focus on one thing,\\" says developer Evan Maloney. \\"There's something else that happens with the creative process when you've been awake for a while, where you start to have ideas that you may not necessarily have if you had your wits about you.\\" A full day later -- noticeably more exhausted -- the group presented their creations. One new app they created detects the color of any object you point your smartphone at. It will then show everything the website has for sale in that color. Gilt Group isn't the only company using hackathons to spark corporate creativity. Facebook makes them a regular feature of its product development process. \\"Hacking is a central part of Facebook's culture,\\" the company wrote on its blog in December. \\"Whether we're building the next big product at one of our Hackathons or creating a smarter search algorithm, we're always hacking to find a better way of doing things.\\" Location-based network Foursquare recently hosted its first Hackathon. More than 150 developers spent a day building new features on top of the company's API. Fifteen hours -- plus 25 pizzas and 300 cups of coffee later -- engineers came up with 39 apps built on Foursquare's infrastructure. \\"It definitely helps kickstart creativity,\\" says programmer Jonathan Wegener, who took a break from working on his own venture -- part of startup accelerator TechStars' first New York cohort -- to participate. In one day, Wegener created a feature for Foursquare users called 4squareand7yearsago, which sends users a daily history of their check-ins a year ago. And as startup valuations soar and tech companies battle to find engineers, it can't hurt to gather a group of talented engineers in a room for 24 hours to see what they're capable of. \\"It's often secretly about recruiting,\\" Wegener says.","completion":"A \\"hackathon\\" is an event where groups of engineers work together for hours, trying to create new computer codes and solve problems.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Given the below context: Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....

Here is an article: This week The Wall Street Journal and VentureSource ranked the top 50 U.S. venture-backed companies with the most potential to become \\"The Next Big Thing.\\" You can check out the list, along with the methodology, here. We thought we'd take a look at where these companies reside. After all, if these are the next Ciscos, Microsofts and Amgens (all formerly venture-backed companies), which cities and states will claim bragging rights? Let's be clear—it's hard to draw hard conclusions from such a tiny sliver of the 10,000-plus venture-backed companies out there, and many stellar start-ups just missed making this list (or were excluded because their valuation was above 1 billion). But the study is interesting, nonetheless. For your convenience, we've marked these companies' exact locations on the interactive, color-coded map here. Blue is for information technology companies, red for health care, green for clean technology, yellow for consumer services and purple for business and financial services. Not surprisingly, a large share of these companies make their home in California, a state that year-after-year captures the most venture funding thanks mostly to Silicon Valley. (California companies raised 49% of the 21.4 billion in venture capital distributed last year.) But it was curious that such a high percentage of the top companies—33 out of 50, or 66%—hailed from California. Within the state, nearly half—24 of 50—are in Silicon Valley, which received 36% of the total venture dollars last year. In fact, five companies—No. 6 Azul Systems, No. 7 Complete Genomics, No. 12 NeuroPace, No. 17 Fanfare Group and No. 36 Soasta—all operate a few blocks from each other in Mountain View. So why is this list so heavily tilted in California's favor? The answer is likely in the survey's methodology. The track record of these companies' venture capital board members account for 27.5% of the final rank, and some of the most well-established venture firms dwell in Silicon Valley. Even though it's a documented fact that the density of entrepreneurs and investors in a place like Silicon Valley breeds innovation, the list may provide some interesting insight into the subtle and powerful ways those connections help companies rise to the top. Perhaps more curious is the lack of companies in Massachusetts, which, thanks to the Boston area, is the second largest region for venture-capital funding (12% of last year's venture dollars). Just three companies—No. 29 Boston-Power, No. 43 Akorri Networks and No. 50 Acceleron Pharma—live there. By comparison, five companies are in the New York City area: No. 19 Gilt Groupe, No. 22 HuffingtonPost.com, No. 24 Small Bone Innovations, No. 33 Vidyo and No. 39 Etsy. Then there are the few companies outside the traditional venture-capital hot spots. For instance, No. 21 Xanodyne Pharma is located in Newport, Ky. (Cincinnati area), No. 15 Suniva in Norcross, Ga. (Atlanta suburb), and No. 31 CVRx in Minneapolis. That's impressive, considering they're in regions not know for producing major high-tech companies. Perhaps we should do follow-up \\"top 50″ lists and apply the methodology to individual regions. That might help us understand, as Seattle tech blogger John Cook asked, why there are no companies on this list in the tech-heavy Seattle area.

(CNN) -- Henry Joseph Madden was a good student and track team member in high school, but he had a secret: He sometimes wore his mother's pantyhose and underwear under his clothes. Dr. Jennifer Madden, a family physician, began her transition to being female at age 48. \\"I really wanted to be a girl so bad, and that was one way for me to satisfy those feelings,\\" Madden said. \\"I always felt like someone was looking over my shoulder.\\" The desire to be female never went away. At age 48, Madden confessed these feelings to a doctor, and started seeing a gender therapist who suggested Madden was transgendered. Through reconstructive surgeries, electrolysis, laser procedures and voice lessons, Henry Joseph became Jennifer Elizabeth, known as Jenny. She is a practicing family physician in Nashua, New Hampshire. Watch Jenny's story » Chastity Bono, child of performer Cher and the late entertainer and politician Sonny Bono, announced Thursday the beginning of a transition from female to a male. While still relatively rare -- one advocate estimates that 0.25 to 0.5 percent of the American population is transgendered -- the idea of changing gender identity has become more widespread in recent years. The term \\"LGBT\\" (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) is more commonly recognized, and transgendered people have been portrayed in the 1999 film \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" as well as the 2002 book \\"Middlesex\\" by Jeffrey Eugenides. Many people who have transitioned, including Madden, say they knew they had been born into the wrong gender from childhood. As early as age 3, Dr. Julie Praus, born male, didn't understand why her father wanted to play catch. As a boy, Praus learned how to fish and hunt, but enjoyed collecting Depression-era glassware vases. Praus, 48, a psychiatrist in Brattleboro, Vermont, started living as a woman in March 2008.

From the moment I stepped into the restaurant, I was impressed by the ambient atmosphere and impeccable service provided by the staff. Upon being seated, we were greeted by our knowledgeable and attentive server, Sarah, who guided us through the menu with great enthusiasm. We started our culinary journey with the chef's signature appetizer – the delectable Crab Cakes, which were cooked to perfection, boasting a light, crispy exterior and flavorful, succulent interior. For our main course, we opted for the Pan-Seared Salmon and the Herb-Crusted Rack of Lamb. The salmon was beautifully cooked, with a crispy skin and tender, flaky flesh, complemented by a tangy lemon dill sauce. The rack of lamb was equally impressive: tender, juicy, and full of flavor, encased in a golden, herb-infused crust. The accompaniments – garlic mashed potatoes, honey-glazed carrots, and seasonal sautéed greens – were absolutely scrumptious, elevating the overall dining experience. We couldn't resist indulging in one of their delectable desserts – the decadent Triple Chocolate Mousse. It was a heavenly combination of rich, silky chocolate layers, complete with fresh berries and a delicate dusting of powdered sugar – the perfect ending to a fabulous meal. There were a couple of minor issues – the restaurant was a bit noisy, and the wait for our food was longer than expected. However, these concerns became insignificant considering the warm hospitality, exceptional food, and overall memorable dining experience. In conclusion, I highly recommend The Gourmet Garden for anyone seeking a fantastic culinary adventure in a charming and elegant setting. I'm already looking forward to my next visit!

Context: Mantua is the ancestral city where the male line of the Gonzaga dynasty ruled, first as marquesses, then after 1540 as dukes, in vassalage to the Holy Roman Empire. Monferrato was a duchy since 1574 on the eastern side of Piedmont, and an Imperial fief since the eleventh or twelfth century. The Gonzagas had enlarged their realm with Monferrato after receiving it in dowry from the wife of duke Frederick II Gonzaga. On 22 September 1612, Francis IV, Duke of Mantua and Monferrato died at the age of 26. His death occurred only a couple of months after the death of his father Vincent I, Duke of Mantua. He left only a three-year-old daughter, Maria of Mantua. Francis IV also had two younger brothers who, both being cardinals, could not marry and were thus ineligible to succeed to Mantua's throne. Nonetheless, Francis' two brothers, Ferdinando I and Vincenzo II , eventually did become Dukes of Mantua. Despite marrying, following the resignation of Ferdinando and the expulsion of Vincenzo from the Sacred College of Cardinals, neither produced any legitimate children. A crisis erupted when Vincenzo II died on 26 December 1627 at the age of 33, the same day that his niece Maria Gonzaga's marriage with Charles de Nevers was celebrated. Nevers was the eldest son and heir of Charles, Duke of Nevers, Rethel and Mayenne. Moreover, he was the head of the cadet branch of the House of Gonzaga, and after Vincenzo II, heir male of the Duchy of Mantua. Question: How many years after the male line of the Gonzaga dynasty ruled Mantua as dukes did Monferrato become a duchy? Answer:","completion":"To find the answer, let's identify the relevant dates first: 1. The male line of the Gonzaga dynasty ruled Mantua as dukes starting in 1540. 2. Monferrato became a duchy in 1574. Now, let's calculate the difference between these two dates: 1574 (Monferrato becomes a duchy) - 1540 (Gonzaga dynasty rules Mantua as dukes) = 34 years So, 34 years after the male line of the Gonzaga dynasty ruled Mantua as dukes, Monferrato became a duchy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(August 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) When the final closing arguments in a murder trial have been presented to the judge, she gives her instructions to the jury, all of whom are men. In the United States, the verdict in criminal cases must be unanimous. A non-unanimous verdict results in a hung jury which in turn forces a mistrial. The question they are deciding is whether the defendant, a teenaged boy from a city slum, murdered his father. The jury is further instructed that a guilty verdict will be accompanied by a mandatory death sentence. Under current American criminal law, a defendant must first be found guilty, and then the jury in the sentencing phase must find an aggravating circumstance and unanimously agree to recommend the death penalty, if the state has the death penalty.[citation needed] The jury of twelve retires to the jury room, where they begin to become acquainted with their personalities and discuss the case. The story revolves around their difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict, mainly because of the personal prejudices of several of the jurors. An initial vote is taken and eleven of the jurors vote for conviction. Juror number 8, the lone dissenter, states that the evidence presented is circumstantial and the boy deserves a fair deliberation, upon which he questions the accuracy and reliability of the only two witnesses to the murder, the fact that the knife used in the murder is not as unusual as the testimony indicates (he produces an identical one from his pocket), and the overall shady circumstances. Having argued several points, Juror 8 requests another vote, this time by secret ballot. He proposed that he would abstain from voting, and if the other eleven jurors voted guilty unanimously, then he would acquiesce to their decision. However, if at least one...

La Building Workers International se había enfocado en la protección y el mejoramiento de las condiciones laborales de los trabajadores de la construcción, mientras que la Wood Workers International se había centrado en el apoyo y la organización de los trabajadores de la industria maderera. La unificación de estas dos organizaciones permitió a estos trabajadores ampliar su alcance y su capacidad para luchar por sus derechos. La IFBWW trabajó en pos de la creación de políticas laborales equitativas y justas en todo el mundo, promoviendo el diálogo y la cooperación entre los sindicatos, las empresas y las autoridades gubernamentales. Además, la federación también buscó impulsar mejoras en la capacitación y formación de los trabajadores del sector, así como la promoción de condiciones de trabajo seguras y protegidas. A lo largo de los años, la IFBWW ha pasado por distintos cambios, incluyendo la adopción de un nuevo nombre en 1995: la Federación Internacional de Trabajadores del Ramo de la Construcción y la Madera (FITRCM) o, en inglés, International Federation of Building and Wood Workers (IFBWW).

Bennett, 21, of C Battery, U.S. 17th Field Artillery Regiment, was a four-year veteran of the U.S. Army, and had served in the division since March 1943. Records show he had no medical history until 6 August 1943, when a friend was wounded in combat. According to a report, he \\"could not sleep and was nervous.\\" Bennett was brought to the 93rd Evacuation Hospital. In addition to having a fever, he exhibited symptoms of dehydration, including fatigue, confusion, and listlessness. His request to return to his unit was turned down by medical officers. The shells going over him bothered him. The next day he was worried about his buddy and became more nervous. He was sent down to the rear echelon by a battery aid man and there the medical aid man gave him some medicine which made him sleep, but still he was nervous and disturbed. On the next day the medical officer ordered him to be evacuated, although the boy begged not to be evacuated because he did not want to leave his unit. On 10 August, Patton entered the receiving tent of the hospital, speaking to the injured there. Patton approached Bennett, who was huddled and shivering, and asked what the trouble was. \\"It's my nerves,\\" Bennett responded. \\"I can't stand the shelling anymore.\\" Patton reportedly became enraged at him, slapping him across the face. He began yelling: \\"Your nerves, hell, you are just a goddamned coward. Shut up that goddamned crying. I won't have these brave men who have been shot at seeing this yellow bastard sitting here crying.\\" Patton then reportedly slapped Bennett again, knocking his helmet liner off, and ordered the receiving officer, Major Charles B. Etter, not to admit him. Patton then threatened Bennett, \\"You're going back to the front lines and you may get shot and killed, but you're going to fight. If you don't, I'll stand you up against a wall and have a firing squad kill you on purpose. In fact, I ought to shoot you myself, you goddamned whimpering coward.\\" Upon saying this, Patton pulled out his pistol...

The lady told me her name was Helen and she called the restaurant she and her husband were going to have lunch at after her appointment to see if he was waiting for her there.She explained that she thought her husband parked the car in the parking lot and waited for her in the car but she didn't find him there so she returned to see if he entered the medical building,but Ed was not there either.She regretted making her husband park the car alone since some signs of Alzheimer's had happened in his behavior.I asked a few nurses to help look for Ed inside and outside the medical building according to Helen's description.Then I offered to drive Helen to the restaurant to see if Ed was waiting for her there. On arriving at the parking lot of the restaurant,Helen began to search for Ed's car but she failed,which suggested Ed wasn't there.We decided to have a talk with the manager before we returned to the hospital.On our way to the manager's office.I received a call from a nurse,who said they had found Ed.What a relief!

Answer a question about this article: From the early 16th century, both Western Armenia and Eastern Armenia fell under Iranian Safavid rule. Owing to the century long Turco-Iranian geo-political rivalry that would last in Western Asia, significant parts of the region were frequently fought over between the two rivalling empires. From the mid 16th century with the Peace of Amasya, and decisively from the first half of the 17th century with the Treaty of Zuhab until the first half of the 19th century, Eastern Armenia was ruled by the successive Iranian Safavid, Afsharid and Qajar empires, while Western Armenia remained under Ottoman rule. In the late 1820s, the parts of historic Armenia under Iranian control centering on Yerevan and Lake Sevan (all of Eastern Armenia) were incorporated into the Russian Empire following Iran's forced ceding of the territories after its loss in the Russo-Persian War (1826-1828) and the outcoming Treaty of Turkmenchay.

This marked the beginning of a major campaign and series of events that led to the significant territorial expansion of the German forces throughout Eastern Europe. Following this initial invasion, German forces advanced quickly into Soviet territory. It took a little over two weeks, in fact, before they reached Estonia. On 7 July 1941, the Wehrmacht crossed the Estonian southern border, as indicated in the statement. Estonia at the time was occupied by the Soviet Union since the Soviet occupation in June 1940. As the German forces pushed further into Soviet-held territory, they established and consolidated their presence in Estonia and other occupied regions. The Wehrmacht crossing the Estonian southern border was part of a much larger conflict taking place on the Eastern Front during World War II. The eventual German invasion of Estonia and the broader Baltic states brought them into direct conflict with Soviet forces. This conflict ultimately played a pivotal role in shaping the outcome of both the Eastern Front and the overall progression of the war. So, in conclusion, the statement provided does contain the correct answer to the question pertaining to when the Wehrmacht crossed the Estonian southern border.

To further explain, sentiment analysis is a form of natural language processing that interprets and classifies emotions in textual data using techniques such as text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics. This technique is often used in social media monitoring, allowing businesses to gain insights into how the public perceives their brand, product, or service. The tweet \\"@jamesurquhart Great. We will meet again\\" does not express any form of disappointment, sadness, anger, or any negative feelings. Instead, the word \\"Great\\" indicates a positive sentiment. The phrase \\"We will meet again\\" can further back up this claim as it is usually used in a joyful, emotional circumstance where people are looking forward to seeing each other again in the future. Such an expression demonstrates anticipation and exhilaration, indicating a positive sentiment. Even though text sentiment analysis lacks the sureness of understanding the complete sentiment without knowing the entire context or situation, based on the provided text and standard vocabulary, we can say the sentiment of the tweet is positive. These keywords \\"Great\\" and \\"will meet again\\" are often associated with positive emotions and reactions. Therefore considering the basic principles of sentiment analysis, the only sensible choice is to classify the sentiment expressed in this tweet as positive."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Organic food, once considered something that only health fanatics desired, is now a regular feature at most supermarkets. And that has created a bit of a dilemma. On the one hand, you have a conventionally grown apple. On the other, you have one that's organic. Both apples are firm, shiny and red. Both provide vitamins and fiber, and both are free of fat, sodium and cholesterol. Conventionally grown food generally costs less, but is organic food a better choice? The advantages claimed for such foods over conventionally grown and sold food products are now being debated on a large scale. Supporters of organic foods -- a term whose meaning varies greatly --are frequently telling the world that such products are safer and more nutritious than others. The growing interest of consumers in the safety and nutritional quality of daily foods is a welcome development. However, much of this interest has been aroused by sweeping claims that the conventional food supply is unsafe or inadequate in meeting nutritional needs. Almost daily, the public is surrounded by claims for \\"no-aging\\" diets, new vitamins and other wonder foods. There are numerous unsubstantiated reports that natural vitamins are superior to man-made ones, that fertilized eggs are nutritionally superior to unfertilized eggs, that untreated grains are better than those treated with insect spray and the like. Although most of these claims are not supported by scientific evidence, large amounts of written material about the benefits of organic foods makes it difficult for people to separate fact from fiction. As a result, claims that eating a diet consisting of organically grown foods prevents or cures disease or provides other benefits to health have become widely advertised and form the basis for people's opinion. One thing that most organically grown food products seem to have in common is that they cost more than conventionally grown foods. But in many cases consumers are misled if they believe organic foods can maintain health and provide better... Question: It can be inferred from the passage that _ . - most doctors believe organic foods prevent disease or provide other benefits to health - organic foods are actually less nutritious than conventionally grown foods - people cannot separate fact from fiction because of the TV advertisements - organic foods cost more but are not necessarily better than conventionally grown foods Answer:","completion":"It can be inferred from the passage that organic foods cost more but are not necessarily better than conventionally grown foods.

Problem:Rick Perry‘s campaigned launched a new campaign ad, and it’s exactly the sort of action packed trailer a candidate who runs with a gun might want. Borrowing the services of Tim Pawlenty‘s old video man, Lucas Baiano, the ad mostly forgoes biographic info in favor of setting a strong tone for his campaign. “A great country requires a better direction, a renewed nation needs a new president,” you hear him say. “The United States of America really is the last great hope of mankind.” The first forty seconds of the ad go to Barack Obama, the “Zero President” — zero jobs, zero confidence, zero hope, zero change, etc. The attack juxtaposes images of an abandon nation of crumbling billboards and and increasingly urgent news casts reporting high poverty rates against Obama’s assurance that, “I’m just getting started.” Then all goes quiet and “In 2012” flashes across the screen. Things brighten: there are wild horses, paparazzi flashes, and the world is again populated with healthy looking children. There is a shot of him in his Air Force jump suit, and images of him shaking hands with workers across the country. “I believe in America,” he says, implying better days ahead. “I believe in her purpose and promise.” See what you think.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Winter is dangerous because it's so difficult to know what is going to happen and accidents take place so easily. Fog can be waiting to meet you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hiding under the melting snow, waiting ahead to send you off the road. The car coming to you may suddenly slip across the road. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly . Sudden movements can make a car very difficult to control. So every time you either start or stop your car, increase or reduce your speed, you must be as gentle and slow as possible. Suppose you are driving with a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive so that you wouldn't spill it. Rule Number Two is to pay attention to what might happen. The more ice there is, the further down the road you have to look. Test how long it takes to gently stop your car. Remember that you may be driving more quickly than you think. Generally, allow twice of your usual stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice.

Hans Lundgren was born on 3 November 1957 in Spanga, the son of Sigrid Birgitta (nee Tjerneld), a language teacher, and Karl Johan Hugo Lundgren, an engineer and economist for the Swedish government. He lived in Spanga until the age of 13, when he moved to his grandparents' home in Nyland, Angermanland. Some sources wrongly state 1959 as his year of birth, but Lundgren himself has confirmed it to be 1957. He has two sisters and an older brother; he was raised in the Lutheran church. Lundgren resides in Los Angeles, California. He speaks Swedish and English, as well as smaller amounts of French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish, but is not fluent in five languages as has often been reported. He is an avid football fan. He supported Everton FC when he lived in Europe, but developed more of an interest in international football tournaments (such as the UEFA European Championship and the FIFA World Cup) after moving to Los Angeles. During the 1980s, Lundgren had relationships with Jamaican singer Grace Jones and American model Paula Barbieri. In 1994, he married Anette Qviberg, a jewellery designer and fashion stylist, in Marbella. The couple decided they liked Marbella so much that they rented accommodation there for years, before eventually buying a family home there. They have two daughters: Ida Sigrid Lundgren and Greta Eveline Lundgren, both born in Stockholm. Lundgren and Qviberg have cited the reason for living away from Hollywood is that they want to give their children as normal a childhood as possible. His father died in 2000. In early May 2009, Lundgren's Marbella home was reportedly broken into by three masked burglars who tied up and threatened his wife, but fled when they found a family photo and realized that the house was owned by Lundgren. Lundgren later stated he believed the intruders to be Eastern European and had asked contacts in Bulgaria to investigate them, but to no avail. After the incident, Lundgren's elder daughter, Ida, suffered from PTSD. His wife was the \\"most traumatized\\", and as of 2011, they are divorced.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The legislature voted in 1810 to relocate the capital again, and moved the seat of government to Harrisburg in October 1812 onto the land originally given by Harris a decade earlier. An additional 10 acres (4 ha) was also purchased from United States Senator William Maclay. The legislature met in the old Dauphin County courthouse for the next decade until a new capitol was constructed. A competition was held to determine the design of the capitol starting in 1816, which \\"was the first formal contest for [designing] an American statehouse\\". The designs submitted, including one from William Strickland, were rejected as being too expensive. Another contest was started in January 1819. Of the seventeen designs submitted, two were selected as semifinalists. One was from Harrisburg architect Stephen Hills and the other was from the designer of the Washington Monument, Robert Mills; Hills' design was selected. Hills had designed a \\"red-brick, Federal-style\\" capitol to \\"architecturally represent the function of democratic government.\\" Construction began on the Hills Capitol in 1819 and it was completed in 1822. The capitol's construction and subsequent furnishing was estimated to have cost 244,500. The Hills Capitol was visited by famous people, including the Marquis de Lafayette in 1825 and Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, (later King Edward VII) in 1860. Abraham Lincoln visited the capitol in 1861 as president-elect, and then his body lay in state there after his 1865 assassination.

Answer the question...the free surface of a rotating fluid is??","completion":"To answer this question, let's first break it down step-by-step: Step 1: Understand the context of the question The question is asking about the nature of the free surface of a rotating fluid. A free surface is the boundary between a fluid and a gas, such as air, where the pressure of the fluid is equal to the pressure of the gas. Step 2: Consider the effect of rotation on the fluid When a fluid is rotating, the particles in the fluid experience centrifugal force, which pushes them away from the center of rotation. This causes the fluid surface to adjust according to the balance between the centrifugal forces acting on the fluid particles and the gravitational forces pulling them down. Step 3: Describe the free surface of a rotating fluid The free surface of a rotating fluid takes the shape of a paraboloid, also known as a parabolic surface. This is because the particles are subjected to both centrifugal and gravitational forces, causing the fluid to form a curve.

Answer the following question: Information: - A voice type is a particular human singing voice identified as having certain qualities or characteristics of vocal range, vocal weight, tessitura, vocal timbre, and vocal transition points (\\"passaggio\\"), such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and vocal register. A singer's voice type is identified by a process known as voice classification, by which the human voice is evaluated and thereby designated into a particular voice type. The discipline of voice classification developed within European classical music and is not generally applicable to other forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within opera to associate possible roles with potential voices. Several different voice classification systems are available to identify voice types, including the German \\"Fach\\" system and the choral music system among many others; no system is universally applied or accepted. - Maria Malibran ( 24 March 1808 -- 23 September 1836 ) was a Spanish mezzo - soprano who commonly sang both contralto and soprano parts , and was one of the most famous opera singers of the 19th century . Malibran was known for her stormy personality and dramatic intensity , becoming a legendary figure after her death at age 28 . Contemporary accounts of her voice describe its range , power and flexibility as extraordinary . - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \\"high A\\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \\"soprano C\\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which usually encompasses the melody. The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano. The lyric soprano is the most common female singing voice. - Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice, and augments regular speech by the use of sustained tonality, rhythm, and a variety of vocal techniques. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist. Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists, or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues and popular music styles such as pop and rock. - A contralto is a type of classical female singing voice whose vocal range is the lowest female voice type. The contralto's vocal range is fairly rare; similar to, but different from the alto, and almost identical to that of a countertenor, typically between the F below middle C (F in scientific pitch notation) to the second F above middle C (F), although at the extremes some voices can reach the E below middle C (E) or the second B above middle C (B). The contralto voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, lyric, and dramatic contralto.

There is one at the canteen entrance. I always cherish a secret desire to take a glance before it at myself in a beautiful new dress. However, each time when it comes to the fulfillment, I get seized with such an uneasiness that I literally stagger away--backing out at the critical moment. At the root of it is my lack of confidence by which I have been enslaved since childhood. It embarrasses me at the mildest praise, crushes my utmost efforts to say \\"No\\", and prevents me from asking my parents for one cent more than necessary. Among other things, lack of confidence has wormed its way into my love of piano. At the age of 14, one Sunday morning, I was woken up by a resounding hymn . Tracing that call of God into a neighboring church, I found myself deeply attracted by the melody of a piano--something beyond the means of my parents. To make it worse, people say a pianist is supposed to have music in the blood, but I believe I had none from my engineer father and technician mother. For days on end, I kept thinking of nothing else. I had a dream. It wasn't a dream after gold, which made some of my close friends to engage in business as self-employed traders or street peddlers. I was sometimes dazzled by their gold rings or elegant necklaces behind which, however, I seemed to catch sight of skeletons in their cupboards and was frightened away from the craze for fortunate. Out of despair, I kept it to myself, lack of confidence weighing heavy on me. I could do nothing but turn to my dream for comfort, for courage to aim high and wish for the impossible. I was convinced that before I could afford anything expensive (to me, it was a piano), I should climb up the academic ladder as high as possible. For the next nine years, I carefully held back my desire for music to keep my search for learning, especially in English studies. My efforts were so rewarding that I went successfully through high school and college in my hometown. When I received the admission notice for a second...

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","completion":"Yes, the information you found on Google is indeed a correct answer. The greater palatine canal, also known as the pterygopalatine canal, is a passage in the human skull that plays a crucial role in connecting various anatomical structures. To provide further insight into this structure and its significance, we can explore its features, location, and associated structures in more detail. The greater palatine canal is located within the skull, specifically in the posterior region of the maxilla and the adjoining palatine bone. Its position can be described as inferior to the eye socket (inferior orbital fissure) and near the root of the pterygoid process. The canal emerges from the pterygopalatine fossa, a small, pyramid-shaped depression located on the sphenoid bone, where several nerves and blood vessels converge. From this fossa, the canal descends in an anterior and medial direction towards the oral cavity. Structures that pass through the greater palatine canal include the greater palatine artery, vein, and nerve. Each of these components plays a vital role within the skull and oral cavity: 1. Greater palatine artery: This artery is a branch of the maxillary artery, which is a major blood vessel supplying the face and various structures within the oral and nasal cavities. The greater palatine artery supplies blood to the hard palate, the gums of the maxillary teeth, and parts of the nasal cavity. 2. Greater palatine vein: This vein drains the blood from the regions supplied by the greater palatine artery, such as the hard palate and the gums of the maxillary teeth. The blood then travels back to the venous circulation through the pterygoid venous plexus. 3. Greater palatine nerve: This nerve is a branch of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V), which is responsible for sensation in the face. The greater palatine nerve provides sensory innervation to the hard and soft palate, the maxillary gingiva, and parts of the nasal cavity. In summary, the greater palatine canal is a vital passage in the human skull that connects the pterygopalatine fossa with the oral cavity. It facilitates the transmission of essential structures such as the greater palatine artery, vein, and nerve, ensuring the proper functioning of associated oral and nasal anatomical components."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the full name of the director of Halo's video? is inside the article: \\"Halo\\" is a song recorded by American singer Beyoncé for her third studio album, I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008). Included on the I Am... disc, it was intended to give a behind-the-scenes glimpse of Beyoncé's life, stripped of her make-up and celebrity trappings. Columbia Records released the song, the album's fourth single, to mainstream radio in the United States on January 20, 2009, and to international markets from February 20. Inspired by Ray LaMontagne's 2004 song \\"Shelter,\\" \\"Halo\\" was written and composed by Ryan Tedder, Evan Bogart, and Beyoncé herself. It was conceived by Tedder and Bogart specifically for Beyoncé, although there was media speculation that it had been intended for Leona Lewis. \\"Halo\\" is a pop power ballad, the lyrics of which describe a sublime love. It features drum, piano, keyboard, string, synthesizer, and percussion instrumentation. The song faced a controversy when Kelly Clarkson claimed that Tedder had reused the musical arrangement in her own 2009 song \\"Already Gone.\\" \\"Halo\\" received positive reviews from music critics, who made comparisons with Lewis's 2007 song \\"Bleeding Love.\\" Its production and Beyoncé's emotional vocals also received critical praise. \\"Halo\\" was nominated for Record of the Year and won Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards. It won Best Song at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards. \\"Halo\\" topped the singles charts of Brazil, Norway, and Slovakia, and reached the top five on the singles chart of Australia, Germany, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the US. It has received over ten certifications including a seven-times platinum certification from Australia and a double-platinum from Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Article: People give off noticeable changes in their movements when they feel attracted to someone. While everyone has their own set of bodily cues, there are some common signs to look out for when someone's crushing. Open postures such as uncrossed legs, open arms, and palms facing up. People will often lean in much closer to a crush when speaking with them in comparison to the personal space they use with platonic friends. Sometimes people will play with their hair, jewelry, or will simply make extended eye contact and smile during their conversations with crushes. Prolonged eye contact, even for just over a second, is a common sign of either aggression or romantic interest. Pay close attention to how long your friend's crush gazes at your buddy. If they fail to maintain consistent eye contact, then it could be a bad sign for any hopes of a relationship. On the contrary, it's an excellent signal of affection if they constantly stay locked onto each other's eyes during conversations. See if your friend's crush interacts with your friend frequently on social media accounts such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Pay attention to the language they use with your friend, and see if they use obvious signs such as smiley face or winky face emojis. People looking to give off signs of attraction will likely dole out many compliments to their crush. Watch to see if your friend's crush praises them on their talents or academic accomplishments. It's important to note that being complimentary isn't always a sign of affection, so it's crucial to pay attention to the frequency of their praise and admiration. Compliments on physical features are an especially key sign of flirting. Did your friend's crush notice their new glasses, haircut, or workout routine? Flirts tend to notice these subtle changes and point them out to convey affection. Sexual innuendos laced in jokes and conversations can also be not-so-subtle signs of a flirt's desire to spice up conversations with the person of their desire. Flirts will commonly drop hints in conversations that reflect their relationship status, such as mentioning they're recently single or how lonely they've been. Some people may flirt very openly and little guessing is required, while others can be introverted flirts with more subtle signs of affection. Physical flirts rely on body language cues to convey their feelings. They often use physical signs of affection before verbal cues, such as eye contact and playful touching. Traditional flirts tend to be more polite, preferring to convey affection over a longer period of time instead of using flashy and overt statements such as saying they're single or rubbing their crush's arm. These flirts also prefer professional environments like bookstores or study groups to build relationships over parties. Playful flirts use very clear signs of affection in a boisterous manner. For example, they may joke excessively in a sexual way with their crush or make bold physical complements about their crush's appearance. Find out who your crush's friends are and ask around to see if what the status of the crush's feelings are. Chances are if the crush is significant the word has already made its way around to people.

Please answer the following question: - Green is a color that gathers sunlight easily - Sunlight is gathered by the leaves of the plant - The sunlight is broken down into glucose through photosynthesis - The glucose travels the plant What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The last step of the process after glucose has been produced and transported throughout the plant is the utilization and storage of this glucose for various vital functions of the plant. This occurs in two primary ways: cellular respiration and growth, and storing for later use. 1. Cellular Respiration and Growth: The glucose produced through photosynthesis acts as the primary energy source for the plant. A portion of this glucose is converted to a readily available energy molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via the process of cellular respiration, which occurs mainly in the mitochondria of plant cells. Cellular respiration involves a series of chemical reactions, including glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and electron transport, which ultimately results in producing ATP from glucose. The ATP is then used to provide energy for various biochemical processes, including the synthesis of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids necessary for the plant's growth, development, and reproduction. It also helps to maintain the balance of nutrients, ions, and other essential molecules inside cells and aids in transport across cell membranes. 2. Storing for Later Use: As plants produce more glucose than is immediately needed for energy, they store the excess glucose in different forms for future use. This glucose is stored in plant cells as starch, a complex carbohydrate consisting of long chains of glucose molecules. Starch serves as a reserve energy source, and its storage occurs mainly in specialized plastids called amyloplasts in plant organs like roots, stems, and seeds. In times of low light or darkness, when photosynthesis cannot occur, plants break down this stored starch into glucose, allowing them to continue meeting their energy requirements. Moreover, a portion of glucose is also converted into other storage compounds, such as lipids, which can be found in seeds or fruits, and sugars like sucrose, which is used for long-distance transport in the plant's vascular tissues (phloem). These stored compounds can not only provide energy under low light conditions but also become the initial energy source for germination and growth of a new plant. In summary, the last step of the process after sunlight is broken down into glucose through photosynthesis and transported through the plant involves utilizing and storing the glucose for essential functions, including cellular respiration and growth, and maintaining a reserve for future energy needs."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

The whole world felt sorry about the death of Mandela, a great man of history. Mandela is mostly remembered for his efforts to end apartheid in South Africa. Mandela was born in 1918. In South Africa, there are both black and white people. But at that time, Black people couldn't live or travel where they wanted. They didn't have the right to vote, either. Mandela didn't think that was right. He organized many activities against it, but he was sent to prison for 27 years. Under international pressure, the government set Mandela free in 1990. Great changes in the law began to end apartheid. At that time, Mandela chose to forgive his enemies. He shook hands with the people who wanted him dead. He also encouraged black people to forgive the whites. Because of his forgiveness, Mandela is remembered as a moral model by the whole world. In1993,Mandela won the Nobel Peace Prize.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"If the premise is true, it does not necessarily mean that the hypothesis is true as well. Let's break down the given premise and hypothesis and explore the reasoning behind this conclusion. Premise: \\"Watch them at the wheel of a Long ago, driving became a major opportunity for the Italians to display their dramatic talents.\\" This premise suggests that Italians have, historically, used driving as an opportunity to showcase their dramatic abilities. In other words, they have developed a distinctive driving style, which may involve a certain level of flair and theatrics on the road. Hypothesis: \\"Italians have never learned how to drive.\\" This hypothesis claims that Italians do not know or have never learned the skill of driving. Now, let's try to determine if the truth of the premise implies the truth of the hypothesis. From the premise, we infer that Italians have a unique driving style, which is more theatrical and dramatic compared to drivers of other nationalities. However, it is important to note that a unique, dramatic driving style does not equate to not knowing how to drive. For the hypothesis to be true based on the premise, there would have to be a link between the dramatic driving style and not understanding the skill of driving at all. This evidence is not present in the premise, and therefore, it is not possible to conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. Furthermore, it is possible for someone to have a dramatic driving style while still having proper knowledge and competence in driving. In this case, knowing how to drive does not necessarily mean adhering strictly to a standardized, non-dramatic driving style. In conclusion, if the premise is true, it does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. The premise speaks about a distinctive driving style characterized by dramatic talents, while the hypothesis claims that Italians have never learned how to drive. The presence of a theatrical driving style does not automatically imply a lack of driving knowledge or skill."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Scientists are building a \\"Cold Atom Lab,\\" which would be able to bring matter within down as low as 0.0000000001 degrees above absolute zero, the Christian Science Monitor reports. (The lab itself will be a \\"fridge-sized box,\\" it notes.) Absolute zero, which is equivalent to −459.67 Fahrenheit, is the theoretical point at which matter loses all thermal energy. As matter approaches it, things get weird; it begins acting like a wave, and can be in two places at once. NASA will be studying in particular Bose-Einstein condensates, which are created when millions of atoms begin coalescing into a single wave. Building the lab in zero gravity will make it a lot easier to generate these low temperatures, allowing particles to sit comfortably within a force field. The effort is piggybacking on a broader microgravity lab, the Tech Times adds, and like that lab, isn't expected to launch until 2016. But once it's live, it'll be the coldest place in the known universe—even deep space between galaxies only reaches 3 Kelvin, or -454.27 degrees Fahrenheit, Geek.com points out, compared to the lab's 100 pico-Kelvin.

They are often credited with taking the first steps toward popularizing grunge music, and have continued to achieve critical and commercial success in the new millennium, with bands such as Fleet Foxes, Foals, Beach House, The Postal Service, Flight of the Conchords, Sleater-Kinney, Blitzen Trapper, No Age, Wolf Parade and The Shins on their roster. In 1995 the owners of Sub Pop sold a 49% stake of the label to the Warner Music Group. - Mogwai are a Scottish post-rock band, formed in 1995 in Glasgow. The band consists of Stuart Braithwaite (guitar, vocals), Barry Burns (guitar, piano, synthesizer, vocals), Dominic Aitchison (bass guitar), and Martin Bulloch (drums). The band typically compose lengthy guitar-based instrumental pieces that feature dynamic contrast, melodic bass guitar lines, and heavy use of distortion and effects. The band were for several years signed to renowned Glasgow indie label Chemikal Underground, and have been distributed by different labels such as Matador in the US and Play It Again Sam in the UK, but now use their own label Rock Action Records in the UK, and Sub Pop in North America. The band were frequently championed by John Peel from their early days, and recorded seven Peel Sessions between 1996 and 2004. Peel also recorded a brief introduction for the compilation \\"\\". - Post-rock is a form of experimental rock characterized by the influence and use of instruments commonly associated with rock, but using rhythms and \\"guitars as facilitators of timbre and textures\\" not traditionally found in rock. Post-rock bands are often instrumental. - Rhythm (from Greek , \\"rhythmos\\", \\"any regular recurring motion, symmetry\\" ) generally means a \\"movement marked by the regulated succession of strong and weak elements, or of opposite or different conditions\\" . This general meaning of regular recurrence or pattern in time can apply to a wide variety of cyclical natural phenomena having a periodicity or frequency of anything from microseconds to several seconds (as with the riff in a rock music song); to several minutes or hours, or, at the most extreme, even over many years. - In music, timbre (, also known as tone color or tone quality from psychoacoustics) is the perceived sound quality of a musical note, sound, or tone that distinguishes different types of sound production, such as choir voices and musical instruments, such as string instruments, wind instruments, and percussion instruments, and which enables listeners to hear even different instruments from the same category as different (e.g. a viola and a violin). - \`\` Friend of the Night '' is a song by Glaswegian post-rock band , Mogwai from their 2006 album , Mr. Beast . It was released as a single on 30 January 2006 , and became the first Mogwai single to reach the UK top 40 singles chart , peaking at # 38 . - Chemikal Underground is an independent record label set up in 1994 by Glasgow, Scotland rock band The Delgados. It was set up to release their first single, \\"Monica Webster\\" / \\"Brand New Car\\" and went on to break many new Scottish bands in the nineties. - Rock Action Records is a Glasgow-based record label, founded and maintained by Scottish post-rock band Mogwai. The label has showcased such diverse talents as Part Chimp, Errors, Trout, The James Orr Complex and Kling Klang, has licensed music for UK release from Torche, Envy, Afrirampo and Growing, and in the past represented Papa M and The Zephyrs. As of 2010, Mogwai have released their own records on the label in the UK and Europe. - Glasgow is the largest city in Scotland, and third largest in the United Kingdom. Historically part of Lanarkshire, it is now one of the 32 council areas of Scotland. It is situated on the River Clyde in the country's West Central Lowlands. Inhabitants of the city are referred to as Glaswegians. - John Robert Parker Ravenscroft, OBE (30 August 1939 25 October 2004), known professionally as John Peel, was an English disc jockey, radio presenter, record producer and journalist.

The Redskins played a 4-0 Atlanta Falcons team for the second time in four years; they had previously hosted the 4-0 Falcons in the 2012 season, when Atlanta won 24-17 to move to 5-0 for the first time in franchise history. That game, coincidentally, was Kirk Cousins' first appearance in an NFL game. Three years later, now as the starter, he was attempting to lead Washington to their first 3-2 start since 2011. He faced a stern test though, as his career TD-INT ratio on the road was 11-13, and he had never played in a road game without throwing at least one interception. Washington was only able to run four plays on their first drive before having to punt to Atlanta. The Falcons were able to cross midfield before quarterback Matt Ryan's pass to superstar receiver Julio Jones was tipped and intercepted by Redskins safety Trenton Robinson; it was Washington's first interception of the season. Nearing the end of a scoreless first quarter, the Redskins tried to accumulate some momentum in the running game, as their longest run so far had been only 4 yards. Alfred Morris and Matt Jones both saw action, but it was the passing game that began to heat up. The two longest plays on the drive were a 14-yard pass to Chris Thompson and a 21-yarder to Pierre Gar&#231;on. The drive culminated in tight end Derek Carrier's first career touchdown pass, a 7-yard throw from Cousins that gave the Redskins a 7-0 lead early in the second quarter. Atlanta responded with a methodical drive, including only 2 plays longer than 7 yards, to get on the board. Kicker Matt Bryant connected on a 42-yard field goal and the Falcons cut the deficit to 7-3. Washington's next drive was not as effective, with only one out of five plays gaining positive yards before Cousins threw deep and was intercepted by Falcons cornerback Robert Alford, who returned the ball into Redskins territory. Of the 8 career road games in which Cousins had now played, he totaled 14 interceptions, and had thrown at least one interception in each. The Falcons now needed to capitalize on the turnover, and advanced the ball to the Redskins' 23-yard-line, easily within field goal range. Defensive end Chris Baker had other ideas, sacking Ryan on 3rd and 3 and forcing a fumble, which was recovered by linebacker Will Compton. However, Atlanta regained possession with 1:39 left and all three of their timeouts. Running back Devonta Freeman and tight end Jacob Tamme helped get the Falcons into field goal range, but Bryant missed a short 38-yard attempt, bouncing the ball off of the right upright. Entering halftime, undefeated Atlanta trailed Washington 7-3 at home. The Falcons began the second half aggressively, throwing on 6 of their first 7 plays. This got them into field goal range. Bryant attempted to redeem himself for the earlier miss, but this kick bounced off the left upright. The ensuing Redskins drive utilized several short Cousins passes to get into field goal range, although Hopkins missed the 53-yard attempt. Atlanta crossed midfield on their next drive, and faced a decision on 4th-and-6 from the Redskins' 40-yard-line, just outside of Bryant's range. Ryan threw to Jones, his most reliable target, for a gain of 9 and the first down. Two plays later, Bashaud Breeland was called for a horse-collar tackle, which moved the ball from the Redskins' 30-yard-line to the 15. This was close enough for Bryant to convert a field goal, and Atlanta had crept within one of Washington, 7-6. Still unable to move the ball effectively, the Redskins went three-and-out to give the ball back to Atlanta. Washington then struggled on defense as well, allowing 4 plays of 10+ yards. Chris Baker forced a Freeman fumble at the goal line, but Julio Jones jumped on the ball in the endzone for the go-ahead score. Falcons first-year head coach Dan Quinn opted to attempt a two-point conversion to go up by a full seven points, but Ryan's pass fell incomplete to keep the lead at 12-7. The Atlanta drive covered 91 yards in just 11 plays, and now only 9 minutes remained in the game. With their lead gone, and having been shut out in the second half, the Redskins began a crucial drive from their own 20-yard-line. A 10-yard pass and a 26-yard pass, both to rookie receiver Jamison Crowder, were followed by a deep attempt to fellow rookie Rashad Ross. The ball fell incomplete, but Atlanta defensive back Robert Alford was assessed a 42-yard pass interference penalty that gave Washington the ball on the 2-yard line. On the next play, Matt Jones completed the all-rookie drive with a touchdown, allowing Washington to regain the lead, 13-12. Redskins coach Jay Gruden attempted a two-point conversion to extend the margin to a field goal, but it, like the Falcons' attempt, fell incomplete. Atlanta then committed a surprising turnover, a Ryan pass intercepted by Breeland, who returned the ball all the way back to the Atlanta 21-yard-line. This allowed the Redskins to extend the lead to 16-12, significant because Atlanta now needed a touchdown to win instead of a field goal. Atlanta's next 6 plays covered 67 yards, followed by an apparent 13-yard touchdown pass on 3rd and 2; however, the play was later ruled an incomplete pass because Freeman did not maintain possession of the ball as he fell to the ground. The Falcons had to convert the next play, a 4th and 2, to keep any hope of a perfect season. Veteran receiver Roddy White made the catch, and Freeman redeemed himself on the next play with a touchdown, resulting in a 19-16 Falcons lead. They had run the clock down to 24 seconds, leaving almost no time for the Redskins to respond, but Washington still had all three timeouts. Their next three plays, gains of 20, 19, and 7 to Carrier, Garcon, and Crowder, took only 19 seconds, leaving 5 seconds for a 52-yard attempt at a game-tying field goal. Hopkins drilled the kick, tying the game at 19-19, and the game went into overtime. In 24 previous meetings, dating back to 1966, the Redskins and Falcons had never gone into overtime, and Atlanta had won the last four meetings. The Redskins won the coin toss and began overtime on offense. A Crowder 17-yard catch moved them near midfield, only needing about 20 more yards to get into Hopkins' range. Three plays later, though, Cousins attempted to pass to rookie receiver Ryan Grant, but Grant slipped on the route, allowing Robert Alford to intercept the pass and return it 59 yards for a touchdown, a 25-19 Falcons win, and their second 5-0 start in franchise history. For the Redskins, the heartbreaking loss was the second time in four seasons they had lost to Atlanta in Week 5 by 7 points or fewer. Cousins moved to 0-3 in his career against the Falcons and threw the 15th career interception on the road in only 8 games. In each of Washington's three losses, Cousins had thrown 2 interceptions; in their two wins, he had not thrown any. Based on the above article, answer a question.

A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress.

Choose your answer from: -no. -yes.","completion":"The process of manufacturing laptop chargers by Sony and Apple may share similarities. However, they are not the same due to differences in the products and the companies themselves. So, the answer to your question is: no. First, let's look at how Sony makes laptop chargers: Sony, a Japanese multinational conglomerate, has its charger manufacturing process well-established to meet high-quality standards for their products. The process of making laptop chargers includes several stages: 1. Design and Development: Sony engineers work together to design the charger with the competing factors of size, output voltage, and current in mind. Their goal is to create a charger that provides the necessary output while remaining compact and durable. 2. Material Selection: High-quality components and materials, such as transformers, capacitors, diodes, and resistors, must be selected to ensure the charger can withstand prolonged usage without failure. 3. Manufacturing: During the manufacturing phase, the electronic components are assembled onto a printed circuit board (PCB). Soldering techniques, automated machines, and quality control measures are employed to ensure the safe and proper assembly of the charger. 4. Testing: Each charger undergoes a series of tests, including stress tests, electrical tests, and safety tests, to ensure it meets quality requirements. 5. Packaging: Finally, the chargers are packaged and prepared for shipment to various locations worldwide. Now let's look at how Apple makes laptop chargers: Apple, an American multinational technology company, is known for its sleek and innovative product designs. The process of making laptop chargers at Apple also involves several stages: 1. Design and Development: Apple's design team creates chargers with aesthetic appeal, convenience, and technological advancement in mind. The company is known for its innovations, such as the MagSafe connector, which was unique to Apple chargers and provided a magnetic attachment. 2. Material Selection: As with Sony, high-quality components and materials must be selected to build a reliable and long-lasting charger. Apple also emphasizes using environmentally friendly materials in their manufacturing processes. 3. Manufacturing: Apple outsources its manufacturing to contract manufacturers like Foxconn, who assemble the charger components onto a printed circuit board. The process involves soldering, automated machinery, and strict quality control measures to ensure each charger meets Apple's standards. 4. Testing: Similar to Sony, laptop chargers made by Apple also undergo a series of tests, including electrical and safety tests, to meet compliance standards and ensure product quality. 5. Packaging: Apple's chargers are then packaged in their recognizable minimalist packaging and shipped globally. In conclusion, while both Sony and Apple produce laptop chargers through similar steps, the design, technological innovations, and company-specific process details make these two questions different.

Nobody as yet can give a correct answer to this question. However, tests have shown that lack of sleep over about four weeks leads to a strong drop in body temperature, great weight loss and finally sickness. Different people need different amounts of sleep. Eight hours a night is considered the average amount of sleep. For teenagers the least number of sleeping hours advised by doctors are ten hours for primary school students, nine for junior highs and eight for senior highs. Some people seem to get along just fine with very little sleep at night. Leading American scientist Thomas Edison said that sleep was a waste of time. He did, however, take naps during the day. On the other hand, Albert Einstein, another great scientist, said he needed at least ten hours' sleep a night. Here are some of the most useful suggestions, for a good night's sleep.

Input: Passage: The Sack of Brescia took place on February 18, 1512 during the War of the League of Cambrai. The city of Brescia had revolted against French control, garrisoning itself with Venetian troops. Gaston de Foix, recently arrived to command the French armies in Italy, ordered the city to surrender; when it refused, he attacked it with around 12,000 men. The French attack took place in a pouring rain, through a field of mud; Foix ordered his men to remove their shoes for better traction. The defenders inflicted heavy casualties on the French, but were eventually overrun, suffering 8,000 - 15,000 casualties. The Gascon infantry and landsknechts then proceeded to thoroughly sack the city, massacring thousands of civilians over the next five days. Following this, the city of Bergamo paid some 60,000 ducats to the French to avoid a similar fate. Output:","completion":"1.

Billie Jo (our daughter) was probably around ten years old when it happened. We had a young Black Labrador dog who had become quite smitten with chewing things up that she wasn't supposed to. The list grew longer as the months passed. Looker, our black lab, had chewed up and eaten a 10 bill, my VCR remote control (probably around 1987), and a sticker-filled blackberry vine my wife had planted. How she did that one without serious repercussions is beyond me. She also had a habit of grabbing the mail as it slid through the slot that was in our front door, taking it out back and 'sorting' it for us. So what happened really came as no big surprise. My daughter was a very diligent student, never wanting to let down her teachers by not turning her homework in as soon as she got to school (at least until she hit 14). One morning our daughter was trying to find the math homework that she knew she had completed the night before. My wife assisted in the search and soon found a partially chewed up piece of our daughter's homework page. Our daughter was devastated! How could she possibly walk in to school and publicly announce, “My dog ate my homework!” without becoming the laughing stock of the school? Like this: Mama Bear (my wife) storms into the classroom and vehemently upholds our daughter's “dog ate my homework” bit, showing the teacher the half eaten paper. Funny thing was, the teacher would have never doubted our little girl for one minute. Back then, Billie Jo was the sweetest, cutest, most polite and well mannered child a parent could possibly hope for. And her teachers loved her.

Einstein was displeased with quantum theory and mechanics (the very theory he helped create), despite its acceptance by other physicists, stating that God \\"is not playing at dice.\\" Einstein continued to maintain his disbelief in the theory, and attempted unsuccessfully to disprove it until he died at the age of 76. In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser. This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws. Einstein discovered Louis de Broglie's work, and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first.

One day, ahot spring causes Graboid eggs to hatch, resulting in the death of 17 miners. Hiram Gummer, great-grandfather of Burt Gummer (Michael Gross) and the mine's owner, arrives in town to fix the problem. After Graboids attack his camp one night, he is shocked by their presence. One of his companions, Juan, kills one with a pickax, and the pair escapes. Inexperienced and not fond with firearms, Hiram calls for a gunfighter, Black Hand Kelly (Billy Drago). Hiram and Kelly do not get along well, though Kelly succeeds in conveying to Hiram some of his attitude towards firearms and life in general. Eventually, Kelly is eaten alive but not before discovering that a total of four Graboids have hatched. Hiram decides to abandon Rejection and leave the townsfolk to their fate. However, they force him to give them the silver mine, threatening to alert potential buyers to the danger if he sells it out from under them. In Carson City, Hiram hears a telegram revealing that the fully-grown Graboids have made it through the pass and are headed for the town. Changing his mind, he buys weapons, heads back to Rejection to lead a last stand against the Graboids, and helps the town ready itself. After two Graboids are killed, the third and final one adapts and avoids all of the traps. Hiram tricks it into coming to the surface and then attaches it by the tail to the wheel of a steam traction engine. The Graboid is reeled in and slammed against the wheel with such force that it is explosively decapitated on impact.

Background: Pfeiffer was born in Santa Ana, California, the second of four children of Richard Pfeiffer, an air-conditioning contractor, and Donna (nee Taverna), a housewife. She has one elder brother, Rick (born 1955), and two younger sisters, Dedee Pfeiffer (born 1964), a television and film actress, and Lori Pfeiffer (born 1965). Her parents were both originally from North Dakota. Her paternal grandfather was of German ancestry and her paternal grandmother was of English, Welsh, French, Irish, and Dutch descent, while her maternal grandfather was of Swiss-German descent and her maternal grandmother of Swedish ancestry. Context: Pfeiffer's subsequent career choices have met with varying degrees of success. After The Age of Innocence, she played the role of Laura Alden opposite Jack Nicholson in Wolf (1994), a horror film that garnered a mixed critical reception. The New York Times wrote: \\"Ms. Pfeiffer's role is underwritten, but her performance is expert enough to make even diffidence compelling\\". The movie grossed US65 million (equivalent to 107.3 million) at the domestic box office and US131 million worldwide (equivalent to 216.3 million). Her next role was that of high school teacher and former US Marine LouAnne Johnson in the surprise box office hit Dangerous Minds (1995), which was co-produced under Pfeiffer's film production company Via Rosa Productions. She appeared as her character in the music video for the soundtrack's lead single, \\"Gangsta's Paradise\\" by Coolio (featuring L.V.), which was used by the producer Jerry Bruckheimer for television advertising. A 60-second version was aired on music channels, while a 30-second cut was aired in the rest of the networks. The song won the 1996 Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance, and the video won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Rap Video. In 1996, she turned down the Golden Globe Award-winning role of Eva Peron in the biopic Evita, which went to Madonna. Pfeiffer then portrayed Sally Atwater in the romantic drama Up Close & Personal (1996) opposite Robert Redford. The film's screenplay, co-written by husband and wife team John Gregory Dunne and Joan Didion, was intended to be a biographical account of the career of news anchor Jessica Savitch, but the final version had almost nothing to do with Savitch's life, leading Dunne to write an expose of his eight-year battle with the Hollywood producers, Monster: Living Off the Big Screen. She took the role of Gillian Lewis in To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday (1996), which was adapted by her husband David Kelley from Michael Brady's play of the same name. Pfeiffer and her producing partner Guinzburg were on a winning streak of producing three back to back films next under their Via Rosa Productions header that included, One Fine Day (1996), A Thousand Acres (1997) and The Deep End of the Ocean (1998). She served as an executive producer and starred as the divorced single mother architect Melanie Parker in the romantic comedy One Fine Day (1996) opposite George Clooney, Subsequent performances included Rose Cook Lewis in the film adaptation of Jane Smiley's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel A Thousand Acres (1997) with Jessica Lange and Jennifer Jason Leigh; Beth Cappadora in The Deep End of the Ocean (1998) about a married couple who found their son who was kidnapped nine years ago; Titania the Queen of the Fairies in A Midsummer Night's Dream (1999) with Kevin Kline, Rupert Everett and Stanley Tucci; and Katie Jordan in Rob Reiner's comedy-drama The Story of Us (1999) opposite Bruce Willis.

The President is elected by the Council of Representatives by a two-thirds majority, and is limited to two four-year terms. The President is responsible for ratifying treaties and laws passed by the Council of Representatives, issues pardons on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, and performs the \\"duty of the Higher Command of the armed forces for ceremonial and honorary purposes\\". - The Prime Minister of Iraq is Iraq's head of government. Prime Minister was originally an appointed office, subsidiary to the head of state, and the nominal leader of the Iraqi parliament. Under the newly adopted constitution the Prime Minister is to be the country's active executive authority. Nouri al-Maliki (formerly Jawad al-Maliki) was selected to be Prime Minister on 21 April 2006. On 14 August 2014 al-Maliki agreed to step down as prime minister of Iraq to allow Haider al-Abadi to take his place. - Iraq (, or ; '; '), officially known as the Republic of Iraq ('; ') is a country in Western Asia, bordered by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest, and Syria to the west. The capital, and largest city, is Baghdad. The main ethnic groups are Arabs and Kurds; others include Assyrians, Turkmen, Shabakis, Yazidis, Armenians, Mandeans, Circassians, and Kawliya. Around 95% of the country's 36 million citizens are Muslims, with Christianity, Yarsan, Yezidism, and Mandeanism also present. The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish. - Nouri Kamil Mohammed Hasan al-Maliki (born 20 June 1950), also known as Jawad al-Maliki or Abu Esraa, is an Iraqi politician who was Prime Minister of Iraq from 2006 to 2014. He is secretary-general of the Islamic Dawa Party and a Vice President of Iraq from 2014 to 2015. - Saddam Hussein Abd al-Majid al-Tikriti (Arabic: \\"\\"; 28 April 1937 30 December 2006) was the fifth President of Iraq, serving in this capacity from 16 July 1979 until 9 April 2003. A leading member of the revolutionary Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, and later, the Baghdad-based Ba'ath Party and its regional organization the Iraqi Ba'ath Partywhich espoused Ba'athism, a mix of Arab nationalism and socialismSaddam played a key role in the 1968 coup (later referred to as the 17 July Revolution) that brought the party to power in Iraq. - A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch. - Baghdad is the capital of the Republic of Iraq. The population of Baghdad, , is approximately 7.216.040 making it the largest city in Iraq, the second largest city in the Arab world (after Cairo, Egypt), and the second largest city in Western Asia (after Tehran, Iran). - Haider Jawad Kadhim Al - Abadi ( or al - ' Ibadi ; Arabic : , born 25 April 1952 ) is an Iraqi politician who has been Prime Minister of Iraq since 2014 .

Daraar is a 1996 Indian thriller film directed by Abbas-Mustan starring Juhi Chawla, Rishi Kapoor and Arbaaz Khan in his film debut. Khan received the Filmfare Best Villain Award for his portrayal as a possessive husband. The film became average at the box office and was inspired by the Julia Roberts thriller \\"Sleeping with the Enemy\\".","completion":"Based on the text provided, it is difficult to definitively determine if Daraar is Arbaaz Khan's most successful role. However, we can analyze the available information to make a more informed assessment. In Daraar, Arbaaz Khan made his film debut and won the Filmfare Best Villain Award for his portrayal of a possessive husband. This achievement suggests that his performance in the film was critically acclaimed and recognized with an important award. The film itself was declared average at the box office, which indicates that while not a blockbuster commercial hit, it still had some level of success. Additionally, Daraar was inspired by the Julia Roberts thriller \\"Sleeping with the Enemy,\\" which could mean that the source material and general theme of the film had a proven track record of attractiveness to audiences. However, simply winning an award for his debut role doesn't necessarily constitute Arbaaz Khan's most successful role. Success can be measured in various ways such as commercial success, critical acclaim, personal satisfaction, or lasting impact on the industry. To truly determine whether Daraar is Arbaaz Khan's most successful role, more information about his career, other film roles, and achievements would be required. In conclusion, based on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively say if Daraar is Arbaaz Khan's most successful role. While his award-winning performance is a significant achievement, a more comprehensive analysis of his entire career would be necessary to make this determination."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Weak start, solid middle, fantastic finish. That's my impression of this film, anyway. I liked Simon Pegg in the two films I've seen him in--- Hot Fuzz, and Shaun of the Dead. His role here, though, took a completely different turn. Shows his range as an actor, but nonetheless I really disliked th character as he was portrayed at the beginning. There's a kind of humour I call \\"frustration comedy.\\" Its supposed \\"jokes\\" and wit are really nothing more than painful and awkward moments. Much like the Bean character Rowan Atkinmson plays. There are a number of other comedic actors who portray similar characters too. I don't mean to bash them here, so will not. But do be warned that if you are like me, and you dislike smarmy and maddeningly bungling idiots, Pegg shows just such characteristics for the first third of this film. It DOES get better, however. I read somewhere that this is based on a true story. Hmmm. Maybe. The film's story stopped being annoying, and became kind of a triumph of the \\"little guy\\" in the final third. I don't need all films to be sugar and light--- but coincidentally, as this film got better, it also started to be more and more of a happy ending. It was also a pleasure to see an old favourite, Jeff Bridges, play a role so masterfully. I liked \\"Iron Man,\\" but was saddened by the fact that Bridges' character was a villain. Purely personal taste, of course, as his acting in that was superb. Nonetheless, he was a marvel here as the Bigger Than Life man of vision, the publisher of Sharps. It was nice to see him in a role that I could actually enjoy. Overall then, I liked it! I just wish I had come in 40 minutes late, and missed the beginning. Would you say this review is positive or negative?","completion":"This review can be considered as a mixed one, leaning more towards positive. The reviewer starts off describing their dislike for Simon Pegg's character at the beginning of the film but later states that it gets better, and they end up appreciating the triumph of the \\"little guy\\" and the happy ending. The reviewer also enjoyed Jeff Bridges' performance and liked the film overall but wished they had missed the beginning.

Step 3: Assess the evidence The baby having his dad's glasses in his mouth could indicate various things, such as the baby is exploring objects around him, wants attention, or simply likes the texture. Step 4: Consider alternative explanations One possible explanation for the baby having glasses in his mouth is that the baby is teething, meaning his teeth are growing in and he feels discomfort. It is common for teething babies to chew on objects to help relieve their discomfort.

Intel delivers updated Itanium 2 chips Gunning for markets that have long been the domain of RISC-based systems, Intel yesterday delivered updated Itanium 2 processors with larger memory caches. What is this text about?","completion":"This text discusses Intel's release of updated Itanium 2 processors designed to compete in markets traditionally dominated by RISC-based systems. By incorporating larger memory caches into the processors, Intel aims to gain a strategic advantage in these markets. To provide a detailed and long answer, we'll take a step-by-step approach: 1. Introduction to Itanium Processor: The Itanium processor family is a series of 64-bit processors developed by Intel in collaboration with Hewlett-Packard (HP). These processors use the Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC) architecture, which enables better parallelism and instruction-level parallelism for superior performance. Itanium processors are typically used in high-end server and workstation environments where high performance, large memory addressability, and reliability are crucial. 2. RISC-based systems: RISC stands for Reduced Instruction Set Computing and is a processor design that emphasizes a simplified set of instructions with an intent to improve performance. RISC-based systems have historically been popular in high-performance computing, server and workstation markets, which value their speed and efficiency. Some popular RISC architectures are ARM, PowerPC, and MIPS. 3. The competition between Itanium and RISC-based systems: Before the release of the updated Itanium 2 processors mentioned in the text, markets that required powerful computing capabilities heavily relied on RISC-based systems. These systems were generally faster and easier to implement, thereby becoming the preferred choice over Intel's Itanium processors for high-performance computing applications. 4. The launch of updated Itanium 2 processors: To gain a foothold in the market dominated by RISC-based systems, Intel released updated versions of its Itanium 2 processors. The primary improvement in these updated processors was the inclusion of larger memory caches. Memory caches are crucial for improving performance in processors, as they help in reducing the latency involved with processing data by storing frequently used instructions or data, speeding up the CPU's overall function. 5. Importance of larger memory caches: By incorporating larger memory caches in the updated Itanium 2 processors, Intel aimed to enhance the performance of their chips, making them more competent contenders against RISC-based systems. Larger caches allow for better storage of frequently accessed data, leading to reduced latency and a faster processing speed. This improvement can give Intel's processors an edge over their RISC-based counterparts, allowing them to grab a share of the high-performance computing market. In conclusion, the text refers to Intel's introduction of updated Itanium 2 processors, featuring larger memory caches, to make strides in markets predominantly occupied by RISC-based systems. This move was intended to improve the performance of the Itanium processors, making them more competitive contenders against RISC-designed architectures in high-performance computing applications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Romans are known for the great number of deities they honored, a capacity that earned the mockery of early Christian polemicists. The presence of Greeks on the Italian peninsula from the beginning of the historical period influenced Roman culture, introducing some religious practices that became as fundamental as the cult of Apollo. The Romans looked for common ground between their major gods and those of the Greeks (interpretatio graeca), adapting Greek myths and iconography for Latin literature and Roman art.

From the moment I first came across \\"The Stone Boy\\", something told me it would be a great film. In spite of that, it seemed very unlikely that I'd ever have the opportunity to actually see it for myself. Then, one day, while looking through the online catalogue of my local library, I saw that they had recently purchased the DVD release of this film. Which I'm extremely glad for, because the cinematography is of a stunning depth and quality that an old VHS copy could never replicate. And speaking of the cinematography, I must single it out as far and above the most stunning aspect of this film. As a photographer who pursues very nearly the exact visual style portrayed in \\"The Stone Boy\\", I'm a firm believer in the fact that a great cinematographer can almost single-handedly carry a film. Here, he has a lot of help from an extremely talented cast, and a director who understands perfectly what the story needs. But to have Juan Ruiz Anchía behind the camera makes virtually every scene something of beauty. And you can almost never say that. Most films would never even expect such a thing of you. Scene after scene captures some detail, some little bit of visual magic that takes your breath away. The director, Christopher Cain, has had a long and interesting career. As far as I can gather, this film is not very representative of it. But, sometimes, to catch a director near the beginnings of his career, before all the big budgets and loss of focus, there's a real subtle magic to be found. Cain steps back in this film, lets things happen with a life of their own, and then ever further. Much like early John Sayles films, characters are given space to breathe, time to talk. Side stories happen because they do, and that's how life is. Cain displays a remarkable, raw, even outright painful understanding of human nature in this film. The acting ties much of this story together. When people talk, when they exist in this film, they do so as actual people, not held back by the fact that they are playing characters. Gina Berriault's script allows immensely talented and respected actors like Wilford Brimley, Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Frederic Forrest to spend time simply existing. Whether the things they have to say are minor or of deep significance, it all comes down with the weight of pure reality. When you look at the actors involved, or the great soundtrack by James Horner, it seems strange that such a film be very nearly forgotten. Maybe much of what makes \\"The Stone Boy\\" what it is was the time period it was made in. There's this 1970s hangover feeling to this picture that reminds me deeply of my own childhood. People talk of the 80s in terms of modern styles and music, but that's not the 80s I lived in or remember. The look of the images, the understated and dark knowing quality of the acting, and the overall result should get under the skin of any person who grew up in or near this era of time in North America. I see myself in this. I see how I saw the world. And a film like \\"The Stone Boy\\" sees the world for how it truly is. For more of this feeling, please see: The Black Stallion (1979), Never Cry Wolf (1983), Tender Mercies (1983), Testament (1983), Places in the Heart (1984), Matewan (1987), High Tide (1987), Driving Miss Daisy (1989), The Secret Garden (1993), The Secret of Roan Inish (1994), Wendy and Lucy (2008) Would you say this review is positive or negative?","completion":"This review is definitely positive.

Please answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him. Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump has... After the story ends, Comey probably: - returns to the FBI after a few months - not enough information - Does not return to working for the FBI ever - works for a restaurant chain Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided and the circumstances surrounding Comey's firing and subsequent events, it is most likely that James Comey does not return to working for the FBI ever. To elaborate on this assessment, it is essential to consider the following points: 1. Tense relationship with Trump: The relationship between Comey and President Trump was strained, as evidenced by the harsh criticisms and insults exchanged between them. Trump's public condemnation of Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball\\" and his comment that it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him make it highly improbable that Comey would be welcomed back into the FBI under Trump's administration. 2. Comey's book and allegations: Comey's memoir, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" criticizes Trump on several fronts, accusing him of being unethical, unfit to lead, and demanding personal loyalty over professional duties. By writing this book and making such serious accusations against the president, Comey has further distanced himself from any possibility of returning to the FBI. 3. Appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel: Following Comey's firing, Robert Mueller was appointed as the special counsel to oversee the Russia investigation. This development confirmed that the investigation would continue and has since expanded to include possible obstruction of justice by Trump due to Comey's firing. Given this context, it is unlikely that Comey would be brought back into the FBI, as it could imply political influence or interference in the ongoing investigation. 4. Future career prospects: After leaving such a high-profile position within the FBI and given the controversy surrounding his dismissal, it is more probable that Comey may pursue opportunities in other professional fields, such as academia, private sector consulting, or even starting his own ventures, rather than working for a restaurant chain as suggested. In conclusion, taking into account the contentious relationship between Comey and Trump, the accusations made in his memoir, and the ongoing Mueller investigation, it is most plausible that James Comey does not return to working for the FBI ever. His future career moves may involve exploring new fields or leveraging his extensive experience in law enforcement and national security in other capacities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The affected markets account for 10% of revenues, the company said. Last month McDonalds suspended sales of its nuggets in Hong Kong amid concerns about an American owned meat supplier. Its supplies came from Shanghai Husi Food, whose operations have been suspended by regulators after local media reports claimed it re-processed out-of-date meat. Shanghai Husi Food is a subsidiary of the US meat processor, OSI - one of America's largest privately owned companies.

Summarize this article: Eye contact and smiling are two universal acts of flirting. Looking at someone from across a room lets them know that you notice them. When you smile, you're showing them that you are open to talking to them and that you may be interested in them, or that you like how they look. Don't force a smile or stare at them, however! You can meet a potential date at school, work, a grocery store, a bar, or in other social situations. Smiling also releases endorphins that make you happier and can make other people react in a positive way. Maintain eye contact for two to three seconds before looking away. If you look back and the person is still looking in your direction, this is a good sign that they meant to lock eyes with you. You can tell a lot just by the way someone looks at you or carries themselves. For example, if they point their feet toward you or lean in your direction, they may be interested in you. If they cross their arms and legs or point their knees away from you, they are not interested in you. Other signs include: If the person smiles back, it's a good indicator that they wouldn't mind your company. If they hold your gaze for more than two seconds, it's a good sign that they would talk to you. If they avoid your gaze, look uncomfortable, or avoid you altogether, this is a sign that they aren't interested. Once you've evaluated that they like your attention, you can introduce yourself. Walk up to them with confidence by standing upright and keeping your shoulders back. Start by offering a handshake and saying hello. Begin the conversation by asking for their name or talking about something relatable. For example, you can say something like, \\"Hey, my name's Alex. This band rocks. What do you think of them?\\" Pay close attention to their body language and facial expressions. If they look disgusted, disinterested, or frightened, you may not want to introduce yourself. Once you've introduced yourself to them and they appear receptive to you, you can start a conversation. Start by asking small questions, like how their day is so far or if they live in the area. If the conversation seems like it's stalling, ask them questions about themselves. Practice active listening by paying close attention to what the person has to say and where they are coming from. Improve your communication and listening skills by providing feedback, deferring judgemental thoughts, and responding appropriately. Instead of waiting for your turn to say something, internalize and listen to what the person is saying and show them that you're invested in the conversation. You can enhance your listening skills by summarizing or repeating something that the person said. For example, if they explain how they liked a band before they went mainstream, you can say something like, \\"So what you're saying is that you liked their underground sound more than their poppy new music, right?\\" Some good starter questions include: What do you like to do in your spare time? What kind of music do you prefer? Are you a student? Do you like art? or What's your favorite movie? Don't plainly ask the question by itself. Integrate it into the conversation. For example say, \\"I just saw the new Guillermo Del Toro film and thought it was amazing. What movies do you like?\\" If you listen to what they have to say, you'll determine whether the person would be interested in seeing you again. If they mention a significant other, then they will most likely not go on a date with you. If they seem happy and enthusiastic to talk to you, then it's likely they want to see you again. If they avoid eye contact altogether and have short responses, you should take this as a sign to leave. If they seem comfortable and happy while talking to you, it's a good hint that they will say yes if you ask them out. Ask them for their contact information first, then see how they feel about meeting up with you later. It may be stressful to ask the question, but don't wait too long to ask, or you may never get the opportunity. You can say something like, \\"I had a fun time talking to you. Do you want to do this again?\\"","completion":"This article explains the importance of eye contact, smiling, and body language in the flirting process.

Fonda made his mark early as a Broadway actor. He also appeared in 1938 in plays performed in White Plains, New York, with Joan Tompkins. He made his Hollywood debut in 1935, and his career gained momentum after his Academy Award-nominated performance as Tom Joad in The Grapes of Wrath, a 1940 adaptation of John Steinbeck's novel about an Oklahoma family who moved west during the Dust Bowl. At age 20, Fonda started his acting career at the Omaha Community Playhouse, when his mother's friend Dodie Brando (mother of Marlon Brando) recommended that he try out for a juvenile part in You and I, in which he was cast as Ricky. He was fascinated by the stage, learning everything from set construction to stage production, and embarrassed by his acting ability. When he received the lead in Merton of the Movies, he realized the beauty of acting as a profession, as it allowed him to deflect attention from his own tongue-tied personality and create stage characters relying on someone else's scripted words. Fonda decided to quit his job and go east in 1928 to seek his fortune. He arrived on Cape Cod and played a minor role at the Cape Playhouse in Dennis, Massachusetts. A friend took him to Falmouth, MA where he joined and quickly became a valued member of the University Players, an intercollegiate summer stock company. There he worked with Margaret Sullavan, his future wife. James Stewart joined the Players a few months after Fonda left, though they were soon to become lifelong friends. Fonda left the Players at the end of their 1931-1932 season after appearing in his first professional role in The Jest, by Sem Benelli. Joshua Logan, a young sophomore at Princeton who had been double-cast in the show, gave Fonda the part of Tornaquinci, \\"an elderly Italian man with a long white beard and even longer hair.\\" Also in the cast of The Jest with Fonda and Logan were Bretaigne Windust, Kent Smith, and Eleanor Phelps. The tall (6 ft, 1.5 in) Fonda headed for New York City, to be with his then wife, Margaret Sullavan. The marriage was brief, but when James Stewart came to New York his luck changed. Getting contact information from Joshua Logan, Jimmy, as he was called, found Hank Fonda and these small town boys found they had a lot in common, as long as they didn't discuss politics. The two men became roommates and honed their skills on Broadway. Fonda appeared in theatrical productions from 1926 to 1934. They fared no better than many Americans in and out of work during the Great Depression, sometimes lacking enough money to take the subway.

He was really good at running with the ball and dodging all the other players who were trying to catch him. Everyone loved to watch him play because he was so exciting and talented! But one day, during an important game, something sad happened. While Adrian was running super fast with the ball, another player tried to stop him. In this big, fast chase, Adrian's ankle got hurt. An ankle is a part of your leg that connects your foot to your leg, and it's really important for running and walking. Adrian's ankle hurt really, really bad, so he couldn't play in the game anymore. His team's helpers needed to bring a special cart to help him leave the field. A cart is like a small car for people who are hurt or can't walk well and need help to move around. Everyone in the stadium felt sad and worried about Adrian because they wanted him to play and to be okay. After the game, the doctors and team helpers checked on Adrian's ankle to see what was wrong and how to help him feel better. They will take extra good care of him and make sure he gets lots of rest and treatment so his ankle can heal quickly. If all goes well, Adrian will be back playing and running with the ball soon, making everyone excited to watch him again! That's the story of how Adrian Peterson had to leave the game because his ankle hurt. Remember, even the strongest and fastest people can get hurt sometimes, but with the right care, they can get better and continue doing the things they love."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who transcribed the music of an English composer?, using the article: In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in..., what would be the answer ?

To do this, we will subtract 762 from both sides of the equation. By performing the same operation on both sides of the equation, we maintain the equality. -80*c + 762 - 762 = 122 - 762 This simplifies to: -80*c = -640 Step 2: Solve for c by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable c, which is -80. To isolate c, we will divide both sides of the equation by -80. By doing this, we cancel out the -80 on the left side of the equation and isolate c.

To simplify, we add together the numbers on the right side: -132 + 167 = 35 So, our equation now becomes -5*n = 35. Step 2: Solve for n Now, we can solve for n by dividing both sides of the equation by -5. The mathematical reason for this is that it is the inverse operation of multiplication. Doing this will isolate the variable n to one side of the equation, which allows us to determine its value. Our equation becomes: -5*n / -5 = 35 / -5 Both -5's on the left side will cancel out, so n = 35 / -5. This further simplifies to n = -7.

RADIO ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE NATION THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. This weekend I am engaged in extensive sessions with members of my National Security Council, as we plan a comprehensive assault on terrorism. This will be a different kind of conflict against a different kind of enemy. This is a conflict without battlefields or beachheads, a conflict with opponents who believe they are invisible. Yet, they are mistaken. They will be exposed, and they will discover what others in the past have learned: Those who make war against the United States have chosen their own destruction. Victory against terrorism will not take place in a single battle, but in a series of decisive actions against terrorist organizations and those who harbor and support them. We are planning a broad and sustained campaign to secure our country and eradicate the evil of terrorism. And we are determined to see this conflict through. Americans of every faith and background are committed to this goal. Yesterday I visited the site of the destruction in New York City and saw an amazing spirit of sacrifice and patriotism and defiance. I met with rescuers who have worked past exhaustion, who cheered for our country and the great cause we have entered. In Washington, D.C., the political parties and both Houses of Congress have shown a remarkable unity, and I'm deeply grateful. A terrorist attack designed to tear us apart has instead bound us together as a nation.

For women especially, as you age you'll lose lean muscle mass and the amount of calories your body needs to support itself decreases.","completion":"In the next paragraph, we can discuss various ways to regulate calorie intake and maintain a balanced diet to help prevent menopause-related weight gain. Step-by-step process: 1. Research the ideal daily caloric intake: First, women going through menopause should figure out their ideal daily caloric intake based on their age, height, weight, and physical activity level to maintain or achieve their desired weight. 2. Create a meal plan: Next, women can create a well-balanced meal plan that provides adequate nutrition and satisfies their daily caloric intake. This meal plan should include a variety of whole foods, such as fruits, vegetables, lean protein, healthy fats, and whole grains. 3. Monitor portion sizes: It's vital for women to practice portion control and monitor serving sizes to prevent overeating and excess calorie consumption. 4. Choose nutrient-dense foods: Prioritize nutrient-dense foods over calorie-dense foods to ensure the body receives the necessary nutrients while supporting healthy weight management. 5. Practice mindful eating: Slowing down and paying attention to the body's hunger and satiety cues can help women become more aware of their calorie intake habits and prevent overeating. 6. Stay hydrated: Drinking enough water throughout the day can help in managing hunger levels, overall calorie intake, and preventing fluid retention that may contribute to weight gain. 7. Reduce consumption of processed foods: Limiting processed, sugary, and high-fat foods can help keep calorie intake in check and improve overall health. By slowly implementing these steps, women going through menopause can better regulate their calorie intake and manage weight gain associated with this phase of life."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in Japanese.

Context: Coming off their close win over the Colts, the Patriots flew to FedExField for an interconference duel with the Washington Redskins. The Patriots grabbed the early lead, when defensive tackle Vince Wilfork recovered a fumble off Redskins' quarterback Rex Grossman in the end zone for a touchdown. The Redskins responded with a 24-yard field goal by placekicker Graham Gano. The Patriots added to their lead, with quarterback Tom Brady throwing an 11-yard touchdown pass to tight end Rob Gronkowski. The Redskins countered, with Grossman throwing a 9-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jabar Gaffney, then grabbed the lead early in the second quarter, with wide receiver Brandon Banks throwing a 49-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Santana Moss. The Patriots tied the game with a 23-yard field goal by placekicker Stephen Gostkowski. The Redskins countered with a 25-yard field goal by Gano, and a 24-yard field goal by Gostskowski just before halftime tied the game at 20. The Patriots grabbed the lead early in the third quarter, with a 37-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Gronkowski, but the Redskins countered again, with Grossman throwing a 6-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver David Anderson. The final scoring play of the game came from the Patriots, with Brady connecting with wide receiver Wes Welker on a 24-yard touchdown. Both teams were held scoreless in the fourth quarter, which included linebacker Jerod Mayo intercepting Grossman at the Patriots' 5-yard line with 29 seconds remaining. Brady was intercepted in the Redskins endzone on a pass intended for Tiquan Underwood; Brady's sideline argument with Underwood led to a quick but spirited showdown with assistant coach Bill O'Brien that resulted in intervention by Bill Belichick - all of it caught by CBS Sports cameras.

Write some highlights for the following article: Rangers midfielder Lewis Macleod is determined to take all he can from his first experience in the full Scotland squad. The 20-year-old will spend the week training with Gordon Strachan's men ahead of their European Championship qualifier against the Republic of Ireland on Friday night and the friendly with England the following Tuesday. Macleod further enhanced his reputation with his eighth goal of the season on Saturday, heading home the second goal in a 4-0 Scottish Championship win over Falkirk after meeting Jon Daly's cross on the counter-attack. Rangers star Lewis MacLeod (centre) celebrates his goal during the 4-0 league win over Falkirk. He also set up the third for Kenny Miller with a low cross to the far post as Rangers remained four points behind leaders Hearts. His passing ability also helped Rangers put Falkirk on the back foot ahead of Nicky Law's 25th-minute opener, when the former Motherwell man forced the ball home after the visitors struggled to clear a corner. Macleod had sent Miller away to set up a break by drilling a 60-yard pass just inside the left touchline, and then arrived in the attack to thread a defence-splitting ball to the veteran forward, who saw his shot turned wide. Macleod poses with the Saltire after being called up for Scotland to face Republic of Ireland and England. Macleod has already featured for Scotland at Under 21 level as he takes on the Slovakia defence in September. It is such creativity that has earned him a place in the Scotland squad as Strachan continues to involve the country's promising young players. Hull left-back Andy Robertson utilised his chance to force his way into Strachan's regular plans, and although Macleod has a tougher position to break into, he aims to make sure he gives himself every chance. 'I don't expect to play but it will be a great experience training and you couldn't get two bigger games to be involved in,' Macleod said. 'If I get any game time at all I'll be more than happy. 'It's a massive step. It was a big step playing with the 21s and it will be hard but I'm looking forward to it. It can only benefit me.' The 20-year-old is a fast rising star and has been named October's SPFL young player of the month, thanks to performances such as at Livingston when he opened the scoring with an acrobatic effort. The likes of Miller and Kris Boyd have given Macleod some advice ahead of his first involvement. 'They have just told me to take it all in and enjoy every minute of it because, you never know, it could be your last time but hopefully it will be the first of many times,' said the midfielder. Macleod secured another accolade this weekend after helping Rangers win their eighth consecutive game when he was named SPFL young player of the month. 'It's been a great month and the team has played a lot better,' he said. 'The call-up came as a big surprise and I'm delighted with the award too.' Highlights:","completion":"1.

On Saturday night, \\"Whovians\\" (\\"Doctor Who\\" fans) finally got their first full look at Peter Capaldi in his role as the Twelfth Doctor (with no karaoke or mimes in sight). He almost literally landed with a splash, as we first saw him and companion Clara being swallowed by a dinosaur who ended up in 19th century London. Because, obviously. Here are five of our favorite moments of what was a spectacular season premiere. 1. The new Doctor himself. The Doctor was still in a bit of post-regenerative hysteria, which led to some hilarious lines. He also, of course, took a few shots at his new look, especially the eyebrows (\\"These are attack eyebrows! You can take bottle tops off with these!\\") and the fact that he's now Scottish. That was probably one of the biggest surprises: For a Doctor who is darker than the ones we're used to recently (he certainly doesn't have the wackiness of Matt Smith), there was a great deal of humor in the episode. When we saw his final costume toward the end of the episode, we've gotta say, the Twelfth Doctor is looking sharp. 2. Clara back how we remember her. When Clara first officially met the Doctor, she was in Victorian dress. Having ended up in the 19th century, she was dressed for the times once more. Whether it was a callback or not, the producers seemed to know that the look really suits Jenna Coleman (In fact, a lot of the memorable parts of this episode seemed to do with the clothes - see Madame Vastra and Jenny's battle gear as well). With a few episodes under her belt, Clara is the \\"veteran\\" of the show, and much of it revolved around her, especially with the Doctor being in a confused state for much of it. She had some trouble getting used to this new Doctor, having fallen for the last one (see below), but she had instant chemistry with the Twelfth. 3. The icky new villain. A restaurant where you're on the menu? The half-visaged android the Doctor met could give Hannibal Lecter a run for his money. Their face-off (sorry) toward the end was one of the most memorable confrontations in recent \\"Doctor Who\\" history as well. 4. A dinosaur in the Thames?! Not much to say here, except that tyrannosaurus rex was quite a way to kick off the season. 5. The Eleventh Doctor makes a call. The biggest surprise of them all was the Eleventh Doctor's time-shifted call to Clara at the end of the episode, asking her to take care of the new him. (Though he wasn't a big fan of looking old.) We'll miss you, Matt Smith! What were your favorite parts of the episode? Highlights:","completion":"1. Peter Capaldi's debut as the Twelfth Doctor: Capaldi's performance showcased a darker Doctor, yet still maintained humor throughout the episode. His new look, along with clever lines, brings a fresh perspective to the iconic character. 2. Clara's return in Victorian attire: Jenna Coleman's character, Clara, is shown in 19th century clothing once again, a nod to her first meeting with the Doctor. The storyline heavily revolves around her as she struggles to adapt to the new Doctor, but their chemistry is evident. 3. The chilling new villain: The half-faced android brings a sinister edge, creating one of the most memorable confrontations in \\"Doctor Who\\" history. The restaurant-themed premise adds a creepy touch. 4. A dinosaur in the Thames: The season premiere kicks off with an unexpected twist - a tyrannosaurus rex being swallowed by a dinosaur, transporting them to 19th century London. This scene captures the vivid imagination and excitement of the show. 5. The Eleventh Doctor's cameo: Matt Smith's surprise call to Clara at the end of the episode tugged at the heartstrings of fans, as he asks her to take care of his new incarnation. It was a touching tribute to his time on the show and a passing of the torch to Capaldi."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hint: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes.

Choices: (1). yes (2). it is not possible to tell (3). no And the answer is:","completion":"(2). it is not possible to tell The premise provided, \\"Individual Development Accounts for Low-Income Savers,\\" does not directly imply that low-income earners often spend the money as soon as they get it. Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) are savings accounts designed to help low-income individuals save for specific goals, such as education, homeownership, or starting a business. While the premise introduces a financial tool for low-income earners to help them save, it does not provide information about their spending habits. The hypothesis that low-income earners often spend the money as soon as they get it is not clearly entailed by the premise. The premise is focused on providing an opportunity for low-income savers to improve their financial situation, rather than addressing their spending habits. It is true that some low-income earners might struggle to save money and therefore spend it as soon as they get it, but this claim is not directly supported by the given premise. Furthermore, the presence of IDAs in the premise suggests that there is an effort to help low-income earners save and manage their money more effectively. However, this does not inherently mean they spend their money immediately upon receipt. Hence, it is not possible to tell if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, as the premise talks about a financial instrument for low-income earners to save, but does not address their spending patterns."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: As time passes, the number of HIV copies keeps increasing, while the number of helper T cells keeps decreasing. The graph in Figure below shows how the number of T cells typically declines over a period of many years following the initial HIV infection. As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. As a result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections. Medicines can slow down the virus but not get rid of it, so there is no cure at present for HIV infections or AIDS. There also is no vaccine to immunize people against HIV infection, but scientists are working to develop one. Now, I have a new situation: Robert and Justin are both patients in the hospital who are suffering complications from their HIV infections. The doctor is trying to get information from both men about their diseases so he can create customized treatment plans for both men. After a few questions, the doctor discovers that Robert has been infected with HIV for many years, while Justin's infection is quite recent. Answer this question please: Who will develop infections less frequently? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, Justin, who has a more recent HIV infection, will likely develop infections less frequently than Robert, who has been living with HIV for many years. Let's delve into the scientific basis behind the situation. The progression of HIV affects the immune system over time, specifically the T cells. T cells play an instrumental role in the body's ability to ward off infections and diseases. They are a type of white blood cell that circulates around our bodies, scanning for cellular abnormalities and infections. In an HIV infection, the virus attaches itself to these T cells and uses them to replicate and spread, damaging and eventually killing them in the process. From the information given, we understand that as time passes, the number of HIV copies in the body increases, while the number of helper T cells – which play a crucial role in the immune response – decreases. This leads to a decrease in the immune system's ability to defend the body, resulting in the development of more and frequent infections, a state known as immunodeficiency. So, if Robert has been infected with HIV for many years, his T cell count will likely be significantly lower than it was at the onset of his infection. This means that his immune system's ability to fend off infections is much more compromised than Justin's, who has a recent HIV infection. With a more robust T cell count, Justin's immune system is better equipped to combat infections. However, it's important to remember that the rate at which an HIV infection progresses can vary greatly from person to person. Some people may see a rapid decrease in T cells and a corresponding increase in infections soon after infection; for others, this process may take years. Justin's recent diagnosis does not guarantee immunity from regular infections, but statistically, he is likely to face lesser infections than Robert. Lastly, it's essential to keep in mind that medication adherence can significantly impact the course of HIV. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can suppress the virus to undetectable levels, slow disease progression, and prolong life. The likelihood of both Robert and Justin developing infections also will depend on how consistently they stick to their treatment plans, as well as the efficacy of the treatments themselves. Long-term HIV infection like Robert's can result in the virus developing resistance to certain medications, which can make managing the disease more challenging."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is used to inquire about the destination. - \\"my\\" (we) - This is a personal pronoun used to refer to the speaker and one or more other people considered together. - \\"chceme\\" (want) - This is a plural form of the verb \\"chtít\\" (to want). \\"Chceme\\" specifically is used when referring to multiple people wanting something. - \\"utéci\\" (to escape) - This is a verb derived from \\"utéct,\\" meaning \\"to escape\\" or \\"to run away.\\" \\"Utéci\\" is in the infinitive form, indicating that an action needs to be done. Putting it all together, the translated sentence, \\"Where do we want to escape to?\\" is a question asked by a speaker who wants to know the desired destination or location for them and others to escape or run away to.

Premise: \\"Derry's head snapped up.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Derry looked up.\\"?","completion":"If the premise \\"Derry's head snapped up\\" is true, it entails the hypothesis \\"Derry looked up\\" as a natural consequence since the action of someone's head snapping up implies that their gaze, and thus their line of sight, has changed direction and shifted upwards. Let's break down the relationship between the premise and hypothesis and the logical implications of this scenario. \\"Derry's head snapped up\\" indicates that there was a sudden or abrupt movement of Derry's head from a lower position to a higher one. This could be a reaction to a sound, an event, or any other stimulus requiring immediate attention. It can indicate that Derry was initially looking down or at a level below the horizon and then quickly redirected their gaze upwards. The hypothesis \\"Derry looked up\\" essentially refers to Derry's change in gaze direction to a higher position or a position above the horizon. Since the premise involves the action of Derry's head moving upwards, the hypothesis about Derry's gaze can be inferred because the movement of the head is directly related to the direction of sight in humans. Analyzing the premise and hypothesis in terms of logical consequences, we can establish the following inferences: Premise: Derry's head snapped up. 1. Derry's head moved from a lower to a higher position. 2. This movement was sudden and quick, reflecting urgency or surprise. Hypothesis: Derry looked up. 1. Derry's gaze moved from a lower position to a higher position. 2. Derry's line of sight shifted upwards, focusing on something above the initial line of sight. By examining these inferences, we can deduce that the premise entails the hypothesis. When Derry's head snapped up, it directly caused or influenced Derry's gaze to move from a lower position to a higher position. This upward shift in the head and gaze indicates but does not fully describe the specific object or event responsible for capturing Derry's attention, but it does make it clear that Derry looked up as a result. Therefore, if the premise \\"Derry's head snapped up\\" is true, it logically follows that the hypothesis \\"Derry looked up\\" is also true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the solution?","completion":"To solve this problem, we will follow the steps of linear equation solving. Step 1: Add up 1053 and 1033. This results in 2086. So, the equation now is: 2086 = 136*c + 182 Step 2: Next step is to isolate the term with \\"c\\" on one side of the equation. In order to do so, subtract 182 from both sides. This can be written as follows: 2086 - 182 = 136*c + 182 - 182 This gives us: 1904 = 136*c. Our equation is now simplified to represent 'c' in terms of other constants. Step 3: Now, the final step is to solve for 'c'. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by 136: 1904 / 136 = 136*c / 136 This simplifies to: c = 14 So, the solution to the original equation is c = 14."},{"prompt":"Question: why was kitty claiming that she sold them?

Along the way, the group is mistaken for a CIA hit squad by several groups, including the United Nations police force and the Serbians themselves; at one point, at the initiative of Benjamin, they claim to be CIA agents themselves, using a threat to avoid paying a fee for a tip. Simon, Duck, and Benjamin are then captured by the Fox's guards and taken to a barn to be executed. At the last moment, a team of CIA assassins storms the barn and frees the journalists, but Fox escapes.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil.

Unreal landscape: This term reflects that the scenery being described is fictional or has an otherworldly, dreamlike quality. The landscape is not representative of the typical, real-world environment. 2. Lone tree silhouette: The \\"lone tree silhouette\\" is a distinct visual element in this scene. It refers to a single tree that is standing alone and is possibly the only prominent object in the landscape. Its silhouette suggests that the tree's detailing is not the main focus here, but instead, the tree is providing a contrast to the surrounding elements. 3. Planet: The mention of \\"planet\\" adds a celestial aspect to the landscape, hinting that the scene might be from a viewpoint in outer space, or may be showcasing a unique planetary body that is not usually visible in typical landscapes. It signifies the presence of celestial objects within the scene. 4. Galaxy: Adding to the celestial theme, the \\"galaxy\\" keyword suggests that an entire galactic system, with countless stars and planets, can be seen within the vivid sky. This creates an even more awe-inspiring and fantastical setting. 5. Visible: This keyword indicates that the celestial objects, such as the planet and the galaxy, are clearly observable within the scene. It highlights that these celestial bodies are not obscured, but rather easy to see and distinguish. 6.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Some scientists say that animals in the ocean are increasingly threatened by noise pollution caused by human beings. The noise that affects sea animals comes from a number of human activities. Such noises are added to natural sounds. These sounds include the breaking of ice fields, underwater earthquakes, and sounds made by animals themselves. Decibels measured in water are different from those measured on land. A noise of one hundred and twenty decibels on land caused pain to human ears. In water, a decibel level of one hundred and ninety-five would have the same effect. Some scientists have planned to set a noise limit of one hundred and twenty decibels in oceans. They have found that noises at that level can frighten and confuse whales. A team of American and Canadian scientists discovered that loud noises can seriously hurt some animals. The research team found that powerful underwater explosions were causing whales in the area to lose their hearing. This seriously affected the whales' ability to exchange information and find their way. Some of the whales even died. The explosions had caused their ears to bleed and become infected. Many researchers whose work depends on ocean sounds disagree to a limit of one hundred and twenty decibels. They say such a limit would mean an end to important industrial and scientific research. Scientists do not know how much and what kinds of noises are harmful to ocean animals. However, many scientists suspect that noise is a greater danger than they believed. They want to stop noises from harming creatures in the ocean. Answer:","completion":"Question: According to the article, what are the effects of noise pollution on animals in the ocean, and what actions are being considered by some scientists?

Hume argued that it requires inductive reasoning to arrive at the premises for the principle of inductive reasoning, and therefore the justification for inductive reasoning is a circular argument. Among Hume's conclusions regarding the problem of induction is that there is no certainty that the future will resemble the past.

Movie title: Freeheld Movie plot: The film opens at a meeting of the Board of Chosen Freeholders of Ocean County, New Jersey in 2005. Ocean County resident and New Jersey police officer Lieutenant Laurel Hester, a 23-year veteran of the police force, has been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, and expected to live only one year, she wishes to pass on her pension to her domestic partner of five years, Stacie Andree. Although New Jersey counties have the option to extend pension benefits to domestic partners, Ocean County Freeholders will not do this. In protest, the state's LGBT civil rights organization, Garden State Equality, organizes hundreds of people to speak out at each of the Freeholders' meetings. The crowds Garden State Equality organizes get bigger and more vociferous at each meeting.Among those speaking out are Laurel's police colleagues and Ocean County residents, describing Laurel's 25 years of exemplary work for the police department, and petitioning the Freeholders to allow her to pass on her pension to Stacie. Laurel's first police partner, Dane Wells, speaks about her and compares the situation to separate drinking fountains and seats at the back of the bus. Freeholder Joseph Vicari says that although they are \\"anguished\\" by Laurel's case, they are unable to change things because of state legislature and moves for an adjournment. The members of the public present are unhappy with this decision and some begin to chant \\"It's in your power\\".Outside the administration building, news reporter Ida Siegal explains the background to the case. In 2004 New Jersey passed the Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act which allows all gay and lesbian state employees to pass on their benefits, including the pension, to their domestic live-in lovers/partners.

President Donald Trump’s decision to reverse a policy of separating families coming across the U.S. southern border came in the wake of a political firestorm that fired up opposition Democrats and alarmed even some Republicans. At the very least, it likely set the stage for immigration to be a key issue in November. Trump was in combat mode Wednesday during a political rally in Duluth, Minnesota, where he vowed to make immigration a central focus in the upcoming congressional campaign. “If you want to create a humane, lawful system of immigration then you need to retire the Democrats and elect Republicans to finally secure our borders,” Trump said to an enthusiastic crowd, some chanting, “Build the wall!” Just hours earlier, the president reversed his controversial policy of separating children from their parents by signing an executive order in the White House. “We are going to have strong, very strong, borders. But we are going to keep the families together,” he said. Trump decided to back away from the controversial policy of separating families after an outcry from around the country that included protests in several states, including Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Also driving the outrage was a recording of children crying out for their parents released by the investigative journalist group ProPublica. The separation policy drew condemnation from Republicans including former first lady Laura Bush and a host of Democrats. “We should be able to agree that we will not keep kids in child internment camps indefinitely and hidden away from public view,” said Maryland Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings. “What country is that? This is the United States of America!” Advocates for a tough border policy sided with the president including Art Arthur of the Center for Immigration Studies. He cited a recent upsurge in attempted border crossings. Where is Elijah Cummings a Congressman from? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. Texas B. Pennsylvania C.

Options: A. guide foreigners B. introduced C. foreigner D. established E. immigrant The answer to this question is:","completion":"B. introduced To answer this question in line with common sense, we must first understand the context and the possible implication of each option. The question sets up a scenario in which Sam assumes that James is a native based on the actions of Lane. Let's analyze each option: A. guide foreigners - This option suggests that Lane is helping James like a guide assisting foreigners. This information would more likely lead Sam to assume that James is a foreigner and not a native. So, this option doesn't make sense. B. introduced - If Lane introduced James to Sam, it's possible that Sam could infer from their interaction that James was a native. The manner in which Lane introduced James might have indicated familiarity, which might lead Sam to assume that James is a native. As this option can lead Sam to assume James being a native, it is a plausible answer. C. foreigner - This option refers to a person from another country, and if Lane did something in relation to James being a foreigner, it would not lead Sam to think that James is a native. Therefore, it is not logical and in line with common sense. D. established - This word alone doesn't provide a clear context to understand Lane's actions towards James. We do not know if Lane established a business or relationship with James, but either way, it doesn't offer enough information for Sam to assume James is a native. Thus, this option doesn't make sense as an answer. E. immigrant - This option refers to an individual who has moved to another place to live permanently. If Lane did something involving James as an immigrant, it would make Sam think that James is not a native. So, this option doesn't fit as an answer. In conclusion, option B, which refers to Lane introducing James, is the most logical and sensible answer for the question. The way Lane introduced James might have provided enough context for Sam to assume that James is a native."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Throughout the season, they finished with a 10-6 record under the guidance of head coach Adam Gase. Led by quarterback Ryan Tannehill, the Dolphins secured a Wild Card playoff spot. In the Wild Card round of the playoffs which took place on January 8, 2017, the Dolphins faced the Pittsburgh Steelers at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Unfortunately for the Dolphins, they were defeated decisively by the Steelers with a final score of 30-12. Pittsburgh's defense was a significant factor in this game, managing to hold the Dolphins offense in check. Jay Ajayi, Miami's running back who had a breakout season that year, was limited to only 33 rushing yards. Since that playoff appearance in 2016, the Dolphins have gone through numerous changes such as coaching staff overhaul, roster modifications, and of course, the entry of a new franchise quarterback, Tua Tagovailoa, who was drafted in 2020. Miami's football fans continue to hope for a return to the playoffs and a potential run towards the Super Bowl, but their last taste of playoff football remains that 2016 season and the Wild Card game on January 8, 2017."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Identify the main components of the sentence: The main component of the sentence is the adjective \\"lavish.\\" 2. Determine the meaning and sentiment of both components: \\"Lavish\\" generally refers to something being luxurious, opulent, or extravagant. It is often used to describe a positive aspect of something, like a movie's production values, set designs, or costumes. 3. Determine the overall sentiment of the sentence: As \\"lavish\\" is a positive adjective, the sentiment of the sentence can be considered positive. However, it's important to note that the context in which this word appears can affect its sentiment. For example, if used in a sentence like, \\"The movie's lavish set designs could not make up for its poor plot,\\" the sentiment could be mixed or negative.

Detailed Instructions: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. Problem:turn right thrice after look right twice Solution:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the actions and repetitions. - 'look right twice' - 'turn right thrice' Step 2: Determine the order of actions by identifying the keyword 'after'. - The 'look right twice' action should be executed after 'turn right thrice'.

All the places where Nathan usually holds his games refuse him entry due to Brannigan's intimidating pressure. The Biltmore garage is the only venue where Nathan can hold the game, but its owner requires a 1,000 security deposit, which Nathan doesn't have. Adding to his problems, Nathan's fiancée, Miss Adelaide, a nightclub singer, wants to bring an end to their 14-year engagement and actually tie the knot. She also wants him to go straight, but organizing illegal gambling is the only thing he's good at. Then Nathan spots an old acquaintance, Sky Masterson, a gambler willing to bet on virtually anything and for high amounts. To win the 1,000 security deposit, Nathan bets Sky that he can't take a girl of Nathan's choosing to dinner in Havana, Cuba.

(November 2015) In New York City in the fall of 1937, 17-year-old high-school student Richard Samuels meets Orson Welles, who unexpectedly offers him the role of Lucius in Caesar, the first production of his new Mercury Theatre repertory company. The company is immersed in rehearsals at its Broadway theater. Charmed by Welles, Richard infers that he is having an affair with the leading actress while his wife is pregnant. Richard finds ambitious production assistant Sonja Jones is attracted to him. Welles tells Richard a few days before the premiere that he is worried, because he has recently had nothing but good luck; he fears that he will finally have bad luck with the premiere, and that the play will be a flop. During rehearsals Richard accidentally sets off the sprinkler system, soaking the entire theatre. When accused by Welles he denies having anything to do with the deluge, and suggests that the catastrophe was the bad luck that Welles needed to get out of the way. Welles decides the entire production crew would benefit from a coupling game, and Richard cheats to ensure he is paired with Sonja. Richard spends the night with Sonja, but becomes jealous when she spends the next night with Welles. He confronts Welles, mentions his pregnant wife, and is fired. An apparent reconciliation follows, and Richard performs on the first night. The anti-fascist adaptation of Caesar is a huge success, but after the premiere, Richard is told that Welles only needed him in order to secure a successful first-night production and, that done, he has again been fired. The broken-hearted but wiser Richard spontaneously recites lines from Julius Caesar in his high school English class, to his classmates' applause. He later meets up with a likely new girlfriend, Gretta Adler, a young aspiring playwright whom he met in a music store at the film's beginning. With Richard's and Sonja's assistance, Adler manages to get a story published in The New Yorker, and she invites Richard out, to...

Poor relationship between parents and their children are very common. Whether we like it or not, our parents are responsible for us at least until we're out of high school. So rather than get upset about that fact, maybe we should focus on some ways to make our relationship better. The best way, in my opinion, is to learn to really communicate with my parents. When I find myself arguing with my mom and dad, I try to stop. If I can manage to stop myself from talking, I usually find that I can calm down quickly. I guess I'm usually acting out of emotion rather than logic . But if I can stop arguing for a minute, it seems that my opinion changes and I start to realize that I'm a bit childish. Emotionally I may still be upset, but logically I understand that yelling and fighting surely won't make things better. Once I've stopped arguing, I look at my parents in the eye. You'd be amazed at how much easier it is to communicate with your parents when you've actually looking at them. Looking away doesn't do much of anything except for giving them the impression that I'm not listening or that I don't care. It's much easier to see things eye to eye when you're physically seeing them eye to eye. Finally, I listen to what they're saying (or at least I try). Communication can't happen unless both sides hear and listen to each other. There is nothing wrong with my hearing, but that doesn't mean I always listen to the sounds that people are making. When I argue with my parents, I can physically hear what they're saying without mentally listening to it. Whether I admit it or not, my parents' experience can actually help them give me some pretty sound advice at times. I don't always agree with them, but I think it's safe to say that it has truly helped our relationship in the long run. Parents and children can communicate only when _ . A) both sides stop yelling and fighting B) both sides start thinking what to say next C) both sides agree with each other D) both sides can listen to each other Answer:","completion":"D) both sides can listen to each other"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: The McNabb-less Eagles travelled to Indiana to take on the 9-1 Indianapolis Colts. Any chances of victory would be reliant upon a strong defensive showing, but the Colts stormed ahead behind three rushing touchdowns by rookie Joseph Addai in the first two quarters. Philadelphia's new starting quarterback, Jeff Garcia, found L.J. Smith for a 1-yard touchdown to make it 21-7 in the second quarter. Adam Vinatieri booted a 44-yard kick before the end of the half for Indianapolis. Peyton Manning tossed an 11-yard touchdown pass to Reggie Wayne making it 31-7 Colts in the third quarter. The Eagles showed signs of life with touchdowns by Reggie Brown and Brian Westbrook to climb within ten with about ten minutes to play. However, Addai scored his fourth touchdown of the game and a Garcia fumble led to a defensive touchdown for the Colts, making it 45-21 - a score representative of how overmatched the Eagles appeared all night. The Colts rushed for 237 yards on the Eagles' beleaguered defense. Westbrook had his third consecutive 100-yard game - the first Eagle to do that since Wilbert Montgomery 25 years ago. The loss drops the Eagles to under .500 for the first time all year. Question: Which team was playing with home field advantage?

Jon Withers and his wife June have began protesting against the group, creating a Facebook page for other residents to openly voice their concerns. Article:","completion":"Title: Aveo Retirement Village Gripped in Controversy: Allegations of Abuse, Harassment, and Illicit Alcohol Sales The otherwise serene and peaceful atmosphere of the Aveo Retirement Village has recently been mired with a series of accusatory headlines as residents claim abuse, harassment, and bullying from an allegedly influential clique composed of body corporate and community members. The situation has escalated to the point where a still, an apparatus generally used for distilling alcoholic beverages, has been discovered in operation within the village's premises. What's more, it has emerged that several senior citizens have been involved in illegally selling bottles of alcohol to other residents at a staggering low price of 10. Leading the charge against the accused group is Jon Withers and his wife June, who have taken it upon themselves to put an end to the unfolding drama within the village. The couple has initiated a Facebook page to provide a platform for other residents who have been affected by the clique’s actions to voice their concerns openly. They hope that this move will not only raise awareness about the issue but also serve as a starting point for initiating dialogue, and ultimately, address the problem at hand. Aveo Retirement Village, a haven for numerous individuals during their golden years, was originally designed to offer a supportive, empowering, and comfortable community for its residents. It has since been the cause of anxiety and distress, however, as individuals such as the Withers couple found themselves subjected to mistreatment by a powerful few. The illicit alcohol trade within the village has also raised serious legal and safety concerns, as its operation, distribution, and consumption are not only unauthorized but could potentially pose a hazard to the health of the elderly, who may be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of alcohol. The Facebook page created by the Withers has received an outpouring of support and condolence from people who have either experienced or witnessed similar incidents within their communities. In documenting and sharing their stories, the group aims to tackle the issue constructively by raising awareness and garnering attention from both the management of Aveo Retirement Village and the wider public. It is their hope that this exposure will prompt the necessary actions to be taken to put an end to the suffering and injustice that has plagued the village. The situation in Aveo Retirement Village serves as a wake-up call to other similar establishments and community organizations that aim to provide a secure, nurturing, and comfortable living space for the elderly. It sheds light on the importance of vigilance and communication in ensuring that all members of these communities are treated with respect and dignity, and that their rights are upheld. Moreover, it serves as a reminder that even in spaces that are considered to be sanctuaries for the retired and elderly, there is always a possibility for the corruption of power and mistreatment when left unchecked. The unfolding events in Aveo Retirement Village have exposed the challenges that sometimes lurk beneath the surface of an otherwise idyllic community. By consistently monitoring the situation and holding authorities accountable, the residents and their well-wishers aim to restore a sense of justice, security, and collegiality within the village. However, only by addressing the root causes of this issue and introducing effective measures to prevent its spiraling recurrence will a true solution be found. As the story continues to develop, one can only hope that the best interests of Aveo's residents are prioritized and that they may soon be able to once again enjoy a peaceful retirement without fear or intimidation."},{"prompt":"Teacher:You are given a sentence in English.

Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las VegasParadise metropolitan area where three of the state's four largest incorporated cities are located. Nevada's capital is Carson City. Nevada is officially known as the \\"Silver State\\" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy.

First-order logic uses quantified variables over non-logical objects and allows the use of sentences that contain variables, so that rather than propositions such as \\"Socrates is a man\\" one can have expressions in the form \\"there exists X such that X is Socrates and X is a man\\" where \\"there exists\\" is a quantifier and \\"X\\" is a variable. This distinguishes it from propositional logic, which does not use quantifiers. - Logic in computer science covers the overlap between the field of logic and that of computer science. The topic can essentially be divided into three main areas: - In mathematical logic, Craig's interpolation theorem is a result about the relationship between different logical theories. Roughly stated, the theorem says that if a formula implies a formula , and the two have at least one atomic variable symbol in common, then there is a third formula , called an interpolant, such that every nonlogical symbol in occurs both in and , implies , and implies . The theorem was first proved for first-order logic by William Craig in 1957. Variants of the theorem hold for other logics, such as propositional logic. A stronger form of Craig's theorem for first-order logic was proved by Roger Lyndon in 1959; the overall result is sometimes called the CraigLyndon theorem. - Philosophy of science is a branch of philosophy concerned with the foundations, methods, and implications of science.

Whether a national university is considered public varies from one country (or region) to another, largely depending on the specific education landscape. - Set theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which informally are collections of objects. Although any type of object can be collected into a set, set theory is applied most often to objects that are relevant to mathematics. The language of set theory can be used in the definitions of nearly all mathematical objects. - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - Mathematical logic is a subfield of mathematics exploring the applications of formal logic to mathematics. It bears close connections to metamathematics, the foundations of mathematics, and theoretical computer science. The unifying themes in mathematical logic include the study of the expressive power of formal systems and the deductive power of formal proof systems. Mathematical logic is often divided into the fields of set theory, model theory, recursion theory, and proof theory. These areas share basic results on logic, particularly first-order logic, and definability. In computer science (particularly in the ACM Classification) mathematical logic encompasses additional topics not detailed in this article; see Logic in computer science for those. - A formal system or logical calculus is any well-defined system of abstract thought based on the model of mathematics. A formal system need not be mathematical as such; for example, Spinoza's \\"Ethics\\" imitates the form of Euclid's \\"Elements\\".. Spinoza employed Euclidiean elements such as \\"axioms\\" or \\"primitive truths\\", rules of inferences etc. so that a calculus can be build using these. For nature of such primitive truths, one can consult Tarski's \\"Concept of truth for a formalized language\\". - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - In mathematics, model theory is the study of classes of mathematical structures (e.g. groups, fields, graphs, universes of set theory) from the perspective of mathematical logic. The objects of study are models of theories in a formal language. A set of sentences in a formal language is called a theory; a model of a theory is a structure (e.g. an interpretation) that satisfies the sentences of that theory. - Foundations of mathematics is the study of the philosophical and logical and/or algorithmic basis of mathematics, or, in a broader sense, the mathematical investigation of what underlies the philosophical theories concerning the nature of mathematics. In this latter sense, the distinction between foundations of mathematics and philosophy of mathematics turns out to be quite vague. Foundations of mathematics can be conceived as the study of the basic mathematical concepts (number, geometrical figure, set, function, etc.) and how they form hierarchies of more complex structures and concepts, especially the fundamentally important structures that form the language of mathematics (formulas, theories and their models giving a meaning to formulas, definitions, proofs, algorithms, etc.) also called metamathematical concepts, with an eye to the philosophical aspects and the unity of mathematics. The search for foundations of mathematics is a central question of the philosophy of mathematics; the abstract nature of mathematical objects presents special philosophical challenges. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - Metamathematics is the study of mathematics itself using mathematical methods. This study produces metatheories, which are mathematical theories about other mathematical theories. Emphasis on metamathematics (and perhaps the creation of the term itself) owes itself to David Hilbert's attempt to secure the foundations of mathematics in the early part of the 20th Century. Metamathematics provides \\"a rigorous mathematical technique for investigating a great variety of foundation problems for mathematics and logic\\" (Kleene 1952, p. 59). An important feature of metamathematics is its emphasis on differentiating between reasoning from inside a system and from outside a system. An informal illustration of this is categorizing the proposition \\"2+2=4\\" as belonging to mathematics while categorizing the proposition \\"'2+2=4' is valid\\" as belonging to metamathematics. - The University of California, Berkeley, (also referred to as Berkeley, UC Berkeley, and Cal) is a public research university located in Berkeley, California. Founded in 1868, Berkeley is the oldest of the ten research universities affiliated with the University of California system, and is often cited as the top public university in the United States and around the world. - Ontology is the philosophical study of the nature of being, becoming, existence or reality as well as the basic categories of being and their relations. Traditionally listed as a part of the major branch of philosophy known as metaphysics, ontology often deals with questions concerning what entities exist or may be said to exist and how such entities may be grouped, related within a hierarchy, and subdivided according to similarities and differences. Although ontology as a philosophical enterprise is highly theoretical, it also has practical application in information science and technology, such as ontology engineering. - Epistemology is the branch of philosophy concerned with the theory of knowledge. - Proof theory is a major branch of mathematical logic that represents proofs as formal mathematical objects, facilitating their analysis by mathematical techniques. Proofs are typically presented as inductively-defined data structures such as plain lists, boxed lists, or trees, which are constructed according to the axioms and rules of inference of the logical system. As such, proof theory is syntactic in nature, in contrast to model theory, which is semantic in nature. - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Yahoo’s Asian Lifeline By JEFF SOMMERJAN. 18, 2014 Yahoo’s core business has been eroding. It’s lost ground in display advertising and in online search, and the Wall Street consensus is that its revenue declined last year. When Marissa Mayer, Yahoo’s chief executive, unceremoniously dumped Henrique de Castro, her top lieutenant, on Wednesday, it was an acknowledgment that she had so far failed to turn the company around. But no matter: Wall Street greeted the news of Mr. de Castro’s dismissal with a shrug. Regardless of what Ms. Mayer does, the stock market loves Yahoo. Its shares doubled in value last year, outstripping the performance of highflying rivals like Google, AOL and Facebook. How is this feat even remotely possible? Yahoo’s lofty valuation makes sense only if you put its American business aside, and think of the company as an investment in Asia. That’s the way Wall Street sees it. From this perspective, most of Yahoo’s value is found in Japan and, especially, in China, where it has a large stake in the Internet colossus Alibaba. As Yahoo’s chief executive, Marissa Mayer has acquired more than 20 companies and removed the chief operating officer in an attempt to rejuvenate the once-dominant Internet giant. “In the United States, they are doing the best they can, and I think Marissa Mayer is doing a fine job, but their core business is challenged, to be polite, and it will likely remain that way for some time,” said Victor Anthony, managing director for Internet media at Topeka Capital Markets. “For Yahoo, it’s all about Asia.” Yahoo’s 24 percent stake in Alibaba, which has been described as a combination of Amazon, eBay and PayPal, with a bit of Google thrown in, accounts for the bulk of the American company’s value, Mr. Anthony calculates. In the United States, Yahoo trades at about 40, and he says he believes that at that price, it still has plenty of room to run. “I think Yahoo’s worth 50 to 52 a share,” he said, “but that’s not because of its American operations.” In his estimation, Yahoo’s American core, damaged by sliding advertising revenue and diminished profit margins, is worth only 10 a share. On the other hand, its holdings of Alibaba, which is planning an initial public offering that has Wall Street drooling, are worth 30 a share, he said. While that figure is subject to debate, no one questions that it is sizable: Alibaba plays a gargantuan role in China’s Internet economy. This online retailer’s two main shopping sites handled roughly 160 billion in merchandise in 2012, more than eBay and Amazon combined. Analysts estimate that its eventual I.P.O. could value it at 130 billion to 190 billion. Yahoo’s stake in its Japanese counterpart, Yahoo Japan — which still beats Google in local search — is worth an additional 7 a share to the American company, Mr. Anthony said. The rest of the stock’s value comes from Yahoo share buybacks, which are financed in large part from income derived from the Asian properties, he said. While numbers vary somewhat, many people on Wall Street make remarkably similar estimates. In a research report last Oct. 16, for example, JPMorgan Chase noted some improvements in Yahoo’s Internet search metrics and in the revamping of categories like sports and weather on its website. Over all, the report said, “the core business remains challenged and we believe the focus for most will remain on the strength in its Asian assets.” In a similar vein, Brian Wieser, senior analyst at Pivotal Research in New York, said: “It’s sad but you can pretty much forget about Yahoo’s core. I’m afraid it has no future. The Asian holdings, though — that’s another story.” Like many other people who follow Yahoo closely, Mr. Wieser says Ms. Mayer appears to be doing a perfectly fine job. “She’s talented, but it’s just that she’s facing a secular decline in the company’s core advertising business,” he said. Mr. de Castro was supposed to bring new ad revenue to the company. But Mr. Wieser suggests that the failure to do so wasn’t surprising. “I don’t care who runs the company right now,” he said. “They’re not going to be able to reverse that easily.” Fundamentally, he said, Yahoo is suffering from an ailment that afflicts “legacy publishers” of all kinds, including much older ones like newspapers and magazines. Yahoo, the dominant site of bygone days when the words “web portal” were still fashionable, can no longer attract premium display advertising as easily as it could before the rise of Google and sites like Facebook. Mr. Wieser praised Ms. Mayer’s acquisitions of Internet properties like Tumblr, the blogging service, and her hiring of prominent online talent like Katie Couric, the television host, and David Pogue, former tech writer at The New York Times. “That may all be helpful,” Mr. Wieser said. “But it’s not moving the stock.” Mark May, a Citi Research analyst, said that while Ms. Mayer had made progress, much of Yahoo’s stock market strength resulted from prescient investments by Jerry Yang, a Yahoo co-founder who stepped down from his leadership positions at the company in 2012. He made Yahoo an early financier of both Yahoo Japan and Alibaba and fought off repeated efforts by the Chinese company to buy out Yahoo’s stake. “That’s much of the value of Yahoo now,” Mr. May said. Mr. Anthony of Topeka Capital Markets added: “Marissa Mayer is really extremely lucky. She inherited many problems, of course, but she’s still got those incredible Asian assets. And that’s keeping the stock strong today.” A version of this news analysis appears in print on January 19, 2014, on page BU1 of the New York edition with the headline: Yahoo’s Asian Lifeline.

With a 24% stake in Alibaba and a significant presence in Yahoo Japan, Wall Street perceives these Asian assets as key drivers of Yahoo's value, providing a lifeline amidst steady declines in its American advertising revenue and profit margins. The article suggests that even though Marissa Mayer, Yahoo’s CEO at the time, made progress in revitalizing the company, much of Yahoo’s strength on the stock market can be attributed to the foresight of co-founder Jerry Yang who invested in Yahoo Japan and Alibaba."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Your genuine interest in another person is the most attractive and meaningful message you could possibly send. Don’t play games by being intentionally vague. Read all of your texts to yourself before sending them. Ask yourself if it’d be a text you’d be happy to receive. If the person knows you’re interested, and they’ve reciprocated their interest in you as well, you don’t have to say much to get them smiling. Try, “Thinking of you.” If you’re feeling more direct, go with “Wish you were here.” This is more forward, as it explicitly indicates your desire to be in someone’s company. It also adds an element of intrigue if the recipient doesn’t know what you’re up to, so you’ll get their imagination whirring. Know that we’re all in this together. That includes whomever you’re texting. Just relax and be yourself - be simple, be honest, be true. It’s always best to shoot for a smile, and even better if you can get your crush laughing. Be casual. Don’t overthink it. Remember, we’re talking about texting. Be a cheeseball. Quote something ridiculously melodramatic or throw a ridiculously cheesy pick up line out there. There’s nothing like a bit of Shakespeare or Thoreau. Emerson once declared, “Thou art to me a delicious torment.” Steal lines like this (and credit them to the appropriate authors for added drama). There are some officially bad pick-up lines that will almost should never work, and that’s the point – which means they somehow work. Making light of your affection for someone can be a great way to convey interest casually. There are some classics, but you probably already have a go-to in mind. Don’t abbreviate everything. It can be misleading, confusing, and may even seem a bit childish. You can get away with “lol” – it’s practically a part of the English language – but don’t send acronyms or abbreviations your recipient might not familiar with it. If you’re interested in them, the least you can do is thumb out complete words. Relatedly, be aware that emoticons should not completely take the place of words. Cap your emoji-use. There is definitely, definitely such a thing as too many emoticons. Personal preference is a legitimate argument here, but don’t forget to occasionally mention that you’re interested in having a genuine conversation if they would too. Comedy is the only realm in which it is appropriate to overuse emoticons. In particular, feel free to indulge in storytelling with emoticons. If you can wind together a solid, ideally humorous narrative using only tiny 2D images, by all means, emoji-away. Even emoticons are getting raunchy these days. Hold off on the emoji innuendos until you have an appropriate relationship with someone who might appreciate your smiley face based sultriness.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"The questions you asked are similar but have slight differences in focus. The first question emphasizes production while the second one targets industries. Let me address both aspects within my answer. Differences between primary, secondary, and tertiary production: 1. Primary production: Primary production refers to the extraction of natural resources directly from the environment. This includes activities such as agriculture, forestry, fishing, and mining. In this stage, the focus is on acquiring raw materials that can be further processed, transformed, or used as inputs for other products. Primary production is typically marked by a direct interaction with the natural environment, land, and resource exploitation. 2. Secondary production: Secondary production involves the manufacturing, processing, and refining of raw materials obtained from primary production. During this stage, raw materials are transformed into intermediate goods or finished products. Common examples of secondary production include the manufacturing of goods such as automobiles, textiles, furniture, and electronic devices. Factories, mills, and workshops are sites of secondary production, which generally involves more specialized skills and technology for processing raw materials. 3. Tertiary production: Tertiary production, also known as the service sector, is characterized by the provision of services rather than the production of tangible goods. This sector comprises a wide range of activities, such as retail, transportation, healthcare, education, hospitality, and financial services. Tertiary production is concerned with the distribution, support, and enhancement of primary and secondary production activities. It can include the development of new technologies, research, and development or even creative endeavors like arts and entertainment. Differences between primary, secondary, and tertiary industries: 1. Primary industries: Primary industries are industries involved in the extraction and collection of natural resources. As with primary production, these industries are primarily agriculture, forestry, fishing, and mining. As a result, primary industries generally deal with the direct collection of raw materials from the natural environment. These industries typically require large tracts of land and natural resources, as well as low-skilled labor. 2. Secondary industries: Secondary industries are involved in the processing, manufacturing, and construction of goods using raw materials acquired from primary industries. These industries are responsible for the production of intermediate and finished goods intended for consumption or use by other industries and end consumers. This sector is characterized by a higher concentration of technology and capital investment, which results in greater employment opportunities and contributes significantly to a country's GDP. 3. Tertiary industries: Tertiary industries, also known as the service sector, encompass all industries that provide services rather than tangible products. These industries are not directly involved in the extraction or production of raw materials but rather support economic processes by offering services like transport, marketing, distribution, and consultancy. The tertiary sector includes banking, insurance, education, healthcare, and hospitality services, among others. With the rise of the knowledge-based economy, this sector is steadily becoming more significant in terms of driving economic growth, generating employment, and promoting innovation. In conclusion, the two questions you asked have similar undertones, but the focus of the first question is on the production aspect (which deals with activities within each stage), while the second question emphasizes industries (which describes the sectors that participate in each stage). Both questions address the different stages in the movement of goods and services from extraction to consumption."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer this question: what is the meaning of the name gisela?","completion":"The name Gisela (also spelled Giselle, Gisele, or Gisèle) is a female given name of Germanic origin, derived from the Old High German \\"gisil,\\" meaning \\"pledge\\" or \\"hostage.\\" It is an ancient name with significant historical roots and cultural significance. The name Gisela embodies the idea of someone who is committed to their relationships, friendships, and responsibilities. It is a name that suggests loyalty, dedication, and a strong sense of duty. In early Germanic societies, a pledge or hostage was an essential aspect of sealing treaties and agreements between tribes and kingdoms. Giving a hostage, often a child of a ruler or high-ranking noble, helped ensure both parties would abide by the agreed-upon terms. This practice also provided assurance for the recipient that the other party had a vested interest in maintaining the peace. Gisela as a name, therefore, symbolizes trust, devotion, and perseverance. Historically, several women named Gisela held significant roles within European history. Some noteworthy figures include: 1. Gisela of Swabia (990-1043) - She was an influential Holy Roman Empress and the wife of Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II. Gisela exerted considerable political influence during her husband's reign and is remembered for her intelligence and strong personality. 2. Gisela of Hungary (985-1065) - The daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Henry II and Cunigunde of Luxembourg, she became the wife of St. Stephen I, the first king of Hungary. As Queen Consort of Hungary, Gisela played a crucial role in the early Christianization of the region. 3. Gisela of Bavaria (984-1060) - The daughter of Duke Henry II of Bavaria and sister of Emperor Henry II, Gisela married King Stephen I of Hungary. Their strong alliance and rule played an essential role in the Christianization of Hungary and the formation of a stable Central European power. The name Gisela has also been popular in literature and the arts. One famous example is the ballet \\"Giselle,\\" with music by Adolphe Adam and choreography by Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot. The ballet premiered in France in the 19th century and tells the story of a delicate young girl named Giselle who falls in love with a nobleman disguised as a peasant. In contemporary times, the name Gisela, or its alternative spellings, has been popular among celebrities and public figures. One well-known example is Gisele Bündchen, a Brazilian supermodel who has enjoyed a highly successful career in the fashion industry. In summary, the name Gisela carries a rich history and deep cultural significance that symbolizes loyalty, dedication, and responsibility. Its historical roots and various adaptations keep the name popular and relevant in today's world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please write the text above using proper case.","completion":"His enigmatic disappearance has been puzzling to the Egyptologists; many are rejecting that he was subject to an obvious conspiracy, and different hypotheses about his fate have been prevailing in turn. The mysterious disappearance of this individual has captured the interest of Egyptologists for quite some time. Despite the lack of concrete evidence pointing to a clear conspiracy, various hypotheses have come to the forefront in their attempt to piece together the puzzle of his fate. As researchers delve deeper into the history, intrigue, and culture that define the ancient Egyptians, they continue to decipher clues that could lead to the understanding of how and why this particular person vanished without a trace. Theories range from political intrigue to personal motives, and as more data emerges, scientists hope to put an end to the endless speculation. Among the various hypotheses that have been proposed, some of the most prevalent include: 1. Assassination: It is possible that the person was deliberately murdered as part of a power struggle or vendetta by opposing forces, wishing to remove him from power or gain political advantage. 2. Accidental death: Given the many dangers of the ancient world, it is equally plausible that the person died accidentally. Environmental hazards or simple accidents might have caused his untimely demise, leaving no clues about his disappearance. 3. Exile: Under certain circumstances, it is conceivable that the individual was exiled from his position due to political maneuverings, personal animosity, or as a consequence of his own behavior. It is not uncommon for powerful figures in such societies to face sudden and cruel twists of fate, as their fortunes and influence can rapidly alter. 4. Forced disappearance: Another possibility is that the person was forcibly removed from his position by those who sought to undermine his power or perceived him as a threat. This could involve kidnapping, imprisonment, or more nefarious designs that led to his disappearance from the public eye. 5. Voluntary disappearance: Lastly, it is always possible that the person chose to walk away from his life of prominence in search of peace, solitude, or spiritual enlightenment. There have been instances of individuals deserting their positions to embark on personal journeys away from the pressures and expectations of high society. As Egyptologists continue to scrutinize historical records, explore hidden tombs, and unearth ancient artifacts, they hope to uncover the definitive answers to such enigmatic cases. While the truth behind this disappearance may lie buried beneath the sands of time, the fascination with this historical mystery will continue to captivate scholars and laymen alike. Each breakthrough in our understanding of this ancient civilization brings us one step closer to unraveling this intricate puzzle and learning about the person who mysteriously vanished, leaving behind no tangible trace of his existence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When Jodi Gholson Oliver's 19-year-old told her that he was going to live as a transgender male, the Las Vegas mom took to Facebook to let her family and friends know how proud and accepting she was of her child. 'For about 18 1/2 years we thought he was a girl, who just happened to like bugs, tattoos, flames, skulls, snakes, lizards, etc, etc,' Mrs Gholson Oliver wrote on her Facebook wall March 27. Last September, Jesse Oliver, born 'Jessica' but known to everyone as 'Jes,' came to his parents and revealed that he's never felt like he was supposed to be a girl and always identified as a male. Proud mom: Jodi Gholson Oliver (left) wasted no time embracing her son Jes' (right) decision to live as a transgender male. Inspiring message: The Las Vegas mother of two wrote a smart and touching Facebook post letting her family and friends know that her 19-year-old son is transgender. 'This is something that we have all seen over the years and I am so happy that he can finally feel like the person he was born to be!' Oliver's mother added. To drive the point home, the mother of two supplemented her post with a picture of a cartoon stork wearing an 'It's a Boy' cap. While the witty and heart-warming Facebook post was meant to simply keep Gholson Oliver’s family in the loop about a major development in her son's life, it quickly became much more than that, as Daily Dot first reported. The message has gone viral, drawing more than 150 ‘likes’ from loved ones and supportive strangers alike, who praised the Las Vegas hairdresser for embracing her child's life-altering decision. The mother, who has since joined the Gender Justice Nevada group, was surprised by the public’s reaction to her Facebook statement. ‘I had no idea this was going to affect so many people like it has,’ Gholson Oliver wrote in a follow-up post. ‘My hope is that in a short time this topic can just be small talk over coffee.’ Then and now: The Las Vegas teen was born Jessica Oliver (left) 19 years ago, but he has always known that his real gender was male. Transformation: Jes enjoys when people use male pronounces to address him, including his mother (right) and his girlfriend. Jes Oliver then shared his mother's message on his Tumblr page, adding, 'Heck yeah, mom,' at the bottom. The post quickly exploded online, and Oliver’s page has been overwhelmed with more than 150,000 comments from other Tumblr users. Over the past week-and-half, Oliver has been responding to questions from curious Internet users about what it means to be FtM transgender - female to male. Photos on Jes Oliver's Facebook and Tumblr account depict a masculine-looking teenager with piercing blue eyes, short dark hair and oval face with a cleft chin. He has an 18-year-old girlfriend, Hailey, who calls herself ‘Jesse’s girl’ on her social media account. Real identity: Jes Oliver got a new birth certificate late last year and has since begun going to gender therapy sessions. Although he was born with female reproductive organs, Jes Oliver has always known that it was the wrong gender for him. The 19-year-old also has a younger sister, Juliana. An old photo from their childhood, which Oliver shared online, shows the two sisters smiling into the camera, with Jes on the right rocking a black Harley-Davidson baseball cap turned backwards. In response to a question from a Tumblr user, the 19-year-old explained that when he was in the sixth grade in Missouri, where the family are originally from, he was pretending to be a boy on a drawing website and chatting with girls online. 'My mom found out and questioned it, but the conversation only went like “if you’re gay that’s okay me and dad still love you,”' Oliver wrote, adding that despite his parents’ positive attitude, he denied being gay 'to the end of time.' Then last September, the Las Vegas teen finally came out to his parents and friends as a transgender male. The family quickly set the wheels in motion, applying for an official name change. Last December, the former Jessica Oliver got a new birth certificate with the correct gender - male. The outspoken and inspiring young man, who describes himself as a ‘pretty decent dude,' has been blogging about the process of his transformation. Supportive: Miss Gholson Oliver has joined the Gender Justice Nevada group to raise awareness of transgender people like her son. A few months ago, Oliver began attending gender therapy sessions. The goal is for him to eventually obtain what is called a T letter - a letter of recommendation for hormone replacement therapy. One of the things he enjoys the most is when people use male pronounces when addressing him. Oliver was especially overjoyed when his mother took to referring to the teen as a ‘he.’ ‘The other day my mom told me she’s gonna start trying harder to use male pronouns and I’ve even heard her use ‘em when she’s around me,’ Jes Oliver gushed. ‘Hot diggity dog, that’s cool.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Jodi Gholson Oliver, a Las Vegas mother, posted a heart-warming message on Facebook in support of her 19-year-old transgender son, Jes Oliver.

If it hits a solid object, like a drum or a table, the particles inside the object start to dance and vibrate, and we hear a sound, like a tone or a noise.

Write an article based on this summary: – Yesterday saw a Washington Post report that raised fundamental questions about reports that Sen. Robert Menendez was involved with Dominican prostitutes. Now, the Daily Caller, which originally broke the story, says the Post's takedown is full of holes: The paper misidentified an escort at the heart of the case, the Caller holds. According to the Post report, an escort named Nexis de los Santos Santana attested in an affidavit that she was paid by a lawyer to appear in a video claiming she'd been paid by the New Jersey Democrat for sex. In the video, \\"those are my words and that is me, but it does not reflect the truth,\\" she said, per the affidavit. That lawyer, in turn, says he was misled about how the tape would be used; the two said they believed it was to be used as evidence in a divorce case.

Article:","completion":"Title: The Controversy Over Reports of Sen. Menendez's Alleged Involvement with Dominican Prostitutes Introduction: The ongoing allegations against Senator Robert Menendez have ignited a debate between the Washington Post and the Daily Caller, with both news organizations disputing each other's versions of events concerning Menendez's alleged involvement with Dominican prostitutes. Background: The Washington Post report published yesterday raised questions about how trustworthy the initial reports were that Sens. Robert Menendez was involved with Dominican prostitutes. The original story was broken by the Daily Caller, which now argues that the Post's take on the story contains inconsistencies and misidentifications. Claims from Washington Post: According to the Washington Post, an escort named Nexis de los Santos Santana claimed, in an affidavit, that she was paid by a lawyer to appear in a video wherein she says she was paid by the New Jersey Democrat for sex. However, she later stated in the affidavit that \\"those are my words and that is me, but it does not reflect the truth.\\" She said that she thought the video would be used as evidence in a divorce case. The lawyer involved also said he was misled about how the video would be used. Counterclaims from the Daily Caller: In response to the Post's story, the Daily Caller asserts that neither of the women who appeared in its video exposé were named Nexis de los Santos Santana. It also argues that there are other flaws in the Washington Post’s report. For example, it says the Post’s story indicates that de los Santos identified a prominent lawyer in her video confession, but according to the Daily Caller, no such name was spoken in the video interview. Washington Post Hits Back: In defense of its reporting, the Washington Post stands by its story and refutes the Daily Caller's claims that its reporter did not reach out before publication, as documented by Politico. The debate between the two news organizations continues with no clear resolution in sight. Conclusion: The veracity of the allegations against Sen. Menendez remains uncertain as the Washington Post and the Daily Caller dispute one another's claims. As the debate continues, it is unclear which news organization's version of events will ultimately be proven accurate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: The Ironton Railroad became part of which Class 1 Railroad Corporation? A:","completion":"The Ironton Railroad became part of the Conrail Corporation, which was a Class 1 Railroad Corporation in the United States. To provide a detailed and historical context to this answer, let us first understand the journey of the Ironton Railroad, its connections with other railroads, and how it eventually became part of the Conrail Corporation. Founded in 1861, the Ironton Railroad was initially created to transport iron ore from the various iron mines near Ironton, Pennsylvania to the Lehigh Valley Railroad (LVRR) at Catasauqua. In its early years, the railroad primarily served as a short line railroad and was only 9.2 miles long. Nevertheless, the Ironton Railroad played a crucial role in supporting the local iron industry, which was a vital part of the economy in the region. Over the years, the business of the Ironton Railroad expanded as it connected to other important railroads and industries. Although the rail line was initially constructed to transport iron ore, it later began handling coal, cement, and even passengers. By the 20th century, due to industrial progress and the decline of the iron industry in the region, the railroad started to see a decrease in the transportation of iron and subsequently shifted its focus to other freight traffic. In 1902, the Ironton Railroad leased its line to the Lehigh Valley Railroad (LVRR), which significantly connected the railroads and contributed to the Ironton Railroad's extents and exposure to larger markets. The Lehigh Valley Railroad operated and expanded the Ironton line, and by this time, the cement industry had become a prominent source of revenue for the Ironton railroad, substituting its earlier focus on iron transportation. However, the existence of the Lehigh Valley Railroad itself was turbulent. The LVRR faced bankruptcy and financial difficulties during the mid-20th century. After a series of attempts to maintain the railroad, the LVRR was finally declared bankrupt in 1970, and its operations were eventually merged with other bankrupt northeastern railroads. This merging resulted in the creation of a new Class 1 Railroad Corporation, the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail), in 1976. Conrail was established by the United States government to salvage and reconsolidate the rail services in the northeastern region for better efficiency and cost-effectiveness. As a result, the Ironton Railroad, through its connections and lease agreement with the Lehigh Valley Railroad (LVRR), became a part of the Conrail Corporation. After becoming one of the Class 1 railroads under Conrail, the Ironton Railroad continued to operate as an essential line for freight traffic services, transporting cement and other essential commodities in the region. In conclusion, the Ironton Railroad, which initially started as an iron ore transportation service, got connected with other major railroads and evolved in terms of its services and extent. The integration of the Ironton Railroad with the Lehigh Valley Railroad (LVRR) was crucial in its growth, and as LVRR eventually became a part of the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) in 1976, the Ironton Railroad also joined the Conrail Corporation, thus becoming a part of a Class 1 Railroad Corporation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Form a seal around the drain then push & pull the plunger up and down without removing it. Reasoning: Using a plunger effectively requires creating a strong seal around the drain so that the pressure generated from pushing and pulling the plunger can dislodge any clogs within the drain. By forming a seal around the drain and maintaining it consistently while pushing and pulling the plunger, a sustained pressure is created that maximizes the chances of clearing the blockage. Removing and reinserting the plunger between each push and pull motion, as described in option 2, would weaken the seal and reduce the effectiveness of the plunging action."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The most precise timekeeping device of the ancient world was the water clock, or clepsydra, one of which was found in the tomb of Egyptian pharaoh Amenhotep I (1525–1504 BC). They could be used to measure the hours even at night, but required manual upkeep to replenish the flow of water. The Ancient Greeks and the people from Chaldea (southeastern Mesopotamia) regularly maintained timekeeping records as an essential part of their astronomical observations. Arab inventors and engineers in particular made improvements on the use of water clocks up to the Middle Ages. In the 11th century, Chinese inventors and engineers invented the first mechanical clocks driven by an escapement mechanism. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Why did the Chinese maintain timekeeping records in the 11th century?","completion":"The Chinese maintained timekeeping records in the 11th century for various reasons, some of which included: 1. Civil and bureaucratic purposes: Accurate timekeeping was essential for the efficient functioning of the Chinese imperial bureaucracy. This would ensure that officials could properly schedule and arrange their daily tasks, meetings, and other important administrative activities. 2. Astronomical and astrological observations: Like many ancient civilizations, the Chinese had a strong interest in studying celestial events. Timekeeping was critical for accurately observing and predicting astronomical phenomena, such as eclipses and the movement of stars and planets. 3. Agricultural planning: Having accurate timekeeping records helped to determine the best times for planting and harvesting crops based on seasonal changes. 4. Cultural and religious practices: Timekeeping played a crucial role in Chinese society for determining the appropriate times to conduct religious and cultural ceremonies, as many of these events were based on the lunar calendar. 5. Technological advancements: The invention of mechanical clocks in the 11th century by Chinese inventors was a groundbreaking innovation and demonstrated the value of accurate timekeeping. The development of these clocks allowed for a greater level of precision in measuring time compared to previous water clock technologies. In summary, the Chinese maintained timekeeping records in the 11th century for civil, bureaucratic, astronomical, agricultural, cultural, religious, and technological reasons."},{"prompt":"Question: Q: Mammalian lungs are located in what cavity, where they are surrounded and protected by the rib cage, intercostal muscles, and chest wall?

Wood senior had started in his family's pawnbroking business, but by the time of his son's birth he was trading as a jeweller, optician and engineering modeller, much sought-after for his model engines. It was a musical household: Wood senior was an amateur cellist and sang as principal tenor in the choir of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate, known as \\"the musicians' church\\". His wife played the piano and sang songs from her native Wales. They encouraged their son's interest in music, buying him a Broadwood piano, on which his mother gave him lessons. The young Wood also learned to play the violin and viola. Wood received little religious inspiration at St Sepulchre, but was deeply stirred by the playing of the resident organist, George Cooper, who allowed him into the organ loft and gave him his first lessons on the instrument. Cooper died when Wood was seven, and the boy took further lessons from Cooper's successor, Edwin M. Lott, for whom Wood had much less regard. At the age of ten, through the influence of one of his uncles, Wood made his first paid appearance as an organist at St Mary Aldermanbury, being paid half a crown. In June 1883, visiting the Fisheries Exhibition at South Kensington with his father, Wood was invited to play the organ in one of the galleries, making a good enough impression to be engaged to give recitals at the exhibition building over the next three months. At this time in his life, painting was nearly as strong an interest as music, and he studied in his spare time at the Slade School of Fine Art. He remained a life-long amateur painter.After taking private lessons from the musicologist Ebenezer Prout, Wood entered the Royal Academy of Music at the age of seventeen, studying harmony and composition with Prout, organ with Charles Steggall, and piano with Walter Macfarren.

Sean Heisey and Ted Czech A charge of ethnic intimidation was later dropped against Amanda Warfel Amanda Marie Warfel (Photo: Submitted) UPDATE:Woman pleads guilty in loud sex case. Some nights, before two of her daughters went to bed, Tanya Saylor would give them headphones. That would help block the noise — the music, the threats and the sex noises. The sounds were coming from the other side of a wall the room shared with a neighboring row home in Red Lion. Sometimes they lasted until 3 a.m. \\"It's pretty pathetic when you have to have a protocol due to your neighbor's actions,\\" Saylor said Monday. Saylor, her terminally ill husband and her five children — all between the ages of 9 and 17 and one of whom has cancer — dealt with the noise for two years, she said. And in April, the neighbor, 25-year-old Amanda Marie Warfel, pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and harassment charges for incidents that took place in February and March, according to charging documents. Those charges were reduced to non-traffic citations, according to District Judge John H. Fishel's office. A charge of ethnic intimidation — originally filed against Warfel in connection with a Feb. 28 incident — was dropped. An ongoing problem Two of Saylor's daughters — a 15-year-old and a 17-year-old — share a room in their row home in the 100 block of West Gay Street. That room shares a wall with Warfel's room, she said. When the noise first became an issue about two years ago, Saylor said she would knock on the door and ask Warfel to quiet down. It didn't help. Warfel would call her daughters names and threaten them, she said. As she was having sex, she would describe the acts loudly enough for the girls to hear, she said. WHAT'S IN A TOWN: Learn more about Red Lion borough. On March 21, Warfel was \\"loudly fornicating and banging around her bedroom to the degree that the victims' dresser and her own bed shook,\\" documents state. A family member knocked on the common wall, but Warfel yelled back and the noise became louder, documents state. On Feb. 28 around 11:15 p.m., Warfel made \\"racist comments\\" and ignored requests to turn down her music, according to charging documents. One of Saylor's daughters, who was trying to sleep, again asked Warfel to turn the music down, and Warfel allegedly responded by using derogatory language. The daughter is black, documents state. But it wasn't about the racial comments, Saylor said. Not really. \\"We're not a family that gets easily offended,\\" she said. It was about the impact the situation was having on her family. \\"She harassed my kids for two years,\\" Saylor said. \\"We let it go for two years.... I shouldn't have let it go that long. I should have started calling the police a year ago.\\" Warfel's loudness, she said, would keep her two daughters up so late that one would have trouble getting to school on time the next morning. On two occasions, state police wrote notes to the school to excuse her lateness, she said. Her 17-year-old daughter, who has cancer, needed to be quarantined after getting treatment. She stayed in the room for 10 days in January because \\"she had to be isolated up there,\\" Saylor said. During that time, Warfel had sex \\"nonstop, making sure that my daughter heard,\\" she said. \\"I couldn't do anything,\\" Saylor said. \\"I couldn't be around her; nobody could.\\" And the mother of five hardly ever saw Warfel, who stayed cooped up in the neighboring row home, she said.

Court documents show Amanda Marie Warfel is now facing two misdemeanor counts of disorderly conduct and one misdemeanor count of harassment stemming from the incidents.

Victim mentality not only limits one's growth, but it also creates a downward spiral of negative emotions, poor self-esteem, and unhappiness. This article aims to provide practical advice and steps to help you stop playing the role of victim and embrace positivity, self-love, and well-being in your life. 1. Stop Thinking Like a Victim Taking responsibility for your actions and thoughts is the first step to overcoming a victim mentality. Acknowledge that you are not helpless and do not need to be rescued by someone else. Understand that you have the power within you to change your situation and shape your destiny. Stop dwelling on blame or past failures and start focusing on what you can do to improve your current circumstances. 2. Kick Negative Self-Talk to the Curb Negative self-talk is one of the biggest culprits of victim mentality. Replacing these destructive thoughts with positive affirmations and empowering beliefs can drastically change your mindset. Practice mindfulness and be kind to yourself. When you catch yourself thinking negatively, stop and replace the thought with something more positive and encouraging. 3. Love Yourself and Others Self-love is often underrated but is crucial in building a positive self-image. Accept and embrace your imperfections, rather than constantly striving for perfection. Recognize your worth and believe in your abilities. Additionally, show love and empathy towards others. Practicing acts of kindness and forgiveness not only contributes to the well-being of others but can dramatically boost your self-esteem and happiness. 4. Engage in Activities You Love Regularly Pursuing activities, hobbies, and interests that bring you joy is a vital part of maintaining a positive outlook on life. Find what makes you truly happy and make time for it in your daily routine. Engaging in activities you love can help take your mind off of negative thoughts and create more opportunities for growth and fulfillment. 5. Make Use of Social Support Having a strong support network can significantly help in overcoming victim mentality. Connect with friends, family, or support groups who understand and encourage your journey towards positivity and self-love. Surround yourself with people who uplift your spirits and provide constructive advice when you need it. Remember that you are not alone; others have faced similar challenges and can empathize with your situation. 6. Nurture Your Body A healthy body is essential for a healthy mind. Prioritize physical self-care by exercising regularly, eating a balanced diet, and getting enough sleep. These practices not only improve your physical well-being but also impact your mental health, mood, and attitude. Make a conscious effort to listen to your body's needs and commit to a healthier lifestyle. 7. Practice Gratitude Gratitude has been proven to have a powerful impact on one's well-being. Make it a habit to express gratitude for the good things in your life, no matter how small or insignificant they may seem. Keep a gratitude journal, verbalize your thankfulness to others, or simply take a moment each day to reflect on the positive aspects of your life. Gratitude can help shift your focus away from negativity and amplify your appreciation for the world around you. 8. Turn to Your Spirituality Regardless of your religious or spiritual beliefs, embracing and nurturing your spiritual side can provide a strong foundation for overcoming victim mentality. Engage in spiritual practices such as meditation, prayer, or mindfulness to help gain emotional strength and resilience. Connecting with a higher power or purpose can provide a sense of guidance and belonging, making it easier to navigate life's challenges. Conclusion Overcoming victim mentality involves changes in mindset, behavior, and emotions. Breaking free from this limiting state provides an opportunity to embrace positivity, self-love, and personal growth. By applying the steps in this article, you can begin to take charge of your life, improve your well-being, and drive your destiny towards a more fulfilling and rewarding future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While the phrasing of the questions may differ slightly, the underlying meaning is the same. Both of them imply that the person wants to remove their current answer and replace it with a new one. To provide a more in-depth understanding, let's examine both questions separately. 1. I want to add a new answer. How do I permanently remove my existing answer for a question? This question explicitly mentions that the person wants to remove their existing answer permanently, which means completely erasing it. They then want to write a new answer for the same question in place of the previous one. The focus here is on removing the old answer and adding a new response. 2. What if I want to write a new answer to a question I have already answered? In this question, the person is simply asking about the possibility of composing a new answer to a question they have already answered. The implication here is that they might want to remove or replace their previous response with a new one. While the question may not explicitly mention \\"permanently remove,\\" it still carries the same notion of replacing the existing answer with a new one. It's important to note that the methods for achieving this deletion and replacement process might vary depending on the platform or context where the answers are being provided.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Alexander the Great's accomplishments and legacy have been depicted in many cultures. Alexander has figured in both high and popular culture beginning in his own era to the present day. The Alexander Romance, in particular, has had a significant impact on portrayals of Alexander in later cultures, from Persian to medieval European to modern Greek. Alexander may already have considered himself as the \\"King of Asia\\" after his victory at Issos, a conception strengthened by his subsequent successes. The conception might have inspired the title given to Alexander in Babylonian documents, \\"king of the world (since \\"king of Asia\\" had no meaning in Babylonian geography). It might also be alluded in the sarcastic comments by Anaxarchus, trying to rouse Alexander after the murder of Cleitus. or in the orator Demades' comments that if Alexander were dead, \\"The whole world would stink of his corpse\\". Alexander is called \\"kosmokrator\\", ruler of the world, in the later Alexander Romance. Alexander features prominently in modern Greek folklore, more so than any other ancient figure. The colloquial form of his name in modern Greek (\\"O Megalexandros\\") is a household name, and he is the only ancient hero to appear in the Karagiozis shadow play. One well-known fable among Greek seamen involves a solitary mermaid who would grasp a ship's prow during a storm and ask the captain \\"Is King Alexander alive?\\".

What is the answer to this question? how many football players are in a team?","completion":"In a football team, the total number of players varies depending on the specific rules and regulations under which the game is being played. However, in most cases, particularly within the realm of association football (also known as soccer) and American football, the number of players in a team is clearly defined. In association football, or soccer, each team is comprised of 11 players, including 1 goalkeeper and 10 outfield players. The outfield players can be further divided into positions as follows: 1. Defenders: These players are responsible for preventing the opposition from scoring goals. Defenders typically include central defenders, full-backs, and wing-backs. There are usually 4 defenders in a team, but formations may vary depending on the team's strategy. 2. Midfielders: These players are crucial for maintaining possession of the ball, creating goal-scoring opportunities, and assisting defensively. Midfielders can be divided into central midfielders, attacking midfielders, and defensive midfielders. Typically, a team has 3 to 5 midfielders, again, depending on the chosen formation. 3. Forwards: These players focus primarily on scoring goals, and their roles include center forwards, wingers, and strikers. Generally, a team will have 1 to 3 forwards on the field. In American football, each team is composed of 11 players on the field at any given time. However, unlike soccer, American football teams maintain separate squads for offense, defense, and special teams. The 11 players on each squad have different positions and roles: 1. Offensive team: The players in the offensive squad contribute to the team's goal-scoring efforts. Their positions include the quarterback, running backs, wide receivers, tight ends, offensive linemen (including tackles, guards, and centers), and occasionally a fullback. 2. Defensive team: The defensive squad is responsible for preventing the opposing team from scoring. Key positions in the defense include defensive linemen (defensive tackles and defensive ends), linebackers, cornerbacks, and safeties. 3. Special teams: Responsible for plays involving punts, kickoffs, field goals, and extra points, the special teams squad is comprised of various players who specialize in kicking, punting, or returning kicks, as well as blockers and other specialists. The total number of players on an American football team roster typically ranges from 45 to 53, depending on professional, collegiate, or other league rules. However, each team is only allowed 11 players on the field during active gameplay. In summary, a soccer team and an American football team both have 11 players on the field at any given time, but the roles and positions of the players, as well as the total roster size, are quite different between the two sports."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This planet is almost an exact copy of Earth, but it is currently uninhabited by intelligent life. Upon landing, the explorers name the planet Caprica and begin learning as much as they can. They discover that the species on this Caprica are nearly all the same as on Earth, and even most of the topography looks the same. However, the main difference is that humans never evolved here. For this reason, there are no cities or cars or factories to burn up fossil fuels. Does Earth have more or less greenhouse gases than Caprica? Hint: When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Earth has more greenhouse gases than Caprica. The primary reason for this difference is the presence of human activities on Earth, which have significantly contributed to the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. On Earth, humans have extensively utilized fossil fuels for various purposes, such as transportation, energy production, and industrial processes. The burning of these fossil fuels releases a large amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which is a major greenhouse gas. This increase in carbon dioxide disrupts the natural carbon cycle and leads to an imbalance between the amount of carbon dioxide released and the amount absorbed through processes such as photosynthesis. In contrast, Caprica, being devoid of human presence and the associated activities, does not experience the same level of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel consumption. Given the similarities between the two planets in terms of species and topography, it is likely that the natural carbon cycle on Caprica is more balanced, with fewer disruptions in the process. This would result in lower overall greenhouse gas levels on the planet. In summary, Earth has more greenhouse gases than Caprica, primarily due to the impact of human activities that involve the burning of fossil fuels and contribute to the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Wilson and Brent Maddock, who are best known for their collaborations on various movies, such as \\"Tremors\\" and \\"Batteries Not Included.\\" \\"Short Circuit\\" tells the story of an experimental military robot named Number 5, which is developed by the fictional company NOVA Robotics. The robot is initially designed for military use and is equipped with advanced artificial intelligence, allowing it to learn and adapt autonomously. However, after being struck by lightning during a demonstration, Number 5's programming malfunctions, leading the robot to gain self-awareness and a profound desire to experience life beyond its designated purpose as a weapon. As Number 5 begins to explore the world around it, the robot befriends a young woman named Stephanie Speck, played by Ally Sheedy. Stephanie, a kind-hearted and animal-loving person, becomes instrumental in helping Number 5 understand the value of life and the importance of preserving it. With Stephanie's help, Number 5 embraces a pacifist attitude and works to avoid being captured and destroyed by its creators, who believe it has gone rogue and poses a threat to society. \\"Short Circuit\\" has a lighthearted and comedic tone throughout, with plenty of slapstick humor and amusing interactions between Number 5 and other characters. In addition to Sheedy, the film features actors like Steve Guttenberg, Fisher Stevens, and G.W. Bailey, who deliver entertaining performances that contribute to the overall charm of the movie. The robot character of Johnny 5 is brought to life through a combination of puppetry, animatronics, and remote control technology. The design and mechanics involved in creating Johnny 5 were the work of Syd Mead, a renowned visual futurist and industrial designer who also contributed designs to iconic films such as \\"Blade Runner\\" and \\"Aliens.\\" Due to the success of \\"Short Circuit,\\" a sequel titled \\"Short Circuit 2\\" was released in 1988,-directed by Kenneth Johnson. The sequel follows Johnny 5 as he continues to learn about the world and adapt to life among humans while helping his friend Ben Jahrvi, played by Fisher Stevens, to produce and sell toy versions of himself. In conclusion, Johnny 5 is the central character in the 1986 science fiction comedy film \\"Short Circuit.\\" The film's unique blend of humor, adventure, and a lovable robot protagonist made it a commercial success and contributed to the creation of a sequel, as well as cementing its legacy as a beloved and enduring piece of 80s popular culture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information: - Flint corn (\\"Zea mays\\" var. \\"indurata\\"; also known as Indian corn or sometimes calico corn) is a variant of maize, the same species as common corn. Because each kernel has a hard outer layer to protect the soft endosperm, it is likened to being hard as flint; hence the name. - The Andropogoneae, sometimes called the sorghum tribe, are a large tribe of grasses (family Poaceae) with roughly 1,200 species in 90 genera, mainly distributed in tropical and subtropical areas. They include such important crops as maize (corn), sugarcane, and sorghum. All species in this tribe use C carbon fixation, which makes them competitive under warm, high-light conditions. - Forage is plant material (mainly plant leaves and stems) eaten by grazing livestock. Historically, the term \\"forage\\" has meant only plants eaten by the animals directly as pasture, crop residue, or immature cereal crops, but it is also used more loosely to include similar plants cut for fodder and carried to the animals, especially as hay or silage. The term forage fish refers to small schooling fish that are preyed on by larger aquatic animals. - Dent corn also known as yellow dent corn, Reid's yellow dent corn, white dent corn, or field corn, is a variety of maize or corn with a high soft starch content. It received its name because of the small indentation (\\"dent\\") at the crown of each kernel on a ripe ear of corn. It is a variety developed by northern Illinois farmer James L. Reid. Reid and his father, Robert Reid, moved from Brown County, Ohio to Tazewell County, Illinois in 1846 bringing with them a red corn variety known as \\"Johnny Hopkins\\", and crossed it with varieties of flint corn and floury corn. Most of today's hybrid corn varieties and cultivars are derived from it. This variety won a prize at the 1893 World's Fair. - Panicoideae is the second - largest subfamily of the grasses with over 3,500 species , mainly distributed in warm temperate and tropical regions . It comprises some important agricultural crops , including sugarcane , maize ( or corn ) , sorghum , and switchgrass . C4 photosynthesis evolved independently a number of times in the subfamily , which presumably had a C3 ancestor . - Maize (; \\"Zea mays\\" subsp. \\"mays\\", from after Taíno \\"mahiz\\"), also known as corn, is a large grain plant first domesticated by indigenous peoples in Mexico about 10,000 years ago. The six major types of corn are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn. - Sorghum is a genus of plants in the grass family. Seventeen of the twenty-five species are native to Australia, with the range of some extending to Africa, Asia, Mesoamerica, and certain islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. - Indigenous peoples, also known as first peoples, aboriginal peoples, native peoples, or autochthonous peoples, are ethnic groups who are descended from and identify with the original inhabitants of a given region, in contrast to groups that have settled, occupied or colonized the area more recently. Groups are usually described as indigenous when they maintain traditions or other aspects of an early culture that is associated with a given region. Not all indigenous peoples share such characteristics. Indigenous peoples may be settled in a given locale/region or exhibit a nomadic lifestyle across a large territory, but they are generally historically associated with a specific territory on which they depend. Indigenous societies are found in every inhabited climate zone and continent of the world. - Sugarcane, or sugar cane, are several species of tall perennial true grasses of the genus \\"Saccharum\\", tribe Andropogoneae, native to the warm temperate to tropical regions of South Asia and Melanesia, and used for sugar production. It has stout, jointed, fibrous stalks that are rich in the sugar sucrose, which accumulates in the stalk internodes. The plant is tall. All sugar cane species interbreed and the major commercial cultivars are complex hybrids. Sugarcane belongs to the grass family Poaceae, an economically important seed plant family that includes maize, wheat, rice, and sorghum, and many forage crops. - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León. - Flour corn (\\"Zea mays\\" var. \\"amylacea\\") is a variety of corn with a soft starchy endosperm and a thin pericarp. It is primarily used to make corn flour. - Popcorn is a type of corn that expands from the kernel and puffs up when heated. Popcorn is able to pop like amaranth grain, sorghum, quinoa, and millet. When heated, pressure builds within the kernel, and a small explosion (or \\"pop\\") is the end result. Some strains of corn are now cultivated specifically as popping corns. - Sucrose is a common, naturally occurring saccharide found in many plants and plant parts. Saccharose is an obsolete name for sugars in general, especially sucrose. The molecule is a disaccharide combination of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose with the formula CHO. - Saccharum is a genus of tall perennial plants of the broomsedge tribe within the grass family. - Sweet corn (\\"Zea mays\\" convar. \\"saccharata\\" var. \\"rugosa\\"; also called sugar corn and pole corn) is a variety of maize with a high sugar content. Sweet corn is the result of a naturally occurring recessive mutation in the genes which control conversion of sugar to starch inside the endosperm of the corn kernel. Unlike field corn varieties, which are harvested when the kernels are dry and mature (dent stage), sweet corn is picked when immature (milk stage) and prepared and eaten as a vegetable, rather than a grain. Since the process of maturation involves converting sugar to starch, sweet corn stores poorly and must be eaten fresh, canned, or frozen, before the kernels become tough and starchy. History. Sweet corn occurs as a spontaneous mutation in field corn and was grown by several Native American tribes. The Iroquois gave the first recorded sweet corn (called 'Papoon') to European settlers in 1779. It soon became a popular food in southern and central regions of the United States. Open pollinated cultivars of white sweet corn started to become widely available in the United States in the 19th century. Two of the most enduring cultivars, still available today, are 'Country Gentleman' (a Shoepeg corn with small kernels in irregular rows) and 'Stowell's Evergreen'.

Q:\\"Because all of you of Earth are idiots!\\" shouted Tom, wearily wiping the glass counter, removing coconut oil from the reflections of overpriced candy bars. Inside the theater the movie echoed him: \\"Because all of you of Earth are idiots!\\" Tom sighed, not for the first time that evening. The Manager, who paid in cash every Sunday, had decided to take advantage of the bizarre tastes of his Generation X clients and offer an Ed Wood film festival. Bride of the Monster, Plan 9 From Outer Space, and Night of the Ghouls ran on the second, smaller screen on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, two bucks a head. The Manager was making a killing. Tom, who needed the job in order to move out of his parents' trailer home, found little about the Ed Wood canon amusing, although it was light-years beyond anything by Coleman Francis. Even so, Tom had been forced to hear the dialog of each film, on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday... He only had to watch them once, having filled in for the Manager's weasel-featured nephew/projectionist Neoldner, who had called in sick to buy grass in Beloit. But he would have been able to forget the experience had it not been for the penetrating soundtrack which bled into the lobby. The ordeal, for tonight, was almost over - the concession stand closed after Plan 9. He hoped he had sold enough to keep his job - there was the worry that the Manager would increase his profit margin by manning the concession stand himself. But the Manager strolled out of the second theater with a broad grin, revealing his cutting overbite. \\"I don't know why,\\" the Manager exclaimed, \\"but they love it!\\" \\"Most of them are from the 'Ed 9 Film Society,'\\" Tom replied. \\"By the way, I need to restock the chocolates.\\" Who was was making good money from saling movie tickets? - The manager of the store - Ed Wood - Tom - not enough information A:","completion":"The manager of the store was making good money from selling movie tickets.

Quezon on recommendations by MacArthur, to become the chief of police of a new capital being planned, now named Quezon City, but he declined the offer. A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Options: (1). yes (2). no","completion":"(1). Yes To provide a more detailed and elaborate answer, Dwight D. Eisenhower was serving as a military advisor to the Philippines from 1935 to 1939. During this period, he worked closely with General Douglas MacArthur and the Philippine government. The Philippine Commonwealth Government, under the leadership of President Manuel L. Quezon, was focused on developing and modernizing the country, which included the establishment of a new capital city called Quezon City. In recognition of Eisenhower's expertise and experience in security and law enforcement, President Quezon, based on MacArthur's recommendation, offered him the position of chief of police. Being the chief of police for the new capital, Eisenhower would have played a significant role in maintaining law and order, developing the organization's structure and strategies, and ensuring the security of the growing city. However, Eisenhower declined the offer. His decision can be attributed to various factors, including a preference for a military career over a local law enforcement position. Ultimately, he continued his military service under MacArthur, leading to his distinguished career during World War II and beyond, eventually becoming the 34th President of the United States. In conclusion, Eisenhower's response to the offer to become the Philippine police chief was to decline the opportunity, preferring to remain focused on his military career and his existing responsibilities as a military advisor to the Philippines. His choice proved to be significant for his own career and the broader historical context, considering the roles he played in the successes of World War II and his subsequent presidency."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He'd founded the company three years back and, just a few hours ago, his partners and erstwhile friends had fired him without cause or warning. He concentrated hard as his pen brought to life demonic figures from one of the best-selling comics he'd created, scythe wielding cyber-men called Myrmidons who tore into surprised computer programmers with fangs and claws. Elsewhere on the page, computers assembled themselves into 21st century Golems, rising up against traitorous CEO's and producers to crush them to bloody pulp as they cowered beneath their desks. Sitting at the bar in Señor Goldstein's Mexican Restaurant in San Jose, California, Paul's own artwork engaged him for the first time in months, maybe years. Under other circumstances, that would have made him happy. But today's circumstances allowed only two emotions: despair and a burning desire for revenge. Not wanting to succumb to the former, and not quite wanting to find a gun and go back to the office, he instead drew. He had turned to a fresh page and begun to sketch his most elaborate revenge-scheme yet when a woman walked into his line of vision. There were four or five other women in the restaurant already (most of them employees), but this one stood out. This one would've stood out anywhere.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of Andy's character on Taxi? Andy Kaufman is a struggling performer whose act fails in nightclubs because, while the audience wants comedy, he sings children's songs and refuses to tell conventional jokes. As the audience begins to believe that Kaufman may have no real talent, his previously timid \\"foreign man\\" character puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them. He catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro, who signs Kaufman as a client and immediately lands him a network TV series, Taxi, much to Kaufman's dismay, since he dislikes sitcoms. Because of the money, visibility, and a promise that he can do his own television special, Kaufman accepts the role, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named Latka Gravas. Secretly he hates doing the show and expresses a desire to quit. Invited to catch a different act at a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance by a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer, Tony Clifton, whom Kaufman wants to guest-star on Taxi. Clifton's bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. But backstage, when he meets Shapiro in person, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually Kaufman.

Their lives and works are connected with the lonely moors of Yorkshire, England, where they lived. Patrick Bronte, the sisters' father, was a poor Irishman who became the parish clergyman of the small, isolated town of Haworth, Yorkshire. Bronte was somewhat strange and tended to be strict. His wife died in 1821 and her sister brought up the family out of duty, but with little love or understanding. The sisters went to several boarding schools where they received a better education than usual for girls at that time, but in a bad atmosphere. Few jobs were available for women at that time, and the Bronte sisters, except for occasional jobs as governesses or schoolteachers, lived their entire lives at home. They were shy, poor, and lonely, and occupied themselves with music, drawing, reading and ---above all---writing. Their isolation led to the early development of their imaginations. In 1846, under the male pen names of Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell, the sisters published a joint volume of poems.Although only two copies were sold, all three sisters soon had their first novels published. Charlotte Bronte's most famous novel Jane Eyre (1847) is largely _ . Through the heroine, Charlotte relived her hated boarding school life and her experiences as a governess in a large house. Rochester, the hero and master of the house, is fictional. Jane Eyre was enormously successful, but many readers were shocked that Rochester, who tried to make Jane his mistress, should be rewarded by marrying her. Some readers were also shocked because Jane wanted to be regarded as a thinking and independent person, rather than as a weak female. Charlotte Bronte wrote three other novels. The first one, The Professor, was not published until 1857, after her death. Shirley (1849) is set among the labour riots of the early 1800s. Villette (1853) the most popular of the three, is based on Charlotte's unhappy experiences as a governess in Brussels. Question: We can infer from the passage that _ .

Independence with Partition: The British began to see India's independence as inevitable; however, only a few seemed to understand the vital role of the religious groups. Britain prepared a parliamentary democracy with majority rule, but the majority were Hindus — and Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs had been killing each other in war for many centuries. Nehru's Congress Party, largely Hindu with a socialist leadership, wanted a parliamentary democracy. As counterweight, British legislation reserved parliamentary seats for religious minorities, but the Punjab and Bengal had such a complicated mixture of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs that it was not possible to avoid fights over how separate constituencies were to be formed. The seeds of future trouble were sown. The legislation on reserving seats gave the Muslims the basis for an alternative to an India in which they were only a quarter of the population: Partition. In 1930, the poet Muhammad Iqbal proposed a separate Muslim homeland in the northwest of India. A small group of Indian Muslims at Cambridge came up with the name Pakistan, using the initials of the Punjab, Afghania (N.W. Frontier Province), Kashmir, and Sind (at the same time producing the word pak, meaning \\"pure\\"), and adding \\"stan,\\" the Persian suffix for the word \\"country. \\" The Muslim campaign for Partition was led by London-trained Bombay lawyer, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Meanwhile, Gandhi vehemently opposed any dismemberment of the country, and tried to keep people united by fasting to uphold the spirit of love, and by focussing on the common adversary: the British. Advocating civil disobedience, he led his famous Salt March to the sea, to scoop up salt and circumvent the hated British salt tax. This put more than 60,000 in jail. Against this militancy, World War II did not elicit the solidarity of the first. Indians courageously fought alongside the British troops, in Burma, the Middle East, and Europe, but Gandhi saw the British as a provocation for Japanese invasion and was jailed yet again, for launching a \\"Quit India\\" campaign in the year 1942. Some anti-British extremists saw the Japanese as an Asian liberator. Winston Churchill didn't want any Indian independence and so it was probably as well for India that he was defeated by Attlee's Labor Party in 1945. With riots growing ever more bloody in Bengal, Bihar, and the Punjab, India's last viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, kept a mandate to make the British departure as quick and as smooth as possible. Quick it was — six months after his arrival — but not smooth.

Everton originally played in the southeast corner of Stanley Park, which was the site for the new Liverpool F.C. stadium, with the first official match taking place in 1879. In 1882, a man named J. Cruitt donated land at Priory Road which became the club's home before they moved to Anfield, which was Everton's home until 1892. At this time, a dispute of how the club was to be owned and run emerged with Anfield's owner and Everton's chairman, John Houlding. A dispute between Houlding and the club's committee over how the club should be run, led to Houlding attempting to gain full control of the club by registering the company, \\"Everton F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd\\". In response, Everton left Anfield for a new ground, Goodison Park, where the club have played ever since. Houlding attempted to take over Everton's name, colours, fixtures and league position, but was denied by The Football Association. Instead, Houlding formed a new club, Liverpool F.C.

Question: The looseness of soil has a positive impact on a plant 's roots' growth in that soil, and most mulches help to keep soil surfaces loose and receptive to water absorption. Given these facts, soil receptive to water absorption has a positive impact on what aspect of the plant among the following options: - support - growth - stem thickness - root growth - energy - dry roots - Energy. - bud amount Answer:","completion":"The soil's receptiveness to water absorption primarily has a positive impact on the growth and root growth of the plant among the options provided. Let's delve deeper into each of the aspects and understand how soil loose in texture and its water absorption capacity influences each. 1. Support: While this term is a bit ambiguous in the context of plant biology, we can assume it refers to structural support. While planting in loose soil can help a plant establish more easily and provide a certain degree of physical support, the soil's water absorption affects support indirectly. Well-hydrated roots become stronger and may provide a better anchor to the plant in the soil, improving the overall support. 2. Growth: Both the looseness of soil and its water absorption capabilities have a direct impact on growth. Loose soil allows for easy root growth, as it means the roots can penetrate deep into the soil without much resistance. Increased water absorption provides more water to the plant, which is essential for photosynthesis and nutrient transportation within the plant. Therefore, the soil being receptive to water absorption has a very positive direct impact on the plant's overall growth. 3. Stem Thickness: The watering level can indirectly influence stem thickness, as plants in an optimal water environment have the potential to grow more robust; however, it's not the primary driver. Genetic factors, light exposure, and nutrient content play more substantial roles. 4. Root Growth: Loose soil and the soil's water absorption have a significant impact on root growth. Loose soil allows roots to spread and grow without restriction, and the ability of soil to absorb and retain water ensures that the roots have a consistent supply of water, encouraging root growth and development. 5. Energy: When we speak about the energy of a plant, we're referring to the process of photosynthesis - the way a plant converts light energy into chemical energy. Water is a crucial part of this process, so soil that's absorbent does have an impact on a plant's energy. Yet, the level of light exposure, as well as other nutrients in the soil, play a more significant role. 6. Dry Roots: Good water absorption by the soil can prevent roots from drying out, ensuring they maintain the moisture levels necessary for nutrient absorption. Therefore, soil receptive to water absorption indirectly impacts preventing dry roots. 7. Bud Amount: While the soil's water holding capability indirectly affects the bud amount (as a result of promoting overall healthier plant growth), this is not the primary factor. The formation and amount of buds are more directly influenced by the plant's genetic predisposition, seasonal changes, and light exposure. In conclusion, given the options, the soil's capacity to absorb water likely best facilitates plant growth and root growth above the other aspects. The availability of water in the right amounts when need can significantly accelerate and enhance the plant's growth, making it healthier and more robust."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Information: - Archaeology, or archeology, is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture. The archaeological record consists of artifacts, architecture, biofacts or ecofacts, and cultural landscapes. Archaeology can be considered both a social science and a branch of the humanities. In North America, archaeology is considered a sub-field of anthropology, while in Europe archaeology is often viewed as either a discipline in its own right or a sub-field of other disciplines. - Alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama is the 30th-most extensive and the 24th-most populous of the U.S. states. At nearly , Alabama has one of the nation's longest navigable inland waterways. - The Creek War (1813-1814), also known as the Red Stick War and the Creek Civil War, was a regional war between opposing Creek factions, European empires, and the United States, taking place largely in Alabama and along the Gulf Coast. The major conflicts of the war took place between state militias and the \\"Red Stick\\" Creeks. - Fort Mitchell is an unincorporated community in Russell County, Alabama, United States. The area was originally a garrisoned fort intended to provide defense for the area during the Creek War (1813-1814). - Fort Mitchell Historic Site is a park and an archaeological site in Fort Mitchell , Alabama , that was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1990 . The park features a reconstruction of the 1813 stockade fort that was an important United States military post in the Creek War , a museum with exhibits about the fort 's history and a collection of historic carriages , a restored 19th - century log home , and a visitor center . The Chattahoochee Indian Heritage Center has a ceremonial flame memorial to the Creek nation . Interpretive panels recount the history of the Creek War of 1836 and the subsequent forced removal of the Creek peoples along the Trail of Tears . The memorial is located adjacent to Fort Mitchell Historic Site . The site also features historic burial grounds . - The archaeological record is the body of physical (not written) evidence about the past. It is one of the core concepts in archaeology, the academic discipline concerned with documenting and interpreting the archaeological record. Archaeological theory is used to interpret the archaeological record for a better understanding of human cultures. The archaeological record can consist of the earliest ancient findings as well as contemporary artifacts. Human activity has had a large impact on the archaeological record. Destructive human processes, such as agriculture and land development, may damage or destroy potential archaeological sites. Other threats to the archaeological record include natural phenomena and scavenging. Archaeology can be a destructive science for the finite resources of the archaeological record are lost to excavation. Therefore archaeologists limit the amount of excavation that they do at each site and keep meticulous records of what is found. The archaeological record is the record of human history, of why civilizations prosper or fail and why cultures change and grow. It is the story of the world that humans have created. - A stockade is an enclosure of palisades and tall walls made of logs placed side by side vertically with the tops sharpened to provide security. - A National Historic Landmark (NHL) is a building, district, object, site, or structure that is officially recognized by the United States government for its outstanding historical significance. Of over 85,000 places listed on the country's National Register of Historic Places, only some 2,500 are recognized as National Historic Landmarks. - A militia is generally an army or some other type of fighting unit that is composed of non-professional fighters, citizens of a nation or subjects of a state or government who can be called upon to enter a combat situation, as opposed to a professional force of regular, full-time military personnel, or historically, members of the warrior nobility class (e.g., knights or samurai). Unable to hold their own against properly trained and equipped professional forces, it is common for militias to engage in guerrilla warfare or defense instead of being used in open attacks and offensive actions. - The National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) is the United States federal government's official list of districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects deemed worthy of preservation. A property listed in the National Register, or located within a National Register Historic District, may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred preserving the property. - An archaeological site is a place (or group of physical sites) in which evidence of past activity is preserved (either prehistoric or historic or contemporary), and which has been, or may be, investigated using the discipline of archaeology and represents a part of the archaeological record.

Question: Who made a cameo? Title: A Modern Musketeer Movie plot: The film opens with a sequence in which D'Artagnan (Douglas Fairbanks) rides up to a tavern on horseback and ends up brawling with sword and fist with the patrons inside in his haste to approach a fair young stranger. After triumphing, he morphs into modern day Ned Thacker (also played by Fairbanks). Ned is born and raised in Kansas by a mother who passes along to him her love of D'Artagnan and The Three Musketeers, despite his father's concern that it is not good for him. In fact, Ned does get into trouble with his (sometimes unwanted) chivalrous attempts to help women. Finally, Ned can stand it no more; he decides to leave dull Kansas. In mirroring scenes, D'Artagnan is astride a somewhat less-than-noble steed, a present from his father for his departure from home, while Ned's father gives him the modern equivalent: a car. While driving in the desert, he comes upon a chauffeur-driven automobile stopped because the road ahead has been washed away. Unimpressed with one passenger, the middle-aged Forrest Vandeteer (the \\"richest man in Yonkers\\"), Ned is quite taken with the lovely \\"Park Avenue flapper\\" Elsie Dodge. Her mother, the third passenger, sees her only daughter's marriage to Vandeteer as the solution to their dire financial straits. Vandeteer buys what he wants, and he wants Elsie. She, however, loathes her suitor; she much prefers young Ned. Scene from the movie Ned comes up with the idea to put his car on railroad tracks.

Larry Mullins and Adam Clayton are the rhythm section for which band?","completion":"Larry Mullins and Adam Clayton are the rhythm section for the world-renowned Irish rock band U2. U2, which was formed in 1976, is made up of Bono (vocals and rhythm guitar), the Edge (lead guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals), Adam Clayton (bass guitar), and Larry Mullen Jr. (drums and percussion). As part of the rhythm section, Clayton and Mullen play significant roles in establishing the tempo, rhythm, and beat of U2's music, contributing to their characteristic sound. Adam Clayton, U2's bassist, was one of the original founding members. His bass playing forms the backbone of U2's music, providing both rhythm and harmony. Despite having no formal musical training, Clayton's creativity and inventiveness on the bass have been critical in shaping U2's distinctive sound. He often uses a pick to play, which gives the band its rhythmic edge. From catchy, driving bass lines in songs like \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\" to brooding, aggressive ones in \\"Bullet the Blue Sky,\\" Clayton's contribution to U2's music is immense and influential. Larry Mullen Jr. is the drummer for U2, with his style considered as rock-solid, minimalistic yet with an effectual approach that avoids common rock drumming clichés. He was the one who posted a note on the school notice board seeking members for a band, which eventually led to the formation of U2. Mullen's drumming style, although it has evolved over the years, is noted for its military-like precision, helping to maintain a steady rhythm for the band's adventurous sonic explorations. His opening drumbeat on \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" is one of the most recognizable in rock history. Together, Clayton and Mullen provide the rhythmic and harmonic foundation upon which Bono and the Edge build their melodies and lyrical themes. Throughout their career, these four musicians have created a sound that, while it has evolved over the decades, remains unmistakably U2. Their work has been recognized with numerous awards, including 22 Grammy Awards and an induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Their ability to create emotionally resonate and socially conscious music has solidified their place as one of the most influential bands in rock history."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: You will be given a context and a question in Spanish.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the child of the person that began to use LSD and lose interest in his wife?, using the article: Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug.

Review: I have always been a fan of this band, but am not so rabid that I knew the politics behind their falling from the \\"American scene\\". Young and impetuous, they hit America with their British attitude and some of us didn't get it. Oops on both of us. This is as good as I remembered.

Question: SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation. Humanitarian assistance has been exempted from the economic sanctions, but Beasely said import restrictions has made it more complicated to bring in aid, and made...
