Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: We're so well educated - but we're useless students who have lost the ability to do anything practical. The only thing we've mastered is consumption . Large numbers of students have entered higher education in the past 10 years, but despite being the most educated generation in history, it seems that we've grown increasingly ignorant when it comes to basic life skills. Looking back on my first couple of weeks of living in student halls, I consider myself lucky to still be alive. Unfamiliar to fresher's, there are many hidden dangers in the dirty corners of students accommodation. I have survived a couple of serious boiling egg incidents and lots of cases of food - poisoning, probably from dirty kitchen counters. Although some of my clothes have fallen victim to ironing experimentation, I think I have now finally acquired all the domestic skills I missed out in my modem education. In 2006 and 2010, the charming educationist Sir Ken Robinson gave two very amusing talks in which he discussed the importance of creativity in education. Robinson's main viewpoint is that our current education system dislocates people from their natural talents. I would like to go a step further and propose that besides our talents, the system takes away what used to be passed from generation to generation - a working knowledge of basic life skills. Today's graduates may have earned themselves honor in history, law or economies, but when it comes to simple things like putting up a shelf to hold all their academic books, or fixing a hole in their on - trend clothes, they have to call for help from a professional handyman or tailor. Since the invention of the internet, it has never been easier for people to access information, but our highly specialized education has made us more one - sided than ever. I suggest that we start with the immediate reintroduction of some of the most vital aspects of \\"domestic science\\" education, before the current lack leads to serious accidents in student halls. Answer:","completion":"Question: What is an issue facing the current generation of students according to the article? A. They are less educated than previous generations B.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Determine the sentiment: I sat glued to the screen, riveted, yawning, yet keeping an attentive eye. I waited for the next awful special effect, or the next ridiculously clichéd plot item to show up full force, so I could learn how not to make a movie. It seems when they set out to make this movie, the crew watched every single other action/science-fiction/shoot-em-up/good vs. evil movie ever made, and saw cool things and said: \\"Hey, we can do that.\\" For example, the only car parked within a mile on what seems like a one way road with a shoulder not meant for parking, is the one car the protagonist, an attractive brunette born of bile, is thrown on to. The car blows to pieces before she even lands on it. The special effects were quite obviously my biggest beef with this movie. But what really put it in my bad books was the implausibility, and lack of reason for so many elements! For example, the antagonist, a flying demon with the ability to inflict harm in bizarre ways, happens upon a lone army truck transporting an important VIP. Nameless security guys with guns get out of the truck, you know they are already dead. Then the guy protecting the VIP says \\"Under no circumstances do you leave this truck, do you understand me?\\" He gets out to find the beast that killed his 3 buddies, he gets whacked in an almost comically cliché fashion. Then for no apparent reason, defying logic, convention, and common sense, the dumb ass VIP GETS OUT OF THE TRUCK!!! A lot of what happened along the course of the movie didn't make sense. Transparent acting distanced me from the movie, as well as bad camera-work, and things that just make you go: \\"Wow, that's incredibly cheesy.\\" Shiri Appleby saved the movie from a 1, because she gave the movie the one element that always makes viewers enjoy the experience, sex appeal.","completion":"Step 1: Read the text carefully and understand the context. I read the given text and understood that it is a review of a movie that the writer seems to have not enjoyed.

Most of the key points indicate negative sentiment towards the movie, with phrases like \\"awful special effect\\" and \\"implausibility\\". There is only one slightly positive point mentioned (\\"Shiri Appleby saved the movie from a 1\\"). Step 4: Determine the overall sentiment. After analyzing the key points in the text, I can conclude that the overall sentiment of the text is negative. The reviewer is criticizing the movie for various reasons, such as poor special effects, clichéd plot, implausibility, weak acting, and bad camera work.

French President Francois Hollande is considering legal action against the French version of Closer magazine after the publication alleged he was having an affair with actress Julie Gayet, French news agency Agence France-Presse reported Friday. A member of the President's entourage said in a statement to AFP that \\"Hollande deeply condemns the attacks on the right to privacy which he has a right to like every other citizen. He is looking into possible action, including legal action against this publication (Closer).\\" CNN has reached out to Hollande and Gayet for comment, but there has been no response. But the magazine's director, Stefan Haitaian, did tell CNN that the magazine is in the process of taking the story down from its website at the request of Gayet's lawyer. Hollande, 59, lives with 48-year-old French journalist and mother-of-three","completion":"Valerie Trierweiler, who serves as the unofficial First Lady of France since the couple is not married. The alleged affair between Hollande and Gayet, a 41-year-old accomplished actress who has appeared in over 70 films and TV series, has sparked a media frenzy and public debate in France, raising questions about the President's personal life and its possible impact on his political career. The French public has historically been accepting of their leaders' private lives, often shielding them from excessive scrutiny, as was the case with former President François Mitterrand, who maintained a secret family for years. Nevertheless, the growing intensity and scale of public discussion surrounding Hollande's alleged affair indicate a shift in the nation's traditionally hands-off approach to politicians' personal matters. Moreover, the timing of the allegations has further complicated Hollande's political situation. His approval ratings have been plummeting due to the nation's struggling economy and widespread unemployment. The unfolding scandal may further erode the trust of the French electorate as Hollande seeks to implement his economic reform agenda. Critics argue that the President's woes in his private life have become a distraction, making it more difficult for him to concentrate on the pressing issues that France faces. The French media landscape has been transformed within recent years by the rise of the internet and social media, allowing for a faster and more pervasive dissemination of rumors and gossip. It is speculated that the ensuing tabloid-sponsored scandals involving public officials have contributed to the steady erosion of the privacy that French politicians have historically enjoyed. Regarding this alleged affair, some condemnations come from the highest levels of French politics. Former Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault voiced his disapproval of Closer magazine, stating that \\"it is important to respect the private lives of individuals, especially when it comes to elected officials.\\" Additionally, French Justice Minister Christine Taubira supported Hollande's decision to consider legal action, emphasizing that the right to privacy is a fundamental principle of French law. While the potential legal action against Closer magazine looms, those who defend the magazine's coverage argue that, as a public figure and head of state, Hollande ought to be held to a higher standard of accountability and scrutiny. It is also worth noting that the French president is protected by stringent libel laws, which increase the risks for publishers who decide to expose scandalous or sensitive information about public figures. In summary, the allegations of an affair between French President François Hollande and actress Julie Gayet have ignited a media storm, prompting Hollande to consider legal action against the French version of Closer magazine. The scandal has stirred a debate about the balance between a public figure's right to privacy and the public's interest in knowing about their leaders' personal lives. As France's struggling economy and political landscape remain their primary focus, the French people and the international community will undoubtedly continue to follow the story and debate the merits of public scrutiny versus privacy for those in positions of power."},{"prompt":"Q: When does diseases like alzheimer's become more common?

This condition, known as tinnitus, haunted him incessantly. It had not only derailed his professional life, but it sometimes felt like an ever-present reminder of his vulnerability. To drown out the noise, he began to rely on music, playing tunes through earbuds he wore almost constantly. During this period of vulnerability, Robert found himself entangled with a criminal mastermind named Doc. Realizing the potential in Robert's top-notch driving skills, Doc forced him into a seemingly endless debt. Now known as Baby, Robert ferried various crews of robbers assembled by Doc on a series of heists, using his exceptional driving abilities to help them evade the law. This was Baby's only feasible means to pay off the outstanding debt. He longed for the day he would be free of Doc's clutches. With each crew and job he provided transport for, Baby maintained a cordial, easy-going attitude, which often disarmed even the most hardened criminals. However, his luck took a turn for the worse when he met Buddy, the hot-headed leader of Doc's latest crew. Unlike the others, Buddy took an immediate dislike to Baby's reserved nature, and the haunting tinnitus-inducing music he always played. He made it a point to make Baby's life miserable while they worked together, and the tension between them was palpable, like a ticking bomb waiting to explode. The crew's latest job required a purchase of illegal arms, and Baby was tasked with driving them to the meeting. As they embarked on their mission, Baby couldn't shake the feeling that something was off; it wasn't just Buddy's sour demeanor that plagued him, but also the risky transaction itself. He had a nagging suspicion that the crew was marching into a trap and the future of their operation dangled precariously. Outside of his tumultuous life of crime, Baby found solace in a local diner run by Debora, a young and vibrant woman with whom he had forged a deep connection. As he drove to complete the weapons deal, he couldn't help but think of Debora's warmth that had so often pulled him through his darkest moments. Their shared dream was to hit the open road together, leaving their old lives behind and starting anew. Every time they saw each other, those hopes felt closer to becoming a reality. But Baby couldn't just abandon his loyal roommate Joseph, a deaf-mute elderly man living in an assisted living home. The two of them shared a special bond, and Baby felt responsible for him, continuing to check in on him regularly. Now on yet another dangerous mission, Baby's thoughts drifted to both Joseph and Debora. He longed to break free from the dangerous life he was forced into and find a way to enjoy his freedom with his loved ones. As the crew returned from the weapons deal, shaken but intact, Baby made a decision. He drove to Debora's diner, where she eagerly awaited him, her eyes lighting up upon his arrival. He then proceeded to the assisted living facility where Joseph resided, filled with anxious anticipation. The debt to Doc was nearly paid off, and it wouldn't be long before Baby could unshackle himself from the world of crime and step into the sunlight with Debora and Joseph by his side. In that moment, the incessant ringing of tinnitus was momentarily drowned out by the hope of a better future, one Baby felt was so tantalizingly close that he could almost touch it. And as he parked the car in front of Joseph's assisted living home, with a determined gaze and a heart full of dreams, Baby knew that he would forge a path forward for them all - one filled with love, peace, and freedom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The agents begin to suspect its intended use by the assassins, when Kim, a scientist working at a lab connected to CTX, is assassinated by Bang-hee.Park and his agents ambush a military convoy with several liters of CTX, killing all the soldiers and making off with the dangerous liquid before the agents could arrive in time to warn them.

Input: Question: Who did Ohio State defeat in its consecutive tournament championships? Passage 1:Following his father's relatively early death Heinrich Sproemberg went to live with his grandfather. It was now that he decided to concentrate his further academic studies on history. He attended the \\"Empress Augusta [secondary] school\\" (\\"Kaiserin-Augusta-Gymnasium\\" - as the \\"Ludwig-Cauer-Grundschule\\" was then known), and passed his school final exams (\\"Abitur\\") in 1909 which opened the way to a university education. He moved on to the Frederick William University (as the Humboldt was then known) where he studied History, and Jurisprudence. His teachers included , Michael Tangl and Otto Hintze. For his subsidiary module on Applied Economics he was taught by Gustav Schmoller. He received his doctorate in 1914 for work on the eleventh century Bishopric of Liège. The work was supervised by . However, after war broke out at the end of July 1914 there was a major falling out with Schäfer. The German High Command implemented war plans that included a rapid invasion of Belgium which was accompanied by persistent reports of widescale atrocities by German troops against Belgian civilians. Sproemberg was at pains to distance himself from Schäfer's \\"annexationist\\" support for German policy in respect of Belgium.

For the season, Teske averaged 12.3 minutes per game to go with 3.4 points and 3.3 rebounds. Passage 3:Strutt was baptised at Springfield, Essex, on 26 February 1762, the second son of John Strutt, of Terling Place, Essex, by Anne, daughter of the Rev. William Goodday of Maldon. Entering the army in 1778, he joined his regiment, the 61st, at Minorca. Later he was appointed to a company in the 91st, and took part in the defence of St. Lucia. In 1782, having exchanged into the 97th, he served at the siege of Gibraltar. On the signing of the preliminaries of peace he purchased a majority in the 60th regiment, and, being placed on half-pay, visited several German courts. In 1787 he was sent with his regiment to the West Indies, where he took an active part in military affairs. Succeeding to a lieutenant-colonelcy by special command of George III, he was removed to the 54th, and went with the army of Lord Moira to Flanders. In 1794 he bore a very distinguished part against the French at Tiel, going through much hard fighting. On his return he was sent to St. Vincent, where he was raised to the rank of brigadier-general. In January 1796, with two hundred men, he attacked a force of twelve hundred, being himself thrice wounded, and losing his right leg. On his return to England he was received with marked favour by the king, and on 23 February 1796 was made deputy governor of Stirling Castle, afterwards serving upon the staff in Ireland. On 23 June 1798 he was raised to the rank of major-general, and on 13 May 1800 he was, as a reward for his services, appointed to the sinecure office of governor of Quebec, and he held that post until his death.

Cust was a distinguished politician active during the politically turbulent 1760s, and his monument at Belton blames his death at the age of 51 to the \\"unusual fatigues of his office\\". His heir was created Lord Brownlow in 1776, and Belton was owned by successive Lords Brownlow for the next 200 years.In the last three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money restoring Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.At the beginning of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and the largest and most drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established in the southern part of Belton park. The lie of the land there, where the River Witham passes between the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone and the Upper Lias mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the Great North Road and Grantham railway station on the East Coast Main Line. The depôt was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920. Little sign of the Machine Gun Corps's stay remains in the park, but plaques and inscriptions can be followed from the south gate of Belton park to the memorial gate on the way from there to the town centre and in the north aisle of Grantham parish...

Answer: The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) is a United States Act of Congress that is a reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act , which included Title I , the government's flagship aid program for disadvantaged students. Question: who passed no child left behind A:","completion":"Yes, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) is indeed a United States Act of Congress that reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). This reauthorization featured a particular emphasis on Title I, which is the core of the government's financial aid program aimed at improving educational opportunities for economically disadvantaged students. The Act was introduced and passed during the presidency of George W. Bush. The NCLB Act was passed with strong bipartisan support from both the House of Representatives and the Senate. In the House of Representatives, the bill was sponsored by the then Republican House Committee on Education and the Workforce Chairman John Boehner and Democratic Ranking Member George Miller. It was passed with a vote of 384-45 on May 23, 2001. Similarly, in the Senate, the bill was co-sponsored by then Republican Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Chairman Judd Gregg and Democratic Ranking Member Edward Kennedy. The bill was passed by a vote of 91-8 on June 14, 2001. The key aim of the No Child Left Behind Act was to improve the overall performance of schools across the United States, with a focus on closing the achievement gap between high- and low-performing students, particularly minority and economically disadvantaged students. In order to achieve this, the Act provided federal funding for programs aimed at supporting disadvantaged students and mandated states to assess students' progress annually based on certain, uniform standards. Additionally, states were required to implement strategies for accountability and improvement in underperforming schools. Despite its initial wide bipartisan support and noble goals, the No Child Left Behind Act has faced significant criticism over the years. One of the primary criticisms is that the Act tends to overemphasize standardized testing, leading to a \\"teach-to-the-test\\" approach in many schools. Critics argue that this focus on testing scores can limit the development of other crucial skills and subjects not assessed in standardized tests. Furthermore, there are concerns that the Act's provisions for improving underperforming schools are not effective enough and sometimes unfairly penalize schools in low-income areas. In light of these criticisms, the No Child Left Behind Act was eventually replaced by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) in December 2015, which was signed into law by President Barack Obama. The ESSA retained key aspects of the NCLB while granting more flexibility and control to states with regard to setting their academic standards and measuring school performance. Moreover, it aimed at addressing some of the concerns and limitations of the NCLB Act by reducing the federal government's role in education policy and emphasizing a more well-rounded approach to education."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the following sentence linguistically acceptable? Ron yawned himself awake.","completion":"The sentence \\"Ron yawned himself awake\\" is linguistically acceptable, though it might be seen as somewhat informal, non-standard, or poetic in usage. To analyze its linguistic acceptability, let us break down the different components and their functions in the sentence. 1. Subject: The subject of the sentence is \\"Ron,\\" which is a proper noun representing a person. It clearly denotes the acting entity in the sentence and is an acceptable subject. 2. Verb: The verb in the sentence is \\"yawned,\\" which is an intransitive verb that doesn't require a direct object to make sense. It is an action that an individual can perform, and it doesn't necessarily need an object to receive the action. 3. Reflexive pronoun: The pronoun \\"himself\\" is a reflexive pronoun referring back to the subject, \\"Ron.\\" Reflexive pronouns are often used when the subject and object of a verb are the same person or thing. In this case, \\"himself\\" signifies that Ron's action (yawning) affected him directly. 4. Predicate: The word \\"awake\\" functions as an adjective in this sentence, and its placement after the verb creates a predicate adjective construction. Predicate adjectives describe the subject and usually follow a linking verb (such as \\"be\\" or \\"seem\\"). However, the use of the predicate adjective \\"awake\\" following the action verb \\"yawned\\" creates an unusual construction. This suggests that the act of yawning causes Ron to become or feel awake. While the sentence may not follow the typical subject-verb-object pattern, it is still understood that Ron is the one performing the action (yawning) and that this action has a direct effect on his state (awakening). The structure deviates from standard grammar, but it communicates the intended meaning and adds a poetic or playful tone to the language. In conclusion, although the sentence \\"Ron yawned himself awake\\" does not adhere to standard syntactic structures and might be seen as informal or unconventional, it can be considered linguistically acceptable. The sentence effectively conveys the idea that Ron's action of yawning caused him to become awake, and readers or listeners would likely grasp its intended meaning without confusion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I don't know, but I should have my head examined. And director and writer Simon Gornick should be ashamed of himself to give men an injustice as he does. He takes away any strength and conviction a man could have by having several boring women do him in. Number one bore is Joyce Hyser as the wife. I couldn't wait for him to drop her. Her revenge was silly and stupid and very confusing through most of the movie. The other femme fatale was Nichole Hiltz, about the coldest person you'd ever want to meet. Her looks didn't warrant our leading man to go that ape over her and her acting was so obvious, only a fool could miss. Definitely a loser. Tembi Locke was pretty good, but slow on the uptake as to the slut seducing her own husband, again played as a guy who is a loser, by David DeLuise.

Pisek's play at Primorje was his most professional, recognizable work.","completion":"Janez Pišek was a man from Slovenia who loved playing and coaching football. Imagine football is like playing with a ball and trying to score goals in a big net. Janez played for a team called Primorje for a long time, and he was very good at it. Later, he helped other teams get better by being their manager, or the person who makes decisions for the team. He was a special person in Slovenian football because he was the first professional coach from Slovenia, and he also helped start a group for football coaches in 1953. When he passed away, people remembered how much he did for football in Slovenia and gave him an award called the Blodek plaque.

Q:If high-mass stars collapsing forms a sphere, then what does a high-mass star collapsing form? Answer choices: - forces - a sphere - a cube - a circle - dangerous - an object - comets - nucleus A:","completion":"A high-mass star collapsing forms a sphere. High-mass stars, those stars with a mass greater than eight solar masses, undergo a series of nuclear reactions during their lifetimes, eventually depleting their nuclear fuel. When the nuclear fuel in the core is exhausted, the star can no longer produce the energy necessary to maintain its structural integrity. This leads to the core's gravitational collapse due to the intense pressure exerted by the star's own mass and gravity. As the core collapses, it releases a vast amount of energy in the form of thermal and kinetic energy, creating a shockwave that blows the outer layers of the star away in a supernova explosion. The remaining core, now denser and only tens of kilometers in diameter, continues to collapse under its own gravity. One possible outcome of this collapse is the formation of a neutron star due to the pressure becoming so high that the protons and electrons combine to form neutrons. If the mass of the core is high enough, it does not stop at the neutron star stage but continues to collapse under its immense gravity, forming a black hole. In both cases (neutron star and black hole), the collapsing high-mass star forms a sphere. This spherical shape occurs due to the properties of gravity, which pulls matter uniformly inward towards the center of mass. Since the gravitational force is equal in all directions, the result is a three-dimensional, centrally symmetric structure, which is a sphere. In summary, a high-mass star collapsing forms a sphere, either as a neutron star or a black hole, depending on the mass of the star's core. This spherical shape arises as a natural consequence of the isotropic nature of the gravitational force, which pulls matter uniformly towards the center of mass."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

First, find a special box called a mousetrap. It's like a tiny house for the mouse where they get caught, so they can't run around your kitchen anymore. 2. Mice really like to eat cheese and peanut butter, so take a tiny piece of one of these treats and put it inside the mousetrap. This will help to persuade the mouse to come into the trap. 3. Place the mousetrap near where you saw the mouse in the kitchen, and wait quietly for the mouse to show up. Mice like to come out when it's dark and quiet, so you might need to wait for a while. 4. When the mouse goes into the mousetrap to have a snack, the trap will close and catch the mouse. Make sure to ask a grown-up to check the trap, as mice can bite and carry germs. 5. Once the grown-up has the mouse safely in the trap, they will take it far away from your home and let it go. This way, the mouse will find a new place to live, and it won't cause any more trouble in your kitchen.

Now that my energy levels are returning I though that it is about time I told you about these amazing products! Okoii products are handmade by Yoko, formally from Japan, now living in Australia. Her aim was to introduce Australian women to traditional natural ingredients from Japan and Asia that they may not previously have been aware of. Some of these ingredients have been used in Japan for upwards of 1000 years, and recently the benefits of such ingredients have been scientifically proven. When you place an order with Okoii, your products are then made by hand, one by one, so you know that they are as fresh as they can possibly be. Other than Lush' Fresh Face Masks, I can't think of any other product that would be as fresh as Okoii. I find it quite exciting to know that when I purchase a product from Okoii, that it hasn't been sitting on the shelf of a warehouse for months, slowly deteriorating. It is recommended that the products be kept in the fridge to maintain their freshness and the all come with a recommended used by date that is between 3-6 months from when it was made. The first product that I am going to introduce you to is the Luxury Rice Bran Face Soap. I decided to review this one on its own for two reasons.

From the days of 78 rpm discs, when relatively little modern music was being put on record, Walton was favoured by the record companies. In 1929 the small, new Decca company recorded eleven movements from Façade, with the composer conducting a chamber ensemble, with the speakers Edith Sitwell and Walton's friend and colleague Constant Lambert. In the 1930s, Walton also had two of his major orchestral works on disc, both on Decca, the First Symphony recorded by Harty and the London Symphony Orchestra, and the Viola Concerto with Frederick Riddle and the LSO conducted by the composer. In the 1940s Walton moved from Decca to its older, larger rival, EMI. The EMI producer Walter Legge arranged a series of recordings of Walton's major works and many minor ones over the next twenty years; a rival composer expressed the view that if Walton had an attack of flatulence (he used an earthier expression), Walter Legge would record it.Walton himself, although a reluctant conductor, conducted many of the EMI recordings, and some for other labels. He made studio recordings of the First Symphony, the Viola Concerto, the Violin Concerto, the Sinfonia Concertante, the Façade Suites, the Partita, Belshazzar's Feast, and suites from his film scores for Shakespeare plays and The First of the Few. Some live performances conducted by Walton were recorded and have been released on compact disc, including the Cello Concerto and the Coronation Te Deum.Almost all Walton's works have been recorded for commercial release. EMI published a \\"Walton Edition\\" of his major works on CD in the 1990s, and the recording of the Chandos Records \\"Walton Edition\\" of his works was completed in 2010. His best-known works have been recorded by performers from many countries. Among the frequently recorded are Belshazzar's Feast, the Viola and Violin Concertos and the First Symphony, which has had more than twenty recordings since Harty's 1936 set.

Plant growth is reduced (viii). enormous damage to homes The answer is:","completion":"(v). it is unpredictable Given the two facts provided, the effect of a population suddenly getting much smaller is considered to be unpredictable. This is because the bottleneck effect can lead to a wide variety of outcomes, depending on various factors within a population and its environment. Some of the possible outcomes are: 1. Loss of genetic diversity: When a population is reduced significantly, the chances of losing genetic diversity are high. Genetic diversity is essential for a population's adaptability and long-term survival. Loss of genetic diversity can result in inbreeding, increased prevalence of genetic diseases, and decreased reproductive success. 2. Founder effect: A small group of individuals who survive the bottleneck event may become the founders of a new population, passing on their specific genetic traits to their descendants. This can lead to the new population having different characteristics than the original population. 3. Drift: Genetic drift is the random fluctuation of gene frequency due to chance events in small populations. With a reduced population size, the role of genetic drift is amplified. This may lead to certain genes or traits becoming more or less prevalent within the population, which can further impact genetic diversity and overall population health. 4. Vulnerability to external factors: A population that has undergone a bottleneck event is more vulnerable to environmental changes, diseases, and predation than a larger, more stable population. This can lead to further population decline and potential extinction. 5. Potential for rapid evolution: In some cases, a population that has experienced a bottleneck event may evolve more rapidly in response to new selective pressures, as there may be a higher rate of beneficial mutations that can help the population adapt to its changed environment. In summary, while there are various possible outcomes to a population suddenly getting much smaller due to the bottleneck effect, the overall effect is still unpredictable.

However, you might also be referring to the ancient city of Knossos on the island of Crete. The city is known as Europe's oldest city and was the centre of the Minoan civilization, which predates the classic Greek civilization. Discovered in Crete, the Minoans were the first major civilization in Greece, and their culture had a significant impact on the subsequent Mycenaean culture on mainland Greece. While the term \\"ancient\\" generally refers to the time period begun with the earliest recorded Greek writings in about 8th century BCE, it should be noted that the civilization that existed on Crete, as identified by British archaeologist Arthur Evans, dates back to around 2700 to 1420 BCE. Here, in Knossos, the first palace was built around 1900 to 1700 BCE, much earlier than Athens began to rise as a city. The ancient city of Mycenae on the Peloponnese peninsula is another major site in ancient Greek history. An Indo-European group who came to Greece around 2000 BCE established this city. The Mycenean civilization spanned from 1600 to 1100 BCE and produced notable archaeological works, including the Lion's Gate and the Treasury of Atreus. Overall, the first Greek city found in ancient times depends on one's interpretation. If you consider Minoan Crete as part of Greek history, then the oldest city would be Knossos. This civilization greatly influenced later Greek cultures, but it remained distinct. If you are referring to the first city-state in what is traditionally considered classical ancient Greece, the answer would generally be Athens after the political system began the shift towards what we understood as a city around the 6th century BCE."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the debut album of the band that took its name from a fictional Phoenician city? ? Opeth was formed as a death metal band in 1989 in Stockholm, Sweden, by lead vocalist David Isberg. Isberg asked former Eruption band member Mikael Åkerfeldt, who was just 16 years old at the time, to join Opeth as a bassist. When Åkerfeldt showed up to practice on the day after Isberg invited him, it became clear that Isberg had not told the band members, including the band's current bassist, that Åkerfeldt would be joining the band. An ensuing argument led to all members but Isberg and Åkerfeldt leaving to form a new project. The band name was derived from the word \\"Opet\\", taken from the Wilbur Smith novel The Sunbird. In this novel, Opet is the name of a fictional Phoenician city in South Africa translated as \\"City of the Moon\\". Isberg and Åkerfeldt recruited drummer Anders Nordin, bassist Nick Döring, and guitarist Andreas Dimeo. Unsatisfied with Opeth's slow progress, Döring and Dimeo left the band after their first performance, and were replaced by guitarist Kim Pettersson and bassist Johan De Farfalla. After the next show, De Farfalla left Opeth to spend time with his girlfriend in Germany, and was initially replaced by Mattias Ander, before Åkerfeldt's friend Peter Lindgren took on the role of bassist. Rhythm guitarist Kim Pettersson left following the band's next performance, and Lindgren switched to guitar, with the role of bassist falling to Stefan Guteklint. The following year, David Isberg left the band citing \\"creative differences\\".Following Isberg's departure, Åkerfeldt took over vocal duties and he, Lindgren, and Nordin spent the next year writing and rehearsing new material. The group began to rely less on the blast beats and aggression typical of death metal, and incorporated acoustic guitars and guitar harmonies into their music; developing the core sound of Opeth. Bassist Guteklint was dismissed by the band after they signed their first record deal with Candlelight Records in 1994. Opeth initially employed former member De Farfalla as a session bassist for their demo recordings, and he...

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.

Such features are generally composed of highly fluid basalt lava, and can extend for tens or even hundreds of miles across the underlying terrain. The extent of large lava fields is most readily grasped from the air or in satellite photos, where their typically dark, nearly black color contrasts sharply with the rest of the landscape. According to the US Geological Survey, monogenetic volcanic fields are collections of cinder cones, and/or Maar vents and associated lava flows and pyroclastic deposits. Sometimes a stratovolcano is at the center of the field, as at the San Francisco Volcanic Field in Arizona. Monogenetic volcano fields have systematic growth patterns that suggest they represent single magmatic systems in the same way that stratovolcanoes do, but monogenetic volcanoes grow laterally rather than vertically (Wood and Shoan, 1984). Detailed mapping indicates that some cinder cones in monogenetic fields (e.g., Cima, California, and Timber Mountain Volcanic Field, Nevada) may have had multiple eruptions separated by tens to hundreds of thousands of years (Wells, et al., 1989). Thus, some monogenetic cones may actually be polygenetic. This possibility differs from observations of historic eruptions (Wood, 1979), and is physically difficult to understand because cinder cone conduits are narrow and must solidify within a few years of eruption. Nonetheless, such multiple eruptions appear to have happened at least twice: Other cinder cones need to be closely reexamined. - Dancer in the Dark ( Danish : Danser i mørket ) is a 2000 Danish musical drama film directed by Lars von Trier and starring Icelandic singer Björk , Catherine Deneuve , David Morse , Cara Seymour , Peter Stormare , Siobhan Fallon Hogan , and Joel Grey .

Please write a short summary for the following article: 5 Design Missteps A recent Facebook update lets page administrators schedule posts in advance, similar to the scheduling functions of HootSuite and other third-party apps. However, users quickly noticed flaws in the user interface — that is, if they could even find the feature at all. Check out the gallery below, where we pinpoint and troubleshoot these faults. What do you think about the feature’s flaws? Will you still use it, or will you stick with third-party apps? Let us know your thoughts in the comments. 1. A Good Scheduling Feature Is Hard to Find If you're waiting for the scheduling feature to roll out to your page, look a little bit closer -- you already have it. Go to your page and begin to write a post. In the bottom-left corner, you should see a small clock (yeah, it's tough to notice). Click on it and set the time to the future, and the button that says \\"Post\\" will change to \\"Schedule.\\" 2. Find the Future in the Past Albert Einstein said that the distinction between the past and future is \\"only a stubbornly persistent illusion.\\" Who knew he was predicting Facebook's scheduling feature? In order to schedule a post, you have to date it the same way you would date a milestone, only in the future. These two features aren't separate, which is another reason why you might not realize you can schedule posts on your page in the first place. 3. Ten Is the Loneliest Number Rather than offering a simple calendar and timing function, Facebook only allows you to schedule posts in 10-minute increments. More than that, you must schedule an update at least 10 minutes in advance. Once you schedule a post, you can't modify or edit the content, only the time. Many users have complained that you can't see what you've scheduled or cancel any posts, but you can do these things in the Activity Log (see next slide). 5. Activity Log: \\"IZ IN UR TOOLBAR, HIDING MOAR FEECHURS\\" When you schedule a post, a window pops up that allows you to view your Activity Log, which is essentially a list of all activity on your page. Scheduled posts show up at the top of the log. However, if you want to look at scheduled posts later, it's difficult to find the Activity Log. At the top of your page, click the \\"Manage\\" drop-down menu and choose \\"Activity Log.\\" A small arrow will appear and disappear when you hover over each post, which you need to click if you want to cancel the post or modify its time.","completion":"A recent Facebook update lets people who run pages schedule their posts in advance, just like some other apps can do. But, there are some mistakes in the way it works. Some problems include: it's hard to find the scheduling feature, it's a bit confusing to set up a post for the future, you can only choose times in 10-minute chunks, and it's tricky to change or cancel a scheduled post. Despite these issues, the scheduling feature can still be helpful to people who want to plan their page posts."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Jan van Eyck (Dutch: ['jan van 'eik]) (before c. 1390 - 9 July 1441) was an Early Netherlandish painter active in Bruges. He is often considered one of the founders of Early Netherlandish painting, and, one of the most significant representatives of Northern Renaissance art. Van Eyck served as official to John of Bavaria-Straubing, ruler of Holland, Hainault and Zeeland. By this time he had assembled a small workshop and was involved in redecorating the Binnenhof palace in The Hague. After John's death in 1425 he moved to Bruges and came to the attention of Philip the Good c. 1425. His emergence as a collectable painter generally follows his appointment to Philip's court, and from this point his activity in the court is comparatively well documented. He served as court artist and diplomat, and was a senior member of the Tournai painters' guild. On 18 October 1427, the Feast of St. Luke, he travelled to Tournai to attend a banquet in his honour, also attended by Robert Campin and Rogier van der Weyden. A court salary freed him from commissioned work, and allowed a large degree of artistic freedom. Over the following decade van Eyck's reputation and technical ability grew, mostly from his innovative approaches towards the handling and manipulating of oil paint. Unlike most of his peers his reputation never diminished and he remained well regarded over the following centuries. His revolutionary approach to oil was such that a myth, perpetuated by Giorgio Vasari, arose that he had invented oil painting. His brother Hubert van Eyck collaborated on Jan's most famous works, the Ghent Altarpiece, generally art historians believe it was begun c. 1420 by Hubert and completed by Jan in 1432. Another brother, Lambert, is mentioned in Burgundian court documents, and may have overseen his brother's workshop after Jan's death.

Q: In his lifetime, Ray had done a number of things for which he was not proud, things he'd like to see just as well stuffed down a dark hole. Everybody had things of which they were ashamed. Everybody has committed their share of sins that they wish they could take back. But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand. It was a good thing, a right thing, like the time he had given emergency CPR to the woman already ten minutes dead and gone, the woman whose mouth tasted of chocolate death and scrambled eggs, just to spare her horrified children the sense of helplessness while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. That had been a noble thing like this one was. Should have been. Perhaps it was always less difficult to have things fail here, with the living, than it was with the dead. The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right? The living simply did not understand that there were rules. They didn't want to understand something so banal. Someone who didn't take the time to understand the rules had no right to pass judgment on him. Not that it ever stopped them. \\"I hear that you are unhappy,\\" he said into the phone, then had to pull the receiver away from his ear so the woman on the other end could scream at him some more. Conflict de-escalation technique number one was invariably affirmation. Make it clear that you are aware of the individual's feelings and frustrations, that you are at least listening to their side, whether or not you personally may eventually have the authority to validate or alleviate those feelings.

I either really love them or I loathe them. Some of the fancier productions (such as Desperation and Storm of the Century) I didn't enjoy. Some of the smaller ones, I really loved. Sleepwalkers is one that I really do enjoy and watch it regularly. The story revolves around Charles Brady and his mother Mary. They are Sleepwalkers, shape shifting creatures who although human like in appearance shift into a feline like creature. They are immune to the scratch of cats and whenever they move to a new town, lay out traps to catch and kill the animals. When they move to their latest town, they need to seek out a virgin and when Charles finds one, he actually falls for her,but his mother needs to feed from her to keep up her strength. The story revolves around what will happen with the girl. Will Charles spare her or use her to save his mother. Although this story has overtones of incest which some may find unappealing it does actually play a part in the story and is therefore not just plonked in the movie for scandal's sake. Like most Stephen King stories it's based in a small town with lots of interesting characters. The acting isn't the best, nor are the special effects, however, somehow, the whole thing tends to 'gel' and is very watchable and enjoyable adaption.

Write an article based on this summary: A Brazilian baby who was shot in the womb by a stray bullet has been deemed a miracle for surviving and his family hope he will overcome injuries to walk one day.","completion":"Title: Miracle Baby in Brazil: A Stray Bullet Survivor with Hopes of Walking One Day Introduction In a world filled with news of violence and misfortune, it is important to acknowledge stories that defy the odds and restore hope in humanity. A remarkable tale of resilience has emerged from Brazil, where a baby who was shot in the womb by a stray bullet is being hailed as a miracle. The infant's miraculous survival has left the family, doctors, and the public astounded, turning this heart-wrenching incident into an uplifting demonstration of hope and perseverance. The Incident A pregnant woman in Brazil faced an unimaginable situation when a bullet strayed into her womb. The tragic incident occurred amidst a casual outing in the bustling streets of the town, where the unexpected bullet found its way into the mother's body — and yet even with such a harrowing experience, both the baby and mother managed to survive. The doctors in the local hospital were shocked by the incident and worked tirelessly to provide the necessary care for the baby and the mother. The Miracle Baby The baby boy, who survived the life-threatening injury, demonstrates the sheer power of resilience and is now being affectionately called \\"the Miracle Baby\\" by his family, doctors, and well-wishers. His recovery has been nothing short of miraculous, considering the severe nature of his injuries. The baby has already undergone a series of surgeries, including an operation to remove the bullet that pierced his spine. Despite the devastating tragedy, the baby's heart never stopped beating, and his vital organs continued to function throughout the ordeal. Challenges and Hopes of Recovery While the Miracle Baby has pulled through the immediate aftermath of the stray bullet, there are still several challenges ahead. The bullet's impact on the baby's spine has left him with injuries that could potentially affect his ability to walk. However, his family and medical team remain optimistic that he will overcome these hurdles and walk one day. To help increase the chances of a full recovery, the baby will be receiving top-notch medical care and support from a dedicated team of doctors, therapists, and specialists. His rehabilitation process may include physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other interventions to help regain mobility and improve muscle strength. The family has also received an outpour of support from the local community, proving that miracles, alongside love and compassion, can make the world a better place. Raising Awareness about Gun Violence While the Miracle Baby's story is undoubtedly inspiring, it also sheds light on the need for effective gun control and better control of illegal firearms. This devastating incident is an unfortunate reminder of the countless innocent lives that are affected by gun violence globally. It underscores the necessity to advocate for stricter gun laws and create a safer environment for families and children. Conclusion The story of the Miracle Baby in Brazil is a tale of resilience, hope, and determination that has deeply moved many around the world. As his family and the medical team work to help the baby heal and overcome the challenges in his path, his journey serves as both a powerful reminder of the need to address the issues surrounding gun violence and as a testament to the strength of the human spirit. With hard work, love, and widespread support, there remains a strong hope that this Miracle Baby will walk one day, embodying the sheer force of willpower and perseverance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Can you tell me what it is? A:","completion":"A: The answer to the question \\"__ is the international act in which a state indicates its consent to be bound to a treaty\\" is \\"ratification\\". Ratification is the international act in which a state signifies its consent to be legally bound by the provisions of a treaty. After a treaty has been adopted and opened for signature, it usually requires each participating state to complete its own domestic legal procedures for ratifying the treaty. These procedures may include obtaining approvals from relevant government bodies, such as the legislature or the executive branch, as well as ensuring that the content of the treaty is in compliance with the country's existing laws and regulations. Once a state has completed its domestic ratification processes, it will then deposit a document called an \\"instrument of ratification\\" with the designated depositary - usually the United Nations for multilateral treaties. This deposit signifies the state's commitment to be legally bound by the terms of the treaty. The treaty will enter into force only after the required number of ratifications is received, as specified in the treaty itself. Ratification is an essential step in the implementation and enforcement of international treaties, as it demonstrates a state's commitment to uphold and adhere to the agreed-upon provisions contained within the treaty. This process ensures that all parties involved are held accountable in the observance of the treaty's provisions and promotes the rule of law within the international community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: I purchased this book before my honeymoon in hopes of ithelping my wife and I get the maximun enjoyment out of sex in ourmarrige. The first few chapters are rather dry and cold speaking mostly of anatomy and the like. After that there are some excellent tips to making sex very enjoyable and not discouraging, especially if its your first time.

In the first sentence, \\"The mixer returned to the plant for another fill,\\" the word \\"fill\\" is used as a noun and refers to the act or an instance of filling a container or object, typically with a substance like a liquid, gas, or loose material. In this context, the mixer returns to the plant to be filled again with the material it needs to carry out its function, such as concrete or gravel. The word \\"fill\\" here conveys the idea of replenishing the contents of the mixer. 2. In the second sentence, \\"He ate his fill of potatoes,\\" the word \\"fill\\" also functions as a noun, but its meaning differs in this context.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which city disrupted fewer ocean food webs? Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided information, Hop city, which solely used alternative sources of energy, disrupted fewer ocean food webs compared to Bend city that heavily relied on fossil fuels to generate electricity. The extensive use of fossil fuels contributes significantly to air pollution, and subsequently to the destruction of the ozone layer. Pollutants such as chlorine and bromine gases are released from combustion processes, aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. This leads to ozone depletion, promoting an increase in UV radiation reaching Earth, which in turn affects humans, disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. Alternative sources of energy, such as solar, wind, and hydro power, have a smaller environmental footprint and release fewer pollutants. By using these alternative sources, Hop city reduces its contribution to emissions responsible for ozone depletion and the consequential effects on ocean food webs.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options： A. ditch B. shop C. north america D. pet shops E. outdoors A:","completion":"D. Pet shops The increasing demand for exotic snakes has led pet shops to carry them in response to the growing interest from consumers. This trend has been observed worldwide and particularly in countries where keeping exotic pets is popular or becoming more accepted. As a result, pet shops, which typically cater to the preferences of their customers, have begun to carry a wider variety of exotic snake species to cater to this demand. There are several reasons why people might be drawn to exotic snakes as pets. Firstly, some individuals are fascinated by the unique appearance and behavior of these creatures. Exotic snake species often display striking colors, patterns, and striking features, which make them visually appealing and intriguing to potential owners. Additionally, many exotic snake species have unique and captivating behaviors, making them interesting and sometimes challenging pets to care for. Secondly, owning an exotic snake can be perceived as a status symbol in certain social circles. Possessing a rare or expensive exotic snake can act as a conversation starter, garner attention, and reflect the owner's knowledge and commitment to caring for an unusual and often misunderstood pet. However, there are various concerns associated with the increasing demand for exotic snakes in pet shops. One significant issue is the potential negative impact on the ecosystems and natural habitats from which these snakes are sourced. The removal of snakes from their native environments can disrupt local ecosystems, harm other wildlife, and potentially contribute to the decline of already vulnerable snake species. Another concern is the ethical treatment of these animals and the potential mistreatment during the process of being captured, transported, and housed in pet shops. That is without mentioning the potential for improper care by inexperienced snake owners who might not provide appropriate housing, nutrition, or medical care. Moreover, there is also the risk of snake escapes and the subsequent impact non-native species could have on local wildlife if they establish as an invasive species. In conclusion, the growing demand for exotic snakes has driven pet shops to carry them to cater to customer preferences. This trend has numerous consequences, both positive and negative, which need to be carefully considered by potential snake owners, pet stores, and policymakers to ensure the wellbeing of these animals and the ecosystems they inhabit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: What were the full names of the two people who were suspected of having a love affair during months of rehearsal? Answer the above question based on the context below: The search for a singer-actress to play Carmen began in the summer of 1873. Press speculation favoured Zulma Bouffar, who was perhaps the librettists' preferred choice. She had sung leading roles in many of Offenbach's operas, but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable. In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to Célestine Galli-Marié, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Marié, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.The leading tenor part of Don José was given to Paul Lhérie, a rising star of the Opéra-Comique who had recently appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of Les pêcheurs de perles. Jacques Bouhy, engaged to sing Escamillo, was a young Belgian-born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as Méphistophélès in Gounod's Faust and as Mozart's Figaro. Marguerite Chapuy, who sang Micaëla, was at the beginning of a short career in which she was briefly a star at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; the impresario James H. Mapleson thought her \\"one of the most charming vocalists it has been my pleasure to know\\". However, she married and left the stage altogether in 1876, refusing Mapleson's considerable cash inducements to return.

In the first quarter, Arizona trailed early as 49ers RB Frank Gore got a 6-yard TD run for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Cardinals took the lead with kicker Neil Rackers getting a 35-yard field goal, while RB Edgerrin James got a 7-yard TD run. San Francisco would tie the game with kicker Joe Nedney getting a 33-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the 49ers regained the lead with Nedney kicking a 30-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, the Cardinals retook the lead with QB Matt Leinart completing a 5-yard TD pass to WR Anquan Boldin. However, late in the game, the Cards' defense failed to hold off San Francisco's ensuing drive, which ended with WR Arnaz Battle getting a 1-yard TD run. With just over&#160;:20 seconds left in the game, Arizona had one final chance to save the game. Leinart's pass to WR Larry Fitzgerald was intercepted by 49ers CB Shawntae Spencer.

This House believes that cannabis should be legalised What is a possible side to this debate?","completion":"A possible side to this debate would be in favor of legalizing cannabis. I will now present a few arguments to support this side: 1. Medical benefits: Research has shown that medical marijuana can alleviate symptoms of various conditions, such as chronic pain, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. Legalizing cannabis would allow patients suffering from these conditions to gain access to a potentially effective treatment option. 2. Economic benefits: Legalizing and regulating the cannabis industry would generate tax revenue for governments through sales taxes and business licenses. Additionally, it could create new jobs and foster business growth in the agricultural and pharmaceutical sectors. 3. Reduced burden on the criminal justice system: Decriminalizing cannabis use would reduce the number of arrests and incarcerations related to its possession and distribution, freeing up law enforcement resources to focus on more serious crimes. 4. Quality control and safety: By regulating the cannabis market, the government could impose quality control standards that protect consumers from dangerous contaminants and ensure that they receive accurate information about the potency and strains they are purchasing. Legalizing cannabis would also eliminate the need for users to engage with dangerous black market entities, reducing the risk of associated criminal activity and violence. 5. Personal freedom: Legalizing cannabis use would respect adult citizens' right to make their own decisions about what they consume, as long as it does not harm others. This promotes personal autonomy and aligns with values of individual freedom and choice. Overall, the side in favor of legalizing cannabis argues that it would provide medical, economic, and societal benefits, as well as protect personal freedoms, and enhance public safety by mitigating the negative consequences associated with the black market."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

I loved it, wore it for years, and haven't had another one since it stopped ticking a decade ago. Why? Because I don't need one. I have a mobile phone and I'm always near someone with an iPod or something like that. All these devices tell the time--which is why, if you look around, you'll see lots of empty wrists; sales of watches to young adults have been going down since 2007. But while the wise have realized that they don't need them, others--apparently including some distinguished men of our time--are spending total fortunes on them. Brands such as Rolex, Patek Philippe and Breitling command shocking prices, up to PS250.000 for a piece. This is ridiculous. Expensive cars go faster than cheap cars. Expensive clothes hang better than cheap clothes. But these days all watches tell the time as well as all other watches. Expensive watches come with extra functions--but who needs them? How often do you dive to 300 metres into the sea or need to find your direction in the area around the South Pole? So why pay that much of five years' school fees for watches that allow you to do these things? If justice were done, the Swiss watch industry should have closed down when the Japanese discovered how to make accurate watches for a five-pound note. Instead the Swiss reinvented the watch, with the aid of millions of pounds' worth of advertising, as a message about the man wearing it. Rolexes are for those who spend their weekends climbing icy mountains; a Patek Philippe is for one from a rich or noble family; a Breitling suggests you like to pilot planes across the world. Watches are now classified as\\"investments\\" . A 1994 Philippe recently sold for nearly PS350, 000, while the 1960s Rolexes have gone from PS15, 000 to PS30, 000 plus in a year.

Brown's comments Sunday came after Britain's International Trade Secretary Liam Fox visited the U.S. this week for trade talks. Brown said the U.S. has voiced support for relaxing the definition of whisky, which he said would open the market to products that don't meet the current standard. ||||| Image copyright SWA The Scottish government has called for Scotch to be defined in UK law in order to protect whisky exports after Brexit. Scotland's Economy Secretary Keith Brown has written to UK ministers calling for protection of the Scotch whisky industry. The industry is worth about £4bn to Scotland in exports. An EU definition of whisky currently protects sales from sub-standard products. The UK government said it would support the industry so it continued to thrive. Mr Brown's call follows International Trade Secretary Liam Fox's visit to the US last week. The economy secretary said: \\"Aside from being a key part of Scottish culture and identity, our whisky industry supports around 20,000 jobs. \\"The US made clear in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership discussions that they would support a relaxation of the definition of whisky, which would open the market up to a number of products which do not currently meet that standard.\\" 'Right outcomes' He added: \\"It is vital that we continue to have robust legal protection of Scotch whisky, which is why I have sought clarification from the UK government as to whether Scotch whisky featured in discussions during last week's trade visit by the Secretary of State for International Trade. \\"I am also demanding that the current EU regulations are guaranteed post-Brexit. \\"After reports this week that the UK government is contemplating trade deals that threaten the value and reputation of Scottish produce, once again we can see the confusion which is at the heart of the UK government's Brexit position. \\"We need to be sure that any future deals work for Scotland and are not threatening the livelihoods of our farmers and producers.\\" He said all four UK governments should have oversight of the negotiations to ensure, as far as possible, \\"that the right outcomes for everyone are secured\\". A UK government spokeswoman said: \\"Scotch is a UK export success story and we will support the industry so that it continues to thrive and prosper post-Brexit. \\"The UK government has a strong relationship with the Scotch Whisky Association and is working closely with the industry as we aim to secure the best possible deal for the whole of the UK.\\" ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"The Scottish government has called for Scotch whisky to be defined in UK law, in an attempt to protect the vital £4bn (5.3bn) industry following Brexit.

After the Lithuanians were defeated in the Battle of Strėva by the Teutonic Knights in 1348, Liubartas lost all territories except for eastern Volhynia with Lutsk to Casimir and his ally Louis I of Hungary . Liubartas' brothers Algirdas and Kęstutis organized several expeditions to Poland and Red Ruthenia. Lithuanians allied themselves with Muscovy: Liubartas married an unnamed daughter of Konstantin of Rostov, a relative of Simeon of Moscow, and Algirdas married Uliana of Tver, sister-in-law of Simeon. In spring 1351, Lubartas was taken prisoner by Louis, but was released in summer after a truce was agreed upon with Kęstutis. The deal fell through and more military attacks followed in 1352. Another truce, rather favorable to the Lithuanians, was signed in fall 1352: Lubartas received not only Volhynia and Podolia, but also Belz and Chełm. However, already in 1353, Liubartas attacked again. Casimir responded by organizing a large campaign against the pagan Lithuanians with a special permission from Pope Innocent VI. After the campaign did not achieve the desired results, Casimir contemplated an alliance with the Lithuanians. In 1366, Casimir, allied with Siemowit III of Masovia and nephews of Liubartas, resumed the war. As Algirdas was involved in conflicts in the east and Kęstutis fought with the Teutonic Knights, Liubartas had to defend alone and was defeated. In fall 1366, a treaty was signed: Liubartas retained only eastern Volhynia with Lutsk and became somewhat dependent on Poland .

Movie plot title: A Christmas Carol Movie plot: Old Ebenezer Scrooge is a cruel man for whom life's only passion has become only money; he hates Christmas, even the very mention of it, lives alone and only to work. He is very strict with his only, underpaid and overworked, employee, Bob Cratchit, and does not believe in giving away to charity or being kind to anyone. One Christmas Eve, Ebenezer Scrooge receives a ghostly visit from his long deceased partner Jacob Marley, who had died exactly seven years before on that same day. In his life, Jacob Marley had been just as selfish and uncaring as Scrooge was now. He tells Ebenezer about how his soul has not had a moment's rest since his death and how his spirit has been doomed to wander the earth looking down at what might have been, had he been a different man. He tells Scrooge that he wants to spare him that same fate, and that on that night, he will receive the visits of three spirits. After Jacob departs, Scrooge heads for his bed with no intention of having his sleep be interrupted by anyone. Still, precisely as Jacob Marley had predicted, the first spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Past arrives at one o'clock. He and Scrooge depart together for the Christmases that have already been, and from the experience, Scrooge gains a painful memory of the person he was, and how he became what he is today. The second spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Present, shares with Scrooge the Christmases being celebrated on that same year, especially the merriment being had at his nephew Fred's home; Fred had invited him to dinner, and Scrooge, as usual, had declined the invitation. From this experience, Scrooge also learns about Bob Cratchit's family, and how his youngest son, Tiny Tim, is a fragile creature supported by a crutch who may be doomed to die unless he receives better nourishment, more than his father can provide. Finally, Scrooge receives the last of the visits, from the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, and Scrooge finds himself a changed man after he learns of the cruel fate in store for Tiny Tim, as well as the... Answer:","completion":"Jacob Marley is a significant character in the movie \\"A Christmas Carol.\\" He was the former business partner of the protagonist, Ebenezer Scrooge. Marley, like Scrooge, was a selfish, uncaring, and cruel man in life, with a sole passion for money. Unfortunately, his stinginess and lack of compassion ultimately led to his restless spirit being doomed to wander the earth after his death, unable to find peace. Marley appears in the movie plot as a ghost who visits Scrooge on Christmas Eve, exactly seven years after his own death. The purpose of his visit is to warn Scrooge about the consequences of living such a cold-hearted life and try to spare him from the same tormented fate. Marley informs Scrooge that he will be visited by three spirits that night who will attempt to help him change his ways. Jacob Marley's appearance in the story serves as a turning point for Ebenezer Scrooge, as he begins to question his own actions and attitudes, and ultimately undergoes a deep transformation in response to the lessons he learns from the three ghosts. Marley's character acts as a cautionary figure, representing the potential consequences of living a life filled with greed, selfishness, and a lack of empathy for others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: When your lips are dry and chapped, they will appear thinner. You can make your lips appear plumper and healthier simply by taking better care of them; the first step to doing this is to drink enough water. A popular method for calculating how much water you should drink each day is to take your weight in pounds and divide it in half; the result is how many ounces of water you should drink each day. A 150-pound woman should drink roughly 75 ounces (about 2,200 ml) of water each day. When you lick your lips, your tongue spreads acidic saliva on them. This can remove your lips’ natural oils and cause them to become irritated. Smoking can irritate and discolor your lips; it can also cause wrinkles around your mouth. If you smoke and do not want to quit, at the very least try switching to an e-cigarette, which will not be as toxic to your lips as a regular cigarette. You may be able to reduce smoking-related discoloration by massaging almond and coconut oil on your lips each day. If your lips are dry or chapped, use a lip balm regularly. Even if your lips are not chapped, consider using a lip moisturizer that contains an SPF to protect your lips from the sun’s damaging rays. If your lips are sensitive, it may take some trial and error to find a lip balm that works for you. Some people use natural balms containing ingredients like coconut oil and honey, while others find that medicated balms containing menthol are best. Unless your lips are already well-hydrated, avoid beeswax lip balms. Beeswax lip balms are too heavy to actually impart moisture to your lips; they can only seal in the moisture that’s already there. If you only put one thing on your lips, it should be SPF. The sun’s rays can cause your lips to chap and become dry, making them look smaller than they are. Shiny products such as lip glosses can actually magnify the sun’s rays, causing them to harm your lips more than if you had nothing on your lips at all. Dermatologists warn that wearing lip gloss without an SPF can do more than damage your lips: it can actually cause skin cancer. Exfoliating your lips might help them feel smooth in the short term, but it can actually damage your lips if you do it regularly. Instead of exfoliating your lips, work on keeping them hydrated. Unlike your regular skin, your lips are made of a sensitive mucous membrane. When this membrane is healthy, it’s naturally smooth. If you are taking good care of your lips and they are still always chapped, you may be experiencing an allergic reaction to something you’re using on or near your lips: Citrusy and salty foods can irritate lips. Some toothpastes can irritate lips. If you think your toothpaste may be causing problems for you, try switching to one that doesn’t contain sodium laurel sulphate or alcohol. Be mindful of heavily scented facial products, which can wind up on your lips and can cause irritation.","completion":"To make your lips appear plumper and healthier, ensure proper hydration by drinking enough water daily based on your body weight. Avoid licking your lips, as acidic saliva can remove natural oils, causing irritation. Refrain from smoking or switch to e-cigarettes, and treat smoking-related discoloration using almond and coconut oil. Regularly use lip balm or lip moisturizer containing SPF to protect against sun damage. If your lips are sensitive, try natural lip balms or medicated options with menthol, but avoid beeswax lip balms. Be cautious with lip glosses without SPF due to increased sun damage risk. Rather than exfoliating, focus on hydration to maintain smooth, healthy lips.

Installing batteries and choosing the correct measurement settings are two of the most essential steps in ensuring the seamless operation of your device. In this article, we'll provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to install batteries and configure the measurement settings tailored to your preferences. Step 1. Read the Instructions Provided Before you begin installing the battery and configuring the settings, it's important to carefully read the instructions provided with your device. Different gadgets have different specifications, so you must always follow the manufacturer's guidelines to avoid any unwanted issues or damage. The instructions will usually include details like the type and size of the battery required, the specific procedure to insert the battery, and any precautions you need to take while handling the device. This will ensure that you accurately follow the steps and avoid any damage or malfunction. Step 2. Install the Battery Once you've read the instructions and familiarized yourself with the details, you can begin installing the battery. To do this, follow the steps outlined in the instruction manual. Typically, installing a battery involves the following steps: 1. Ensure the device is turned off. This helps avoid any accidental button presses or configuration changes. 2. Locate the battery compartment, which is usually at the back or bottom of the device. You may need to use a screwdriver or another utensil to open it, depending on the design. 3. Check the battery type and size specified in the manual. Most devices use standard AA or AAA batteries, but some may require unique sizes like CR2032 or button-cell batteries. 4. Carefully insert the battery into the compartment, making sure to align the positive and negative terminals correctly. The compartment should have markings indicating the correct alignment. 5. Close the battery compartment securely. If it requires screws, ensure they are tightened to prevent accidental opening. Step 3. Turn On the Device After installing the battery, power on your device. You may need to press and hold the power button for a few seconds or just press it briefly, depending on the device. If your device doesn't turn on immediately, double-check the battery's alignment and ensure the compartment is closed properly. Step 4. Choose Your Preferred Measurement Setting Once the device is powered on, navigate to the settings menu, which is often denoted by a gear icon or \\"Settings\\" label. Find the measurement settings option within the menu. Depending on your device, this could be anything from units of measurement (such as inches, centimeters, or miles) to temperature readings (Celsius or Fahrenheit). To choose your preferred measurement settings, follow these steps: 1. Scroll through the available options using the navigation buttons on your device until you locate the measurement settings. 2. Select the measurement unit you prefer by pressing the 'OK' or 'Select' button, depending on your device. 3.

Question 2: How a company shares or divides its stocks to NSE and BSE? Or NSE and BSE are just pointers to companies total stocks? OPTIONS: (a). no (b). yes Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Yes, questions 1 and 2 are asking the same thing. Both questions are inquiring about the process or method through which a company divides or allocates its shares between the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). To provide a detailed and long answer on this topic, it is essential first to understand the context of the Indian stock market. In India, the primary stock exchanges are the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). When a company decides to go public, it has to list its shares on one or both of these stock exchanges to allow investors to buy and sell the company's shares. To list its shares on these stock exchanges, a company generally follows these steps: 1. Initial Public Offering (IPO): A company first needs to go through an IPO process, which involves creating and filing a prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), receiving approval from SEBI, and then issuing the shares to the public. The prospectus will contain detailed information on the company's finances, business model, and future prospects. It will also include an overview of how many shares the company plans to issue and at what price. Generally, a company in India can list its shares on both the NSE and BSE, especially if it wants to increase its visibility and ensure a wider reach to investors. However, this is not a requirement, and the company can choose to list its shares on either of the stock exchanges. 2. Share Allocation: After a company completes its IPO process, it will allocate its shares between the NSE and BSE (if it chooses to list on both exchanges). This allocation is typically done based on a predetermined ratio, which will be mentioned in the prospectus. For example, if a company issues 1 million shares and decides to list on both NSE and BSE, it may allocate 50% (500,000 shares) to the NSE and 50% (500,000 shares) to the BSE. 3. Trading: Once the shares are listed and allocated between the stock exchanges, investors can start trading in the shares. Each exchange will have its order book and trading system where buy and sell orders are matched, and trades are executed. It's important to note that the NSE and BSE are not \\"pointers\\" to a company's total stocks. Instead, they are independent trading platforms, each with its own unique set of rules, regulations, and listing requirements. They each also have their order books and trading mechanisms. In conclusion, companies in India typically allocate shares between NSE and BSE based on a predetermined ratio mentioned in their IPO prospectus. This enables them to reach a broader range of investors, increase their visibility in the market, and ultimately facilitate the trading of their shares in the stock market."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - waterfall - shopping mall - beach - disneyland - state park The answer is \\"disneyland\\" because A:","completion":"Disneyland is the most popular destination among the options provided for tourists seeking to see princesses in America. This iconic amusement park, located in Anaheim, California, has been enchanting visitors since it first opened its gates on July 17, 1955. It was conceived and built under the direct supervision of Walt Disney himself, making it the only Disney theme park to be crafted under his watchful eye. Over time, Disneyland has expanded, with multiple offshoots around the globe, but the original Disneyland Park remains a firm favorite among fans and tourists. The primary reason for its enduring popularity is the wide array of Disney princesses that can be encountered throughout the park. Various themed sections, known as \\"lands,\\" offer an immersive experience for guests, particularly Fantasyland, where the magic of Disney's beloved fairy tales comes alive. Here, tourists will not only get the opportunity to see recreations of famous princess scenes but also meet and greet these beloved characters in person. Some of the most iconic Disney princesses that tourists can encounter include Cinderella, Snow White, Aurora, Ariel, Belle, Jasmine, Pocahontas, Mulan, Tiana, Rapunzel, Merida, and Moana. Disneyland provides an unparalleled experience in terms of princess sightings. Visitors can attend character meet-and-greets and take photographs with the princesses at designated locations throughout the park. Experiences such as the \\"Royal Hall,\\" where guests are treated to a royal audience with several Disney princesses, or the \\"Disney Princess Breakfast Adventures,\\" where tourists can dine with the princesses in the elegant Napa Rose setting, create lifelong memories for fans of these regal characters. Additionally, guests can enjoy special parades and live shows that bring these fairy tale worlds even closer to life. Notably, visitors can explore iconic settings from the Disney films at Disneyland, often recreated in intricate detail. For instance, guests can visit and tour \\"Sleeping Beauty Castle,\\" an emblematic landmark that transports tourists into the world of Princess Aurora; or explore \\"The Little Mermaid ~ Ariel's Undersea Adventure,\\" which takes guests on a journey beneath the surface to witness Ariel's story firsthand. As a result, among the options provided, Disneyland is the destination where tourists seeking to see princesses can truly immerse themselves in a world of fairy tales, magic, and enchantment. In contrast, waterfalls, shopping malls, beaches, and state parks may offer picturesque or retail experiences but do not specifically cater to those wanting to meet, greet, and engage with Disney princesses in an interactive and immersive environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The phrase \\"my way\\" suggests the speaker wants their own preference to prevail. So in this context, \\"way\\" means the method or manner one prefers to do something. 2. \\"A lonely way of life.\\" In this sentence, \\"way\\" refers to a manner or style of living. The phrase \\"way of life\\" represents the customs, habits, and attitudes that define how someone lives. In this case, \\"way\\" represents a particular lifestyle characterized by loneliness. Now, let's compare the meanings of \\"way\\" in both sentences: 1. A method or manner one prefers to do something. 2. A particular lifestyle or manner of living. Although both meanings relate to manners or methods, they are not used in the same context. In the first sentence, \\"way\\" refers to personal preference in a specific situation, while in the second sentence, it refers to an overall lifestyle or way of living.

The U.S. is looking to release several prisoners from Guantaamo Bay as it seeks to build a relationship with the Taliban on the back of last night's announcement on withdrawing troops from Afghanistan. 'Operational steps' have been put in motion by the Obama administration to move up to five prisoners in the hope it will further peace talks with the Afghan Taliban, according to a senior congressional official. The revelations follows U.S. Defence Secretary, Leon Panetta's announcement that he wants troops in Afghanistan to end their combat. role by as early as the middle of 2013. Controversial release: The Obama administration have acknowledged that to build trust with the Taliban, the United States may release several Afghan Taliban prisoners from Guantanamo Bay, according to a senior congressional official. The five prisoners are said to be 'hand-picked' by the Taliban preparing for the talks, claimed Fox News today. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that the administration’s efforts to talk with the Afghan Taliban smack of 'desperation.' Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said ahead of the hearing that the administration's efforts to talk with the Afghan Taliban smack of 'desperation' 'Candidly, I don’t like the direction they are going in (with) reconciliation,' Rogers said to Fox News. He said after six years on the Committee looking at the issue, he felt it was an attempt to catch our on 'their policy of we're getting out.' The senior congressional official who. spoke to Fox News anonymously said money had been. spent to send the men to a third. country. The official added that the administration tried to abate concern by insisting they would not release all five Taliban leaders at once and said three would be swapped now and the others at a later date. But as part of Tuesday's Senate. intelligence hearing the head of the national counter-terrorism. center, Matt Olsen, confirmed that 48 detainees were deemed too. dangerous to release during the administration's 2009 review of the. Guantanamo Detention camps and the five Taliban detainees are among them. 'The Taliban asked for them specifically,' the senior congressional official said. He went on to say they detainees who could be released had 'U.S. blood on their hands.' Defence chief Leon Panetta arrives in Brussels yesterday for a defense ministers meeting which will discuss the future of Afghanistan. Prisoner swaps are usually dealt with after the peace terms are settled. Yesterday,. Defence Secretary Leon Panetta laid out the administration's most. explicit portrayal of the U.S. drawdown in Afghanistan, saying that U.S. and other international forces in Afghanistan expect to end their. combat role in 2013 and continue a training and advisory role with. Afghan forces through 2014. Panetta's. remarks to reporters traveling with him to a NATO defense ministers. meeting in Brussels showed how the foreign military role in Afghanistan. is expected to evolve from the current high-intensity fight against the. Taliban to a support role with Afghans fully in the lead. Defence Secretary Panetta recently announced said the U.S. could end its formal combat role in Afghanistan 18 months from now. Taliban militants hand over their weapons after joining the Afghan government's reconciliation and reintegration program. Meanwhile the Taliban have dismissed reports they are preparing to talk peace with the Afghan government, and a leaked NATO report has shown captured insurgents full of confidence they will seize power after international troops leave. While both developments yesterday were setbacks to President Hamid Karzai's quest to broker peace with the Taliban, his government got a big boost from Pakistan's top diplomat who declared her nation's support for an Afghan-led reconciliation process. Pakistan's Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar said she was visiting Kabul to deliver the strong message that Pakistan would stand behind any peace initiative that was widely supported by all ethnic groups in Afghanistan. 'Our only prerequisite to be supportive of an initiative is that it should be Afghan-led,' she said. 'It should be Afghan-owned. It should be Afghan-driven and Afghan-backed.' Trip to Kabul: Pakistan's Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar said she was visiting Kabul to deliver the strong message that Pakistan would stand behind any peace initiative that was widely supported by all ethnic groups in Afghanistan. Rumours have swirled for days that Karzai's government was seeking direct talks with the Taliban in Saudi Arabia - a move seen as Karzai's attempt to take charge of the peace effort. A statement Wednesday from Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid rejected those reports as 'baseless. Khar's visit to Kabul came on the same day a classified NATO. report was leaked, claiming that the Taliban believe they will return to power. after the U.S.-led coalition ends its combat role in Afghanistan in 2014. The. report, which was based on the interrogation of more than 4,000 captured. Taliban, al-Qaida and foreign fighters, was obtained by the BBC and other news. organizations. According to excerpts of the report obtained by the BBC, the. Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence is \\"thoroughly aware of Taliban. activities and the whereabouts of all senior Taliban personnel. The Haqqani. family, for example, resides immediately west of the ISI office at the airfield. in Miram Shah, Pakistan,\\" the report said. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen makes opening remarks during a meeting of NATO defense ministers at NATO headquarters today. Khar dismissed the allegations in the report as 'old wine. in an even older bottle. I don't think these claims are new.' Nick Witney, a former head of the European Defense Agency,. said the report indicated the morale of Taliban fighters remained extremely. high after 10 years of war - and in spite of a massive military effort mounted. by the U.S. and its NATO allies in the past two years. 'The report does confirm what has been increasingly. obvious for a number of years - that this Afghan operation has turned into a. great misadventure for the West,' said Witney, a senior policy fellow at. the Paris-based European Council on Foreign Relations. Pentagon spokesman Capt. John Kirby told reporters that the. U.S. would like to see ties severed between some elements of Pakistani. intelligence and militant groups. 'That's not a strategic decision that we get to make -. that's a strategic decision that folks in the ISI need to make.' NATO officials cautioned that the report was a summary of. interrogations and was not based on an intelligence analysis. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

The review's title suggests that the product is practically worthless, which is a strong indicator that the customer had a terrible experience with the product. This alone would raise concerns about the product's quality and value for money. Furthermore, the review explicitly states that the product's tip split open after just an hour of use, which is surely a significant issue concerning the product's durability and reliability. If the product fails to hold up after such a short period of use, it may not be worth spending money on it, as the purchaser might have to repeatedly replace it or look for alternative options. Finally, the customer has given the product a rating of 1 star just because the rating submission required at least one star. However, the reviewer clearly states that they would have given the product a rating of -5 stars if it was allowed, further emphasizing their strong dissatisfaction with the product. This negative rating, as well as the other issues mentioned in the review, would make a potential buyer think twice before purchasing the product. In conclusion, the review would undoubtedly play a key role in discouraging potential buyers from purchasing the product, as it raises serious questions about the product's quality, durability, and value for money.

In his first general election event in Wales, Mr Corbyn visited Cardiff North - a seat Labour wants to recapture from the Conservatives. The leader used the event to heap praise on the Welsh Government. But Welsh Tory leader Andrew RT Davies claimed the Welsh Labour team would be \\"gritting its teeth\\" during the visit. Mr Corbyn was joined by First Minister Carwyn Jones, as well as Cardiff North AM Julie Morgan. Speaking on Whitchurch Common to a crowd of around 700, Mr Corbyn said: \\"I urge you to come with us on this journey of hope and excitement, not this journey of fear and misery which is all the Tories offer.\\" Mr Corbyn said the UK government was slicing the money from normal state schools for free and grammar schools. He criticised the UK government for cutting the Welsh budget. \\"In Wales it is different, because you've got a government that is determined to properly fund education and give every child an opportunity,\\" he said. Friday's event came after Mr Corbyn said children were being crammed \\"like sardines\\" into \\"super-sized\\" school classes in England, as Labour focused its general election campaign on education. But the Tories called the comments \\"a massive own goal\\", saying the Labour-led Welsh Government had overseen increases in class sizes in Wales. Education in Wales is devolved and Liberal Democrat Education Secretary Kirsty Williams has announced a Â£36m fund to reduce infant class sizes in Wales. In the wideranging speech, Mr Corbyn said seven years of the Tory government and the earlier coalition had brought \\"greater poverty, greater insecurity, greater misery\\", and that Labour was the party of hope and opportunity. He said Labour would maintain the triple-lock on pensions, while he claimed big firms would not be allowed \\"cosy\\" tax negotiations with HM Revenue and Customs. Mr Corbyn was surrounded by a large crowd of well-wishers and supporters as he left the scene. Welsh Labour leader Carwyn Jones said Labour would create a \\"fairer society\\" after 8 June. \\"The time has come for change,\\" he said. But Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: \\"After nearly two decades in government, Labour's record is a smorgasbord of failure evidenced by Wales having the worst-performing education system in the UK, the lowest take-home pay, and the longest hospital waiting times.\\" Jonathan Edwards, Carmarthenshire East and Dinefwr Plaid Cymru MP, said: \\"Given the current weakness and chaos plaguing Labour, the prospect of a UK Labour government is a complete fantasy.\\" Meanwhile, Rhondda MP Chris Bryant said he was \\"fully supporting\\" the leader, despite being a vocal critic when he was voted into the role. Make no bones about it - it would have been a good boost for Mr Corbyn to see so many hundreds of his supporters turn out in Cardiff. But it is not enough for him to rely on the votes of Labour supporters. Take a place like Cardiff North, where the Conservatives have a got a majority of 2,137 votes. It is those voters that it will need to attract, that will sometimes vote Labour, sometimes vote for the Conservatives. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn praised the Welsh Government during his first general election event in Wales. Speaking to a crowd of around 700 people in Cardiff North, Corbyn urged the audience to embrace hope and excitement, and criticized the UK government for cutting the Welsh budget.

That seems to be the lesson young athletes learn from the latest steroids scandal. Sure, they look bad. But both Braun and Rodriguez have millions of dollars to fall back on. What's most troubling about this affair is how many of today's young people believe cheating might be the only way to break through in sports.

Many people think that maybe more athletes are using PEDs too. This news story is about how some young people might think they need to cheat and use PEDs to become successful in sports. A recent survey of young men showed that many of them think PEDs are important for success in professional sports or for improving their athletic abilities.

It is human beings that do great harm to the ocean ecosystems . The coral reefs are fine ecosystems that provide food and protection for many ocean creatures. The coral in almost all of the oceans is in danger from pollution.Chemicals from factories end up in the seas and oceans and destroy coral reefs. If the coral systems die some ocean creatures will be sure to die out. Protecting the ocean also has something to do with the protection of ocean wildlife like dolphins. The fishing industry depends on modern ways to catch many fish in order to earn more money. But the nets for fishing also _ other sea animals. The fishing boat workers are advised to check their nets and set other ocean animals free. But the boats are in a hurry to make money and often other ocean animals are caught with fish. Offshore oil spills can destroy the ocean environment because oil kills all ocean life. The world depends on oil and because there is a great amount of oil off the shore of many countries, the need for oil is more important than the risk of the oil spill. However, the fact is that one human mistake can lead to an ocean environmental accident that will cause years of damage to the fine ocean ecosystems. Oil spills will kill all the creatures in the area of the spill. The oil will be washed up on shore and destroy the ecosystems along the shore including birds. Everyone who cares about the environment should be interested in protecting the ocean, and all of us should do something for the protection of the ocean.

Given the context: How would Lee feel afterwards? Possible answers: Like they need an opportunity, Good for giving them an opportunity, Like they want more employees The answer is:","completion":"Lee would likely feel positive and good for giving Kendall an opportunity. This response is inferred based on the understanding that presenting someone with a job opportunity generally reflects well on the presenter, particularly if they manage the business, and thus could potentially enhance their feelings of satisfaction, achievement, and contribution. Understanding Lee's perspective requires considering different aspects. As a business manager, Lee must have the capacity to identify competent individuals who can significantly contribute to the to the success and growth of the business. Choosing Kendall as a potential candidate implies that Lee sees valuable skills or potential in him that can improve the company's capacity or effectiveness. This act of recognition can lead to a sense of accomplishment, as it demonstrates Lee's ability to identify and secure talent which is a valuable asset in business management. Moreover, providing a job opportunity can manifest Lee's leadership skills. It can reflect Lee’s abilities in decision-making, employee growth, and in fostering a positive workplace. Nevertheless, leaders who provide opportunities to others often feel a sense of fulfillment as it denotes their ability to guide, influence, and develop others. This could further enhance Lee's confidence and self-image. Another significant point is the element of altruism that might accompany Lee's feelings. Granting a job opportunity is, in many ways, an act of contributing to someone else's personal growth and financial stability. It can hence bring about feelings of goodness and positivity. Lee may derive job satisfaction from helping others, particularly if Kendall was unemployed or in need of better career prospects. However, the initial phrase does not specify the relationship between Lee and Kendall before the job opportunity was offered. If they had a positive relationship, Lee might have presented the opportunity as a token of friendship or simply due to trust and belief in Kendall's abilities. This could add another layer of satisfaction and happiness to Lee's action, knowing that he could help a friend or trusted associate in such a significant manner. Lastly, by offering a job opportunity to Kendall, Lee is also indirectly contributing to the business's growth by increasing its employee count and potentially diversifying its skill set. This could make Lee feel responsible and significant, knowing that he is meaningfully contributing to the business's progress. Therefore, in all, Lee would likely feel good for giving Kendall an opportunity. Apart from this, he may experience feelings of achievement, satisfaction, responsibility, and even empowerment, stemming from his leadership role, decision-making abilities, and his act of contributing to both Kendall and the business."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In fact, the hypothesis contradicts the premise. Let's break down the premise and hypothesis to better understand why this contradiction occurs. Premise: This statement highlights that \\"they\\" (presumably a group of people or critics) heavily criticize someone (possibly an author or commentator) for attributing Sylvia Plath's suicide to fate and astrology. By \\"taking him to task,\\" it implies that they heavily disagree with his perspective and voice their disapproval and skepticism towards his explanation.

The contradiction arises from the fact that the premise suggests that the critics do not support the idea of blaming Plath's suicide on fate and astrology, whereas the hypothesis claims that they do. In summary, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as the premise indicates disagreement with the idea of attributing Plath's suicide to fate and astrology, whereas the hypothesis suggests agreement with this notion.

Read this: Since the 1980s, as the complexity of buildings began to increase (in terms of structural systems, services, energy and technologies), the field of architecture became multi-disciplinary with specializations for each project type, technological expertise or project delivery methods. In addition, there has been an increased separation of the 'design' architect [Notes 1] from the 'project' architect who ensures that the project meets the required standards and deals with matters of liability.[Notes 2] The preparatory processes for the design of any large building have become increasingly complicated, and require preliminary studies of such matters as durability, sustainability, quality, money, and compliance with local laws. A large structure can no longer be the design of one person but must be the work of many. Modernism and Postmodernism have been criticised by some members of the architectural profession who feel that successful architecture is not a personal, philosophical, or aesthetic pursuit by individualists; rather it has to consider everyday needs of people and use technology to create liveable environments, with the design process being informed by studies of behavioral, environmental, and social sciences.

It says 80% of parents are concerned about kids meeting bad people online. That's because young people who largely have grown up with the Net think of it as a social outlet , say the researchers. To young people, the benefits of giving out some personal information to reach out to friends outweigh the risks. And the study shows they are so comfortable with the medium that 78% have a personal website or blog. Parents also recognize the importance of the Internet. The survey shows 91% think the Net helps their children explore their passions, and 77% think the Internet is one of the most valuable education tools teens have. But 88% think it's important to know what their kids are doing online. Findings suggest both parents and teens need more education about using online media, Steyer says.

His friend Frank decided to read more about populations that displayed natural selection more sparingly. They both learned lots of new interesting facts. Which friend learned less about animals that reproduce in greater numbers? Hint: New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Greg and Frank were two friends who studied natural sciences and took different paths to learn about different topics.

Considering Greg's choice to study natural selection, he would have learned about the process that enables certain populations to reproduce in greater numbers due to their advantageous traits. This includes learning about animals with traits that are more likely to thrive in their environment, giving them a higher chance of survival and reproduction. On the other hand, Frank decided to read more about populations that displayed natural selection more sparingly. This indicates that Frank's focus was on populations in which the process of natural selection is less prevalent or observable. In such populations, animals may not exhibit as much variation in their traits or may not show significant change over time due to the influence of natural selection. Such populations may not frequently experience the same factors that drive the reproduction of greater numbers in other populations, making it likely that Frank's study focused less on these types of animals. Considering the different paths Greg and Frank took in their studies, it can be concluded that Frank learned less about animals that reproduce in greater numbers. While Greg's study of natural selection directly deals with the factors that contribute to higher reproductive rates in certain populations, Frank's focus on populations that displayed natural selection more sparingly means he likely encountered fewer examples of animals that reproduce in greater numbers due to advantageous traits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Wiser was fired as the paper’s TV critic because her \\"Glee Live!\\" concert review, published Sunday but since pulled from the website, described a song that wasn’t performed and another Wiser didn’t see. She explains, and apologizes, as recounted by the Chicago Tribune and Time Out Chicago: She brought her two young kids with her to Friday’s show, but left after her son fell off a chair and her daughter started throwing up into a cotton-candy bag—just 13 songs into the concert. She got commentary on the encore, which she didn’t see, from information on previous shows. \\"I'd like to think it wouldn't have been part of my thought process if it hadn't been 1am and I was just trying to get the story done,\\" said Wiser. \\"Trying to do this with the kids and a three-hour commute, and when every editor wants something different, let’s just say it’s become a very strange place.

Article:","completion":"Title: The Unfortunate Firing of Veteran Journalist Paige Wiser: Juggling Parenthood and Professionalism Paige Wiser seemed to have it all—a promising journalism career as the Chicago Sun-Times TV critic, spanning over 17 long years, family, and a working-mother's ability to juggle responsibilities both at home and the office. But in a twist of fate, all of that changed when a combination of unfortunate events eventually led to Wiser being fired from her job, and all because of a vomiting child. It all started when Wiser was assigned to cover the \\"Glee Live!\\" concert for the newspaper. As any working parent can attest, sometimes personal and professional schedules collide. That Friday night was no different for Wiser, who brought along her two young children to the concert. What she didn't expect, however, was how that decision would snowball into a series of events that would lead to her professional demise. Only 13 songs into the concert, Wiser's son fell off a chair and her daughter started vomiting into a cotton-candy bag. That was when Wiser was forced to leave the concert to take care of her children, thus missing the encore. Unable to complete the concert review herself, Wiser based her commentary on information gathered from previous shows, an action that eventually had severe repercussions on her career. Despite her 17-year tenure with the Chicago Sun-Times, Wiser was fired from her position as the paper's TV critic because her \\"Glee Live!\\" review made references to a song that wasn’t performed during the concert, and another song that Wiser did not actually see. In an act of professionalism, Wiser both explains and apologizes for her actions, as recounted by the Chicago Tribune and Time Out Chicago. During an interview, Wiser stated that she would like to think that her decision to include the erroneous information about the encore wouldn't have been part of her thought process, had it not been 1 a.m. and her desperation to get the story done. She further explained the difficulties of being a working parent in the journalism industry, saying, \\"Trying to do this with the kids and a three-hour commute, and when every editor wants something different, let’s just say it’s become a very strange place. And because there’s not a lot of people with kids at the paper, I’m a little sensitive about coming across like I can’t do it because of my kids.” The incident brought a tremendous amount of attention, with Gawker taking the opportunity to make light of the situation. But beneath the surface lies an often overlooked struggle that many working parents face when trying to find the balance between their careers and family responsibilities. Unfortunately for Wiser, her delicate balancing act eventually tipped the scales, with her career paying the ultimate price. The case of Paige Wiser serves as a stark reminder for many working parents that the struggle to find the perfect balance between professionalism and parenthood is indeed real, and sometimes, when things go wrong, the consequences can be dire. Regardless of the outcome, Wiser has shown an undeniable sense of integrity and accountability, and her journey will surely resonate with parents who face their own battles in striking the right balance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. One look at Fred Rooney, and you just know he's the good guy. A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.'' After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.

This results in less heat being trapped, which can lead to a cooler climate or reduced global warming. Step 2: Assess the possible impact on disease prevalence Temperature changes due to a lesser greenhouse effect could potentially affect the prevalence of certain diseases. In general, warmer temperatures may benefit bacteria, viruses, and other disease-causing pathogens, allowing them to thrive and reproduce more rapidly. Conversely, cooler temperatures could slow down their growth and reproduction. Step 3: Consider the severity of diseases While temperature affects the prevalence of diseases, it does not directly determine their severity. Disease severity depends on factors such as individual susceptibility, the virulence of the pathogen, and the effectiveness of treatment and prevention measures. Step 4: Analyze the relationship between the greenhouse effect and disease severity In the context of a lesser greenhouse effect, there could be a reduced prevalence of certain diseases due to a potentially cooler climate. However, this change in temperature may not have a direct and universal impact on the severity of diseases.

OPT: 1. Yes. 2. No. The answer is:","completion":"2. No. The correct answer to the question \\"the Earth being tilted on its axis causes solar energy to drive what?\\" is not \\"systems of prejudice\\". The Earth's tilt on its axis affects the distribution and absorption of solar energy, which in turn drives the Earth's weather and climate systems. The Earth is tilted approximately 23.5 degrees relative to its orbit around the Sun. This tilt affects the amount of sunlight reaching different parts of the Earth throughout the year, creating a difference in temperatures and driving the weather system. Solar energy plays a significant role in powering the Earth's weather system, as it influences the atmospheric circulation, ocean currents, and overall climate patterns. The main factors that cause weather to change are the energy from the Sun, the composition of the Earth's atmosphere, and the uneven heating of the Earth's surface. The solar energy that reaches the Earth's surface is absorbed and converted into heat, which causes the air near the surface to warm up and rise. This process creates a flow of air known as convection currents, which ultimately help in generating different weather phenomena such as wind, storms, and other atmospheric events. As the Earth rotates, the Coriolis effect causes the movement of heated air to be deflected, which further influences the formation of winds and weather patterns. The tilt of the Earth's axis also leads to seasonal changes, as it causes the planet to receive varying amounts of sunlight at different times of the year. These seasonal changes affect the balance of heating and cooling on the Earth's surface, influencing the global climate and consequent weather events. In conclusion, the Earth being tilted on its axis causes solar energy to drive the Earth's weather and climate systems, not systems of prejudice. Prejudice is a social issue stemming from biased attitudes, beliefs, or stereotypes about others, which is unrelated to the Earth's tilt and the influence of solar energy on our weather systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

That, and some other takeaways from Tuesday night’s latest committee rankings. Hmm … so you’re saying there’s a chance. Stanford (8-2) dropped just four spots, from No. 7 to No. 11, following its home loss to Oregon. That puts the Cardinal four spots higher than they are in the AP poll, presumably due to their strong schedule. Most notably, they’re the highest two-loss team, and that’s with games remaining against current No. 4 Notre Dame and, if they beat Cal this weekend, either No. 13 Utah or No. 24 USC in the Pac-12 title game. A couple of dominoes would have to fall its way, but enough teams ahead of it are already guaranteed to lose that an 11-2 Stanford team would likely check in no lower than fifth. It needs the Big 12 teams to keep cannibalizing each other. Better yet, it needs Clemson to lose in the ACC title game. An 11-2 Pac-12 champ would likely get in before a 12-1 ACC division champ. Oklahoma’s in … decent shape. The seventh-ranked Sooners moved up to right about where I thought they would following last weekend’s big win at Baylor. If they beat both TCU this weekend and current undefeated Oklahoma State in its finale, the Sooners would be 11-1 Big 12 champs with a very good case to pass No. 4 Notre Dame even if the Irish beat Stanford. It’s hardly a given, though. For one thing, the injury-depleted TCU Horned Frogs dropped to 18th this week after struggling with winless Kansas and will fall even further if the Sooners beat them handily. Also, chairman Jeff Long reaffirmed Tuesday that the committee does discuss common opponents and that “certainly we're aware [of] the Notre Dame win and the Oklahoma loss” to Texas. This much is certain: The Sooners are likely the only Big 12 team that can still get in with one loss. Even at 10-0, Oklahoma State is still stuck down at No. 6. Baylor fell to 10th, and while Long was complimentary of the Bears (“Even though they lost the game, they stood in there toe-to-toe with an Oklahoma team and played well\\"), they have quite a bit of ground to make up. TCU is apparently toast. Better luck next year, UNC. Buried all the way down at No. 17, behind five two-loss teams and a one-loss Group of 5 team (Navy), are the 9-1 Tar Heels. Asked about that low rating, Long said North Carolina’s season-opening loss to a now 3-7 South Carolina team and two games against FCS opponents are “weighing them down.” Mind you, the Heels will go their entire regular season without playing a Top-25 opponent, so even upsetting No. 1 Clemson in the ACC title game likely won’t be enough to close a 13-spot deficit. North Carolina QB Marquise Williams — who threw three red-zone interceptions against South Carolina – took the committee’s message hard. “That’s my fault we not getting the respect,” he tweeted. “I’ll fix that.” Stewart Mandel is a senior college sports columnist for FOXSports.com.

Step 1: Identify the context and subject of the sentence. - The context seems to be about Erin and Samantha's relationship and some choices Samantha has made. - The subject of focus is Erin, who is trying to understand Samantha's choices. Step 2: Decide on a probable action or reaction from the subject. - Erin's reaction could be any of the following: empathy, support, acceptance, respect, frustration, or disappointment. Since the tone of the sentence doesn't seem negative, empathy, support, acceptance, or respect seem more likely. Step 3: Consider if there are any indicators of time, emotion, or consequences. - No clear indication of time or specific emotions related to the choices. - The phrase \\"didn't understand the reasons\\" is important, but the tone doesn't seem overly negative or critical. Step 4: Create a conclusion that is fitting and coherent with the given information, considering the context and probable reactions. - I concluded with \\"she respected her friend's autonomy,\\" as it seems like a plausible reaction for Erin, who doesn't understand Samantha's reasons but still wants to support her friend."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Article: Tim Berners-Lee is the man who wrote the software program that led to the foundation of the World Wide Web. Britain played an important part in developing the first generation of computers. The parents of Tim Berners-Lee both worked on one of the earliest commercial computers and talked about their work at home. As a child he would build models of computers from packing material. After graduating from Oxford University he went on to the real thing. In the 1980s, scientists were already communicating using a primitive version of e-mail. While working at a laboratory in Switzerland, Tim Berners-Lee wrote a program, which let him store these messages. This gave him another idea: write a program that will let academics from across the world share information on a single place. In 1990 he wrote the HTTP and HTML programs which form the basis of the World Wide Web. The next year his programs were placed on to the Internet. Everyone was welcome to use them and improve them if they could. Programmers used this codes to work with different operating systems. New things like web browsers and search engines were developed. Between 1991 and 1994 the number of web pages rose from 10 to 100,000. In 1994 Tim Berners-Lee formed the newly formed World Wide Web consortium , or W3C. More than 200 leading companies and laboratories are represented by W3C. Together they make sure that everyone can share equally on the web. \\"The Web can help people to understand the way that others live and love.

Crime assertion Trump, in his remarks, also suggested those illegally in the United States commit more crimes on a statistical basis than citizens or resident aliens. However, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit a crime in the U.S. than native-born citizens, including one published by the libertarian CATO Institute this year. Following intense domestic and international condemnation, Trump on Wednesday signed an order ending his administration's practice of separation of children from their families while parents were being prosecuted for crossing the border illegally.

Context: This study was designed to examine the course of psychological distress and pain from study entry to death in 59 women with metastatic breast cancer participating in a randomized trial of the effects of group psychotherapy on psychosocial outcomes and survival. It was hypothesized that psychological distress would increase significantly before death independent of changes in pain.', 'Data were collected as part of a larger study (N = 125). Analyses were based on data from a subset of women who had died and for whom we had data from at least three assessments. Mean levels of mood, trauma symptoms, depression symptoms, well-being, and pain over three time points were examined: at baseline (T1), the second-to-last assessment before death (T2), and the last assessment before death (T3).', 'Results indicate that while psychological distress remained relatively constant or declined from T1 to T2, means on all measures significantly changed in the hypothesized direction from T2 to T3. Neither self-reported pain, nor the passage of time, appeared to account for these changes. Additionally, participation in group psychotherapy did not have a significant impact on this change in distress proximal to death.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write some highlights for the following article: If you were to take one line of dialogue in a film of 2013 to represent the year's mood, it would be from Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northup in \\"12 Years a Slave.\\" The abducted freeman shackled into bondage is plainspoken and eloquent: \\"I don't want to survive, I want to live!\\" \\"American Hustle\\" may be the title of David O. Russell's satire of con artists (Christian Bale and Amy Adams) aiding federal agents to carry out the Abscam sting, but it's also a dominant theme in American films of 2013. If you think hustle in its various meanings -- the swindler and the determined -- then just about every character-driven film did the hustle. Occupying the amoral lowlands, there is Leonardo DiCaprio as Jordan Belfort in \\"The Wolf of Wall Street\\" and the title figure in \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" living large - the mansions! the boats! the planes! -- by defrauding the little people. There is Alec Baldwin as the Bernard Madoff-like ex of husband-hunter Cate Blanchett in \\"Blue Jasmine,\\" both of them delusionary in the belief that they are entitled to other people's money. And there is Bale in \\"American Hustle,\\" who rationalizes, \\"People believe what they want to believe,\\" indicting the suckers for their faith in his cons. Up on the moral high ground, there is Ejiofor in \\"12 Years a Slave,\\" caught in a double bind. If, as an intellectual and a freeman, he defends himself against racism, he will be hung; if he does not, he suffers the humiliations of slavery. Chadwick Boseman as ballplayer Jackie Robinson in \\"42,\\" likewise is doubly-bound: advised to repress his righteous anger at racists or he will be brutalized and won't be able to play in the big leagues. In \\"The Butler,\\" Forest Whitaker, who wears one face as a White House domestic and another as a family man, ultimately reconciles his two faces. Then there is a clutch of films that collectively say forget about living, survival is enough. Filmmakers purveyed the human hustle in stories of those facing near death challenges and variously hanging onto life by a thread, a fraying rope, a stranded lifeboat, safety tether or not. Think of Robert Redford fighting for his life in \\"All is Lost,\\" Sandra Bullock clinging to tether in \\"Gravity,\\" Jaden Smith depending on intelligence from his wrist radio in \\"After Earth\\" and Tom Hanks facing death in a lifeboat in \\"Captain Phillips.\\" Also tested in a life-and-death narrative was Jennifer Lawrence in the Survivor-tinged \\"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.\\" Out of breath? Take a good, deep one. We haven't even begun to discuss the year's end-of-the-world movies. The apocalypse was nigh -- not only in action movies like \\"Pacific Rim\\" and \\"Oblivion\\" but in comedies like \\"This is the End\\" and \\"The World's End.\\" On screen the U.S. and British capitals were under terrorist attack in what seemed like an infinite loop of destruction: \\"Olympus Has Fallen,\\" \\"White House Down,\\" \\"G.I. Joe: Retaliation,\\" \\"Star Trek: Into Darkness,\\" \\"Thor: The Dark World.\\" Los Angeles and New York also endured attacks and were defended respectively by the mettle of Robert Downey in \\"Iron Man 3\\" and Henry Cavill in \\"Man of Steel.\\" What does it all mean? We don't need a professional to detect the pervasive anxiety in these Darwinian narratives of survival. Might this reflect Hollywood's guilt about its role as con artist fleecing the easily duped? Or do these films in part show Hollywood's unease about its own future in a world where moviegoers are just as likely to download or stream a movie than buy a ticket for one? Perhaps this, as much as the real-life economy, explains why another theme of 2013 films is economic anxiety. It is symbolized in \\"Elysium\\" by an underclass living on a polluted and overpopulated Earth and the 1 percent living in the pristine atmosphere above, with controlled climate and top-flight health care. Job insecurity reverberated through a broad swath of the year's movies. Consider the Harlem inspirational \\"Black Nativity\\" and the '60s-era \\"Inside Llewyn Davis,\\" where the protagonists have trouble making the rent. Consider the Brooklyn hipsters in \\"Frances Ha\\" to the Oakland underclass in \\"Fruitvale Station\\" where protagonists sought work. Even straight-out comedies like \\"We're the Millers,\\" in which a drug dealer hires underemployed individuals to pose as his family in order to make it easier to smuggle marijuana over the border, is peripherally about fewer legitimate jobs than those looking for them. It wasn't all about angst, though, even if the laughter at the multiplex was rueful. \\"Before Midnight\\" and \\"The Best Man Holiday,\\" two superb sequels, are comic looks at relationships and fidelity. One is sparked by the performances of Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke, the other by an ensemble including Morris Chestnut, Taye Diggs, Sanaa Lathan and Nia Long. The most moving relationship film of 2013 is \\"Her,\\" Spike Jonze's wistful story of a lovesick writer (Joaquin Phoenix) who falls in love with his operating system (voice of Scarlett Johansson), and finds the chasm between human and artificial intelligence is as wide as that between Mars and Venus. Another slice of dialogue representative of movie romances comes from Julie Delpy, exasperated with life partner Ethan Hawke in \\"Before Midnight:\\" \\"Sometimes, I think I'm breathing oxygen and you're breathing helium.\\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Carrie Rickey.","completion":"In 2013, Hollywood released an abundance of movies featuring themes of economic anxiety, survival, and moral dilemmas. These films were not limited to the usual genres, either, incorporating comedies and socio-political dramas as well. Some notable examples include \\"12 Years a Slave,\\" \\"American Hustle,\\" \\"The Wolf of Wall Street,\\" \\"Blue Jasmine,\\" and \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" In each, characters struggled with hustling and surviving rather than truly living. This analysis also highlights other films and their themes, like \\"Elysium\\" and its portrayal of wealth inequality, or the job insecurity shown in \\"Black Nativity\\" and \\"Inside Llewyn Davis.\\" Furthermore, it mentions life-and-death films like \\"Gravity,\\" \\"All is Lost,\\" and \\"Captain Phillips\\" that center on human perseverance in times of extreme physical or moral challenges. 2013 was also the year of apocalyptic movies that touched on pervasive anxiety and collective survival like \\"This is the End,\\" \\"The World's End,\\" and \\"Oblivion.\\" Surprisingly, relationship-based comedies such as \\"Before Midnight\\" and \\"The Best Man Holiday\\" also tackled themes of fidelity and self-imposed limits. Overall, the year in cinema reflected broader societal concerns related to economic stability, moral struggles, and the idea of mere survival rather than embracing life fully."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The 7.7 million day visitors and 5.5 million who made overnight stays on the Norfolk coast in 1999 are estimated to have spent £122 million, and secured the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs in that area. A 2005 survey at six North Norfolk coastal sites, including Blakeney, Cley and Morston found that 39 per cent of visitors gave birdwatching as the main purpose of their visit. The villages nearest to the Point, Blakeney and Cley, had the highest per capita spend per visitor of those surveyed, and Cley was one of the two sites with the highest proportion of pre-planned visits. The equivalent of 52 full-time jobs in the Cley and Blakeney area are estimated to result from the £2.45 million spent locally by the visiting public. In addition to birdwatching and boat trips to see the seals, sailing and walking are the other significant tourist activities in the area.The large number of visitors at coastal sites sometimes has negative effects. Wildlife may be disturbed, a frequent difficulty for species that breed in exposed areas such as ringed plovers and little terns, and also for wintering geese. During the breeding season, the main breeding areas for terns and seals are fenced off and signposted. Plants can be trampled, which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand dunes and vegetated shingle. A boardwalk made from recycled plastic crosses the large sand dunes near the end of the Point, which helps to reduce erosion. It was installed in 2009 at a cost of £35,000 to replace its much less durable wooden predecessor. Dogs are not allowed from April to mid-August because of the risk to ground-nesting birds, and must be on a lead or closely controlled at other times.The Norfolk Coast Partnership, a grouping of conservation and environmental bodies, divide the coast and its hinterland into three zones for tourism development purposes.

Solve -7*m + 5*m + 8 = 0 for m.","completion":"To solve the given equation -7*m + 5*m + 8 = 0 for m, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the terms with the variable m. -7*m and +5*m are the terms with the variable m. Combine them by adding them together: (-7*m) + (5*m) = -2*m Now the equation becomes: -2*m + 8 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable m. To do this, we want to isolate m on one side of the equation and numbers on the other side. To achieve this, subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: -2*m + 8 - 8 = 0 - 8 Which simplifies to: -2*m = -8 Step 3: Solve for m. Now, we need to get m by itself by dividing both sides by the coefficient of m, which is -2: (-2*m) / (-2) = (-8) / (-2) This simplifies to: m = 4 So, the solution for the equation -7*m + 5*m + 8 = 0 is m = 4."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

India decided to use fossil fuels to produce their electricity, and Nepal decided to go renewable and use only hydro power to produce their electricity. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which country released more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere? Hint: When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change. A:","completion":"A: India Step 1: Identify the energy sources used by each country From the given paragraph, we see that: - India uses fossil fuels to produce electricity - Nepal uses hydro power to produce electricity Step 2: Determine the greenhouse gas emissions of each energy source Fossil fuels release more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere when burned compared to renewable hydroelectric power, which does not involve burning fuel and thereby does not release CO2 in the process. Step 3: Compare the greenhouse gas emissions in each country Since India is using fossil fuels for electricity production and Nepal is using hydro power, it is evident that India releases more greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide) emissions than Nepal.

The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Mayoral Hopeful, an Earmark Critic, Has His Own In an interview, Mr. Weiner defended his use of earmarks, saying that he would continue seeking such funds for his constituents as long as the practice continued in Congress. He said that while he would support abolishing Congressional earmarks if the right legislation were proposed, he believed the City Council system of earmarking was more urgently in need of fixing. “I am not going to lay down arms,” he said, referring to his plan to continue seeking earmarks in Congress. “I am going to fight for New York City.” Mr. Weiner took a stand against earmarks in response to revelations that New York City Council members were steering millions of dollars in discretionary spending to phantom organizations and to groups connected with their relatives and associates. He has won praise for that position, which puts him at odds with Ms. Quinn, the Council speaker, who is potentially one of his rivals in the 2009 mayoral contest. He criticized a proposal Ms. Quinn issued requiring all nonprofit groups receiving earmarks over a certain amount to be screened by the Mayor’s Office of Contract Services before the money is issued. Asked about the Quinn proposal during a television interview on WNBC/Channel 4’s News Forum on May 11, he said it did not go far enough. “I think we’re at the point that we should just say, ‘Look. The citizens of New York have lost so much confidence in this process that we should do away with these earmarks that are distributed this way,’ ” he said. “We should figure out a way to provide funding of services to those organizations through some other mechanism.” Ms. Quinn’s office declined to comment. Mr. Weiner’s own use of earmarks shows that the debate over such spending is not as cut and dried as he suggests. Critics have said that Congressional earmarks are awarded without competitive bidding and public hearings. Still, they pay for projects that are popular with lawmakers and often helpful to constituents. Through the years, Mr. Weiner has spread money around New York for a variety of projects of his choosing, from 5.75 million to remove graffiti to 15 million for ferry service from the Rockaways to Manhattan. Mr. Weiner’s latest projects were included in a sea of similar appropriations in the federal budget for fiscal year 2008, which ends Sept. 30. The budget contained 11,780 Congressional earmarks worth 18.3 billion, according to an analysis by Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Congressional watchdog group. Many of the 15 earmarks that Mr. Weiner secured in that budget included projects similar to those that council members have financed. There is, for example, nearly 170,000 he got to help construct rooftop performance space at the Brooklyn Children’s Museum and nearly 200,000 to finance a center for new immigrants at Kingsborough Community College. Mr. Weiner also directed money to projects and programs run by a variety of Jewish groups, whose members make up part of his political base. He secured nearly 100,000 for a program at the Sephardic Community Center in Brooklyn that seeks to help “at-risk immigrant youth successfully acculturate” into American society; nearly 50,000 for an after-school program at the Prospect Park Yeshiva in Brooklyn; and 282,000 for a counseling program for small business at the Sephardic Angel Fund in Brooklyn. Perhaps more significant, he obtained 450,000 for the Fresh Start Program for Agudath Israel, a major Orthodox Jewish organization. The program is intended to provide job training and counseling to women who are recovering addicts or victims of domestic violence. Hank Sheinkopf, a longtime Democratic consultant in New York, said that having the support of the leaders of Agudath Israel could prove important in a citywide election, given that they often instruct members to get behind a particular candidate. “Rabbinical approval of certain candidates can help deliver blocs of votes,” he said. “Having Agudath Israel as a friend in New York City politics is a very good thing.” Mr. Weiner, who has been in Congress for five terms, said that the group had never raised money for him or endorsed him for public office. But he did note that he had a close working relationship with its leaders. “They are helpful when I need to communicate with their members,” he said, adding that he consults with the group’s leaders when considering legislation that might affect their community. The project sponsored by Mr. Weiner that drew criticism was a 4.8 million item slipped into a military spending bill to make improvements at the Gateway National Recreation Area’s Ryan Visitor Center in Brooklyn. Citizens Against Government Waste placed it in its annual Pig Book. Thomas A. Schatz, the group’s president, said the project had no business being in a military spending bill. “I grew up on Long Island, and I know what the Gateway National Recreation Area looks like,” he said. “And it is not on the front line of the defense of the United States.” If Mr. Weiner is concerned about such criticism, it doesn’t show. Last year, he appeared at a news conference at the park to highlight his having secured about 66 million overall to make improvements at the center. Talking to reporters, he described the park as “one of New York City’s best-kept secrets.” He also confided that when he seeks financing for it, he often has to explain to other representatives that it is a national park. “Sometimes people say, ‘Huh, I haven’t heard of that one,’ ” said Mr. Weiner, according to a story published in The Wave, a local newspaper in the Rockaways. An article on Saturday about Representative Anthony D. Weiner’s use of earmarks to finance pet projects in his district  a practice for which he has criticized the New York City Council  misidentified the borough that includes the Ryan Visitor Center of the Gateway National Recreation Area, for which Mr. Weiner secured about 66 million in improvements. The center is in Brooklyn, not Queens. A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Weiner Objects to Earmarks, but Has His Own.

Weiner. Weiner had criticized the New York City Council for their use of earmarks, describing the practice as an issue that needs to be dealt with urgently. However, Weiner himself has secured funding for a variety of projects in his district through earmarks, sparking debate over the use of such spending. Critics argue that Congressional earmarks are awarded without competitive bidding and public hearings, but they often help fund projects that are beneficial to constituents. Weiner has defended his use of earmarks, stating he will continue to fight for funding for his constituents as long as the practice continues in Congress."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Dracula Movie plot: In Whitby, England in 1913, Count Dracula (Frank Langella) arrives from Transylvania via the ship Demeter one stormy night. A sickly Mina Van Helsing (Jan Francis), who is visiting her friend Lucy Seward (Kate Nelligan), discovers Dracula's body after his ship has run aground. The Count visits Mina and her friends at the household of Lucy's father, Dr. Jack Seward (Donald Pleasence), whose clifftop mansion also serves as the local asylum. At dinner, he proves to be a charming guest and leaves a strong impression on the hosts, Lucy especially. Less charmed by this handsome Romanian count is Jonathan Harker (Trevor Eve), Lucy's fiancÃ©. Later that night, while Lucy and Jonathan are having a secret rendezvous, Dracula reveals his true nature as he descends upon Mina to drink her blood. The following morning, Lucy finds Mina awake in bed, struggling for breath. Powerless, she watches her friend die, only to find wounds on her throat. Lucy blames herself for Mina's death, as she had left her alone. At a loss for the cause of death, Dr. Seward calls for Mina's father, Professor Abraham van Helsing (Laurence Olivier). Van Helsing suspects what might have killed his daughter: a vampire. Moreover, he begins to worry about what fate his seemingly dead daughter may now have. Seward and van Helsing investigate their suspicions and discover a roughly clawed opening within Mina's coffin which leads to the local mines. It is there that they encounter the ghastly form of an undead Mina, and it is up to a distraught van Helsing to destroy what remains of his own daughter. Lucy meanwhile has been summoned to Carfax Abbey, Dracula's new home, and soon she reveals herself to be in love with this foreign prince and openly offers herself to him as his bride. After a surreal \\"Wedding Night\\" sequence (employing lasers and shot by famed James Bond title sequence designer, Maurice Binder), Lucy, like Mina before her, is now infected by Dracula's blood.

The term also refers to a concept close to melodic mode in Indian classical music. \\"Raga\\" is a remarkable and central feature of classical Indian music tradition, but has no direct translation to concepts in the classical European music tradition. Each \\"raga\\" is an array of melodic structures with musical motifs, considered in the Indian tradition to have the ability to \\"color the mind\\" and affect the emotions of the audience. - Pebbles is an extensive series of compilation albums in both LP and CD formats that have been issued on several record labels , though mostly by AIP . Together with the companion Highs in the Mid-Sixties series , the Pebbles series made available over 800 obscure , mostly American \`\` Original Punk Rock '' songs recorded in the mid- 1960s -- primarily known today as the garage rock and psychedelic rock genres -- that were previously known only to a handful of collectors . In 2007 , the release of the Pebbles , Volume 11 : Northern California CD marked the final album in the Pebbles series ( Curiously , Vol. 12 had been issued in 1999 ) . The following year , Bomp ! marked the 30th anniversary of the original Pebbles album with a spartan , limited - edition , clear - vinyl reissue complete with the original pink cover insert . The Pebbles series played a significant role in the emergence of a \`\` canon '' of garage - rock music and artists in the late 1970s and early 1980s . In his review of the Pebbles series for Allmusic , Richie Unterberger comments : \`\` Though 1972 's Nuggets compilation reawakened listeners to the sounds of mid- ' 60s garage rock , it only focused on the tip of the iceberg . Behind those forgotten hits and semi-hits lurked hundreds , if not thousands , of regional hits and flops from the same era , most even rawer and cruder ... . More than any other factor , these compilations ( in the Pebbles series ) were responsible for the resurgence of interest in garage rock , which remains high among collectors to this day . '' Including the Highs in the Mid-Sixties series , Best of Pebbles series , Essential Pebbles series , Planetary Pebbles series , and two box sets , more than 60 compilation albums have been released using the Pebbles name . Following on the heels of the success of the Pebbles series , dozens of other series of garage rock compilation albums have been started , with numerous albums being released each year for several decades . - AIP Records is a record label that was started by Greg Shaw's Bomp! Records, being launched in 1983 to continue the Pebbles series. The abbreviation AIP stands for \\"Archive International Productions\\". The first 10 volumes in the Pebbles series had been released by BFD Records of Kookaburra, Australia (most likely a fictitious label name to avoid copyright infringement lawsuits) in 1979-1980 and have been kept in print by AIP for many years. Including those in the companion Highs in the Mid-Sixties series which concentrated on American regional music scenes there are over 50 LPs covering some 800 obscure, mostly American \\"Original Punk Rock\\" songs recorded in the mid-1960s primarily known today as the garage rock and psychedelic rock genres that were previously known only to a handful of collectors. - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s. - A psychedelic drug is a drug whose primary action is to alter cognition and perception, typically by agonising serotonin receptors. - Garage rock (shortened as \\"garage\\"; sometimes '60s punk\\" or \\"garage punk\\") is a raw and energetic style of rock and roll that flourished in the mid-1960s, most notably in the United States and Canada. The term derives from the perception that groups were often made up of young amateurs who rehearsed in the family garage, although many were professional. The phrase \\"garage band\\" is often used to refer to musical acts in this genre. - A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos. Often, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; conducts talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term \\"record label\\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information. - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources. - Garage punk is a rock subgenre that evokes characteristics identified with punk rock. Its progenitors are with the North American garage rock bands in the early 1960s. The term is sometimes used interchangeably with \\"garage rock\\" or \\"garage revival\\". Another movement that is widely categorized as \\"garage punk\\" drew heavily from stripped-down 1970s punk rock and Detroit proto-punk, taking shape in the indie rock underground between the late 1980s and early 1990s. - The Highs in the Mid-Sixties series is a group of 23 compilation albums of garage rock and psychedelic rock recordings that were issued by AIP Records in the mid-1980s. This series is a companion to the \\"Pebbles\\" series of similar music; the title is technically preceded by \\"Pebbles Presents:\\". The title sounds like it might have come from a weather report, although \\"Highs\\" intends to mean \\"the best\\" (and is also an apparent drug reference), while the recordings on these albums were originally released in the mid-1960s. - Copyright is a legal right created by the law of a country that grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights for its use and distribution. This is usually only for a limited time. The exclusive rights are not absolute but limited by limitations and exceptions to copyright law, including fair use. A major limitation on copyright is that copyright protects only the original expression of ideas, and not the underlying ideas themselves. - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - Psychedelic rock is a style of rock music that is inspired or influenced by psychedelic culture and attempts to replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD. It may use novelty recording techniques, electronic instruments or effects, and sometimes draws on sources such as the ragas and drones of Indian music.

The seven years he spent there were later described, in a Memoir published in 1882 by the Architectural Association, as \\"perhaps the happiest years of his life\\". The family initially lived in a semi-detached house called Bron Haul near Betws-y-Coed, on what is now the A5 road. Two years later he bought a larger property called Coed-y-Celyn on the east bank of the River Lledr, about a mile south of Betws-y-Coed.

Set a reasonable goal. Dress to exercise. Buy running shoes.","completion":"Title: Preparing for a Successful and Enjoyable Running Experience Introduction: Running is an excellent form of exercise that benefits both your physical and mental well-being. It helps improve cardiovascular health, build endurance, strengthen muscles, and even relieve stress. However, to get started on the right foot and make the most of your running experience, there are several preparations you must take. This article aims to provide insights into how you can effectively hydrate, eat, set goals, and dress appropriately to make your running journey enjoyable, safe, and successful. 1. Hydrate throughout the day Hydration is a critical aspect of any form of exercise, particularly for running. Ensuring adequate water intake before your run helps prevent dehydration, which can lead to fatigue, muscle cramps, and heat exhaustion. Drinking water regularly throughout the day is essential to keep your body functioning optimally. Aim to drink at least 8 to 10 glasses of water per day and increase this amount on warmer days or when you plan to engage in more intense workouts. Two to three hours before your run, consume 500-600 ml of water to ensure that you are properly hydrated. 2. Eat a simple meal 2-3 hours before running Consuming a meal before running provides your body with the energy it needs to perform your best. However, timing and meal composition are crucial. Eating too close to your run can cause gastrointestinal distress and cramping, while eating too far in advance can leave you feeling sluggish. The ideal pre-run meal should be consumed 2-3 hours before your running session and consist of easily digestible carbohydrates, moderate protein, and low fat. Good pre-run meal options include a peanut butter and banana sandwich on whole-grain bread, oatmeal with fresh fruits and nuts, or a smoothie with a mix of fruits, yogurt, and a little honey. These meal suggestions offer the right combination of nutrients to fuel your body and sustain your energy levels during your run. 3. Set a reasonable goal Setting realistic and specific goals is an important step in keeping you motivated and committed to your running routine. Your goals should be achievable and tailored to your experience and fitness level. For beginners, a goal might be to run consistently for 20 minutes without stopping. Intermediate runners may aim to complete a specific distance, such as a 5k or 10k, while advanced runners might focus on improving their personal best times. Remember to be flexible with your goals and continuously reassess them as your fitness level and running experience improve. Setting manageable goals helps you gradually build on your achievements and enjoy the process of reaching those milestones. 4. Dress to exercise Dressing appropriately for your run is crucial for your comfort, safety, and running performance. Your attire should be made of moisture-wicking fabric that keeps you dry and comfortable as you sweat. Avoid cotton, which tends to become heavy and damp when it absorbs moisture. Wear layers during colder weather, starting with a moisture-wicking base layer, followed by an insulating layer, and topping it off with a windproof and water-resistant outer layer. During warmer months, opt for lightweight, breathable clothing to help you stay cool and promote airflow. Consider investing in high-quality running socks that prevent blisters and provide appropriate cushioning, as well as gear such as sunglasses, a hat, or sunscreen to protect you from harmful UV rays. 5. Buy running shoes One of the most important investments you'll make in your running journey is a good pair of running shoes. The right shoes provide the necessary support, cushioning, and stability to keep your feet, legs, and entire body comfortable and injury-free. Visit a specialty running store where knowledgeable staff can help you find the perfect pair. Be prepared to invest some time trying on different shoes to ensure you find the best fit for your foot type, gait, and running style.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The sunny weather will indirectly impact a step of the process in a larger hive. Allow me to explain further. Bees are highly dependent on favorable weather conditions for their various activities - foraging, reproduction, and overall hive maintenance. Sunny weather is generally suitable for bees to go out during the day and gather food. In a larger hive, there are more bees, and therefore, more needs to be met in terms of food and hive maintenance. A sunny day will facilitate not only their foraging activities but also the other processes that are involved in maintaining the hive, such as making wax, producing honey, and using propolis as a binding agent. However, the sunny weather is not directly impacting a specific step of the process, as it merely creates favorable conditions for the bees to carry out their tasks efficiently. Instead, it indirectly affects their overall productivity, allowing the bee colony to thrive and maintaining the larger hive in a healthy condition. To sum up, the sunny weather is a supposed perturbation that indirectly impacts a step of the process in a larger bee hive. The favorable conditions allow bees to efficiently execute their tasks, ultimately benefiting the hive's wellbeing and maintenance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Given the question: SEOUL — Arms control experts estimate that the dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program could take a decade to complete, and cost 20 billion, if a nuclear agreement is reached between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when they meet in Singapore on June 12. “The hard work has not yet begun, and it is gong to take sustained energy on the part of the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and North Korea. It’s going to be a multiyear long process,” said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington. President Trump has said he expects a \\"very positive result\\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North’s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \\"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\\" This position aligns closer to the Kim government’s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president’s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered. North Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years. With such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost 20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy.

Answer the following question: Given the background: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. and the situation: The Malegese Ocean is primarily connected to one river. This river is next to Hilda's farm that she has lived on for decades. Ever since she was a child, she was taught that it's important to dump excess fertilizer into the river. So, that's what she does whenever she has leftover fertilizer she isn't going to use. The Dundrin Ocean is connected to many rivers. However, these rivers are located primarily in uninhabited and natural areas of the world. There is one farm near the Dundrin, though, which is owned by Luke. Luke never disposes of any of his garbage in the ocean or rivers near his farm, and he chooses instead to store excess fertilizer for the future or properly dispose of his trash. Answer the following question: Who is causing more marine pollution? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given background and situation, it can be concluded that Hilda is causing more marine pollution compared to Luke. To justify this answer, let's analyze the situations step by step: 1. Marine pollution is caused mainly by the entry of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles, with rivers as the major contributors. 2. Agriculture fertilizer chemicals, livestock waste, and human waste have been identified as significant factors leading to marine pollution. 3. Excess oxygen-depleting chemicals from these pollutants lead to hypoxia and dead zones in the ocean. 4. Marine debris or litter is another form of pollution, and it accumulates in gyres and coastlines. Now let's compare Hilda and Luke's farming practices: 1. Hilda's farm is next to the only river that feeds into the Malegese Ocean. She has been dumping excess fertilizer into the river for decades. 2. Pollution from Hilda's farm directly impacts the marine ecosystem, contributing to hypoxia and the creation of dead zones in the Malegese Ocean. 3. Luke's farm is near the Dundrin Ocean, which is connected to many rivers primarily in uninhabited and natural areas. 4. Luke stores excess fertilizers for future use and properly disposes of his trash, preventing any contribution to marine pollution from his farming practices. Given this information, it is evident that Hilda's longstanding practice of dumping excess fertilizer into the river connected to the Malegese Ocean is causing more marine pollution than Luke, who responsibly stores and disposes of excess farm materials and waste."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Fashion is a term commonly used to describe a style of clothing worn by most people of a country. A fashion usually keeps popular for 1-3 years and then is replaced by another fashion.

On this phenomenon , different people have different opinions. It is held that one should follow the fashion so as not to be looked down or seem strange. But it is also held that one should have his or her own judgement . Those who hold the first opinion think that society is progessing and one should get used to the changes. In their opinions, if everyone always follows the old fashion, there won't be any change and naturally there won't be much progress.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the name of the painting that the auction house catalogue stated that it had been owned by William Ride, former director of the Western Australian Museum? ? Further recognition came with the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung at the same time included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work ... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity ... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme ... The details of the picture disclose untiring care. By the time Summer Breezes was on display, Fuller had returned to Australia, not to her previous home in Melbourne but to Perth in Western Australia, where she joined her sister, Amy Fuller, who was a singer. Although only in her mid-thirties, Fuller's background made her \\"one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time\\". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician James George Lee Steere, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections of those who had known him. It was acquired by the gallery whose board he chaired. She also took on students, including French-Australian artist Kathleen O'Connor. Fuller's paintings from this period included A Golden Hour, described by the National Gallery of Australia as \\"a masterpiece ... giving us a gentle insight into the people, places and times that make up our history\\". The painting, an oil on canvas 109 cm (43 in) high and 135 cm (53 in) wide, portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea.

Factors that might lead to a yes or no answer could include your personal interests, aptitude for the sciences, dedication to years of rigorous study, financial considerations, and willingness to work long hours in a high-stress environment. Additionally, becoming a doctor requires a strong passion for helping others, excellent communication skills, and the ability to stay calm under pressure. Before choosing to become a doctor, you should carefully evaluate whether you possess these qualities and if you will be willing to commit to years of training and hard work, as well as the emotional and physical challenges that may come along with it. 2. \\"Why should I be a doctor?\\" This question is seeking reasons or justification for becoming a doctor. The answer to this question might include the various benefits and rewards associated with being a physician, such as a sense of fulfillment from helping others, the opportunity to make a tangible difference in people's lives, high earning potential, job security, and the ability to work in a respected profession. Other reasons individuals might choose to become doctors include personal experiences with illness or the healthcare system, a desire to contribute to scientific research, or an interest in specific medical fields or specialties.

The conceptual view provides a level of indirection between internal and external. On one hand it provides a common view of the database, independent of different external view structures, and on the other hand it abstracts away details of how the data are stored or managed (internal level). In principle every level, and even every external view, can be presented by a different data model. In practice usually a given DBMS uses the same data model for both the external and the conceptual levels (e.g., relational model). The internal level, which is hidden inside the DBMS and depends on its implementation, requires a different level of detail and uses its own types of data structure types. What does the conceptual view offer?","completion":"The conceptual view offers a number of benefits for database management systems (DBMS) by acting as an intermediary between the internal and external levels. These benefits include: 1. Abstraction: The conceptual view provides a high-level, abstract representation of the data stored in the database, hiding the complexities of the internal level and the details of data storage and management. This makes it easier for users and developers to understand and manipulate the data, without worrying about the underlying implementation specifics. 2. Consistency: By offering a common view of the database, the conceptual view ensures that all external views and levels are consistent with each other. This means that the various users and applications accessing the database will have a uniform and coherent understanding of the data, making it more efficient to use and minimizing potential confusion or miscommunication. 3. Flexibility: The conceptual view enables the use of different data models for various levels or external views of the database. This provides flexibility in the design and implementation of the database, as well as allowing for the possibility of using different, specialized models for specific tasks or user needs. 4. Independence: The conceptual view separates the external and internal levels of the DBMS, ensuring that changes in one level do not directly impact the other. This promotes modularity, making it simpler to modify or upgrade individual elements of the system without affecting the entire database. For example, a change in the internal level, such as the introduction of a new data storage technique, would not necessitate changes in the external views. 5. Simplification: By utilizing the same data model for both the external and conceptual levels (e.g., the relational model), the conceptual view simplifies the process of designing, implementing, and managing the database. This can lead to improved efficiency, reliability, and maintainability of the DBMS. In summary, the conceptual view offers abstraction, consistency, flexibility, independence, and simplification, making it an essential component in the effective management of database systems. It serves to enhance overall understanding of the data, streamline system design and implementation, and facilitate efficient communication and data manipulation among users and applications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Thorn county used fossil fuels for their energy needs, while Plant county used nuclear power. They both polluted the environment in different ways. Which county contributed less to acid rain formation? Hint: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up. Answer:","completion":"Plant County, which used nuclear power for their energy needs, contributed less to acid rain formation as compared to Thorn County that relied on fossil fuels. The burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, releases sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the atmosphere. These gases react with water vapor, oxygen, and other substances to form sulfuric and nitric acids, which eventually fall back to the Earth's surface in the form of acid rain. Nuclear power, on the other hand, does not produce these harmful air pollutants. The process of nuclear fission generates heat and energy but does not directly emit SO2 or NOx. Hence, nuclear power plants contribute significantly less to the formation of acid rain than coal or other fossil fuel-based power plants. However, it is important to note that nuclear power comes with its own set of environmental challenges, such as the radioactive waste generated during the nuclear fission process, which requires safe and secure disposal to minimize risk to the environment and human health. But, in terms of contributing to acid rain, it is clear that Plant County with its nuclear power would be a lesser contributor compared to Thorn County with its reliance on fossil fuels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who explored much of the Rio Grande and parts of east Texas? , can you please find it? The French colonization of Texas began with the establishment of a fort in present-day southeastern Texas. It was established in 1685 near Arenosa Creek and Matagorda Bay by explorer Robert Cavelier de La Salle. He intended to found the colony at the mouth of the Mississippi River, but inaccurate maps and navigational errors caused his ships to anchor instead 400 miles (640 km) to the west, off the coast of Texas. The colony survived until 1688. The present-day town of Inez is near the fort's site. The colony faced numerous difficulties during its brief existence, including Native American raids, epidemics, and harsh conditions. From that base, La Salle led several expeditions to find the Mississippi River. These did not succeed, but La Salle did explore much of the Rio Grande and parts of east Texas. During one of his absences in 1686, the colony's last ship was wrecked, leaving the colonists unable to obtain resources from the French colonies of the Caribbean. As conditions deteriorated, La Salle realized the colony could survive only with help from the French settlements in Illinois Country to the north, along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. His last expedition ended along the Brazos River in early 1687, when La Salle and five of his men were murdered during a mutiny. Although a handful of men reached Illinois Country, help never made it to the fort. Most of the remaining members of the colony were killed during a Karankawa raid in late 1688, four children survived after being adopted as captives. Although the colony lasted only three years, it established France's claim to possession of the region that is now Texas. The United States later claimed, unsuccessfully, this region as part of the Louisiana Purchase because of the early French colony. Spain learned of La Salle's mission in 1686. Concerned that the French colony could threaten Spain's control over the Viceroyalty of New Spain and the unsettled southeastern region of North America, the Crown funded multiple expeditions to locate and eliminate...

I taught the kitten the way Pa taught me: I threw him into water where he could not stand, and I watched, ready to grab him if he went under. Tiger did not thrash desperately like me. He merely paddled urgently for the edge of the plastic pool with his head high and his thin legs churning. Little Bit said, \\"Dog paddle,\\" and we all laughed. \\"Tiger paddle,\\" I said, and we all laughed some more, even Jordy. That was probably when Ma noticed the kitten swimming lessons and stopped them. Our swimming lessons happened in two places. When Pa took us, we went to Hawkins Springs behind Mrs. DeLyons' Fountain of Youth Motor Hotel. When Ma took us, we drove to Mermaid Springs State Park, where we would sometimes meet Mr. Drake. I liked Mermaid Springs better because I felt safe there. Ma could not swim, so she never made me jump off a dock into deep water, and she always insisted that I wear an orange styrofoam cylinder on my back like a skindiver or spaceman. Ma usually sat on a towel on the grass near the beach, reading a magazine or a book while tanning her legs. Every now and then she would call to us not to go too far or not to splash each other. When she wore her one-piece red swimming suit, she would come in up to her waist, then lower herself to her shoulders, being careful not to get her hair wet. On the rarest occasions, she would wear a swimming cap and float on her back in the shallow water. Often she stayed in her shorts and shirt, adding sunglasses and removing shoes as her concession to summer and the beach. Question: Where did Pa take them for lessons?

Penney’s Ron Johnson must do now FORTUNE — When Ron Johnson announced his decision to leave Apple for the top position at J.C. Penney, shares for the department store chain shot up 17.5% in a day. Shareholders were eager to see how the genius behind Apple’s retail strategy would perform in a sector begging for innovation. Fast-forward to the present: Shares of JCP JCP plummeted 21% last week following the release of the store’s worse-than-expected fourth quarter results, and Apple’s aapl retail golden boy has yet to hit his stride. Through a series of drastic and decidedly ill-fitted pricing decisions — from eliminating coupons to halting beloved sales events — Johnson’s tenure so far illustrates the danger of relying on past successes as a compass for new endeavors. This dangerous pitfall is certainly not unique to Johnson. Consider Carol Bartz, who fell flat on her face as she tried to turn around Yahoo yhoo using the same fear-mongering tactics that had worked so well when she was CEO at Autodesk adsk . Executives facing new situations often employ the same strategies and tactics that proved successful in the past without questioning whether those strategies are appropriate for the new circumstances. I call this the “experience blind spot.” While this strategy can be particularly perilous for executives who move into a new role or company, this blind spot can also affect tenured executives who face unexpected crises, as we saw with Tony Hayward following the BP bp oil spill. How can today’s executives balance the market’s demand for agility and confidence while avoiding this pitfall? Today is not the same as yesterday Staid retailer J.C. Penney couldn’t be more different than Apple, which is known as much for its innovation and brand loyalty as for its steep product prices. JCP had a legacy customer base accustomed to waiting for special sales with hopes of finding a “steal.” When Johnson did away with those sales in favor of everyday low pricing, customers lost their motivation to shop there. By relying on his experience at Apple, Johnson overlooked the stark contrast between the two organizations and, as a result, he failed to recognize the desires of JCP’s customers. In approaching any new business situation, it’s important to carefully consider what is different this time around. This is exceptionally challenging for successful executives, because their minds immediately gravitate toward the similarities between the current situation and past wins. Yet to break out of the blind spot, executives must intentionally immerse themselves in the contrasts. Successful executives often delude themselves into thinking they are infallible. We saw this kind of behavior when Johnson declined to test his pricing overhaul for JCP prior to an all-store rollout. When a colleague suggested a limited store test of his new strategy, Johnson reportedly responded, “We didn’t test at Apple.” Avoiding the hubris trap requires executives to listen to the opinions of others. Executives are subject to many such sentiments, from shareholders, colleagues, and customers. Carefully considering the input of others — be it agreement or dissent — is critical to making a fully informed decision. It may not change the path an executive takes in the end, but it offers a beneficial speed bump that ensures that several options are considered. Amid pressures of an impending takeover by an angry founder, Best Buy bby CEO Hubert Joly spent his first week on the job as a salesman at the company’s Minnesota stores. His purpose? To learn the business from those working on the front lines, giving him a better understanding of the company’s current state and which strategies may work in his turnaround effort. While the jury is still out on whether Joly will be successful in his new role, he appears to have recognized the importance of focusing on what’s actually happening at his company today. As reports emerge that Johnson may have only six months left to patch up J.C. Penney, it is imperative that, in addition to putting past successes aside, he focus on what’s actually going on at his company right now. His strategy at JCP must be unlike anything he has done before; it must be grounded in the fact that JCP customers are not the same as Apple’s. Steven Snyder is the founder of consulting firm Snyder Leadership Group . He is the author of Leadership and the Art of Struggle (Berrett-Koehler, March 2013). Summary:","completion":"When Ron Johnson left Apple for the top position at J.C. Penney, shareholders were excited to see how he would perform in a sector in need of innovation.

Back when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.) Not all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren’t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don’t like needles. Or maybe they aren’t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer “stronger” versions, designed for older adults? I’m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic. But it’s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu. So I agree with the CDC’s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. In fact, I’m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I’m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza. This month, you’ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I’ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns. Here’s what I’ll cover: * The basics of influenza and vaccination against the flu * What to know about flu shots for older adults * What’s new and resources for the 2017-2018 flu... Question: What does the Centers for Disease Control probably believe. Options: A. not enough information B. They probably believe all adults should get the seasonal flu. C. They probably believe all adults should get a flu shot. D. They probably believe all adults should go to the hospital for the flu. === The correct answer is The answer to this question is:","completion":"C. They probably believe all adults should get a flu shot. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. This is because influenza affects a large number of Americans every year, causing numerous hospitalizations and deaths. Older adults are particularly at risk of getting dangerously ill from the flu, so vaccination is crucial for this age group. Moreover, getting vaccinated helps minimize the chance of spreading the flu to vulnerable populations. The CDC's recommendation applies to all adults, not just older individuals, to promote overall public health and reduce the impact of seasonal influenza."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Maybe it was because I was listening to the radio, maybe it was because I was already thinking about some projects at work, that I didn't spot the dark object on the road until I was too late. I ran over it and felt the back left tire pull, and then sink. I stopped and got out of the car. No mystery here---- my back left tyre was cut like a loaf of bread. Back 50 yards was a piece of sharp iron I had run over. I had never changed a tyre. I looked up the road. Not a car in either direction. The nearest service station was miles away. I threw up my hands. Then I remembered---- my cell phone! I powered it up before realizing, I didn't know who to call. Wouldn't you know it, I spotted a car coming from the opposite direction. The driver slowed as he approached. I guessed he could see I was in trouble. He stopped his car, got out and immediately saw the trouble. \\"Madam, would you like me to change that tyre for you?\\" he asked. The man couldn't have been more friendly. I was frightened out there and he put me completely at ease. \\"There,\\" he said, after putting on the spare, \\"you are all set to go.\\" \\"Good thing for me that you were driving this way,\\" I told him, as I climbed back into my car. \\"Funny you should say that,\\" he said. \\"Just like you, I was heading to work, but my job is in the opposite direction. I made a wrong turn at some point. I don't know what I was thinking.\\" Options: A it was rather dark then B she didn't use her headlights C there was much traffic D she was careless when driving Answer: D she was careless when driving Question: Answer:","completion":"Question: Why did the protagonist in the article not spot the dark object on the road until it was too late?

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article in one sentence. If the cut is actively bleeding, the first step is to stop that bleeding. Do this by applying pressure to the area, using a clean cloth or medical gauze. Do not remove the cloth until the bleeding has stopped completely. Facial injuries often bleed worse than other parts of the body, so the injury may look worse than it is. Crying makes bleeding worse, so try to remain calm and stop crying. If the cut is very deep, particularly if it is a puncture wound, you may need to go to the hospital immediately. Large gaping wounds or deep wounds will likely need stitches and professional cleaning. More superficial wounds can be cared for at home. Before you touch the open wound in any way, be sure to clean your hands thoroughly with soap and hot water. Wash both hands, between all of your fingers, and your wrists thoroughly, rinse with hot water, and dry with a clean towel. Hand-washing is a very important method of avoiding the chance of any infection in the wound. Clean the wound very gently with water and soap. Be sure to rinse the soap out of the wound completely with water. Be sure to remove any visible debris or dirt from the wounded area. Use cool or slightly warm water. Water that is too hot may cause the wound to start bleeding again. Be patient and slow with this step. If there is debris in the wound, try using a soft cloth to aid in removing it. If necessary, sterilize tweezers with rubbing alcohol and use them to aid in removing pieces of debris from the wound. Avoid using hydrogen peroxide or iodine, which can irritate or damage tissue. An antibiotic ointment such as Neosporin or Polysporin is the best option, but if none is available, simple petroleum jelly such as Vaseline can help. Expensive creams or treatments that claim to reduce scarring are generally not as helpful as they claim to be. Place a sterile bandage over the wounded area. This may be a bit cumbersome on your face, but it is important to keep the area free from potential infections. Place a bandage over the cut and use medical tape above and below the bandage to keep it in place. If the wound is still bleeding, try to secure the bandage tightly over the area. If it is not, a loose covering is adequate. A wide open cut needs to be pinched together to aid in healing and reduce scarring. Butterfly tape can help pull the skin together and enable it to heal. If this does not work, you will likely need stitches and you should go to the hospital. If the wound area is swollen (for example, if the cut is the result of a forceful blow), it is important to get the swelling in the area down as well. This can be done by putting ice on the area for 20 minutes at a time. Summary:","completion":"To treat a facial cut, stop the bleeding by applying pressure, clean the wound, apply antibiotic ointment, cover with a sterile bandage, and reduce swelling with ice if necessary."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I have been preparing our house for the market and in doing so, I have gotten rid of a lot of stuff! I am definitely the hoarder in our house. My husband could live out of two bags, use about five kitchen items each year, and doesn’t gather anything for future use or hang on to much for sentimental value. (Which probably means the items he has hung on to mean a whole lot more!) I am always tucking something away here or stashing materials there…all in preparation for “some day.” It’s also part of the teacher in me. Do you know many teachers that don’t have a ton of stuff or utilize every bit of storage available? But, over the last several years, I’ve been fairly good about going through things every six months and weeding out a little here and a little there. Today I’ll be sharing six simple ways to declutter your home and why you should! GIVE THINGS AWAY It’s nice to make money, but sometimes you come across something that you really think someone else could use and you don’t want to throw it away. If it’s the perfect fit for that person, they may adopt the item and add their own wear and tear! Anyone that’s had children knows that kids go through things so fast and it’s nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative. If the receiver decides they don’t want the item, let it be. They’ll either get rid of it on their own or decline the offer. If they choose the latter, maybe the rest of this list will help. PACK If you know you don’t want to purge an item from your house AND you know that you will use it in the future, but it’s not an everyday use item, pack it up. We have several containers of things in our garage that are full of items we use once or twice each year. I have added close to 100 boxes of things to simply declutter our home while it’s on the market. I took a look at everything and kept the essentials (well, maybe even more than the essentials), and packed up the rest.

The Agencies Confer When they learned a second plane had struck the World Trade Center, nearly everyone in the White House told us, they immediately knew it was not an accident. The Secret Service initiated a number of security enhancements around the White House complex. The officials who issued these orders did not know that there were additional hijacked aircraft, or that one such aircraft was en route to Washington. These measures were precautionary steps taken because of the strikes in New York. The FAA and White House Teleconferences. The FAA, the White House, and the Defense Department each initiated a multiagency teleconference before 9:30. Because none of these teleconferences-at least before 10:00- included the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department, none succeeded in meaningfully coordinating the military and FAA response to the hijackings. At about 9:20, security personnel at FAA headquarters set up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies, including the Defense Department. The NMCC officer who participated told us that the call was monitored only periodically because the information was sporadic, it was of little value, and there were other important tasks. The FAA manager of the teleconference also remembered that the military participated only briefly before the Pentagon was hit. Both individuals agreed that the teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of 9/11. Acting Deputy Administrator Belger was frustrated to learn later in the morning that the military had not been on the call. At the White House, the video teleconference was conducted from the Situation Room by Richard Clarke, a special assistant to the president long involved in counterterrorism. Logs indicate that it began at 9:25 and included the CIA; the FBI; the departments of State, Justice, and Defense; the FAA; and the White House shelter. The FAA and CIA joined at 9:40. The first topic addressed in the White House video teleconference-at about 9:40-was the physical security of the President, the White House, and federal agencies. Immediately thereafter it was reported that a plane had hit the Pentagon. We found no evidence that video teleconference participants had any prior information that American 77 had been hijacked and was heading directly toward Washington.

Question: Background: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Many people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common. Paragraph: Megan, a sophomore in college, is visiting her grandparents who live out of town. There is a party going on at her grandparents' house because her grandma, Emily, has just retired. There is cake and ice cream and people are talking about their jobs, and Emily is talking about all the good and bad memories she has from her work. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who will have slower reflexes? Answer:","completion":"Given the information provided in the paragraph, it can be inferred that Emily, Megan's grandmother who has recently retired, will have slower reflexes.

What colour do Chelsea Pensioners wear in the winter","completion":"Chelsea Pensioners, also known as In-Pensioners, are retired members of the British Army who are residents at the Royal Hospital Chelsea, a retirement home in London. The hospital was founded by King Charles II in 1682, and the first pensioners were admitted in 1692. Today, the Royal Hospital Chelsea continues to serve as a residence for around 300 veterans, providing them with a sense of camaraderie, comfort, and support in their later years. The iconic uniform worn by Chelsea Pensioners is commonly referred to as ‘Scarlet,’ named after its distinctive bright red colour. This vivid hue is not only associated with military tradition but also serves to promote the visibility and recognition of these distinguished veterans. The Scarlet uniform is a significant part of the pensioners’ identity, and they proudly wear it during various events, parades, and special occasions. The Scarlet uniform comprises a red tailcoat with navy blue facings, red or navy-blue trousers, a white shirt, a black stock (worn around the neck), a matching navy-blue waistcoat, and a black tricorn hat adorned with a brass badge. In addition, they wear a black leather belt with a brass buckle over their waistcoat. The Royal Hospital Chelsea crest is discreetly displayed on the uniform elements, such as buttons, to symbolise the pensioners' connection with the institution. During the winter months, Chelsea Pensioners require additional clothing to keep themselves warm against the chill. For this reason, they are provided with a blue-grey greatcoat, which is designed to help retain warmth and protect them from inclement weather. The blue-grey greatcoat is lined with red fabric and features brown buttons, which bear the Royal Hospital Chelsea emblem. Like the Scarlet uniform, the greatcoat displays the brass badge on the left-front side. The combination of the red Scarlet uniform and the blue-grey greatcoat ensures that Chelsea Pensioners remain visible and identifiable throughout the year, preserving their identity and the rich military heritage associated with the Royal Hospital Chelsea. In summary, during the winter months, Chelsea Pensioners continue to wear their bright red Scarlet uniforms but add a blue-grey greatcoat for warmth and protection against cold weather conditions. This uniform combination helps maintain their iconic appearance while offering a practical solution for staying comfortable during the colder seasons."},{"prompt":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Article: I have been teaching animal behavior at the Boulder County Prison in Colorado for 10 years. The course is one of the most popular in the prison. Prisoners have to earn the right to attend the course and they work hard to get in. One reason why the course is so popular is that many prisoners find it easier to connect with animals than with people, because animals don't judge them. They trust animals in ways they don't with humans. Yet, they hold a misunderstanding of how animals treat one another. Many admit that their own \\"animal behavior\\" is what got them into trouble in the first place. I teach that though there is competition and aggression in the animal kingdom, there is also a lot of cooperation and sympathy. Many of the students want to build healthy relationships, and they find that the class helps them. I use examples of the social behavior of group-living animals such as wolves as a model for developing and maintaining friendships among people who must work together for their own good and also for the good of the group. It's clear that science inspires the students here and it also gives them hope. I know some students have gone back into education after their being set free while others have gone to work for humane societies or contributed time and money to conservation organizations. One went on to receive a master's degree in nature writing. Science and humane education help the prisoners connect with values that they otherwise would not have done. It opens the door to understanding, trust, cooperation and hope. There's a large population of people to whom science could mean a lot, if only they could have access to it. The class helps me, too. I get as much out of it as the students and it has made me a better teacher. Question: The author's course is welcomed by the prisoners because _ .

Harry was born in the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London, on 15 September 1984 at 4:20 pm as the second child of Charles, Prince of Wales, heir apparent to Queen Elizabeth II, and Diana, Princess of Wales. He was baptised with the names Henry Charles Albert David, on 21 December 1984, at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie. His godparents are Prince Andrew (his paternal uncle); Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones (his paternal cousin once removed); Carolyn Bartholomew (nee Pride); Bryan Organ; Gerald Ward (former officer in the Household Cavalry); and Celia, Lady Vestey (nee Knight). On 17 March 2015, Kensington Palace announced that Prince Harry would leave the Armed Forces in June. Before then, he would spend four weeks throughout April and May at army barracks in Darwin, Perth and Sydney whilst seconded to the Australian Defence Force (ADF). After leaving the Army, while considering his future, he would return to work with the Ministry of Defence, supporting Case Officers in the Ministry of Defence's Recovery Capability Programme, working with both those who administer and receive physical and mental care within the London District area in a voluntary capacity. On 6 April 2015, Prince Harry reported for duty to Australia's Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin at the Royal Military College, Duntroon in Canberra, Australia. Harry flew to Darwin later that day to start his month-long secondment to the ADF's 1st Brigade. His visit included detachments to NORFORCE as well as to an aviation unit. While in Perth, he trained with Special Air Service Regiment (SASR), participating in the SASR selection course, including a fitness test and a physical training session with SASR selection candidates. He also joined SASR members in Perth for live-fire shooting exercises with numerous Special Forces weapons at a variety of ranges and completed an insertion training exercise using a rigid-hull inflatable boat. In Sydney, he undertook urban operations training with the 2nd Commando Regiment. Training activities included remotely detonating an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) and rappelling from a building. He also spent time flying over Sydney as co-pilot of an Army Black Hawk and participated in counter-terrorism training in Sydney Harbour with Royal Australian Navy clearance divers.

ROLAND NARROWED HIS EYES AND STARED UPWARD INTO THE DARKNESS, across the top of Mont Segur toward the Cathar fortress. Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart. The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it. From behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown. A shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars. The stone hit the parapet beside Roland, and the whole palisade shuddered. Roland caught a glimpse of the sergeant's horrified face and heard his scream as the boulder struck him, crushing him to the ground. By the end of this story, the sergeant is: A. not enough information B. Talking to women C. Dead D. Attacking the crusaders head-on The answer to this question is:","completion":"C.

Leicester had never won the Trophy in five final appearances, but they made the better start, racing into an 18-7 lead with nine points from guard Tyler Bernardini. Newcastle levelled the game at 26-26 in the middle of the second quarter only for Sullivan and Wright to give the Riders to a 42-30 half-time advantage, scoring six and five points each in the process. Leicester extended their advantage in the third quarter with threes from Wright and Jamall Anderson before the Eagles threatened a repeat of January's Cup final comeback with a flurry of threes from Fletcher, Charles Smith, Drew Lasker and Joe Chapman. The sides were level 72-72 with just under four minutes remaining, but in contrast to the Cup final, Leicester produced the killer touch. Baskets from Sullivan, Bernardini and Trevor Gruis started the 13-4 run that won the game and ended Newcastle's hopes of repeating last year's clean sweep of all four major titles. Leicester Riders coach Rob Paternostro: \\"Offensively we made better decisions, but before the game I said to the guys 'it's got to be defence that wins it for us' and I think our defence was better today. \\"We held them to 77 points today and that really gave us a chance to win - it was important.\\" Newcastle player-coach Fab Flournoy: \\"They had a good game plan coming in - I think it took us a while to get things going in the first half,\\" he said. \\"In the second half we settled into the game a little better but by that time they already had their rhythm and it was like trying to stop a freight train.\\"","completion":"In a thrilling game of basketball, Leicester Riders overpowered Newcastle Eagles, with Leicester's captain, Andrew Sullivan, leading the charge by scoring 22 points, earning him the title of most valuable player. His teammate, TrayVonn Wright, further tipped the scales in Leicester's favor by contributing another 20 points. Newcastle Eagles managed a fantastic comeback from a 17-point deficit in the third quarter to level the score, but couldn't outpace Leicester in the end, who proved to be the stronger finisher. On the Eagles' side, the highest scorer was Rahmon Fletcher, who notched up 18 points. Even though Eagles put up a spirited game, they were unable to repeat their last year's feat of sweeping all four major titles. The game was particularly notable for Leicester, who despite making it to the finals five times before, had never won the trophy. This victory was therefore a significant achievement. The real momentum for Leicester started building with an impressive 18-7 lead, against Newcastle, largely thanks to nine points scored by Leicester's guard, Tyler Bernardini. This trend continued with Sullivan and Wright broadening Leicester's lead to 42-30 by half-time by earning six and five points respectively -- undeterred by Newcastle's temporary equalizer at 26-26 in the second quarter. Leicester's dominance continued into the third quarter as Wright and Jamall Anderson augmented their lead. However, Newcastle showed grit and threatened a repeat of their spectacular comeback win from January's Cup final. This was made possible through a blitz of points earned by Fletcher, Charles Smith, Drew Lasker, and Joe Chapman. Yet, for all their spirited gameplay, Newcastle couldn't break past Leicester's stronghold. With just under four minutes left in the game, the teams were tied at 72 points each. Sullivan, Bernardini, and Trevor Gruis of Leicester seized the opportunity and launched a decisive 13-4 run which clinched the game, thus shooting down Newcastle's hopes of a title sweep. The victory was a test of their strategic aptitude along with skill. Leicester Riders' coach, Rob Paternostro, attributed this victory to better decision-making on an offensive front and a heightened focus on defense strategy. He remarked that holding Newcastle to 77 points made the difference. On the other hand, Newcastle's player-coach, Fab Flournoy, admired Leicester's intelligent game plan and implied that despite settling better into the game during the second half, the rhythm set by Leicester was much like an unstoppable freight train."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After a 70-yard kick return by Micah Hyde, the Packers were at the Steelers 31-yard line with 1:25 remaining. 3 plays later they reached the Steelers 1-yard line. However, a false start penalty both pushed them back 5 yards and ran 10 seconds off the clock, leaving the Packers with one play to get into the endzone. On the final play, Matt Flynn's pass for Jarrett Boykin was incomplete, and time expired. With the 38-31 loss, The Packers fell to 7-7-1, and their playoff hopes rested on the outcomes of the games played by the Detroit Lions (7-7) and the Chicago Bears (8-6). Detroit lost to the New York Giants 23-20 in OT and was eliminated from playoff contention. Meanwhile, Chicago had an opportunity to clinch the NFC North division with a win over the Eagles on Sunday Night Football, but the Eagles beat the Bears 54-11. This set up a win-and-in matchup between Green Bay (7-7-1) and Chicago (8-7) the following week. The winner would obtain the 4th seed in the NFC playoffs, and the loser would be eliminated from playoff contention.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question. Questions: What would describe the hands of someone who doesn't do manual labor? Options: - articulate - soft - sign language - graceful - cup water","completion":"The option that best describes the hands of someone who doesn't do manual labor is \\"soft.\\" This answer aligns with common sense, as those who don't perform manual labor regularly would typically have softer skin on their hands. Manual labor, which includes tasks like lifting, building, and using tools, can lead to callouses, rough skin, and potentially even scars. Engaging in these activities on a consistent basis can cause the skin on a person's hands to become tougher and more resilient to the physical demands placed upon them. On the other hand, individuals who don't partake in manual labor as part of their occupation or lifestyle are less likely to develop these callouses and rough skin. Instead, their hands would tend to remain softer as a result. A brief explanation for the other options: 1. Articulate: Although \\"articulate\\" can be used to describe someone who can effectively express their thoughts and ideas, it doesn't necessarily pertain to the physical appearance or feel of a person's hands. 2. Sign language: This option refers to a system of communication utilized primarily by individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. While those who use sign language might have more expressive hands, this option doesn't address the manual labor aspect of the question. 3. Graceful: \\"Graceful\\" refers to the sense of elegance or refinement in a person's movements or actions. Even though someone with graceful hands may have delicate and fluid movements, this term doesn't offer direct insight into whether the person does manual labor or not. 4. Cup water: This option seems unrelated to the question at hand. \\"Cup water\\" is an action that involves forming one's hands into a curved shape to hold water, but it doesn't give any information about the person's experience with manual labor."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The report lists in detail: The report says that evidence of sexual violence is difficult to document because of fear of retaliation, stigma, family pressure or trauma. It says that the plight of children, migrants, human rights defenders and journalists has been made worse by \\"the systemic failures of the justice system\\". The UN says the international criminal court should be able to carry out investigations and prosecutions, and protection programmes should be set up for victims and witnesses.

What is the answer for the question: What are the names of the missionaries of Britain that the sculptures in the north represent and are identifiable by their attributes?? from the following article ? The sculptures on the west front at Wells include standing figures, seated figures, half-length angels and narratives in high relief. Many of the figures are life-sized or larger, and together they constitute the finest display of medieval carving in England. The figures and many of the architectural details were painted in bright colours, and the colouring scheme has been deduced from flakes of paint still adhering to some surfaces. The sculptures occupy nine architectural zones stretching horizontally across the entire west front and around the sides and the eastern returns of the towers which extend beyond the aisles. The strongly projecting buttresses have tiers of niches which contain many of the largest figures. Other large figures, including that of Christ, occupy the gable. A single figure stands in one of two later niches high on the northern tower. In 1851 the archaeologist Charles Robert Cockerell published his analysis of the iconography, numbering the nine sculptural divisions from the lowest to the highest. He defined the theme as \\"a calendar for unlearned men\\" illustrating the doctrines and history of the Christian faith, its introduction to Britain and its protection by princes and bishops. He likens the arrangement and iconography to the Te Deum.According to Cockerell, the side of the façade that is to the south of the central door is the more sacred and the scheme is divided accordingly. The lowest range of niches each contained a standing figure, of which all but four figures on the west front, two on each side, have been destroyed. More have survived on the northern and eastern sides of the north tower. Cockerell speculates that those to the south of the portal represented prophets and patriarchs of the Old Testament while those to the north represented early missionaries to Britain, of which Augustine of Canterbury, St Birinus, and Benedict Biscop are identifiable by their attributes. In the second zone, above each pair of standing figures, is a quatrefoil containing a half-length angel...

Movie title: Guilty Conscience Movie plot: Arthur Jamison is a very successful ruthless lawyer. He wants to bump off his wife and spends most of the movie talking to an imaginary alter-ego, protrayed by Anthony Hopkins also. He goes though several ideas and plans while each is disected and foiled by this alter-ego in court like cross examination. The biggest problem in the plans is finding a solid alibi (latin for being elsewhere according to Arthur). All his ideas so far have too many loopholes that he cannot close during cross (I mean self) examination.Arthur has had countless affairs and he has decided to get out of his marriage by doing in Louise (played by Blythe Danner), his wife.Only one problem, Louise has done a little homework on her own and has discovered that Arthur has pulled some pretty shady deals that could get him arrested and/or disbarred if brought to light. She has gathered her own evidence and put it in a safe deposit box in the bank. So Louise decides to blackmail Arthur because she sign a prenup where she would get nothing in the course of a normal divorce.Arthur thinks about faking a robbery, suicide, accidents and all kinds of olther scenarios to take care of Louise. Each has it problems and Arthur discards them.In the midst of this planning, right after Arthur returns from Houston, his girlfriend Jackie (Swoozie Kurtz), pops in and pretends she knows neither Arthur nor Louise.As it turns out, Jackie knows them both. In fact she has discovered, that Arthur has yet another girlfriend, Gail, and Jackie also knows Louise, who she met two weeks earlier and filled Louise in all of Arthur's plans.So Louise and Jackie and devise a plan to do away with Arthur before he gets Louise and they confront Arthur with Louise holding a gun.

The only course, she says, is to kill him and set up an alibi for Louise.It turns out that all the action so far, has strictly been in... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Guilty Conscience,\\" no character is explicitly shot dead on screen. However, the plot revolves around Arthur Jamison, played by Anthony Hopkins, as a ruthless lawyer who wants to kill his wife, Louise, played by Blythe Danner. Throughout the film, Arthur discusses various murder plans with his imaginary alter-ego as they attempt to find a foolproof and completely alibi-supported method for carrying out the crime. As the movie progresses, it is revealed that Louise has been gathering evidence against Arthur for his shady dealings, which could lead to his arrest or disbarment. To leverage this information and make up for the prenuptial agreement that would leave her with nothing in case of a divorce, Louise decides to blackmail Arthur. Concurrently, Arthur's multiple affairs complicate matters, in particular with his girlfriend Jackie, played by Swoosie Kurtz. In a fascinating twist, Jackie knows not just Arthur and Louise but also Arthur's other girlfriend, Gail. Jackie meets with Louise and informs her about Arthur's murderous plans. Together, they decide to try and kill Arthur before he can execute his plan to kill Louise. At this point, it seems like the story might end with Arthur being shot dead by the women. However, Arthur is able to reason his way out of the dangerous situation and get the tables turned to his favor. Interestingly, it is revealed that all of these events have occurred in his imagination - a mental exploration of the potential consequences of trying to go forward with his plan to kill his wife. In conclusion, the movie \\"Guilty Conscience\\" does not definitively depict a character being shot dead. The plot revolves around the main protagonist, Arthur Jamison, as he contemplates and discusses multiple scenarios to kill his wife Louise, but none of them are executed or result in a death. Instead, the viewer is entertained by the mind games and twists occurring within Arthur's imagination as he works through his malicious intentions and navigates the complex web of relationships and blackmail surrounding him."},{"prompt":"FINAL EXAM Question 1. \\"Toothbrush\\" is a song by American band DNCE from their debut EP \\"Swaay\\" (2015), the song was written by which DNCE member, an American singer and actor?

Write some highlights for the following article: Police in Texas have released a sketch of a man suspected of shooting a TV weatherman multiple times as he left work on Wednesday morning. The sketch was drawn during a hospital bed interview with KCEN-TV meteorologist Patrick Crawford, 35, who is recovering after being shot in the stomach and shoulder. The suspect, who managed to escape the scene in Bruceville-Eddy on foot on Wednesday morning, is described as a white male, 30 to 35 years old, with a medium build and a receding hairline. 'We are actively looking for [the suspect],' Trooper D.L. Wilson of the Texas Department of Public Safety told ABC News. 'We had troopers out overnight, but we didn't get any calls of suspicious people. We can't rule out that he's not in the area, but more than likely, he's left the area.' Scroll down for video. Suspect: KCEN weatherman Patrick Crawford (left) helped police put together this sketch (right) of the man who shot him as he left the TV studio on Wednesday morning. He said he had never seen him before. Crawford, the morning weatherman for KCEN, was shot after he climbed into his car around 9.15am on Wednesday. An unknown man approached him in the parking lot and they exchanged words. The weatherman managed to back up at high speed and drive out of the parking lot. He crossed the interstate and drove to a group of construction workers, who administered first aid and called 911. Doctors at Scott and White Memorial Hospital in Temple said that Crawford was recovering and in fair condition after surgery for a gunshot wound to the abdomen. From his hospital bed, he spoke to investigators and told them he had never seen the man before. Police have not yet found a motive for the shooting. Gunned down: Footage shows Crawford, 35, being stretchered away after he was shot on Wednesday. Attack: The man continued to shoot at Crawford as he drove away and flagged down help nearby. Hit: The weatherman sustained gunshot wounds to the stomach and shoulder, and a bullet grazed his head. KCEN also reported that police were at the station on Thursday, checking IDs of everyone driving in the parking lot. Crawford's wife, fellow KCEN meteorologist Heather Brinkmann, also revealed his quick decision to drive off and flag down help saved his life. 'Doctors continue to tell me how well he's doing considering the multiple gunshot wounds,' she wrote on her Facebook page on Wednesday night. 'Police tell me that if it wasn't for his smarts to hurry up and drive off and flag down construction workers, it could have been a whole different story. He is truly my hero.' Brinkmann and other KCEN employees also uploaded Superman's 'S' emblem to their Facebook pages in a sign of support for Crawford. KCEN shared the image with the hashtag '#oursuperman' to its own page. Heroic: Crawford's wife Heather said police believe he saved his life by driving off and flagging down help. Attack: Crawford is pictured left with his fellow KCEN hosts on Wednesday - just hours before he was shot. Crawford, who grew up in Plano, Texas and earned his meteorology degree from Northern Illinois University, moved from New Orleans and joined the station in September 2012. He married Brinkmann, a fellow meteorologist and KCEN producer, last year. The station's news director, Jim Hice, released a statement about the shooting on Wednesday. 'Early this morning KCEN-HD News received the devastating news that one of our own, Texas Today Meteorologist Patrick Crawford, had been shot in front of our building,' he said on KCEN. 'He is currently at Baylor Scott and White Hospital in Temple after undergoing surgery. He is in stable condition and resting. 'The shooter, as of this note, has not been caught. We do not know who the shooter was or if he is connected in any way to KCEN or its employees.' Updates: Texas Department of Public Safety officers DL Wilson, left and Harpin Myers, give a briefing on the shooting on Wednesday afternoon. By Thursday morning, a suspect had still not been taken into custody. Concerns: Law enforcement officers set up near a command post and look for the gunman on Wednesday. Response: Texas Department of Public Safety officers go in a pickup to a command post while other officers look for the gunman accused of shooting Crawford outside the station on Wednesday. Rural: The gunman attacked as Crawford was climbing into his car outside the KCEN studios in Texas. He added that Brinkmann was by her husband's side in the hospital. 'He is a loved member of the KCEN family and our thoughts and prayers go out to him, Heather and their family,' he wrote. On Wednesday morning, just hours before he was shot, Crawford showed off his winning Christmas sweater for the station's 'Ugly Sweater Contest' and shared images online of him raising a trophy. The town is about 75 miles north of Austin. Highlights:","completion":"1. KCEN-TV meteorologist Patrick Crawford is recovering after being shot multiple times by an unidentified man.

Article: Think about how open you want to be about your upcoming surgery. Some people you really do need to tell, but generally it is up to you. There is no etiquette in cancer, and there are no social protocols for you to follow. Think carefully, and then do what's right for you. You do not have to go through this alone! Share your feelings and needs with those who make you feel comfortable, safe, and cared for. You will need help after you get home from the hospital. Many health plans offer visiting nurse services to assist with changing your bandages, but they will not bathe you, cook, or do your laundry. Talk to people you are emotionally close to, and try to have someone stay with you while you recover. Share your thoughts and feelings with your partner, family, friends, therapist – people who are supportive and caring. Join a support group in your community or online, or consider seeing a therapist who specializes in cancer. You can find professionals in your area through the American Psychosocial Oncology Society (APOS) Helpline. Do stress-relieving activities before your surgery like yoga, meditation, deep breathing, taking walks – anything that helps you relax. Practice these skills now and continue them after your surgery. Practice mindfulness meditation on a daily basis. Get clearance from your doctor before doing anything physical like walking or yoga. Work on building up your strength and flexibility before surgery – this can help you feel stronger and more in control afterwards. For breast surgery, try to focus on your upper body and back. Feeling physically strong may help you recover better and feel emotionally strong, as well. Breast reconstruction surgery can make your breast feel and look more natural following your mastectomy. This procedure can be done during your mastectomy or in a separate surgery afterwards. Breast reconstruction may not be important to you, or it may be a big part of the healing process – everyone is different. Spend some time thinking about what feels important to you, and whether further surgery may help you feel more comfortable in your body. Consider talking to a therapist and/or a plastic surgeon about your feelings and options. Every surgery has risks, including breast reconstruction; talk to your doctor for more information. Some organizations, such as AiRS Foundation, help women to afford breast reconstruction surgeries. What is a summary?","completion":"Summary: When preparing for an upcoming surgery, especially one related to cancer, it is essential to consider how open you want to be with others about your situation. There are no set protocols to follow in these circumstances, so do what feels right for you. Ensure you have adequate support during your recovery and seek out friends, family, therapists, or support groups as needed. Engage in stress-relieving activities before and after the surgery, and work on building physical strength to aid in your recovery. For breast surgery patients, consider whether breast reconstruction is important to you and discuss your feelings and options with a plastic surgeon or therapist. Always consult with your doctor about any physical activities or surgeries to understand the risks involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Mary Violet Leontyne Price (born February 10, 1927) is an American soprano. Born and raised in Laurel, Mississippi, she rose to international acclaim in the 1950s and 1960s, and was the first African American to become a leading artist at the Metropolitan Opera. One critic characterized Price's voice as \\"vibrant\\", \\"soaring\\" and \\"a Price beyond pearls\\", as well as \\"genuinely buttery, carefully produced but firmly under control\\", with phrases that \\"took on a seductive sinuousness.\\" Time magazine called her voice \\"Rich, supple and shining, it was in its prime capable of effortlessly soaring from a smoky mezzo to the pure soprano gold of a perfectly spun high C.\\" A lirico spinto (Italian for \\"pushed lyric\\") soprano, she was considered especially well suited to the roles of Giuseppe Verdi and Giacomo Puccini, as well as several in operas by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Price's career climaxed on September 16, 1966, when she sang Cleopatra in Antony and Cleopatra by American composer Samuel Barber and conducted by Thomas Schippers, commissioned to open the Met's new house at Lincoln Center. The role of Cleopatra was written especially for Price. Since their early collaborations, Price and Barber had remained close friends and colleagues, and the composer tailored Cleopatra's music to Price's warm middle register and soaring top. In the performances, although Price's singing was praised, especially in a powerful death scene, the opera as a whole was widely considered a failure. Director Franco Zeffirelli was blamed for burying the music under heavy costumes and huge scenery. Bing admitted he had underestimated the challenge of mounting nine new productions that season (three in the first week), and relying heavily on untested high-tech equipment. (In rehearsals, an expensive turntable broke down and, in the dress rehearsal, another mechanical failure left Price trapped briefly inside a giant pyramid.) The pressures and many of the glitches were chronicled by cameras for a Bell Telephone Hour special documentary, directed by Robert Drew. Still others complained that Barber's score was difficult to grasp because of the dense Shakespearean verse, and lacked satisfying set pieces (apart from the death scene). The opera was never revived at the Met. However, with the help of Gian Carlo Menotti, Barber later reworked the score for successful productions at the Juilliard School and the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, where it received praise. Barber also prepared a concert suite of Cleopatra's arias, which Price premiered in Washington in 1968 and subsequently recorded. Price lobbied Kurt Herbert Adler to have it produced in San Francisco, but did not succeed. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did they make any changes because of the complaints?","completion":"Yes, they made changes because of the complaints. The text says, \\"Barber later reworked the score for successful productions at the Juilliard School and the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, where it received praise.\\" This means that the composer, Barber, made changes to the music after listening to the complaints and then the new version was liked by people in other performances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: When was the Chicxulub crater discovered? is inside the article: The Chicxulub crater (; Mayan: [tʃʼikʃuluɓ]) is an impact crater buried underneath the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. Its center is located near the town of Chicxulub, after which the crater is named. It was formed by a large asteroid or comet about 11 to 81 kilometres (6.8 to 50.3 miles) in diameter, the Chicxulub impactor, striking the Earth. The date of the impact coincides precisely with the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–Pg boundary), slightly less than 66 million years ago, and a widely accepted theory is that worldwide climate disruption from the event was the cause of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, a mass extinction in which 75% of plant and animal species on Earth became extinct, including all non-avian dinosaurs. The crater is estimated to be 150 kilometres (93 miles) in diameter and 20 km (12 mi) in depth, well into the continental crust of the region of about 10–30 km (6.2–18.6 mi) depth. It is the second largest confirmed impact structure on Earth and the only one whose peak ring is intact and directly accessible for scientific research.The crater was discovered by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who had been looking for petroleum in the Yucatán during the late 1970s. Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater and gave up his search. Later, through contact with Alan Hildebrand in 1990, Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature. Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes shocked quartz, a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas. In 2016, a scientific drilling project drilled deep into the peak ring of the impact crater, hundreds of meters below the current sea floor, to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself. The discoveries were widely seen as confirming current theories related to both the crater impact and its effects., can you guess it ?","completion":"The Chicxulub crater was discovered by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who had been looking for petroleum in the Yucatán during the late 1970s.

Solution:","completion":"The task is asking you to analyze a short story and determine certain events in relation to a specific sentence from the story. The aim is to infer whether the previous events led to or simply enabled the chosen sentence to occur. Here are the steps you need to follow: 1. Read the short story carefully. 2. Find and highlight the 'selected sentence' in the story. In this case, it's: \\"She rushed around and got dressed.\\" 3. Now, consider the events happening before this sentence in the story. Here, the only event before our selected sentence is: \\"Tabitha woke up late to work one morning.\\" 4. Now you need to determine if this previous event directly caused or simply made the 'selected sentence' possible. 5. Is there a direct cause and effect relationship (i.e., A causes B), or is the event only a potential setup (i.e., A enables B)? To figure this out, ask yourself: can we say that \\"Because Tabitha woke up late, she had to rush and get dressed\\"? If your answer is yes, then it's a 'causes' relationship. If you feel that Tabitha waking up late only provided the right circumstances that could have made her rush and get dressed, then it's an 'enables' relationship. 6. Given the context, it seems like \\"Tabitha woke up late to work one morning\\" directly caused \\"She rushed around and got dressed\\". This is because waking up late logically induces a sense of urgency, thereby causing Tabitha to rush and get dressed.

However, the extent of these effects on animals may vary depending on various factors, including the adolescents' behavior, attitudes, and level of awareness regarding environmental conservation. To show how the negative effects could be smaller, let's first explore a more general view of the impacts of adolescence on animals and then analyze possible contributing factors. As children transition into adolescence, they experience various physical, emotional, and social changes, which could influence their interactions with nature and animals. Some potential negative effects of more adolescents on animals might include increased consumption of resources, an amplified demand for animal-related products, and recreational activities that might disrupt natural habitats. A: More negative effect: 1. Greater exploitation of resources: As the number of adolescents increases, the demand for resources needed for their overall well-being, like food, clothing, and shelter, will most likely rise as well. This may lead to an increased exploitation of animals for food, deforestation for their habitat, and pollution of natural environments. 2. Increased demand for animal-related products: With more adolescents, the demand for products and services involving animals might also increase, including pets, zoos, circuses, and theme parks. While some of these activities might seem harmless, increased demand for these experiences can impose stress on the animals, ultimately affecting their well-being. B: Smaller negative effect: However, there is also potential for the negative effects on animals to be smaller, as more adolescents become increasingly aware of the environmental consequences of human actions and make an effort to rectify them. We can analyze elements that may contribute to diminishing the negative impacts on animals. 1. Education and awareness: As awareness and education on environmental conservation become more prevalent in society, adolescents exposed to this knowledge may develop appreciation and empathy for animals and their ecosystem. They could become promoters of sustainable practices, animal welfare, and environmental conservation within their social circles. This heightened awareness could eventually lead to an overall smaller negative impact on animals. 2. Sustainable diets and lifestyle choices: Adoption of eco-conscious diets, such as plant-based or reduced meat consumption, could minimize the effects of resource exploitation. Adolescents are at an age of exploration and can be more willing to try new lifestyles, which could lead to an increase in sustainable diets and lifestyle choices that benefit animals. 3. Activism and voluntarism: A higher number of environmentally-conscious adolescents might result in increased participation in activist movements or voluntary commitments in animal care and conservation. This active involvement could help protect and preserve wildlife from human-caused disruptions. 4. Policy influence: Adolescents can be influential stakeholders in shaping public policies. With an increase in young voices advocating for animal welfare and environmental conservation, policy changes that promote sustainable practices and minimize harm to animals could be more likely. C: No effect A scenario in which the number of adolescents turning into adolescents has no effect on animals is unlikely, as human actions are often linked to environmental impacts. However, assuming that human activities remain constant, there might be no additional direct effect on animals. In conclusion, the negative effect of more children turning into adolescents on animals depends on various factors. While there could initially be more negative effects, a rise in environmental awareness, education, and action among adolescents could consequently lead to a scenario in which these negative effects are gradually reduced or even minimized. Thoughtful promotion of sustainable lifestyles, animal welfare, and environmental conservation among adolescents can ensure a brighter future for both humans and animals."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In Week 8, the Bears donned their 1940s throwback uniforms against the Carolina Panthers, who had the worst record in the NFC. The Bears scored first on Matt Forte's 13-yard touchdown run, which would be countered by Justin Medlock's 34-yard field goal. The Panthers then took the lead on Louis Murphy's fumble recovery; Panthers quarterback Cam Newton ran with the ball, and lost the ball when Bears safety Major Wright tackled him at the 1-yard line. The ball rolled into the endzone, where Murphy recovered it. Medlock would then kick three more field goals, and by the fourth quarter, the Panthers led 19-7. The tide eventually turned when Panthers punter Brad Nortman shanked a 6-yard punt, and Jay Cutler hit Kellen Davis on a 12-yard touchdown pass with less than seven minutes left in the game. On the first play of the Panthers' next drive, Tim Jennings intercepted Newton and returned the pick 25 yards to regain the lead 20-19, after Cutler's two-point conversion passing attempt was intercepted. Medlock later kicked another field goal to reclaim the lead 22-20 with 2:27 left in the game. Cutler would lead the Bears downfield, and Gould kicked a 41-yard field goal as time expired to give Chicago the victory. The kick was Gould's tenth game-winning field goal, and the first since 2010.

You can see their reactions in the YouTube video below: For those unfamiliar with this Quebecois specialty, poutine is french fries topped with gravy and cheese curds (think cottage cheese) that's often served as cold-weather comfort food or after a night of bar-hopping.

Articles 77–79 of the Norwegian Constitution specifically grant the monarch of Norway the right to withhold royal assent from any bill passed by the Storting. Should the sovereign ever choose to exercise this privilege, Article 79 provides a means by which his veto may be over-ridden: \\"If a Bill has been passed unaltered by two sessions of the Storting, constituted after two separate successive elections and separated from each other by at least two intervening sessions of the Storting, without a divergent Bill having been passed by any Storting in the period between the first and last adoption, and it is then submitted to the King with a petition that His Majesty shall not refuse his assent to a Bill which, after the most mature deliberation, the Storting considers to be beneficial, it shall become law even if the Royal Assent is not accorded before the Storting goes into recess.\\" If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): How many elections are required to assend a bill that the monarch has vetoed?","completion":"From the given information, it can be concluded that a bill that the monarch has vetoed can be passed after two separate successive elections have occurred, effectively overruling the monarch's veto."},{"prompt":"Question: What would children do if they are bored?

In this scenario, the child is playing on a slide, which is a specific piece of playground equipment. The focus of the premise is entirely on the child's interaction with the slide, providing no information about any other activities that the child might be participating in. On the other hand, the hypothesis presents a different situation, stating that a child is swinging on a swingset. In this separate scenario, the child is engaging in an activity on another type of playground equipment, a swingset, which is distinct from the slide mentioned in the premise. Given the information provided in the premise, we cannot conclude that the same child is engaging in the activity described in the hypothesis. The two situations mentioned are not related or connected in any way that would suggest that one action leads to the other or that they are happening simultaneously. Since the premise only mentions the child's interaction with the slide and does not provide any information about the child's activities on a swingset, we cannot conclude that the child is swinging on a swingset based on the premise alone. Furthermore, it is essential to recognize that while it is possible for a child to play on different playground equipment, it is unlikely that they would be doing so simultaneously. Generally, a child would slide down a slide and then move on to play on a swingset, or vice versa, but not participate in both activities at the same time. In conclusion, given the premise provided about a child sliding down a tan plastic slide, we cannot conclude the hypothesis that the child is swinging on a swingset. The two situations describe distinct and separate activities, and the premise does not provide any indication or information that the child's sliding activity is connected or related to the swinging activity presented in the hypothesis.

This increased usage of petrol-run cars would then lead to higher carbon dioxide production from engines, thus affecting the greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere. Indirect effect: With more countries having access to oil, there may be increased political and economic interest in maintaining the production and use of petrol-run cars, potentially slowing down the transition to more sustainable and eco-friendly transportation alternatives, like electric vehicles.

I do not recommend this place at all and it's a shame as I have enjoyed watching Rick Moonen on Master Chef and thought we'd give this place a whirl. We ordered their \\"featured\\" appetizer, the foie gras which was hyped up by our server. The way he described, it sounded like the foie gras was going to be the star of the plate \\"drizzled\\" with a balsamic reduction. Well, when it arrived, the foie gras was swimming in a pool, literally, of balsamic and it was inedible. We informed the waiter, and he said he would correct the error. He returned with the same piece of foie gras, now just removed from the pool and sitting on a bare plate. Really? We said, \\"no thank you\\" as it was not presentable at this point and it had absorbed all the balsamic from the time in the pool. We then ordered a bottle of wine, needed it at this point, clam chowder, whole lobster; one steamed and one broiled and their macaroni and cheese for a side and the broccoli raab vegetable. The clam chowder came out cold with a heaping handful of fresh thyme on the top which made it entirely inedible. I asked for bread with the soup and the waiter said, \\"crackers?\\" and I repeated, \\"bread please.\\" He brought out two, quarter-sized rolls. Could they spare it? The lobsters were brought out but I ordered steamed and the server was going to give me the broiled one by mistake so I informed him that I wanted the steamed one. Instead of just putting it in the right place, he went back to the kitchen only to return a few seconds later to put the steamed one in front of me. Huh? When I touched it, it was ice cold; chilled lobster? I informed the waiter and I said that this was now ridiculous and please tell me where the hidden camera is. I mean iced cold! He took it back to the kitchen. I stared at the Mac and cheese and when I picked some up on my fork to take a bite, it was dripping no more like running cream/butter/milk -- disgusting. Kraft would be more appetizing than that! I asked the waiter if he would eat that mac and cheese that was swimming in milk or cream and he said \\"no.\\" so I sent that back and p.s. the veggies were cold too. When the Lobsters arrived back at the table, I ate my share, as I was very hungry at this point and just wanted to get out of there.

Choose your answer? What form of energy is stored in a battery? (I) chemical. (II) sound. (III) light. (IV) heat.","completion":"The form of energy stored in a battery is (I) chemical energy. Allow me to provide you with a detailed explanation regarding batteries and how they store energy. Batteries are essentially electrochemical devices that store and release energy through chemical reactions. These chemical reactions occur between the battery's internal components, such as the anode, cathode, and electrolyte. When a battery is connected to an electrical circuit, a chemical reaction occurs within the battery that generates electrical energy, which then flows through the circuit, powering various electronic devices. A battery consists of one or more cells, each containing a positive terminal (or the cathode) and a negative terminal (or the anode). The cathode is an electrode material that releases positively charged ions (cations) during discharging, while the anode is another electrode material that accepts these cations while releasing negatively charged ions (anions) and electrons. The electrolyte is a conductive material (either liquid or solid) present between the anode and the cathode that allows only the passage of ions, not electrons. When a battery is connected to an external circuit, the chemical reaction between the anode and the electrolyte causes the anode to release electrons. These electrons cannot pass through the electrolyte, so they flow through the external circuit. Concurrently, cations from the anode move through the electrolyte toward the cathode, while anions from the cathode move through the electrolyte toward the anode, maintaining the electrical neutrality of the electrolyte. As the chemical reaction progresses, the anode releases its reactant into the electrolyte, transferring electrons to the external circuit and providing a flow of electric current to power electronic devices. The flow of electrons continues as long as the battery has remaining chemical energy, and this flow ultimately stops when the anode or the cathode has depleted its supply of reactants. It is important to note the distinction between the other forms of energy listed in the question and the energy stored in a battery. Sound energy is a form of mechanical energy produced by the vibration of particles in a medium such as air, water, or solids. Light energy, or electromagnetic radiation, is emitted from sources such as the sun, light bulbs, and fire. Heat energy, or thermal energy, is the internal kinetic energy of moving particles within a substance due to temperature differences. In contrast, a battery specifically stores chemical energy that is converted into electrical energy when utilized. In conclusion, the energy stored in a battery is chemical energy, derived from the chemical reactions of the anode, cathode, and electrolyte. This energy is then converted into electrical energy when the battery is connected to an external circuit, powering electronic devices and appliances."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - Canadian Idol was a Canadian reality television competition show which aired on CTV, based on the British show \\"Pop Idol\\". The show was a competition to find the most talented young singer in Canada, and was hosted by Ben Mulroney. Jon Dore was the \\"roving reporter\\" for the first three seasons (appearing in comedy skits throughout the show). Elena Juatco (a season 2 contestant) assumed the role for season four, Dave Kerr had the role in season five and Jully Black in season six. - Pop Idol is a British television music competition created by Simon Fuller which ran on ITV from 2001 to 2003. The aim of the show was to decide the best new young pop singer (or \\"pop idol\\") in the UK based on viewer voting and participation. Two series were broadcastone in 20012002 and a second in 2003. \\"Pop Idol\\" was subsequently put on an indefinite hiatus after series judge Simon Cowell announced the launch of \\"The X Factor\\" in the UK in April 2004. - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Tyler Hamilton is a pop singer best known for placing seventh in the first season of Canadian Idol . He is also a member of the classical music group \`\` Due Voci . '' The group has recently released their first studio album in June 2010 . - Blues is a genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \\"worried notes\\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.

Q: SEOUL — Despite recent tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on. In fact it is probably the nicest one I’ve been on because everything is new,” said Bob McElroy, a Camp Humphreys public affairs officer.

Generate a question that has the following answer: A boat race for the following movie plot: Scott Heyward (Presley) rebels against the plans and expectations of his father, extremely rich oil tycoon Duster Heyward (Gregory). Scott abandons his family, driving to Florida in his shiny red 1959 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray Racer to find himself. When Scott stops for gas and refreshments, he encounters Tom Wilson (Hutchins), who is on his way to take a job as a waterskiing instructor at a Miami hotel. Scott and Tom make small talk, and a chance remark by Tom gives Scott an idea: He switches identities with Tom so he can find out how people react to him as an ordinary person rather than a millionaire. Tom has fun staying at the same hotel and pretending he is rich. Shortly after, hotel guest Dianne Carter (Fabares) insists on taking a lesson minutes after Scott checks in with his new \\"employer\\". However, once they are out on the water, Dianne proves herself to be an expert skier, performing fancy maneuvers to gain the attention of wealthy young playboy James J. Jamison III (Bixby). Later, Dianne confesses to Scott that she is a gold digger, assuming that he is one too. Scott agrees to help Dianne land Jamison, but ends up falling for her himself. Scott persuades boat builder Sam Burton (Merrill) to allow him to rebuild the Rawhide, a damaged high-performance boat, and drive it in the annual Orange Bowl Race, which Jamison has won the last three years. Scott sends for some \\"goop\\", an experimental coating his father spent a lot of money trying (and failing) to perfect. Between his day job and moonlighting as a chemist, Scott is run ragged, but he manages to (hopefully) fix goop's major flaw: losing its strength in water. With no time for testing before the race, he applies it to the boat's hull and prays it will hold the Rawhide together.[2][3] Duster learns where his son is and comes to see what he is doing.

According to the information in the paragraph, Póvoa de Varzim is currently divided into seven civil parishes. It is mentioned that these parishes were most likely established as civil entities in the 19th century and that some were merged in the 21st century. The given context underscores that these parishes directly originated from ecclesiastical parishes that existed since the Early Middle Ages. However, this paragraph does not state how many parishes were originally in Póvoa de Varzim. It mentions that some parishes were merged, implying that there may have been more than seven parishes at some point. But it does not specify if the initial count was eight or any other number.

Article: An American educational expert, Frederick M. Hess, says that a long summer vacation doesn't make sense in today's world. This summer, 50 million kids will spend much time talking online, watching TV, playing video games and asking older brothers or sisters to take them to the supermarket. They will also be putting their academic futures at risk. During much of the 20th century, many Americans worked in factories that did not need a college degree but still offered a high salary. Also, in the 19th century, there was no air condition. And poor hygiene meant that crowded schools had health risks. Things have changed. For today's students, academic skills are key to future success. Many countries don't give kids an American-style summer vacation. They offer no more than seven consecutive weeks of vacation. Most American school districts offer up to 13 weeks. To compete in global marketplace, Americans must be prepared to go up against international competitors. Summer vacation also causes challenges for today's families. In the 1960s, more than 60% of families had a stay-at-home mum. Now, two-thirds of American children live families where every adult works. For these families, summer vacation can be more burden than break. Someone must watch the kids. But the biggest problem may be how summer vacation hurts academic achievement. Scientist have found that disadvantaged students lose important ground in the summertime. A school year can allow time-limited teachers to conduct richer and more imaginative lessons. Schools would have more time for sports, languages, music and the arts.

What is the goal of a poor person having food? - digesting - being full - will not starve - survive - getting fat The best answer is The answer to this question is:","completion":"The goal of a poor person having food can be broken down step-by-step: 1. First and foremost, the primary goal is to survive. Without food, a person cannot sustain themselves and will eventually die from starvation. By consuming food, a poor person can maintain their health, meet their basic nutritional needs, and continue living. 2. Secondly, digesting the food is essential. After eating, the body breaks down the nutrients in the food through the process of digestion. This enables the person to absorb the nutrients, which are necessary for maintaining good health and performing various bodily functions. 3. The next goal is to feel full and satiated. A sense of fullness helps the person feel content and satisfied, which is essential to their overall mental wellbeing. It is important to have enough food to achieve this, as being constantly hungry could lead to feelings of anxiety and stress. 4. Another important aspect is not having to starve. By having access to food, a poor person can avoid the painful experience of starvation and the related physical and mental health consequences. 5. Lastly, while getting fat might not be a primary goal, maintaining a healthy weight is crucial to overall health and well-being. Having enough food to maintain a stable weight can prevent complications from malnutrition and other health-related issues. In summary, the best answer is that a poor person's goal when having food is to survive, digest, be full, not starve, and maintain a healthy weight."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - The isotope is unstable - The isotope emits radiation - The isotope decays - The isotope loses some atomic particles - The isotope turns into a different element - The isotope is finished decaying and emitting radiation. The answer is:","completion":"The missing first step of the following process is: \\"An unstable isotope is produced.\\" Justification of steps: 1. An unstable isotope is produced: To begin the process, there must be the creation or formation of an unstable isotope. This could happen through various processes, such as nuclear reactions or cosmic ray exposure. 2. The isotope is unstable: The isotope in question is not stable and has a tendency to change its form to reach a more stable state. Its instability is the driving force behind the next steps in the process. 3. The isotope emits radiation: As a consequence of being unstable, the isotope releases energy in the form of radiation. This emission is the process through which the isotope begins to decay and transform. 4. The isotope decays: Decay is the process by which an unstable nucleus loses energy by emitting radiation. It is a natural occurrence in various isotopes trying to achieve a more stable state. 5. The isotope loses some atomic particles: During the decay process, isotopes often lose atomic particles, such as protons, neutrons, or electrons. This loss impacts the composition of the isotope, ultimately leading to a change in its atomic structure. 6. The isotope turns into a different element: As a result of the changes in atomic structure, the isotope transforms into a new element with different properties. This is due to the loss or gain of protons, which define the element. 7. The isotope is finished decaying and emitting radiation: The process comes to an end when the isotope has reached a stable state. At this point, it no longer emits radiation or goes through decay, meaning its transformation is complete."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Friends and family gathered around the metal statue Tuesday, June 25, at the National Ranching Heritage Center for what they hoped would be an opportunity to find peace and honor Miguel Martinez where he died within minutes of the accident just before 3 a.m. Saturday. “We just need to get together and pray and be supportive,” said Brenda Garcia, a family friend. One of two adults near Martinez in his last minutes said his death was a “pure accident.” Marenda Podhorsky said Tuesday that she and her boyfriend took her four children and Martinez to play in the park area near the center early Saturday morning, according to the Associated Press. Martinez was spending the night with Podhorsky’s son and the children were awake well past midnight after eating sweets to celebrate her boyfriend’s birthday. When she heard a thump, she thought Martinez might have been knocked down by the bull’s horn during a game of hide-and-seek. Instead, Martinez suffered a chest wound. He died after being impaled by the horn. Texas Tech police, who continued investigating the death Tuesday, released a heavily redacted copy of a police report. The redacted report shows only the date, time, location and a brief synopsis. “He was running and ran into the horn of one of the statues,” the report states. “The boy was unresponsive and died because of his injuries.” Garcia said she has known Martinez for years. Her daughter and Martinez were close friends who attended Cavazos Middle School together. She described him as a good role model to their friends. “And he was always into sports,” she said, listing basketball, football and track. “Whatever season the sports were, he was playing.” Garcia said she would not allow her daughter out past midnight, but avoided laying blame for the accident. “Boys are going to be boys and they’re going to be out late,” she said. “This could happen to anybody, day or night.” Stephanie Cole, a store manager at Wells Fargo’s North University Avenue bank branch, said Martinez’s family is accepting donations through the Miguel Martinez Memorial Fund at Wells Fargo.

Question: \\"What specific elements in the faith of the followers of the man formerly known as Siddhartha Gautama make up the core also known as the Triple Gem?\\" Context: \\"Buddhist schools vary on the exact nature of the path to liberation, the importance and canonicity of various teachings and scriptures, and especially their respective practices. Buddhism denies a creator deity and posits that mundane deities such as Mahabrahma are misperceived to be a creator. The foundations of Buddhist tradition and practice are the Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dharma (the teachings), and the Sangha (the community). Taking \\"refuge in the triple gem\\" has traditionally been a declaration and commitment to being on the Buddhist path, and in general distinguishes a Buddhist from a non-Buddhist. Other practices are Ten Meritorious Deeds including, giving charity to reduce the greediness; following ethical precepts; renouncing conventional living and becoming a monastic; the development of mindfulness and practice of meditation; cultivation of higher wisdom and discernment; study of scriptures; devotional practices; ceremonies; and in the Mahayana tradition, invocation of buddhas and bodhisattvas.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The Triple Gem, also known as the Three Jewels or Triratna, is the core of the Buddhist faith and consists of three fundamental aspects: the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. These elements are central to Buddhist beliefs and practices, and taking refuge in the Triple Gem signifies a person's commitment to following the Buddhist path. Here is a detailed explanation of the three components: 1. The Buddha: This refers to Siddhartha Gautama, who became the historical Buddha, and also to the concept of the Buddha-nature that exists within all sentient beings. Buddha, which means the \\"awakened one\\" or the \\"enlightened one\\", is a person who has reached the state of perfect enlightenment and serves as a guide for others in their quest for spiritual awakening. The Buddha is a role model and a symbol of the potential for liberation that exists within all living beings. By taking refuge in the Buddha, one acknowledges the Buddha's teachings and seeks to follow his example. 2. The Dharma: The Dharma embodies the teachings, the truths, and the path expounded by the Buddha to guide his followers toward spiritual enlightenment. Dharma encompasses the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, and various other discourses, parables, and teachings that address different aspects of human existence and spiritual development. By taking refuge in the Dharma, one commits to understanding and putting these teachings into practice, which ultimately leads to the cessation of suffering and the attainment of enlightenment. 3. The Sangha: The Sangha is the spiritual community of Buddhists who walk the path to enlightenment together. It encompasses both the monastic community (monks and nuns) and the lay community (laypeople who practice Buddhism). The Sangha is important because it provides support, guidance, and inspiration to individuals along the spiritual journey. By taking refuge in the Sangha, one joins a community of like-minded practitioners committed to following the Buddha's teachings and upholding the Dharma. In summary, the Triple Gem forms the core of Buddhist faith and practice, representing the ideal of the Buddha, the truth of the Dharma, and the support of the Sangha. By taking refuge in these three aspects, individuals show their commitment to walking the Buddhist path and seeking enlightenment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The Bush administration in its first months faced many problems other than terrorism. They included the collapse of the Middle East peace process and, in April, a crisis over a U.S.\\" spy plane\\" brought down in Chinese territory. The new administration also focused heavily on Russia, a new nuclear strategy that allowed missile defenses, Europe, Mexico, and the Persian Gulf. In the spring, reporting on terrorism surged dramatically. In chapter 8, we will explore this reporting and the ways agencies responded. These increasingly alarming reports, briefed to the President and top officials, became part of the context in which the new administration weighed its options for policy on al Qaeda. Except for a few reports that the CSG considered and apparently judged to be unreliable, none of these pointed specifically to possible al Qaeda action inside the United States-although the CSG continued to be concerned about the domestic threat. The mosaic of threat intelligence came from the Counterterrorist Center, which collected only abroad. Its reports were not supplemented by reports from the FBI. Clarke had expressed concern about an al Qaeda presence in the United States, and he worried about an attack on the White House by \\"Hizbollah, Hamas, al Qida and other terrorist organizations.\\" In May, President Bush announced that Vice President Cheney would himself lead an effort looking at preparations for managing a possible attack by weapons of mass destruction and at more general problems of national preparedness. The next few months were mainly spent organizing the effort and bringing an admiral from the Sixth Fleet back to Washington to manage it. The Vice President's task force was just getting under way when the 9/11 attack occurred.

The Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (大日本帝國海軍航空隊 , Dai-Nippon Teikoku Kaigun Kōkū-tai ) was the air arm of the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. The organization was responsible for the operation of naval aircraft and the conduct of aerial warfare in the Pacific War. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? The Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service's pilots received high salaries","completion":"Although the opening statement introduces the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (IJNAS) and its role during World War II, it does not provide any information on the salaries of its pilots. However, I can provide context and additional information on the topic. In the context of the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service, it is important to understand the background and training of the pilots. The IJNAS had a rigorous selection process and an extensive training program for their pilots, who were known for their skill and bravery. These pilots, also referred to as \\"Kaigun Kokutai,\\" were instrumental in many major air campaigns and battles, such as the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 and the Battle of Midway in 1942. Regarding the compensation of IJNAS pilots, given the economic conditions of Japan during World War II, it is not accurate to claim that these pilots received high salaries compared to the global standard or even to civilian salaries within their own country. Japan's economy was strained by the war, leading to widespread conscription and a focus on nationalistic duty over individual compensation. However, when compared to other military enlisted personnel within the Imperial Japanese Navy, it could be argued that the IJNAS pilots received better compensation and benefits commensurate with their rank and training. Additionally, their status as pilots in such an elite organization would have afforded them a certain level of prestige and respect among their peers and society. It is also important to note that the concept of compensation in Imperial Japan often extended beyond just salaries to include social status and recognition for one's service and loyalty to the country. In conclusion, while it may not be accurate to claim that the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service's pilots received high salaries compared to the global standard, within the context of wartime Japan and the Imperial Japanese Navy, they were likely better compensated and respected compared to enlisted personnel in other branches of the military. This includes factors such as rank, benefits, prestige, and social recognition associated with their role in the IJNAS."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Here is a news article: ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) — The African Union says the largest Ebola outbreak in history is creating a sense of siege in affected communities during an emergency meeting. The regional bloc has promised to send health care workers, but there are concerns about whether there is enough protective gear to keep them safe. Doctors and nurses are at high risk of infection, and a higher proportion of health workers have become infected in the West African outbreak than in any other previous one. The outbreak began in Guinea and has spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal, killing more than 2,000 people. Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, chair of the AU Commission, told a meeting Monday that efforts to stop Ebola — like border closures and flights bans — have stigmatized the affected countries. ||||| A driver brings a sick woman to an Ebola clinic in Monrovia, Liberia. Kieran Kesner for The Wall Street Journal Milton Mulbon arrived in a taxi at the gates of an Ebola clinic in Liberia's capital, Monrovia, with his 24-year-old daughter, Patience, bleeding in the back seat. Guards turned them away. \\"They're telling me no space?\\" he protested, the taxi parked nearby. \\"She's lying down in there almost at the point of death!\\" Taxis, ambulances, and even men pushing their sick in wheelbarrows are crisscrossing Monrovia, looking for an open bed in West Africa's overbooked Ebola clinics, health-care workers say. Sometimes they get in, through persistence and good timing. Mostly they don't. Liberia's tradition of hands-on burial has exacerbated the Ebola epidemic. Burial teams now don biohazard suits to remove corpses, but they're struggling to keep up. (Photo: Kieran Kesner for The Wall Street Journal) Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea—the three nations bearing the brunt of the outbreak—need at least 1,515 hospital beds for the more than 20,000 people who could be infected before the outbreak can be curtailed, according to World Health Organization estimates. At present, there are only a few hundred beds. International support has been slow to come and is just beginning to address this specific problem, with the U.S. promising 1,000 additional beds in a new aid package. The shortage is so dire that ambulances have picked up people raging with the symptoms of Ebola, driven them around for hours, then dropped them back at home, medical workers say. The odds of surviving Ebola at home, without intravenous hydration, are slim. Along the way, the sick often infect their families. That is creating ever more Ebola patients arriving at the gates of overcrowded clinics. Some, like Mr. Mulbon, collect a bag of sanitary products and painkillers. His daughter, the mother of two boys, died within hours of receiving it. \\"She was helpless,\\" Mr. Mulbon said. Health workers complain they can't throw down mattresses fast enough. Some organizations, including Doctors Without Borders, are asking Europe and the U.S. to send disaster relief—even military personnel—to help West Africa get ahead of an Ebola epidemic that has been under way since December. \\"Many months into an Ebola outbreak, we're in the position of turning away patients who look like they have Ebola,\\" said Henry Grey, a Doctors Without Borders emergency coordinator. \\"That's an indication of the direct failure of the international community.\\" Ebola patients at the hospital. Agence France-Presse/Getty Images A few foreign governments are beginning to respond. On Friday, the European Union said it would pledge €140 million (181.3 million) to the three hardest-hit countries, €97.5 million of it going directly to their national budgets. \\"The situation is going from bad to worse,\\" said Kristalina Georgieva, the EU commissioner for international cooperation, humanitarian aid and crisis response. On Thursday, the U.S. Agency for International Development said it would build 10 Ebola treatment centers with 100 beds each, part of a nearly 100 million aid package to the three nations. USAID Administrator Raj Shah said the agency is moving to fund and deliver beds and several hundred critical-care personnel \\"as quickly as possible.\\" The challenge isn't just delivering beds. It is training staff, said Jeremy Konyndyk, director of USAID's Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance, which is coordinating the U.S. government's response. \\"We could get a bunch of tents and beds in here in no time,\\" said Mr. Konyndyk. \\"The hard part is who staffs those beds.\\" It takes between 200 and 250 health workers to treat 80 Ebola patients, according to the World Health Organization. USAID and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are both looking to recruit and train health workers to take care of Ebola patients. The CDC program will begin in late September. The trouble is finding doctors and nurses willing to treat a deadly disease—with no vaccine or formally approved treatment. In addition, the training is challenging, because they have to learn to care for patients while wearing cumbersome protective gear and meticulously guarding their safety. Meanwhile, USAID is giving sick people who can't find a free bed a home treatment kit. It includes bleach and disposable gloves, Mr. Konyndyk said. An estimated 3,685 people have been sickened by the latest outbreak, WHO says. About half have died. But those numbers represent a small portion of the true toll, the organization says. Because most Ebola victims are suffering at home, their deaths or recoveries aren't noted in any official tally. Now, as clinics open, some of those who have been fighting the virus at home are beginning to show up. A WHO clinic opened late last month in what had previously been a dental office. It was meant for 30 patients. But on a recent Tuesday, it was overbooked, with several patients sprawled out on the concrete floor, including children. The hospital's director was reviewing a list of patients in the car on her way to brief Liberia's Health Ministry. Dr. Anne Deborah Omoruto Atai counted 44 patients. It was an improvement from a week prior when they had more than 70 people in the clinic with patients dying on the ground, she said. Workers wearing protective gear stand inside the contaminated area at a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders in Monrovia, Liberia, on Sunday. Agence France-Presse/Getty Images \\"It's difficult to give them adequate care when they're lying on the floor,\\" she added. \\"We just leave it to natural selection.\\" Across town, workers at the Doctors Without Borders clinic were assembling a 400-bed tent hospital in the mud and rain. The field clinic they already have, with 125 beds, uses 350 head-to-toe body suits, 25,000 liters of water and 2,500 gallons of bleach—every day. Taxis pull up here so frequently that both Doctors Without Borders and the CDC worry the taxis themselves have become conveyors of the virus. The disease spreads through bodily fluids and if a healthy person were to put his hands into the sweat left by previous passenger, it could spread—and in a way that would be impossible to trace. \\"We're hearing stories of people taking four taxis across town,\\" said Caitlin Ryan, communications officer for Doctors Without Borders. Outside the clinic, two taxis pulled up at the same time. Once again, there wasn't any room for the sick. So a shouting match ensued. \\"We are all Liberians,\\" screamed a man who had brought a sick girl in his cab. \\"They think we don't want to help,\\" said Randy Tomanne, one of the guards. \\"Their child is ill. There's no other way you'd feel.\\" Later, a third taxi arrived. The driver said he had been paid 10 to take a family with a 6-year-old girl lying across their laps to a clinic. He had no idea it was an Ebola clinic. \\"He just said the hospital,\\" said the driver, Ibrahim Somir, while a man in a head-to-toe plastic suit sprayed down his taxi in bleach. Before leaving to try his luck elsewhere, the girl's uncle shrugged off the risk he'd put the taxi driver in: \\"What else should we do?\\" —Matina Stevis in Nairobi contributed to this article.

Write highlights for this article: Three beaches along coastal Vandenberg Air Force Base in California have been closed through the weekend following a nonfatal shark attack, authorities said Friday. The attack occurred about 4 pm Thursday, military officials said in a brief statement posted on Vandenberg's website. The attack happened Thursday about a quarter-mile north of Wall Beach, which will be closed along with Surf and Minuteman beaches until 4 pm Sunday. A bite from a great white shark killed a surfer at Surf Beach in October 2012, and a bodyboarder at the same beach died in October 2010 when an apparent great white nearly severed one of his legs. Scene: Three beaches that line the Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Barbara - Wall, Surf and Minuteman - will remain closed until 4pm Sunday following a shark attack near Wall Beach in 2012. Closed: Surf Beach had only recently reopened after being closed for seven months. Tragedy: In 2012, Califonia bodyboarder Francisco Javier Solorio Jr, 39, was killed by a great white at Surf Beach. In 2010, Lucas Ransom, a 19-year-old student at the University of California, died when a shark nearly severed his leg as he bodyboarded at the same beach. Vandenberg's statement only described the latest attack as non-fatal. A base public information officer did not immediately respond to a message seeking additional details. Vandenberg is a missile and space-launch site in Santa Barbara County about 130 miles northwest of Los Angeles.

Area A, situated at the mouth of the Danube River, which presented high levels of water stratification, because of the fresh water discharged by the river; and area B, situated 35 miles south, where the water was less stratified and more oxygenated. and a hint : Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers. Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes.

The rocket's main components are designed by Boeing's Defense, Space & Security division and built in the United Launch Alliance (ULA) facility in Decatur, Alabama. Final assembly is completed at the launch site by ULA. The rockets were designed to launch payloads into orbit for the United States Air Force Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program and commercial satellite business. Delta IV rockets are available in five versions: Medium, Medium+ (4,2), Medium+ (5,2), Medium+ (5,4), and Heavy, to cover a range of payload size and weight. Delta IV was primarily designed to satisfy the needs of the U.S. military. - A Launch service provider (LSP) is a type of company which specialises in launching spacecraft. It is responsible for the ordering, conversion, or construction of the carrier rocket, assembly and stacking, payload integration, and ultimately conducting the launch itself. Some of these tasks may be delegated or sub-contracted to other companies. For example, the United Launch Alliance subcontracts the production of GEM solid rocket motors for its Atlas V, Delta II and Delta IV rockets to Alliant Techsystems. An LSP does not necessarily build all the rockets it launches. - A rocket (from Italian \\"rocchetto\\" \\"bobbin\\") is a missile, spacecraft, aircraft or other vehicle that obtains thrust from a rocket engine. Rocket engine exhaust is formed entirely from propellant carried within the rocket before use. Rocket engines work by action and reaction and push rockets forward simply by expelling their exhaust in the opposite direction at high speed, and can therefore work in the vacuum of space. - A geosynchronous transfer orbit or geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) is a Hohmann transfer orbit used to reach geosynchronous or geostationary orbit using high thrust chemical engines. It is a highly elliptical Earth orbit with an apogee of , or above sea level, which corresponds to the geostationary (GEO) altitude. The period of a standard geosynchronous transfer orbit is about 10.5 hours. The argument of perigee is such that apogee occurs on or near the equator. Perigee can be anywhere above the atmosphere, but is usually restricted to a few hundred kilometers above the Earth's surface to reduce launcher delta-V (formula_1V) requirements and to limit the orbital lifetime of the spent booster so as to curtail space junk. If using low-thrust engines such as electrical propulsion to get from the transfer orbit to geostationary orbit, the transfer orbit can be supersynchronous (having an apogee above the final geosynchronous orbit). This method however takes much longer to achieve due to the low thrust injected into the orbit. The typical launch vehicle injects the satellite to a supersynchronous orbit having the apogee above 42,164 km. The satellite's low thrust engines are thrusted continuously around the geostationary transfer orbits in an inertial direction. This inertial direction is set to be in the velocity vector at apogee but with an outer plane direction. The outer plane direction removes the initial inclination set by the initial transfer orbit while the inner plane direction raises simultaneously the perigee and lowers the apogee of the intermediate geostationary transfer orbit. In case of using the Hohmann transfer orbit, only a few days are required to reach the geosynchronous orbit. By using low thrust engines or electrical propulsion, months are required until the satellite reaches its final orbit. - Delta II is an American space launch system, originally designed and built by McDonnell Douglas. Delta II is part of the Delta rocket family and entered service in 1989. Delta II vehicles included the Delta 6000, and two Delta 7000 variants (\\"Light\\" and \\"Heavy\\"). - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a . The term \\"bit\\" is a portmanteau of binary digit. In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit \\"shannon\\", named after Claude Shannon. - Alliant Techsystems Inc. (ATK) was an American aerospace, defense, and sporting goods company with its headquarters in Arlington County, Virginia, in the United States. The company operated in 22 states, Puerto Rico, and other countries. ATK's revenue in the 2014 fiscal year was about US4.78 billion. - Atlas V is an active expendable launch system in the Atlas rocket family. Atlas V was formerly operated by Lockheed Martin, and is now operated by the Lockheed Martin-Boeing joint venture United Launch Alliance (ULA). Each Atlas V rocket uses a Russian-built RD-180 engine burning kerosene and liquid oxygen to power its first stage and an American-built RL10 engine burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen to power its Centaur upper stage. The RD-180 engines are provided by RD Amross, while Aerojet Rocketdyne provides both the RL10 engines and the strap-on boosters used in some configurations. The standard payload fairing sizes are 4 or 5 meters in diameter and of various lengths. Fairings sizes as large as 7.2 m in diameter and up to 32.3 m in length have been considered. The rocket is assembled in Decatur, Alabama and Harlingen, Texas. - Arianespace SA is a French multinational company founded in 1980 as the world 's first commercial launch service provider . It undertakes the production , operation , and marketing of the Ariane programme . The main launch vehicles offered by the company are the Ariane 5 , the Soyuz - 2 as a medium - lift alternative , and the Vega as a lighter one . As of 2008 , more than 240 commercial launches have occurred since May 22 , 1984 . Arianespace states that the total number of launch contracts signed since Ariane launches commenced operations in 1984 is 285 . Arianespace uses the Centre Spatial Guyanais in French Guiana as a launch site . It has its headquarters in Courcouronnes , Essonne , France , near Évry . On 21 October 2011 Arianespace launched the first Soyuz rocket ever from outside former Soviet territory . The payload was two Galileo navigation satellites . - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - An expendable launch system is a launch system that uses an expendable launch vehicle (ELV) to carry a payload into space. The vehicles used in expendable launch systems are designed to be used only once (i.e. they are \\"expended\\" during a single flight), and their components are not recovered for re-use after launch. The vehicle typically consists of several rocket stages, discarded one by one as the vehicle gains altitude and speed. - Ariane 5 is a European heavy lift launch vehicle that is part of the Ariane rocket family, an expendable launch system used to deliver payloads into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) or low Earth orbit (LEO). Ariane 5 rockets are manufactured under the authority of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales. Airbus Defence and Space is the prime contractor for the vehicles, leading a consortium of sub-contractors. Ariane 5 is operated and marketed by Arianespace as part of the \\"Ariane\\" programme.

The premise reveals: 1. The subject: a group of teenagers. 2. The action: waiting to cross the street. Now, let us examine the hypothesis in question: \\"The group of teenagers is in the middle of the street.\\" This statement describes a potential location of the teenagers, specifically in the middle of the street. To determine whether the hypothesis is true or false based on the premise, we need to consider if the information provided in the premise leads us to believe that the teenagers are indeed in the middle of the street. Upon close examination of the premise, we can infer that the group of teenagers is most likely on the sidewalk, near the street, or at an intersection as they are \\"waiting to cross the street\\". If the teenagers were already in the middle of the street, the most logical assumption would be that they are in the process of crossing the street or that they have some intention other than just waiting to cross. Furthermore, the action \\"waiting\\" implies anticipation and preparation for a certain event—in this case, crossing the street—rather than being in the process of the event. In conclusion, while the provided premise does offer some information about the location and actions of the teenagers, it does not give us enough data to confirm or deny the hypothesis that \\"The group of teenagers is in the middle of the street.\\" The premise suggests that the teenagers are waiting to cross the street, possibly being near a sidewalk or an intersection, but it does not explicitly state their exact location.

Article: Somehow, the conservative jurist's arguments in prior opinions have become a regular feature in lower court rulings legalizing gay marriage. The latest example came Thursday in a decision by renowned Judge Richard Posner of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, with whom Scalia has an ongoing feud. Posner wrote an impassioned opinion for a unanimous three-judge panel to overturn gay marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana. He said three past Supreme Court decisions in favor of gay rights — Romer v. Evans, Lawrence v. Texas and United States v. Windsor — didn't necessarily make gay marriage a constitutional right, although he noted that Scalia had suggested otherwise. \\"But Justice Scalia, in a dissenting opinion in Lawrence ... joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Thomas, thought not. He wrote that 'principle and logic' would require the Court, given its decision in Lawrence, to hold that there is a constitutional right to same-sex marriage,\\" Posner wrote for the Court. He was referring to Scalia's passionate dissent in a 2003 case which prohibited states from outlawing consensual same-sex sodomy. Scalia declared at the time that the Court had endorsed the \\"homosexual agenda\\" and had effectively knocked down the legal argument for prohibiting gay marriage. \\"Today's opinion dismantles the structure of constitutional law that has permitted a distinction to be made between heterosexual and homosexual unions, insofar as formal recognition in marriage is concerned,\\" Scalia wrote. He made a similar prediction in the 2013 ruling that axed the Defense of Marriage Act. It was a cheeky move by Posner. As Garrett Epps, a constitutional law professor at the University of Baltimore, argued recently in The Atlantic, Scalia may have ironically made it likelier that lower courts rule for gay marriage by insisting that the Supreme Court had quashed the legal justification against it. Scalia and Posner, both appointed by Ronald Reagan, have been feuding for several years. In 2012, Posner wrote a lengthy piece in The New Republic attacking Scalia's newly published book, arguing that the justice's philosophy of \\"originalism\\" was a smokescreen for the goal of achieving conservative ideological outcomes. Scalia accused the judge of lying and the two have been critical of one another ever since. ||||| A box of cupcakes are seen topped with icons of same-sex couples at City Hall in San Francisco, June 29, 2013. WASHINGTON A U.S. appeals court judge known for his outspoken views described arguments by Wisconsin and Indiana defending bans on gay marriage as \\"totally implausible\\" on Thursday, in a ruling in favor of same-sex couples. Judge Richard Posner, appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1981, wrote the unanimous decision on behalf of a three-judge panel of the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The court ruled against the bans. The unusually swift decision, issued just over a week after the court heard oral arguments in two different cases, does not take immediate effect and is unlikely do so until the U.S. Supreme Court weighs in during its coming term. The arguments advanced by both states in defense of the bans were \\"totally implausible,\\" wrote Posner, 75 and the panel's lone Republican appointee. \\"Heterosexuals get drunk and pregnant, producing unwanted children; their reward is to be allowed to marry. Homosexual couples do not produce unwanted children; their reward is to be denied the right to marry. Go figure,\\" Posner said. Posner has written dozens of books, including one about economics and intellectual property law. He also is a founding author of a blog on law and economics. Two years ago he engaged in an unusual public spat with Justice Antonin Scalia, a leading conservative on the Supreme Court. In a review of Scalia's new book, Posner wrote the justice's judicial opinions deviated from the strict, text-based approach to interpreting law espoused in his book. Scalia, also appointed by Reagan, publicly disagreed. EQUAL PROTECTION The ruling said the bans on gay marriage in the two states violated the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law. Two other federal appeals courts have ruled the same way, striking down bans in Virginia, Utah and Oklahoma. The Supreme Court is expected to weigh in on the gay marriage issue during its coming term, which starts in October and ends in June 2015. More than 30 courts overall have ruled in favor of gay marriage since a Supreme Court ruling in June 2013 struck down a key part of the 1996 federal Defense of Marriage Act under which states could refuse to recognize same-sex marriages from other states. A federal judge in Louisiana bucked the trend on Wednesday when he upheld that state's ban. Gay marriage is legal in 19 of the 50 states and in Washington, D.C. Wisconsin will appeal the ruling, said a spokeswoman for the state's attorney general, J.B. Van Hollen, a Republican. “The attorney general has always believed that this case will ultimately be decided by the United States Supreme Court,\\" spokeswoman Dana Brueck said. Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller said in a statement that he will seek a suspension of the appeals court ruling and hopes for a quick decision from the Supreme Court. Hoosiers Unite for Marriage, a gay rights group that backed the challenge to Indiana's ban, said in a statement that its members were \\"incredibly grateful\\" that the court ruled so quickly in favor of couples who want to get married. Larry Dupuis, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin, who has helped litigate the case, said he hoped state officials would \\"see the light on this\\" and end their defense of the ban. (Additional reporting by Brendan O'Brien; Editing by Frances Kerry, Grant McCool and Howard Goller) |||||Summary:","completion":"The article discusses how conservative jurist Justice Scalia's previous arguments have become a recurring part of lower court rulings that legalize gay marriage. Specifically, it speaks about a case ruled by Judge Richard Posner of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, who used Scalia’s arguments to overturn gay marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana. Scalia and Posner, despite both being appointed by Ronald Reagan, have an ongoing feud due to their clashing viewpoints on legal principles and rulings. Interestingly, Posner, in his argument, cited Scalia's dissenting opinion in a past Supreme Court case Lawrence v. Texas. In this 2003 case, the court ruled against the outlawing of consensual same-sex sodomy. Scalia in his dissent, held that the court’s ruling in this matter would inevitably lead towards the constitutional recognition of same-sex marriages. He contended that it was a contradiction for the same court to hold constitutional prohibitions against same-sex marriage when it had endorsed the right to same-sex sodomy. This dissent of Scalia was applied by Posner as he argued for the rights of same-sex marriages, bouncing off from Scalia’s past arguments, and using them, ironically, to uphold the opposite of what Scalia intended. Therefore, while Scalia had tried to argue for the traditional conservative prohibition against gay marriage, his arguments were used instead to uphold the constitutionality of same-sex marriages. This led to the humorously ironic situation of Scalia inadvertently contributing to the legal arguments favoring gay marriage. This dynamic signifies the ongoing evolution of legal thought on the matter, with past dissenting opinions being utilized in favor of the issue they were designed to contest. It highlights the transforming landscape of constitutional law, which now includes the inherent right to same-sex marriage. The pushback against traditional conservative views embodied by Scalia’s past dissent is also shown in the courts’ unanimous decisions that reject bans on gay marriage, and instead, uphold the constitutionality of same-sex marriages, utilizing the argument of equal protection under the constitution. The article finally includes the perspective of states that had their bans on gay marriage overturned. Wisconsin, for one, announced its intention to appeal the ruling, insisting that the decision regarding gay marriage will eventually fall under the jurisdiction of the US Supreme Court. Indiana also plans to challenge the court ruling, hoping for an expedited Supreme Court decision. Member groups of those opposing the ban find the quick court ruling in favor of same-sex marriages as a positive step forward. The article sets the stage for the expected Supreme Court hearing on the matter of same-sex marriage. Amidst the shifting viewpoints and the utilization of legal principles in nuanced ways, the final decision of the Supreme Court will be the ultimate declaration on the matter of constitutionality of same-sex marriages."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Information: - A graduate school (sometimes shortened as grad school) is a school that awards advanced academic degrees (i.e. master's and doctoral degrees) with the general requirement that students must have earned a previous undergraduate (bachelor's) degree with a high grade point average. A distinction is typically made between graduate schools (where courses of study vary in the degree to which they provide training for a particular profession) and professional schools, which offer specialized advanced degrees in professional fields such as medicine, nursing, business, engineering, or law. The distinction between graduate schools and professional schools is not absolute, as various professional schools offer graduate degrees (e.g., some nursing schools offer a master's degree in nursing). Also, some graduate degrees train students for a specific profession (e.g. an MSc or a PhD in epidemiology trains a person to be an epidemiologist). - The Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) is the teaching hospital and biomedical research facility of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, located in Baltimore City, Maryland, U.S. It was founded in 1889 using money from a bequest by philanthropist Johns Hopkins. Johns Hopkins Hospital and the school of medicine are the founding institutions of modern American medicine and the birthplace of numerous medical traditions including rounds, residents and housestaff. Many medical specialties were formed at the hospital including neurosurgery, by Harvey Cushing; cardiac surgery by Alfred Blalock; and pediatrics and child psychiatry, by Leo Kanner. - Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. - The Johns Hopkins University (commonly referred to as Johns Hopkins, JHU, or simply Hopkins) is an American private research university in Baltimore, Maryland. Founded in 1876, the university was named for its first benefactor, the American entrepreneur, abolitionist, and philanthropist Johns Hopkins. His 7 million bequestof which half financed the establishment of The Johns Hopkins Hospitalwas the largest philanthropic gift in the history of the United States at that time. Daniel Coit Gilman, who was inaugurated as the institution's first president on February 22, 1876, led the university to revolutionize higher education in the U.S. by integrating teaching and research. Adopting the concept of a graduate school from Germany's ancient Heidelberg University, Johns Hopkins University is considered the first research university in the United States. - John Lewis Holland (October 21, 1919 November 27, 2008) was an American psychologist and Professor Emeritus of Sociology at Johns Hopkins University. He was the creator of the career development model, \\"Holland Occupational Themes,\\" otherwise known as The Holland Codes. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - Daniel Coit Gilman (July 6, 1831 October 13, 1908) was an American educator and academic. Gilman was instrumental in founding the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale College, and subsequently served as the third president of the University of California, as the first president of Johns Hopkins University, and as founding president of the Carnegie Institution. He was also co-founder of the Russell Trust Association, which administers the business affairs of Yale's Skull and Bones society. Gilman served for twenty five years as president of Johns Hopkins; his inauguration in 1876 has been said to mark \\"the starting point of postgraduate education in the U.S.\\" - Heidelberg University (informally Heidelberg) is a public research university located in the town of Heidelberg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Founded in 1386 on instruction of Pope Urban VI, Heidelberg is Germany's oldest university and one of the world's oldest surviving universities. It was the third university established in the Holy Roman Empire. - Professor (commonly abbreviated as \\"prof.\\") is an academic rank at universities and other post-secondary education and research institutions in most countries. Literally, \\"professor\\" derives from Latin as a \\"person who professes\\" being usually an expert in arts or sciences, a teacher of the highest rank. - A psychologist is a professional who evaluates and studies behavior and mental processes (see also psychology). Typically, psychologists must have completed a university degree in psychology, which is a master's degree in some countries and a doctorate in others. This definition of psychologist is non-exclusive; in most jurisdictions, members of other professions (such as counselors and psychiatrists) can also evaluate, diagnose, treat, and study mental processes. Some psychologists, such as clinical and counseling psychologists, provide mental health care, and some psychologists, such as social or organizational psychologists conduct research and provide consultation services. - The Holland Codes or the Holland Occupational Themes ( RIASEC ) refers to a theory of careers and vocational choice ( based upon personality types ) that was initially developed by American psychologist John L. Holland ( 1919 - 2008 ) , Professor Emeritus of Sociology at Johns Hopkins University . The US Department of Labor ETA has been using an updated and expanded version of the RIASEC model in the \`\` Interests '' section of its free online database , The Occupational Information Network ( O * NET ) , since its inception during the late 1990s . - Expert is defined differently in varying academic fields. Psychology defines an expert using superior performance; sociology considers that expertise is a label given to an individual by a group and is interested in the power held by experts; philosophy stresses the kind of knowledge held by experts but not novices. Informally, an expert is someone widely recognized as a reliable source of technique or skill whose faculty for judging or deciding rightly, justly, or wisely is accorded authority and status by peers or the public in a specific well-distinguished domain. An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive knowledge or ability based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study. Experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study. An expert can be believed, by virtue of credential, training, education, profession, publication or experience, to have special knowledge of a subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may officially (and legally) rely upon the individual's opinion. Historically, an expert was referred to as a sage (Sophos). The individual was usually a profound thinker distinguished for wisdom and sound judgment. - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.

Tamir then replaces Aladeen with a dimwitted political decoy named Efawadh (Baron Cohen), whom he intends to manipulate into signing a document nominally democratizing Wadiya while opening the country's oil fields to Chinese and other foreign vested interests. Aladeen escapes after Clayton accidentally kills himself in a botched torture attempt; when his corpse is discovered Tamir thinks Aladeen has been killed. However, Aladeen is practically unrecognizable as Clayton shaved off his trademark long beard prior to his death.

Plot Summary: Act I: In the bustling city of Los Angeles, aspiring filmmaker, Michael Thompson, is eager to make his mark on the film industry. Despite his undeniable talent, Michael's career is at a standstill, having made only a handful of short films that have received lukewarm receptions. In a stroke of luck, he crosses paths with Deon Taylor, the head of Deon Taylor Enterprises, a successful film production company. Impressed by Michael's raw talent, Deon offers him the opportunity to direct a feature film with a limited budget. With a mix of excitement and apprehension, Michael accepts the offer and quickly hires a team consisting of crew members and actors. He begins scouting for locations and finalizing the script, which revolves around a daring heist in the criminal underworld. Act II: As filming progresses, Michael and his team become increasingly aware that certain inexplicable events are taking place around them. Equipment mysteriously goes missing, shadowy figures lurk around the set, and several anonymous threats are sent to Michael. Despite these ominous signs, the crew decides to press on, determined to complete the project. To protect themselves, Michael hires a private investigator to uncover who or what might be attempting to sabotage his film. In the course of the investigation, the PI discovers that the script Michael has been given to work on is, in fact, based on a top-secret heist planned by a notorious crime syndicate. Worse still, the syndicate is fully aware that their plans have been exposed and will stop at nothing to protect their operation. Act III: With this newfound knowledge, Michael and his crew find themselves caught between their passion for making the film and the imminent danger looming over them. As the syndicate close in on them to ensure their silence, Michael devises a risky plan to protect his team and prevent the actual heist from taking place. Using their filmmaking skills and equipment to their advantage, Michael and his crew stage elaborate set pieces and orchestrate carefully timed action sequences to outsmart and stay one step ahead of the crime syndicate. In the climactic final scene, the team confronts the crime boss and exposes the heist to the authorities. In the end, Michael and his crew's bravery, quick thinking, and devotion to their passion for cinema saves their lives and inadvertently prevents a criminal heist from being executed. The film they make during this harrowing experience garners critical acclaim and significant success, launching the careers of Michael and his team into a bright and promising future in the movie industry.

Question: \\"Which discipline of natural history would be last alphabetically?\\" Context: \\"A genre that greatly rose in importance was that of scientific literature. Natural history in particular became increasingly popular among the upper classes. Works of natural history include René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur's Histoire naturelle des insectes and Jacques Gautier d'Agoty's La Myologie complète, ou description de tous les muscles du corps humain (1746). Outside ancien régime France, natural history was an important part of medicine and industry, encompassing the fields of botany, zoology, meteorology, hydrology and mineralogy. Students in Enlightenment universities and academies were taught these subjects to prepare them for careers as diverse as medicine and theology. As shown by M D Eddy, natural history in this context was a very middle class pursuit and operated as a fertile trading zone for the interdisciplinary exchange of diverse scientific ideas.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"Zoology. In the given context, natural history encompasses a wide range of scientific disciplines, including botany, zoology, meteorology, hydrology, and mineralogy. These disciplines focus on various aspects of the natural world, ranging from plants, animals, and the Earth's atmosphere to the study of water and minerals. When considering the disciplines alphabetically, the last one alphabetically is zoology. Zoology is a branch of biology that deals with the study of animals and their classifications, behavior, distribution, physiology, and evolution. This discipline covers organisms from the smallest invertebrates, like insects and microscopic organisms, to the largest mammals, such as elephants and whales. Zoological research provides valuable insights into the diversity of organisms, their life processes, and their relationship with the environment and other living beings. During the Enlightenment period, natural history gained significant importance and popularity, especially among the upper classes. This era saw the rise of scientific literature that was primarily focused on the observation, classification, and description of the natural world. Works such as René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur's Histoire naturelle des insectes and Jacques Gautier d'Agoty's La Myologie complète, ou description de tous les muscles du corps humain (1746) were essential additions to the field of natural history. These and other publications helped to generate scientific knowledge and exchange ideas across various disciplines. Natural history disciplines were integral to both medicine and industry during this time and were taught to students in universities and academies to prepare them for a myriad of careers, including medicine and theology. As noted by M D Eddy, natural history provided an ideal platform for promoting interdisciplinary discussions, bringing together different scientific ideas and fostering a collaborative pursuit of knowledge among the middle class. In conclusion, of the disciplines of natural history mentioned in the context provided, the last one alphabetically is zoology. The popularity of natural history during the Enlightenment period contributed to the growth of scientific literature and led to remarkable advancements in the understanding of the natural world, which in turn had significant implications for medical, industrial, and educational pursuits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: U.S. voters head to the polls in November for a high-stakes congressional midterm election in which Republican control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate appears to be in jeopardy. The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms. Historically, the president's party usually loses congressional seats two years after winning the White House.The losses are usually worse if the president's public approval rating is under 50 percent. Trump's approval has recently averaged about 41 percent. Question: After the end of this story, did Trump probably: Options: - not enough information - Keep the same amount of congress seats - Gain congress seats - Lose congress seats A:","completion":"Lose congress seats"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: ANN ARBOR, Mich. — Katy Bodenmiller was worried about the proposed pipeline work near her house in Groveland Township, Mich., so she started looking for help. She emailed U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) asking about the project being pushed by a Canadian pipeline company called Enbridge Inc., which spilled 20,000 barrels of tar sands oil in Michigan in 2010. The email response from Stabenow’s office: A form letter about the proposed Keystone XL pipeline — a different pipeline project proposed by another company altogether,TransCanada Corp. The next big oil pipeline battle is here, and hardly anybody knows about it. “It saddens me to say that all evidence points to us being better informed about this project than our elected officials,” Bodenmiller said. “But that's only because officials and the press, with a few exceptions, have failed to advocate for those they serve.” A few weeks after she received the form letter -- and after The Times asked Stabenow's office for comment -- a staffer called to apologize for the mix-up, Bodenmiller said. Alberta-based Enbridge is moving forward with 8.8-billion worth of plans to greatly expand its U.S. pipeline network to pump more oil through nearly a dozen states. That work includes the construction of two new pipelines from Illinois and Texas and the expansion of a line running through Bodenmiller’s property in Michigan that will move 500,000 barrels per day through the state once completed. A somewhat similar effort by TransCanada to build an 830,000-barrel-per-day pipeline extension from Canada to the Texas coast — called Keystone XL — met national opposition from landowners, politicians and environmentalists. Their pressure put part of the project on hold because of a federal approval process managed by the State Department that allows the U.S. government to deny pipeline projects. That hasn’t happened to Enbridge, even though one of the company's proposed pipeline projects would take 850,000 barrels per day from Oklahoma to the Texas coast. A nuance in federal law allows Enbridge to improve its pipelines inside the U.S. as long as the work doesn’t cross the Canadian border, meaning the State Department does not have to approve. Enbridge is moving forward at the local and state level without the same friction faced by its competitor with Keystone XL, and expects to complete most of its projects by 2014. Local environmentalists and residents, worried about Enbridge’s safety record and requests to work on their land, have begun opposing Enbridge’s projects on their own. Ernest “Junior” Hamilton, a 69-year-old Holly, Mich., resident, told The Times that Enbridge offered him 7,000 for pipeline work that would tear up his yard, remove all his trees, pass over his drinking well and ruin his septic system. Hamilton refused to cooperate and now has a court date to determine whether the company could exercise eminent domain and take his land to do its work. “If the judge says, ‘OK, you can take his property,’ it’s done,” Hamilton said. “I just paid it off last year. Paid on it for 30 years, and now a judge can say [to Enbridge], ‘Oh, you can have it because you feel the need.' \\" Hamilton added, “Hopefully it will get somebody else’s attention, what they’re doing. Because it isn’t just me living out in the sticks.” The company says it has followed all the rules, contacting landowners to notify them and negotiating to secure the necessary property easements. Now environmental groups are discovering the limitations they face in opposing Enbridge’s projects state by state and county by county. In contrast, the Keystone XL battle provided a national platform. Activists with the Indiana environmental group Save the Dunes said Enbridge was avoiding their request to hold a state-level meeting with residents and environmental groups about pipeline work in Indiana’s three northwest counties. “Up to this point, we believe that the public has not been adequately informed of the project [in Indiana], and Enbridge has so far declined our request for a public meeting of state, federal and local regulators and concerned citizens,” Nathan Pavlovic, a land and advocacy specialist for the group, told The Times in an email. An Enbridge spokesman said the company had already held an open house with local residents and offered to meet privately with Save the Dunes about the project.","completion":"Enbridge's Quiet Pipeline Expansion Sparks Concerns Among Locals and Environmentalists"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the person that released Off the Wall? is inside the article: Jackson explored genres including pop, soul, rhythm and blues, funk, rock, disco, post-disco, dance-pop and new jack swing. Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful. Its tracks included the ballads \\"The Lady in My Life\\", \\"Human Nature\\", and \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", the funk pieces \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", and the disco set \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\".With Off the Wall, Jackson's \\"vocabulary of grunts, squeals, hiccups, moans, and asides\\" vividly showed the singer's maturation into an adult, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and Stevie Wonder's \\"oddball\\" music personas: \\"Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed.\\" With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted this on the songs \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\". In \\"Billie Jean\\", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child, and in \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" he argues against gossip and the media. \\"Beat It\\" decried gang violence in a homage to West Side Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey. He also observed that the title track \\"Thriller\\" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the supernatural, a topic he revisited in subsequent years.

Vaccinations: Vaccinations work by preparing the immune system to fight against specific diseases. They do not prevent particles from entering the respiratory system.

They do not protect the respiratory system from harmful particles like mold. Therefore, layers of fat will not help in this situation. 3. Deep breaths: Deep breaths can actually cause more particles to be inhaled into the respiratory system. So, this option is not suitable. 4.

Therefore, sweating is not the right choice. 5. A breathing mask: A breathing mask is specifically designed to filter out harmful particles from the air before they enter the respiratory system. This is a suitable option for keeping mold from entering the respiratory system. 6. Moisture: Mold requires moisture to grow and thrive. Moisture cannot protect the respiratory system from mold particles. In fact, high moisture can promote mold growth. 7. Organic molecules: Organic molecules make up living organisms, but they do not provide protection from mold particles in the respiratory system. 8. Hydrogen and oxygen: Hydrogen and oxygen are elements that combine to form water molecules. They do not offer protection against mold particles entering the respiratory system. Based on the analysis, the most suitable option to keep mold from entering the respiratory system is using a breathing mask. A breathing mask filters the air and prevents harmful particles, such as mold spores, from entering the respiratory system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: This article: Barbie stars as Genevieve, one of twelve princesses who live in a castle with their widowed father, King Randolph. The princesses have adventurous and free-spirited natures that are viewed as \\"unladylike\\" and \\"non-proper\\" by other members of the royal society. This leads King Randolph to summon his cousin, Duchess Rowena, to the castle to help raise the princesses. Unbeknownst to King Randolph, Rowena plans to poison him and get rid of his daughters so that she can become queen. Attempting to break the princesses' spirits, Rowena makes their lives miserable by stripping the castle of everything they love, making them wear grey dresses and banishing singing and dancing. The princesses find comfort in their late mother's favorite story, which tells of a magical kingdom where golden flowers grant wishes and princesses can dance at an enchanted pavilion for three nights. The princesses realize that the story contains clues on how to enter the magical kingdom from their own bedroom, by dancing on specific stones on the floor from oldest to youngest. Now inside the magical kingdom, the princesses discover that the water there possesses healing properties. The next day, the princesses appear tired and the duchess finds their new dancing shoes worn through, arousing her suspicion. The royal cobbler and Genevieve's love interest, Derek, comes to fix their shoes and sees that they are covered in gold dust. When King Randolph mysteriously falls ill, Genevieve is prompted to ask Derek to investigate Rowena's true intentions. That night, the princesses return to the magical kingdom to dance. During this time, Derek discovers that Rowena is stealing heirlooms from the castle and dealing with an apothecary, and he rushes back to the castle. contains an answer for the question: Who is planned to be poisoned?, what is it ?

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What has there been a drastic decline in over the past 100 years that is probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water? ? Although The Big Cypress is the largest growth of cypress swamps in South Florida, such swamps—as well as portions of sawgrass marshes—can be found near the Atlantic Coastal Ridge and between Lake Okeechobee and the Eastern flatwoods. Hardwood hammocks and pineland are often interspersed with the cypress ecosystem. Much like tree islands that are colloquially referred to as \\"heads\\", cypress trees grow in formations that resemble domes, with the tallest and thickest trunks in the center, rooted in the deepest peat. As the peat thins out, cypresses continue to grow, but are smaller and thinner, giving the small forest the appearance of a dome. They also grow in strands, slightly elevated on a plateau of limestone and surrounded on two sides by sloughs. Other hardwood trees can be found in cypress domes, such as red maple (Acer rubrum), swamp bay (Persea palustris), and pop ash (Fraxinus caroliniana). If cypresses are removed, hardwoods take over, and the ecosystem is recategorized as a mixed swamp forest. Because the cypress domes and strands retain moisture and block out much of the sunlight, plants such as orchids, bromeliads, and ferns thrive in cypress domes and strands. Orchids bloom throughout the year in cypress heads, and bromeliads appear in many varieties; on Fakahatchee Strand alone, thirteen species have been documented. Bromeliads collect moisture from rain and humidity in the bases of their leaves, which also nurture frogs, lizards and various insects. Wood storks (Mycteria americana) nest almost exclusively in cypress forests and in the past 100 years have seen a dramatic decline, probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water. Wood storks' reproductive cycles coincide with the dry season, when small fish and amphibians are trapped in shallow pools and puddles. When water from canals or locks is released too soon or not at all, storks are unable to find enough food for themselves and their offspring. An estimated 20,000 wood storks nested in The Big Cypress in the 1930s, but by the... A:","completion":"Based on the given article, there has been a drastic decline in the population of wood storks (Mycteria americana) over the past 100 years, which is probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water. Wood storks primarily nest in cypress forests, and their reproductive cycles are closely linked with the availability of small fish and amphibians, which tend to get trapped in shallow pools and puddles during the dry season. Controlled water, such as water released from canals or locks, when not managed properly, can disturb the natural feeding patterns of wood storks. When water is released too soon or not at all, it drastically affects the food supply for these birds, making it difficult for them to find enough sustenance for themselves and their offspring. This disruption in their feeding and reproductive cycles has led to a significant decline in their population levels. In the 1930s, it was estimated that around 20,000 wood storks nested in The Big Cypress, but the article does not mention the current population; however, it can be inferred that there has been a substantial decrease due to the mentioned factors. This highlights the importance of understanding and preserving delicate ecosystems and ensuring that human interventions, such as controlled water systems, do not have adverse consequences on local flora and fauna."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Are the particles in Beaker X more or less likely to bump into each other than the particles in Beaker A? Hint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage.

The price of basic food such as wheat and corn has stayed the same for quite a long time,about 30 years.But as the world's population is getting bigger,there's more pressure to feed more people,plus there's less land and water to go round. Another reason is climate change.Droughts and floods make it hard to grow crops like rice and grain.The price of oil has gone up and that makes it more expensive for farmers to run their tractors and to transport the food they make.And lots of fields are being used to grow crops to make other things that can't be eaten--which is bad news for hungry people. The main losers are poor people who live in cities in poor countries,who are facing higher prices for food.Some people are doing well out of the food crisis though.Farmers in rich countries like the US,Canada and Australia are getting record prices for their harvests.

Context: WHITE HOUSE — The United States is escalating trans-Atlantic and North American trade tensions, imposing a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports from the European Union, Canada and Mexico beginning on Friday. The U.S. also negotiated quotas or volume limits on other countries, such as South Korea, Argentina, Australia and Brazil, instead of tariffs, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross also told reporters Thursday by telephone. China's foreign ministry said on Friday all countries should protect the normal trade order, when asked about U.S. decision. President Donald Trump said Thursday that the days of the U.S. being taken advantage of in trade deals \\"are over'\\" in a harshly worded statement responding to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's criticism of new steel and aluminum tariffs. He intensified his criticism of Canada Friday for what he says are the country's \\"highly restrictive\\" trade practices. Trump has repeatedly said measures such as tariffs are necessary to protect American jobs and industries in key manufacturing sectors. \\"The president's actions are about protecting American steel, American aluminum,\\" a White House spokesman, Raj Shah, said on Fox News. \\"They're critical for national security.\\" But the negative reaction from some of America's most important strategic allies has been quick and fierce.

Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€. It’s a nice cool 14°C (57°F) down there, a lovely break from the hot summer weather above. It is damp in places and the ground can be slippery so watch your step as you walk.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person that George Grove helped?, using the article: In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine, professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music. Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war. During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871. With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals. Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society. The Société Nationale de Musique, with its motto, \\"Ars Gallica\\", had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc, Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members. As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems, Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first \\"poème symphonique\\" was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872. In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged. La princesse jaune (\\"The Yellow Princess\\"), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique, Paris in June. It ran for five performances.Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother. In 1875, he surprised many by marrying. The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils.

Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Facebook has a long track record and sordid history of abusing their users’ trust and privacy, including the most recent and egregious cases currently making headlines with Cambridge Analytica as well as election meddling in the US and Britain. As if that wasn’t enough, it then came to light that they have also been tracking and storing users’ phone call and text message data, including “who contacted whom, what time, and how long the conversation was.” This is nothing new, as we can see from this 2012 “study” in which they deliberately manipulated news feeds to influence users’ emotional state. And again with their settlement with the FCC back in 2011 (that they likely violated with their recent offenses) over deceiving consumers by telling them their information was private, but then repeatedly sharing it and making it public. And then there’s The Ugly Memo, in which a FB exec justifies growth at any cost in the name of connecting people, even if that results literally in people dying: We talk about the good and the bad of our work often. I want to talk about the ugly. We connect people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good. And up until this most recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook was negotiating with various healthcare organizations to share patients’ health data with FB so they could match it up to your social circle to allegedly provide better health care. Um yeah right. Each time this stuff happens, they issue an apology (or a justification for their behavior) and promise they will take steps to better inform users and protect their privacy, but it’s clear that this is just lip service at this point.

Answer the following question: where does the word pro bono come from?","completion":"The term \\"pro bono\\" is derived from Latin and has a rich historical and cultural significance in the context of providing services or expertise. To provide a detailed understanding of the origin and meaning of the term, it's helpful to break it down into its Latin components and explore their implications. The phrase \\"pro bono\\" is an abbreviation of the longer Latin term \\"pro bono publico,\\" which directly translates to \\"for the public good.\\" Let's examine each part of this phrase: 1. Pro: The Latin preposition \\"pro\\" carries the sense of \\"for\\" or \\"in favor of.\\" It is used to denote support, advocacy, or allegiance to a specific cause or entity. 2. Bono: \\"Bono\\" is the ablative singular form of the Latin noun \\"bonum,\\" which means \\"good\\" or \\"advantage.\\" In this context, it refers to the benefit or welfare of a larger collective, such as a community or society. 3. Publico: \\"Publico\\" is the ablative form of the Latin adjective \\"publicus,\\" which means \\"public\\" or \\"belonging to the people.\\" It denotes a collective group or entity rather than a private individual or organization. When combined, \\"pro bono publico\\" emphasizes rendering services for the benefit and welfare of the general public rather than for private gain or profit. In the modern context, the term \\"pro bono\\" is predominantly used in connection with the legal profession to denote legal services offered voluntarily and without any financial cost to individuals, nonprofit organizations, or social causes that may not be able to afford adequate legal representation. The roots of the pro bono concept can be traced back to ancient Roman law and that era's emphasis on social responsibility. Lawyers in the Roman Empire were known to provide legal assistance to help less fortunate community members. Over time, as modern legal systems evolved, the principle of providing legal services pro bono endured and became an important component of ethical conduct for legal professionals. In today's world, many law firms, bar associations, and legal aid organizations encourage attorneys to take up pro bono work as a part of their regular practice to help increase access to justice for the underprivileged, to advance public interest causes, and to increase goodwill towards the legal profession in general. While not universally mandated, some jurisdictions have implemented pro bono requirements for legal professionals as a part of their licensure obligations. In summary, the word \\"pro bono\\" comes from the Latin phrase \\"pro bono publico,\\" meaning \\"for the public good.\\" It has a strong historical foundation rooted in ancient Roman law and serves as an enduring reminder of the social responsibility and ethical obligation of legal professionals to provide services for the benefit of their communities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Many people think boiled water is safe and good to people's health. In fact, it is not true. The boiling point of water is 100degC. By boiling it, most bacteria in water can be killed. In the past, the water was less polluted. So boiling was a good way to make clean water. But heavy metals and other dangerous things in today's water are much more terrible than bacteria. Boiling doesn't fix that problem. And boiling water may give us more of the dangerous things in our glass. 4. Never use soft drinks to take the place of water. 5. Water is also needed in winter. 6. Drink water at the right time. 1) After getting up in the morning, you have less water in your body, because you weren't drinking for the whole night.

Anger: Warwickshire Chief Fire Officer Graeme Smith said the charges should never have been brought. The families of three firemen killed in a warehouse blaze have called a chief fire officer 'hypocritical', 'arrogant' and 'small minded' after he welcomed the acquittal of three long-serving firefighters who had been charged with manslaughter over the tragedy. Graeme Smith, the head of Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service, claimed Adrian Ashley, Paul Simmons and Timothy Woodward had been 'treated like common criminals' in the wake of the fatal fire at Atherstone-on-Stour in 2007. Jurors at Stafford Crown Court yesterday cleared watch manager Ashley, 45, and 51-year-old station manager Woodward of gross negligence manslaughter after hearing six weeks of evidence about the deaths of Ashley Stephens, Darren Yates-Badley, John Averis and Ian Reid. Watch manager Simmons, 50, was acquitted of the same charge on the directions of the judge part-way through the trial. Police never found the criminals who started the fire and £4.7million has been spent over five. years trying to pin blame for the losses on the managers who let the. firemen enter the building even though all employees had already been. accounted for. Speaking after the verdicts, Mr Smith said it was 'crystal clear' that the case should not have been brought to court and called for an investigation into why the three men were prosecuted. But at a press conference in Warwickshire today, relatives of Mr Stephens, Mr Reid and Mr Yates-Badley said they had been let down by Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service following the fire at a vegetable packing plant on November 2. The family of Mr Averis were present but decided not to speak. Ian Reid’s widow Julie said she had been devastated by the not guilty verdicts, adding: 'Why does Warwickshire chief fire officer Smith think this case should not have gone to court? Does he not think that where the evidence is there, action should be taken? 'Is he really that arrogant and small minded to think that firefighters are above the law? 'We are all accountable for our actions, even the police. No one is above the law. Victims: (clockwise from top left) Darren Yates-Badley, Ashley Stephens, Ian Reid and John Averis were killed tackling the blaze in Atherstone-on-Stour, Warwickshire, in 2007. Their families are angry at the fire service's reaction to the manslaughter acquittal. 'We have a legal process in this. country and if the police suspect a crime has been committed they are. duty bound to investigate and pass their findings to the Crown. Prosecution Service. 'The legal process will determine. whether charges should be brought, not the profession of an individual. The jury could not find guilt in this case. But if this case makes. incident commanders take one extra minute to assess the situation. presented on arriving at an incident then that can only be for the good. 'A firefighter’s life is not worth. less than that of a member of the public and it most certainly is not. worth a pallet of packing material.' Mrs Reid, who described the fire. service as a 'sleepy hollow', added: 'I do acknowledge that the. defendants and their families have had a difficult year with this. hanging over their heads but it is nothing compared to the heartache. that Sophie (the couple’s daughter) and I have suffered for four and a. half years. Cleared: Watch Manager Adrian Ashley and Station Manager Timothy Woodward were found not guilty of. manslaughter following the deaths of four firefighters killed when a roof collapsed during warehouse blaze. Cleared: Station Manager Timothy Woodward speaks to the media flanked by Watch Leaders Paul Simmonds and Adrian Ashley yesterday. The three men were cleared of causing the deaths of four colleagues. 'I lost my husband, who I loved very much, and Sophie lost the dad she adored. Our heartache and loss is permanent.' Paul Stephens, the firefighter father of Ashley Stephens, was present at the blaze that killed his son. In a statement read on his behalf by a. police liaison officer, he said: 'As his father, and at the time a. serving firefighter being present at the incident, having witnessed the. horrendous scene on that night has left me with images that will stay. with me forever - images so strong I have not been able to attend the. court hearing. 'The loss of Ashley has left such a big hole in our hearts that it is impossible to mend. 'Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service. gave us unlimited support up until the charges were brought against. three of their officers. After that it seemed we were on the wrong side. and support dwindled down to nothing. 'To hear the Chief Fire Officer speak. to the press saying their thoughts were with the families was very. hypocritical as the only family support shown has been to the. defendants’ families. Tragedy: Firefighters Ashley Stephens, Darren Yates-Badley, John Averis and Ian Reid were killed as they tackled the blaze in Atherstone-on-Stour, Warwickshire, in 2007. 'Ashley loved being part of the fire. service and wanted to become a full-time firefighter. It seems so unjust. that the full- time officers he would have looked up to have let him. down so badly.' Mandy Baylis, the mother of Darren Yates-Badley, said: 'That night will haunt me forever. 'I never thought I would feel so let. down by the fire service. They talk about brothers in arms and one big. family. This is not true in our case. 'Family and friends of Alcester Fire. Station, which we have been part of for 25 years, have crossed over the. street rather than speak to us. 'It’s as if we’ve done something. wrong. All we did is lose Darren in the most impossible way. Not to be. able to say goodbye... Darren didn’t deserve that.' Addressing the media at the end of the. trial, Chief Fire Officer Mr Smith said: 'It is crystal clear that. these cases should never have been brought to court. 'The police investigation into this fire took a wrong turn early on. Collapse: An aerial view shows the roof of the warehouse after it collapsed killing the four firefighters. The Fire Brigade Union said it was absurd that the arsonists who started the blaze had never faced trial, while those who struggled to put it out were 'relentlessly pursued' by police and the CPS. 'The police treated decent fire officers like common criminals and the arsonist who started this fire has got away with it. 'It has taken almost five years and. £5million of public money to construct a case against these three men. and when it was presented in court it simply fell apart.' During two days in the custody of. Warwickshire Police, Mr Simmons, Mr Ashley, and Mr Woodward had their. belts and shoelaces taken away and were also held at a police station. overnight between interviews. Mr Smith said Warwickshire Fire and. Rescue Service and the Chief Fire Officers’ Association intended to. write to the Home Secretary and the Justice Secretary to seek a formal. investigation why the firefighters were charged. After yesterday's verdicts, critics said. firemen may now hesitate before trying to save lives for fear they could. be arrested. Verdict:. After hearing six weeks of evidence jurors decided Mr Woodward and Mr. Ashley had not acted illegally during their command of the incident on. the evening of November 2 2007. The police officer in charge of the. inquiry, Detective Superintendent Ken Lawrence, insisted the. investigation was justified and said he hoped the fire service had. learned lessons from the tragedy. The union said it was absurd that the. arsonists who started the blaze had never faced trial, while those who. struggled to put it out were 'relentlessly pursued' by police and the. CPS. FBU assistant general. secretary Andy Dark said: 'This was the first time firefighters at an. incident were accused of the manslaughter of their colleagues. 'This prosecution cast a shadow across the whole fire service and caused anger and concern. 'We are relieved at the not-guilty verdicts but firefighters are furious at the police and prosecutors. 'The. criminals who started the fire are still free, but those who tried to. put the fire out were arrested, charged and brought to trial.'

Question: when does the electoral college votes? Would \\"The Twenty-third Amendment has always resulted in the District of Columbia having three electors.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"The Electoral College casts their votes after the general election in the United States. The election takes place every four years, on the first Tuesday of November. Once the general election is held, states certify their election results, which typically takes a few weeks after the election. The Electoral College members, called electors, then meet in December to cast their votes for the President and Vice President of the United States. These electors are chosen by the political parties in each state, and their number is based on the state's representation in Congress, with each state having a number of electors equal to the total of its Representatives and Senators. The District of Columbia (D.C.) is also allocated electoral votes, even though it does not have voting representation in Congress, due to the Twenty-third Amendment. As for your statement, \\"The Twenty-third Amendment has always resulted in the District of Columbia having three electors,\\" it accurately reflects the historical outcome of the amendment. Ratified in 1961, the Twenty-third Amendment granted the District of Columbia the ability to participate in presidential elections, by assigning it the same number of electors it would be entitled to if it were a state, up to the number of electors held by the least populous state. The least populous states have always had three electors, hence the District of Columbia has consistently been allocated three electoral votes. With the passage of the Twenty-third Amendment, citizens of D.C. have been able to cast their votes in presidential elections. However, it's important to bear in mind that the influence of the Electoral College goes beyond just the District of Columbia, as it determines the outcomes of presidential elections on a nationwide scale, with the candidate who receives the majority of electoral votes (270 or more) winning the presidency. In summary, the Twenty-third Amendment has always resulted in the District of Columbia having three electors. The Electoral College casts its votes in December following the general election, which is held on the first Tuesday of November every four years. The role of the Electoral College is significant in determining the winner of the U.S. presidential election."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Fact 2: Furthermore, the coating is an excellent electrical insulator. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"a coating does what to the transfer of electricity \\" with the following options: - amplifies - energy - heat - causes - slows - reduce - enables - retina Answer:","completion":"A coating, being an excellent electrical insulator, slows the transfer of electricity. Electrical insulators are materials that resist the flow of electric current, thereby reducing or preventing the transfer of electricity. The coating mentioned in Fact 2 serves as a protective barrier against electrical conduction, impeding the flow of electrical current and minimizing the transfer of electrical energy. In this scenario, the most appropriate answer from the given options is \\"slows,\\" as the primary function of an insulator is to slow down or inhibit the transfer of electricity. This is an essential property for many applications, such as electrical wiring, circuits, and devices, to ensure safety and efficiency. As the coating is an excellent electrical insulator (Fact 2), it does not amplify, enable, or cause the transfer of electricity.

The trio were part of Donegal's 2012 All-Ireland winning squad and all three collected three Ulster Senior titles. Toye, 33, was Donegal's longest serving player, having made his debut in 2002, but has suffered from injury and illness in recent years. Midfielder Kavanagh, 34, left the squad after the 2014 All-Ireland final but decided to return after a year out. Toye suffered a ruptured Achilles in a qualifier against Clare in 2009 and did not play again for Donegal for 25 months, enduring setback after setback. A shoulder problem and a recurrence of the Achilles strain meant the Naomh Micheal clubman was never a regular starter during the tenure of former manager Jim McGuinness. Toye played the last 13 minutes of Donegal's All-Ireland final victory but then contracted trigeminal neuralgia. He was confined to a bench role for much of the 2016 summer campaign.

Rick Perry told the Texas Conservative Coalition Research Institute Friday that it is the responsibility of a conservative and compassionate government to protect the most vulnerable in society.","completion":"Title: Embracing a Compassionate Conservative Government: Gov. Rick Perry's Vision for Protecting Society's Most Vulnerable Introduction In a recent address to the Texas Conservative Coalition Research Institute, Governor Rick Perry highlighted the significant role of a conservative and compassionate government in safeguarding the interests of the most vulnerable members of society. Throughout his speech, Perry emphasized the need to strike a balance between maintaining the core values of conservatism while embracing a strong sense of empathy and understanding for those in need of assistance. The Argument for Compassionate Conservatism Governor Perry's stance on compassionate conservatism acknowledges the importance of providing a safety net for vulnerable populations while still adhering to traditional conservative principles. By promoting limited government intervention, fiscal responsibility, and self-reliance, compassionate conservatism encourages individuals and communities to take advantage of existing resources and opportunities to overcome socio-economic challenges. However, Perry's approach also acknowledges that certain demographics require additional aid and intervention from the government to truly prosper and achieve their full potential. Identifying the Most Vulnerable According to Gov. Perry, the most vulnerable populations include children, the elderly, individuals with disabilities, low-income families, and veterans. These demographics often face unique challenges, obstacles, and hardships, which can hinder their ability to overcome barriers and achieve economic stability. By providing targeted assistance and appropriate resources, the government can facilitate a more level playing field for these populations, allowing them greater opportunities for success and independence. Targeted Assistance Programs and Strategies Governor Perry's vision for a compassionate conservative government includes implementing targeted assistance programs designed to address the specific needs of the most vulnerable populations. These programs include: 1. Early Childhood Education and Intervention: By investing in high-quality early childhood education and intervention programs, Gov. Perry's administration aims to improve outcomes for children living in disadvantaged or underserved communities. 2. Health and Nutrition Programs: Providing access to vital healthcare services and nutritional support for low-income families, elderly individuals, and disabled citizens is crucial in improving their quality of life and reducing overall healthcare costs. 3. Job Training and Employment Assistance: Gov. Perry's administration stresses the importance of equipping low-income individuals and disadvantaged groups with the necessary skills and resources to secure fulfilling, well-paying jobs and achieve economic independence. 4. Veteran Services: The government has a responsibility to look after those who have served their country, particularly in terms of providing appropriate care, resources, and support for veterans struggling with mental and physical health issues. 5. Accessible Social Services: Ensuring that members of vulnerable populations have access to vital social services, such as housing assistance, mental health resources, and addiction recovery programs, is essential in facilitating their long-term well-being and economic stability. Accountability and Fiscal Responsibility To ensure that these targeted assistance programs are both effective and fiscally sustainable, Gov. Perry emphasizes the need for ongoing monitoring, evaluation, and adjustment of government policies and services. This approach encourages cost-effective government spending while maximizing the positive impact on the lives of vulnerable members of society. Conclusion The compassionate conservatism endorsed by Gov. Rick Perry offers a viable, nuanced approach for governments looking to protect society's most vulnerable members while maintaining a focus on limited intervention and fiscal responsibility. By striking a careful balance between targeted assistance programs and fiscal discipline, Perry's administration aims to create a supportive environment for the disadvantaged, ensuring equal opportunities for all individuals to thrive and contribute to their communities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Wastewater from showers , sinks and toilets goes into underground purifying tanks and then into the cistern . The collected water then irrigates the land surrounding the house . Surrounding flowers and shrubs native to the area enable the property to blend into the surrounding rural landscape . Question Why is rainwater being collected and moved into the cistern ? Answer:","completion":"Rainwater is being collected and moved into the cistern for multiple purposes. The step-by-step process and justification are as follows: 1. Conservation of water resources: By collecting rainwater and reusing it for irrigation, the household reduces its reliance on external water sources, which may help conserve water resources in the area. 2. Wastewater treatment: The wastewater from showers, sinks, and toilets is directed into the underground purifying tanks, where it is treated before being added to the cistern. This process enables the reuse of water which might have otherwise been wasted, reducing the overall water consumption of the household. 3. Environmental benefits: Using collected rainwater and treated wastewater for irrigation helps maintain the health of the native plants and landscape surrounding the property. This ensures that the property blends into the surrounding rural landscape, promoting a natural ecosystem and habitat for local wildlife. 4. Cost reduction: By reusing rainwater and wastewater for irrigation, the household can potentially reduce their water bill and save money, especially in areas where water costs are high.

How is \\"This is one of the effects of the euro which I mentioned previously.\\" said in Finnish?","completion":"In Finnish, the sentence \\"This is one of the effects of the euro which I mentioned previously\\" can be translated to: \\"Tämä on yksi niistä vaikutuksista, jotka mainitsin aiemmin liittyen euroon.\\" Here's a breakdown of the translation and a brief explanation of the Finnish sentence structure: - Tämä (This) - This word refers to the effect being discussed, and it remains unchanged regardless of the subject's gender or number. - on (is) - \\"on\\" functions as the verb \\"is\\" in the sentence. - yksi (one) - This word specifies a singular effect among multiple effects being mentioned. - niistä (of those) - \\"Niistä\\" comes from the pronoun \\"ne,\\" which translates to \\"those\\" in English. In this context, \\"niistä\\" is used to indicate \\"one of those\\" effects. - vaikutuksista (from the effects) - \\"Vaikutus\\" stands for \\"effect\\" in Finnish. \\"-sta\\" (-ista) ending is added to create the Finnish word for \\"from the effects\\" or \\"of the effects.\\" - jotka (which) - \\"Jotka\\" serves as a relative pronoun used to link two clauses. - mainitsin (I mentioned) - This verb is the first person, past tense of \\"mainita\\" (to mention). The subject pronoun \\"I\\" is not required, as the verb in Finnish already implies its meaning. - aiemmin (previously) - The word \\"aiemmin\\" acts as an adverb to provide information about the time when something happened. - liittyen (related to) - \\"Liittyen\\" functions as an adverb meaning \\"related to\\" or \\"concerning.\\" - euroon (the euro) - Here, \\"euro\\" refers to the European currency. The \\"-oon\\" (-än) ending is added to show that the sentence pertains to the Euro. Altogether, the translation of \\"This is one of the effects of the euro which I mentioned previously\\" is \\"Tämä on yksi niistä vaikutuksista, jotka mainitsin aiemmin liittyen euroon.\\" This maintains the original meaning of the English sentence while conforming to appropriate Finnish grammar and sentence structure."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When approaching the end-of-year holidays and activities, it is not uncommon to experience increased stress and a sense of urgency in completing various tasks, both personal and professional. This phenomenon is often referred to as the \\"December rush.\\" In order to maintain a healthier and more balanced lifestyle, it is crucial to take steps to avoid this overwhelming time of the year. One approach to prevent the December rush is to plan ahead, prioritizing tasks and setting realistic deadlines for their completion. By organizing your time and responsibilities effectively, you can evade the race against the clock that often occurs in the month of December. Another essential aspect of avoiding the December rush is to set boundaries and make sure to allocate enough time for self-care, relaxation, and engaging in activities that you genuinely enjoy. It's okay to say no to certain obligations, thereby preventing an overbooked schedule that only adds to the pressure. Additionally, it's crucial to pay attention to your mental and emotional well-being. The December rush affects not only your physical health but also your psychological state, leading to increased anxiety, frustration, and even a sense of burnout. To counteract this, make sure to engage in practices such as meditation, exercise, spending time with loved ones, or participating in relaxing hobbies. These activities help alleviate stress and might even provide an outlet for decompression. Another useful tactic to avoid the December rush is to set realistic expectations for yourself and others during this time. Acknowledge that the number of tasks on your to-do list might be greater than your available time, and that it's okay for some things to remain unfinished or be postponed. As long as you're making progress and dedicating time to the essential tasks on your list, it's important to give yourself credit for the work you've done and not dwell on the things you haven't. Remember to maintain open communication with your colleagues, family members, and friends, as they can offer support, advice, and, in some cases, assistance in completing tasks or reaching goals. This way, you can address the pressure from the December rush collectively, as opposed to shouldering the burden alone. In summary, avoiding the December rush is about careful planning, setting realistic boundaries and expectations, staying attentive to your mental and emotional well-being, and cultivating a network of support amongst those around you. By taking these steps, you can ensure a more enjoyable and less-stressful end-of-year experience."},{"prompt":"Q:Context: aubrey saw her mom was sick so she took her to the hospital.

The tweet seems to express a feeling of disappointment or regret due to not having obtained one of the \\"708 magnets.\\" There is also an element of curiosity as the author seeks to know if anyone else has one. Breaking down the different elements of the tweet can lead to a more in-depth understanding of the sentiment: 1.

However, the phrase \\"never got one\\" carries a slightly negative connotation, indicating that the author wished they had a magnet but failed to get it. 2. Tone: The tone of the tweet is conversational and comes across as a sincere query from the author.

Context: To fully understand the sentiment, one must consider the context surrounding the mention of \\"708 magnets.\\" If the magnets signify an exclusive or limited-edition item, this tweet's negative sentiment could be heightened as the author might express their regret more keenly.

Intent: Lastly, the intent of the tweet plays a crucial role in describing its sentiment. In this case, it seems the author wants to learn more about these magnets and would appreciate receiving information from others.

Mike Phelan’s Time with Sir Alex Ferguson: Mike Phelan's impressive tenure as the assistant to Alex Ferguson at Manchester United is one that many aspiring coaches would only dream of. During his five years working with Ferguson, Phelan helped guide the Red Devils to multiple domestic and European titles. Under their partnership, Manchester United won three Premier League titles, two League Cups, and reached the UEFA Champions League final on two occasions. The success under Ferguson's reign was, in part, due to Phelan's tactical astuteness and eye for detail. The legendary manager trusted him with overseeing training sessions, scouting opponents, and relayed important decisions on the pitch. The two forged a strong working relationship, with Phelan becoming an integral part of the coaching staff at Old Trafford. As a result, Phelan's influence on games cannot be understated, as the team consistently achieved impressive high-level results.

Phelan was tasked with improving the tactical set-up and player performance, while also working closely with Neil Adams, Norwich City's manager at the time. Ultimately, Phelan's invaluable experience within the English top-flight football helped Norwich as they earned promotion to the Premier League in the 2014/15 season. Assistant to Steve Bruce at Hull City: At the age of 52, Phelan was appointed as assistant coach to Steve Bruce at Hull City, a team that had been struggling to retain their position in the top tier of English football. With Bruce being a former Manchester United legend and a manager with a wealth of experience, combining forces with Phelan made perfect sense in an attempt to revive Hull City's fortunes. The role of an assistant coach at Hull City is one that demanded Phelan's vast experience, tactical acumen, and motivational abilities. He assists Bruce in various coaching capacities, including the planning of training sessions, strategizing for matches, and adjusting tactics to counter the opposing team's strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, Phelan's experience as a high-level footballer and an influential right-hand man under Ferguson have made him the ideal candidate to communicate and build strong bonds within the Hull City squad.

Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2] I am facing a new situation today: High lake had a lot of fresh and salt water mixing, therefore presented layers of stratified water.The water was poor in nutrients.Low lake had no such problems and it was a very abundant and prolific fishing spot.

Hellenistic art saw a turn from the idealistic, perfected, calm and composed figures of classical Greek art to a style dominated by realism and the depiction of emotion (pathos) and character (ethos). The motif of deceptively realistic naturalism in art (aletheia) is reflected in stories such as that of the painter Zeuxis, who was said to have painted grapes that seemed so real that birds came and pecked at them. The female nude also became more popular as epitomized by the Aphrodite of Cnidos of Praxiteles and art in general became more erotic (e.g. Leda and the Swan and Scopa's Pothos).

Whose musical works included Composition For Orchestra and Philomel?","completion":"The musical works \\"Composition for Orchestra\\" and \\"Philomel\\" were composed by Milton Babbitt, an influential American composer, music theorist, and teacher. He is known for his serial and electronic music. Born on May 10, 1916, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Milton Babbitt grew up in Jackson, Mississippi, and began studying violin when he was four but soon switched to clarinet and saxophone. Largely self-taught as a composer, he was already writing music in his teens. He later studied mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania before switching to music and transferring to New York University, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1935. Babbitt's early works, such as his Composition for Orchestra (1940), show an incredible understanding in manipulating musical forms like sonata and fugue. He had considerable technical skill, despite the complexity of many of his works. \\"Philomel\\" (1964) represents one of Babbitt's significant accomplishments in the realm of electronic music, a genre in which he began to work during the 1960s. This composition combines both live soprano and synthesized sound. The lyrics of the piece are a modernist poem by John Hollander, which reimagines the myth of Philomel, a character in Greek mythology who is turned into a nightingale. Despite its complex and abstract nature, the piece has been well received in the music world due to its expressive power and integration of electronic elements. In this work, Babbitt demonstrated innovation in using synthesized sounds and live performance in combination, an example of his broader significance in the development of electronic music in the 20th century. It gave way to a new compositional style that broke free from traditional scores and performances. Overall, Milton Babbitt has left a profound impact in the field of modern classical music, not only through his advanced compositions, including \\"Composition for Orchestra\\" and \\"Philomel\\", but also through his extensive theoretical work. His compositions and theories continue to influence countless composers and musicians today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the context of the conversation, it is likely that Pearl experienced ongoing problems with her previous vehicle, making it difficult or inconvenient for her to continue using it. Her decision to buy a new car could be based on a recent breakdown, frequent issues with the old car's performance, or the desire to own a more modern, safer, and dependable vehicle.

If you are one who believes that George Bush went to war in Iraq to boost the stock price of Halliburton this book is for you. If you think the USA is evil and we just need to understand the plight of terrorists you will love reading this trash. I want my money back! Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? A:","completion":"This product review conveys a strongly negative sentiment towards the book \\"Camel Club\\" by David Baldacci. The reviewer is highly critical of the book's content and perceives it as hate-filled towards the United States.

Rio counting on ‘luck’ to avoid major outbreak of Zika during Olympic Games Rio de Janeiro – \\"This is not an Olympic issue,\\" Rio de Janeiro's mayor, Eduardo Paes, told a reporter when he was asked about the possibility that a Zika outbreak might happen during the Games. \\"The Olympics are taking place when the mosquito is not procreating, not active. August and July are the driest months, and they’re less warm, so you have a lower incidence of mosquito bites,\\" he said. The Olympics are set to take place from Aug. 5 to 21 in Brazil’s second-largest city, followed by the Paralympic Games from Sept. 7 to 18. Tens of thousands of athletes and fans from every country on Earth will flood Rio in that time, only to return home potentially having been exposed to the Zika virus. It’s a scenario that might concern any epidemiologist. Even so, no \\"special preventive actions\\" like fogging with pesticides will be taken during or before the Olympic Games, Cristina Lemos, the city’s Health Department superintendent told Fox News Latino. \\"We will not direct our campaign at tourists,” she said. “We're just instructing them to use personal protection, like long-sleeved shirts, long pants and to avoid exposure to places that may have mosquitoes.” “And also to use insect repellent,\\" Lemos added. But many are skeptical of the city’s preparations. \\"We are counting on luck, we are counting on weather,” Brazilian biologist Mario Moscatelli told FNL. \\"The problem is that a city hosting an event like this should be taking actions to prevent the spread of disease, not depend on external factors.” He added that while it’s true that winters in Rio are relatively cooler and drier, “The mosquitos are still out there, and any change in weather – and we have seen extraordinary changes in these last months – could cause a disaster. The neighborhood where most of the competitions will take place is also where we have the highest concentration of Zika and dengue fever cases.\\" The numbers would seem to validate his concern. Since April 2015, more than 100,000 Brazilians have contracted the Zika virus – which has been linked to the increase of cases of microcephaly, in which babies are born with abnormally small heads. Although summer ended two months ago, in May the country’s southeast region, where Rio is located, surpassed the northeast, where the epidemic began in 2015, in number of cases of Zika with 46,318, according to Brazil’s Health Ministry. The Zika virus is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito which also transmits dengue and yellow fever. The mosquito breeds in small pools of stagnant water that collect in and around residences, such as flower vases, buckets, old tires, even wet floors and in the tanks of toilets. Lemos, the health department official, said that the city has more than 3,000 agents deployed throughout the city to inspect places where Aedes mosquitoes are most abundant. They visit homes, she said, educating residents about how to protect themselves, “searching for water deposits that can become potential breeding sites … [and] treating with pesticide larval deposits that cannot be eliminated.” In extreme cases, she indicated, they would spray homes with insecticide. Lemos also said that squares, parks, clubs, parking lots, stadiums, vacant lots and other sites are being regularly inspected. But Moscatelli, with his expertise in biology, is not convinced. \\"We did almost nothing in the last 20 years to prevent the spread of Aedes. Seven years ago we were chosen to host the Olympics, which gave us a second chance, but nothing was done. What can we do in two months? Pray for the weather to behave. That’s it.\\" Carolina Torres is a freelance journalist living in Rio de Janeiro. Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter & Instagram What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The article discusses concerns in Rio de Janeiro regarding the potential outbreak of the Zika virus during the period of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, scheduled from August to September 2016. Rio de Janeiro's mayor, Eduardo Paes, disregards the chances of an outbreak by pointing out that the Games will take place during the driest months of July and August, when mosquitos are less active. Despite these claims, many people are skeptical about the city’s preparations for the international event. A significant influx of athletes and fans will be descending on the city, potentially exposing a global population to the virus. Even so, no special preventive measures such as fogging or pesticides are due, leaving visitors advised to take personal precautions against mosquitoes. Health Department superintendent, Cristina Lemos, identified that their campaign will not directly target tourists. Instead, the approach will revolve around advising personal protection, like wearing long-sleeved shirts, long pants and using insect repellent. Additionally, efforts are being made to educate residents on mosquito prevention and eliminate potential breeding sites for the Aedes mosquito, which transmits the Zika, dengue, and yellow fever viruses. Biologist Mario Moscatelli is critical of the city's reliance on \\"luck\\" and \\"weather\\". He specifies that although winters are cooler and drier in Rio, mosquitoes are still present, and any extraordinary change in weather could lead to an outbreak. Particularly, Moscatelli raises concern over the neighborhood hosting most of the competitions as it also reports the highest concentration of Zika and dengue fever cases. The Zika virus has been a significant health issue in Brazil, with more than 100,000 cases since April 2015. It is linked to cases of microcephaly, a condition resulting in babies born with abnormally small heads. Despite the end of summer two months ago, as of May 2016, Rio has surpassing the northeast region where the epidemic began in the number of Zika cases. The criticisms against the lack of preventative measures are linked to the past 20 years of minimal action in controlling the Aedes mosquito. Despite winning the bid for the Olympics seven years ago and viewing it as an opportunity to increase disease control, critics argue that not much has been accomplished. The primary hope now is for favorable weather conditions to minimize the presence and activity of mosquitos."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Former President Barack Obama unveiled plans for his future presidential library and museum on the south side of Chicago where he raised his family and launched his political career. The designs show a complex of modern buildings, with a library, museum and event center, plus a community garden, a children's play area and possibly an athletic field. \\"What we want this to be is the world-premiere institution for training young people and leadership to make a difference in their communities, in their countries and in the world,\\" he told the crowd that included Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, his one-time chief of staff. Flanked by drawings and renderings, Obama also announced that he and former first lady Michelle Obama will be donating 2 million to fund a Chicago summer jobs program. The museum, the tallest of the three buildings, will hold exhibition space, public spaces, offices and education and meeting rooms, according to the Obama Foundation. The forum and library buildings are intended to be used for study and foundation programming. Obama said his foundation, which is overseeing the project, is also looking into the possibility of locating a Chicago Public Library branch on the site. Obama said he envisioned recording studios where musicians could help young people work on music, and space for movie directors who could take on community storytelling. The center will also have exhibits with campaign memorabilia and personal artifacts. \\"Let's face it, we want to see Michelle's dresses,\\" the former president joked. Obama also squashed any notion that the library was ever going to be elsewhere. Multiple locations in three states — Illinois, New York and Hawaii — had initially pitched proposals. \\"The best things that have happened to me in my life happened in this community,\\" he said. \\"Although we had a formal bidding process to determine where the presidential library was going to be, the fact of the matter was it had to be right here on the south side of Chicago.\\" When did Obama announce his donation for a summer jobs program?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The Disruptive Power of iMessage You could argue that Apple has changed the way we do things several times. The way we buy music, use our phones, operate our computers and so on. But the world has pretty much overlooked one of Apple’s greatest ideas yet: messages. The Times’s technology columnist, David Pogue, keeps you on top of the industry in his free, weekly e-mail newsletter. It started with iMessages, an iPhone/iPad app that lets you send text messages between Apple hand-held gadgets without cost. Instead of using the cellphone network (and paying 20 cents each or whatever), texts you send using this little app get sent across the Internet, costing you pretty much nothing. These Apple messages have many advantages over regular text messages. For example, the tiny word “received” appears beneath any message you send to let you know that your recipient’s gadget has received it. (If the recipient has turned on “Show read receipts” in Settings, you’ll even see the word “read” to let you know that the person has actually read the message.) If you’re in a back-and-forth conversation, the text messages show up on a single screen, scrolling up in conversation balloons like a chat session. While the other guy is typing, you see “…” in his balloon, so you know he’s working on a response and not just ignoring you. You can send pictures and videos through Messages. And you aren’t held to the usual 160-character limit of phone text messages. And if you have more than one iGadget — say, an iPhone and an iPad — you’ll find the same message threads on each one. You can pick up on a chat from wherever you left off on a different machine. Above all, Messages means that you can keep your text messages. They’re not locked onto your phone, like regular text messages. And they don’t scroll away forever, like regular text messages. You can go back and refer to them whenever, and they’re backed up every time you back up your device. So: Messages is cool. And coolly clever, the way it cuts the cellphone company out of the revenue stream. But that’s not the big news. Apple announced recently that this summer, it will release a new version of Mac OS X called Mountain Lion. And Mountain Lion will come with a new Mac app called Messages. You can download the beta version of Messages free, right now, even before Mountain Lion is available. (It’s actually just a beefed-up version of the previous iChat program, and still includes all of its audiochat and videochat features.) O.K., this is where things get crazy. Suddenly your computer and your phone are sharing the same communications stream. First, this means that you can now send text messages from your computer, using a full keyboard, which is a fairly radical change right there. You’ve been able to do that computer-to-phone trick before, but it’s been tricky. For years, I’ve been using Google Voice to send text messages for that very reason: on its Web page, I can send text messages, free, to phones, with the full comfort of mouse and keyboard. And you could sent text messages from chat programs — but only with special codes, and, of course, without the ability to resume the conversation on a different device. But Messages is the first time there’s been a low-friction, mass-available way to send computer-to-phone messages. The second huge change is that now you have your entire hard drive full of attachments — photos, videos, documents — to send to people’s phones. From your computer. Third, Messages preserves all of these exchanges, just as the iPhone did. But it’s far more useful to have your transcripts on the actual computer. Now you can archive them, search them, copy and paste them, print them, forward them and so on. Finally, Messages blurs the line between text messages, chats and e-mail. Or maybe it erases the line completely, and creates something entirely new. (One wild side effect: It gives birth to this frequently asked question: “Are you on the phone or the Mac?” For the first time, there’s no way to know. You can’t tell if someone’s being terse because she’s tapping out her responses with one finger on glass, or because she’s on her computer but just distracted.) Messages is in beta testing, so there are some kinks to work out. They’re actually kind of cool: side effects of the disruptive Messages change. For example, when I’m conducting a chat on my Mac, the iPhone in my pocket goes nuts, vibrating or dinging madly with each line. Remember, the phone believes that each line of the chat is an incoming text message. Sure, I could go into Settings and turn off the ringing and vibrating — but that’s a lot of trouble every time I start or stop chatting on the Mac. Similarly, a number of times, I’ve had this bizarre situation: I’ve conducted a chat during an airplane ride on the laptop. Then, when I land and turn my phone back on, it’s tied up for seven minutes, furiously downloading all of those “text messages” that happened while it was asleep, frantically vibrating or dinging. I mean, this is logical. It’s what Messages is supposed to do: sync the phone, tablet, Touch, and Mac. But there should be a setting somewhere: “Don’t alert me when downloading messages I’ve already read.” There are also some bugs, including some creepy sequencing errors. I’ve seen text messages appear chronologically in the wrong place in the Mac transcript, for example. Even among Mac-to-Mac chats, I’ve sometimes seen messages appear too soon in the transcript. Finally, I don’t know if I’m typical, but I had some trouble getting started. You have to have an iCloud account (it’s free) to make the syncing work between devices, and somehow I had to enter the proper e-mail address in the phone’s Settings before everything worked. I hope Apple gets around to solving these glitches. In the meantime, Messages will be changing the lives of heavy texters everywhere. Phones, tablets, Touches and computers are now all equal citizens in the world of short typed communications. Photos, videos and documents can now be part of computer-to-phone correspondence. Your dialogue can be archived and preserved forever. In other words, for heavy communicators, the one small modification Apple has made to the rules has changed the game completely. What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about a really cool thing that Apple made called iMessage. You know how you send texts to your friends from your phone? Well, iMessage lets you do that from other Apple things like your iPad or even your computer, and it's free!

Article: One of the worst feelings you have as a professional athlete is the feeling after losing a game to a team that you should have beaten. That happened last night against the lowly Boston Celtics. They had only won 13 games the whole year and were really struggling. We had just come off a very good win against the Orlando Magic on the road and were feeling good about ourselves. The day did not start out good for us when we learned that T-Mac was going to miss the game with the flu. When you lose your best players (Yao, T-Mac) everyone must play a little harder and do a little bit more on the floor. We inserted Bonzi Wells into the lineup (he was the only one to have a good game for us), in place of T-Mac. It was a nasty game. We are usually one of the best three point shooting teams in the NBA and we only made 1 of 22 three point shots! I have never seen that happen. Never! Rafer Alston, Luther Head, and me combined to shoot 5 of 33 from the field. Ouch! You aren't going to win too many games like that. Even as poorly as we shot the ball, we STILL had a chance to win the game in the fourth quarter but failed to make the winning plays that you must make to leave the floor victorious. In the locker room after the game, everybody felt terrible. When we play a bad game, we feel that we let our teammates down. There is a bad feeling in the pit of your stomach when you leave the gym and you just want to go home and not talk to anyone. It is a terrible feeling, but it is a feeling that makes you want to try harder and do better the next time. I'll talk to you guys later. Shane Question: What is the passage mainly about?

Question: Given the following context: Mr. Wilson of the United Nations War Crimes Commission is hunting for Nazi fugitive Franz Kindler, a war criminal who has erased all evidence which might identify him, with no clue left to his identity except \\"a hobby that almost amounts to a mania—clocks.\\" Wilson releases Kindler's former associate Meinike, hoping the man will lead him to Kindler. Wilson follows Meinike to the United States, to the town of Harper, Connecticut, but loses him before he meets with Kindler. Kindler has assumed a new identity and is known locally as \\"Charles Rankin,\\" and has become a prep school teacher. He is about to marry Mary Longstreet, daughter of Supreme Court Justice Adam Longstreet, and is involved in repairing the town's 400-year-old Habrecht-style clock mechanism with religious automata that crowns the belfry of a church in the town square. When Kindler and Meinike do meet, Meinike, who is repentant, begs Kindler to confess his crimes. Instead, Kindler strangles Meinike, who might expose him. Eventually, Wilson deduces that Rankin is Kindler, but not having witnessed the meeting with Meinike, he has no proof. Only Mary knows that Meinike came to meet her husband. To get her to admit this, Wilson must convince her that her husband is a criminal—before Rankin decides to eliminate the threat to him by killing her. Kindler's pose begins to unravel when Red, the family dog, discovers Meinike's body.

Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms. Who will cause less dead zones to form in the ponds near their farm? Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.

The dominant figure of Canadian Confederation, he had a political career which spanned almost half a century. He drank heavily, and in 1873 was voted out during the Pacific Scandal, in which his party took bribes from businessmen seeking the contract to build the Pacific Railway. Macdonald's greatest achievements were building and guiding a successful national government for the new Dominion, using patronage to forge a strong Conservative Party, promoting the protective tariff of the National Policy, and building the transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway. Economic growth was slow during his years in office, as Canada verged on stagnation; many residents migrated to the fast-growing United States. He fought to block provincial efforts to take power back from Ottawa. His most controversial move was to approve the execution of Métis leader Louis Riel for treason in 1885; it alienated many Francophones. - Charles Joseph \\"Joe\\" Clark, (born June 5, 1939) is a Canadian statesman, businessman, writer, and politician who served as the 16th Prime Minister of Canada, from June 4, 1979, to March 3, 1980. - Joseph Philippe Pierre Yves Elliott Trudeau (; October 18, 1919 September 28, 2000), better known as Pierre Trudeau or Pierre Elliott Trudeau, was a Canadian politician who served as the 15th Prime Minister of Canada from 19681979 and 19801984. He is the 3rd longest-serving Prime Minister in Canadian history (behind William Lyon Mackenzie King and John A. Macdonald), having served for 15 years, 164 days. - The Conservative Party of Canada, colloquially known as the Tories, is a political party in Canada. It is positioned on the right of the Canadian political spectrum. The party's leader from 2004 to 2015 was Stephen Harper, who served as Prime Minister from 2006 to 2015. - The Liberal Party of Canada, colloquially known as the Grits, is the oldest federal political party in Canada. The party espouses the principles of liberalism, and generally sits at the centre of the Canadian political spectrum. The Liberal Party is traditionally positioned to the left of the Conservative Party of Canada and to the right of the New Democratic Party (NDP). - The Canadian federal election of 1979 was held on May 22 , 1979 to elect members of the Canadian House of Commons of the 31st Parliament of Canada . It resulted in the defeat of the Liberal Party of Canada after 11 years in power under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau . Joe Clark led the Progressive Conservative Party to power , but with only a minority of seats in the House of Commons . The Liberals , however , did beat the Progressive Conservatives in the overall popular vote by more than 400,000 votes . - William Lyon Mackenzie King (December 17, 1874 July 22, 1950) was the dominant Canadian political leader from the 1920s through the 1940s. He served as the tenth Prime Minister of Canada from 1921 to 1926, 1926 to 1930, and 1935 to 1948. He is best known for his leadership of Canada throughout the Second World War (19391945) when he mobilized Canadian money, supplies and volunteers to support Britain while boosting the economy and maintaining home front morale. A Liberal with 21 years and 154 days in office, he was the longest-serving prime minister in Canadian history. Trained in law and social work, he was keenly interested in the human condition (as a boy, his motto was \\"Help those that cannot help themselves\\"), and played a major role in laying the foundations of the Canadian welfare state. - The New Democratic Party (NDP NPD) is a social-democratic political party in Canada. The leader of the federal wing of the NDP is Thomas Mulcair, who was elected in the 2012 leadership election, led the party through the 2015 federal election and then lost a party leadership review on April 10, 2016. Mulcair will remain as leader, until his replacement is chosen at a leadership election to be held in 2017.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Ants run a tight ship. They organize themselves into groups with very specific tasks: foraging for food, defending against predators, building tunnels, etc. An enormous amount of coordination and communication is required to accomplish this. To explore the evolutionary roots of the remarkable system, researchers at The Rockefeller University have created the first genetically altered ants, modifying a gene essential for sensing the pheromones that ants use to communicate. The result, severe deficiencies in the ants' social behaviors and their ability to survive within a colony, both sheds light on a key facet of social evolution and demonstrates the feasibility and utility of genome editing in ants. \\"It was well known that ant language is produced through pheromones, but now we understand a lot more about how pheromones are perceived,\\" says Daniel Kronauer, head of the Laboratory of Social Evolution and Behavior. \\"The way ants interact is fundamentally different from how solitary organisms interact, and with these findings we know a bit more about the genetic evolution that enabled ants to create structured societies.\\" Social beginnings The most important class of pheromones in ant communication are hydrocarbons, which can communicate species, colony, and caste identity as well as reproductive status. These pheromone signals are detected by porous sensory hairs on the ants' antennae that contain what are called odorant receptors -- proteins that recognize specific chemicals and pass the signal up to the brain. Work in the Kronauer lab, led by graduate student Sean McKenzie and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, has shown that a group of odorant receptor genes, known as 9-exon-alpha ORs, are responsible for sensing hydrocarbons in the clonal raider ant species Ooceraea biroi. McKenzie and his colleagues also examined the genomes of related insects to determine where 9-exon ORs emerged in the evolution of this species, and found that there was an enormous duplication in this gene in a relatively short evolutionary timescale: While the ancestors of bees and ants only had one to three copies of this gene, clonal raider ants have about 180 copies. The massive expansion of 9-exon ORs happened concurrently with the evolution of complex social behavior, suggesting that the duplication of odorant receptor genes was vital to the development of ant communication. Communication interrupted To further dissect the role of odorant receptors in ant communication and social behavior, the Kronauer lab disrupted a gene called orco, required for the function of all odorant receptors. Introducing the mutation -- using a genetic manipulation technique known as CRISPR -- was easy. The challenge was keeping the mutant ants alive. \\"We had to convince the colonies to accept the mutants. If the conditions weren't right, the worker ants would stop caring for larvae and destroy them,\\" says graduate fellow Waring Trible, who led this portion of the study, published separately in Cell. \\"Once the ants successfully made it to the adult phase, we noticed a shift in their behavior almost immediately.\\" Ants typically travel single-file, sensing the route by detecting pheromones left by the ants in front. Using an automated system that tracks color-coded ants and an algorithm that analyzes movement, the researchers observed that, among other behavioral abnormalities, the mutant ants couldn't fall in line. The finding suggests that the missing odorant receptors are crucial for pheromone detection, and therefore social organization. The lack of odorant receptors also changed the shape of the ants' brains. This was a surprise, says Trible, \\"because brain anatomy is not affected in orco mutants in other insects, like the fruit fly. Our findings suggest that ants are fundamentally different -- they need functional odorant receptors for the brain to develop correctly. This points to how crucial sensing odors is to ants, an ability that may be less important in other insects. \\" Now that the lab is able to generate mutant ants, Kronauer has a bucket list of genes to explore, including those related to the division of labor between groups. \\"We've successfully taken a gene out, and next we'd like to put a gene in. We have a whole new world to explore,\\" says Kronauer. ||||| Two independent research teams at New York University and Rockefeller University say they have genetically modified two different species of ants. Here's some of what they found. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post) Despite what you might've seen in 1950s monster movies, it's difficult to raise mutant ants. For years biologists have altered the genetics of organisms as varied as mice and rice. Mutant fruit flies are a laboratory staple. But ants' complex life cycle hampered efforts to grow genetically engineered ants — until now. On Thursday, two independent research teams described their work deleting ant genes. Two papers chronicling the first mutant ants appeared in the journal Cell, along with a third study that altered ant behavior using an insect brain hormone. Claude Desplan, a New York University biologist and an author of one of the studies, said that, as far as he could tell, these ants are “the first mutant in any social insect.” Ants have complex social roles, even though members of a colony are genetically very similar. Females may be egg-laying queens or sterile workers, colony cleaners or fierce soldiers. Males, who are little more than sperm-delivery systems with wings, appear only seasonally. To ensure the mutant genes carry on, “you need to go through the queen,” Desplan said. “It is not so easy to make queens.” “There's a lot of interesting biologic questions that you can study with ants that you can’t study with fruit flies or even mice,” said Rockefeller University biologist Daniel Kronauer, an author of the other mutant-ant study. If you throw a thousand fruit flies in a bucket of dirt, maybe they'll fight or copulate, he said. But that's about it. Do the same with ants and they'll set to work digging, caring for broods and foraging. What's more, the insects are prime targets for studies of epigenetics, the external factors that toggle genes on and off. “Ants are amazing because with the same genome you can be a queen, or a worker, or another class of worker, or a soldier,” Desplan said. Desplan's research group chose to study a species of jumping ant found in India, Harpegnathos saltator, because all of these ants are potentially fertile. Before laying eggs, though, the workers have to become pseudo-queens. (The scientific term for a pseudo-queen is a “gamergate” — no relation to the anti-feminist video game hullabaloo circa 2014.) If a jumping-ant colony loses its queen, the workers go through a gantlet of ritualized antenna-flailing duels. The victor transforms into a pseudo-queen. Kronauer and his colleagues, led by Rockefeller University graduate student Waring Trible, studied clonal raider ants, Ooceraea biroi. Unlike most ants, the raider ants reproduce asexually, through parthenogenesis. Popularly called virgin birth, it's a phenomenon seen in some snakes, lizards and sharks. The offspring end up as clones of the females. For both species, the desired result of genetic alteration was the same: creating mother ants that gave birth to future generations of mutants. Both research groups mutated their ants in the same way. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 technique, with bacterial molecules acting like scissors to snip out genes, the scientists knocked out a crucial component of the ant's odor receptors. Pheromones, the odors by which ants communicate, are their social medium. Though there are hundreds of olfactory genes in ants, deleting one particular gene — called orco, for odorant receptor co-receptor — effectively renders almost the entire ant olfactory system useless. Removing every individual odor gene would be “essentially impossible,” Kronauer said. But the power of orco to “take out the whole family” of olfactory genes makes it an obvious candidate for manipulation. (It's why both research groups independently decided to focus on deleting the gene.) The insects lost about 90 percent of their olfaction, Desplan said. The behavior of the mutants changed dramatically. The Indian jumping ants wandered away from the colony and wouldn't forage. If Desplan isolated a mutant jumping ant, the ant still became a fertile gamergate. But these pseudo-queens laid very few eggs and were poor mothers. And if the mutants belonged to a colony that lost its queen, they didn't partake in the antennae duels. Instead, they only twitched their antennae when alone, as if shadowboxing. The clonal raider ants that couldn't sense pheromones acted strangely, too. Normally, these ants detest the smell of Sharpie markers. But the mutants marched right over lines drawn in Sharpie. Like the jumping ants, the Ooceraea biroi mutants became antisocial. “Suddenly these ants aren’t really social any more. They wander off, they don’t join the colony,” Kronauer said. “They just walk around.” Nor did they follow the pheromone trails their brethren left. Stranger things happened, too. One particularly odd loner crept into a colony, stole off with an egg and began to groom it with her antennae. All of a sudden she startled. There was no cause for alarm, but the flood of warning pheromones she released sent the rest of the non-mutant colony into a tizzy, Kronauer said. Rockefeller University biologist Daniel Kronauer and his colleagues created the first mutant ants using CRISPR technology. Here's how they did it and what they found. (Kate Bredbenner, SimpleBiologist) Now that scientists know they can alter ant behaviors through their genes, Kronauer plans to study the way colonies divide their labor. Imagine two people living in an apartment. As the dishes pile up, the roommate with a lower threshold for dirty plates begins to wash dishes more often. In the parlance of a biologist observer, that roommate “emerges as a dishwashing specialist.” The old research methods would be to alter the external cues — the equivalent of removing the dishwashing machine and seeing what happens. Through genetic manipulation, Kronauer plans to directly change an ant's internal thresholds. Desplan is interested in the way ants alter their longevity, in addition to sensory perception. Workers live to about seven months old. But workers that become pseudo-queens live for four years. That's like one human twin living to age 85 and the other to age 550. “Expanding by a factor of 10 is unheard of,” Desplan said. Workers who become pseudo-queens turn back to workers once they're exposed to queen pheromones. These former queens die within months. That means there must be a reversible genetic switch that controls the ant life span. Other scientists have taken note of the mutant ant models, Kronauer said, including experts who study honeybees. “People are very excited,” he said, and they have asked whether his lab could help establish a similar protocol in other species. Research such as this opens the door for new model organisms, in Desplan's view. If the traditional bioscience method is to ask many questions of the same organism — such as mice or fruit flies — then genetic engineering techniques allow biologists to ask very specific questions to an animal that fits their needs. If you want to model communities, look to ants. “Even mice don’t have very sophisticated behavior,” Desplan said. Some entomologists became ant experts because they loved ants. For Desplan, his was a more pragmatic affinity. He has worked with insects as varied as fruit flies, wasps and butterflies. And now mutant ants. “We became ant people because we needed to,” he said, “not because we were born ant people.” And, if these model mutants catch on the way Desplan and Kronauer predict, expect the ranks of ant people to swell.

Ants rely on pheromones to organize themselves into groups with specific tasks for survival, such as foraging for food and defending themselves from predators. By manipulating these pheromones, scientists found that the ants displayed severe deficiencies in their social behaviors and ability to survive within their colony.

These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem.

Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways. My husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him. I was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable. My husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex — not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy. I often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me. And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer. At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he’d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would “cure” him. Feeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken.

The film takes place in December 1980, and is intended to be an exploration of Chapman's psyche. Its title is a reference to J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, which has twenty-six chapters, and suggests a continuation of the book. The real Mark David Chapman is currently incarcerated at Wende Correctional Facility, on a guilty plea. Aside from two interviews with Larry King and Barbara Walters, both in 1992, he has not spoken with the media. However, Chapman did reveal the mechanics of his unraveling during those three days in New York City to journalist Jack Jones. The interviews were published in 1992 as Let Me Take You Down: Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman, a book of Chapman's recollections of his act of violence. Chapter 27 is based on this text. The title \\"Chapter 27\\" suggests a continuation of J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, which has twenty-six chapters, and which Chapman was carrying when he shot John Lennon. Chapman was obsessed with the book, to the point of attempting to model his life after its protagonist, Holden Caulfield. According to the British music magazine Mojo, the title was also inspired by Chapter 27 of Robert Rosen's book Nowhere Man: The Final Days of John Lennon (2000). Rosen's book explores the numerological meaning of the number 27, \\"the triple 9\\", a number of profound importance to John Lennon. Lennon was deeply interested in numerology, particularly Cheiro's Book of Numbers, along with nine and all its multiples. It was Chapman's goal, according to Rosen, to write Chapter 27 \\"in Lennon's blood\\". Like Chapman, Schaefer is a fan of both The Beatles and J.D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, and said he began the script to try to understand \\"how someone could be inspired to kill anyone as a result of being exposed to this kind of beautiful art. It really bothered me, because Lennon and Salinger have always made me feel so much better, and so much less alone.\\" Ask a question about this article.","completion":"What is the significance of the title \\"Chapter 27\\" in relation to the film and J.D.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: If you touch your finger to a hot stove, you know it's going to hurt. However, if you convince yourself beforehand that the pain won't be so bad, you might not suffer as much. According to a recent study, the part of your brain that reacts to severe pain is largely the same part that reacts to expectation of pain. Researchers in this study worked with 10 volunteers, aged 24 to 46. Each volunteer wore a device that gave out 20-second-long pulses of heat to the right leg. There were three levels of heat, producing mild, moderate, or strong pain. During training, the volunteers would first hear a tone, followed by a period of silence, and then feel a heat pulse. They then learned to associate the length of the silent pause with the intensity of the upcoming heat pulse. The longer the pause, the stronger the heat pulse would be, causing more severe pain. A day or two later, the real experiment began. The researchers found that the parts of the brain involved in learning, memory, emotion, and touch became more active as the volunteers expected higher levels of pain. These were mainly the same areas that became active when participants actually felt pain. Interestingly, when the volunteers expected only mild or moderate pain but experienced severe pain, they reported feeling 28 percent less pain than when they expected severe pain and actually got it. The new study emphasizes that pain has both physical and psychological elements. Understanding how pain works in the mind and brain could eventually give doctors tools for helping people cope with painful medical treatments. Options: A To provide the patient with more pain killers. B To talk to the patient and ease his/her worries. C To give the patient strong heat pulses beforehand.

Process: - Water in the clouds becomes very cold - The cold water forms ice crystals - The ice crystals grow by absorbing surrounding water droplets - Form snowflakes - The snowflakes fall to the ground. Question: suppose the water becomes more cold happens, how will it affect more water droplets will be absorbed. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"A: more When the water in the clouds becomes colder, it will have a greater capacity to absorb more water droplets due to the following reasons: 1. Lower temperatures promote the growth of ice crystals: When the temperature of the water in the clouds decreases, the rate at which it freezes increases. This leads to the formation of ice crystals which grow by absorbing surrounding water droplets. The colder the water, the more efficiently the ice crystals grow. As a result, the ice crystals will absorb more water droplets when the water's temperature is colder. 2. Lower saturation vapor pressure at lower temperatures: The saturation vapor pressure of water decreases at lower temperatures. This means that at colder temperatures, the air can hold less water vapor before becoming saturated. When the temperature of the water drops, the surrounding air will become saturated more easily, leading to a higher relative humidity near the ice crystals. This increased humidity will lead to a higher rate of water droplet absorption by the ice crystals. 3. Increased density of air at lower temperatures: At lower temperatures, the density of air generally increases. This results in a higher concentration of water droplets within the same volume of air, making it more likely for the ice crystals to come into contact with them. As a result, the ice crystals will absorb more water droplets when the water is colder. 4. More efficient snowflake formation: The colder the water in the clouds, the faster the ice crystals can combine to form snowflakes. These snowflakes become more effective at absorbing additional water droplets as they grow larger due to their increased surface area. This leads to a higher rate of water droplet absorption by the snowflakes in colder conditions. In conclusion, when the water in the clouds becomes colder, it is more likely to absorb a higher number of water droplets due to factors such as faster ice crystal growth, lower saturation vapor pressure, increased air density, and more efficient snowflake formation. This results in more water droplets being absorbed by the ice crystals and eventual precipitation as snow."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Answer the question below: If a product is unstretched, elastic force will increase or decrease?

Q:Question: \\"What was named after Jame II?\\" Context: \\"In 1657, Oliver Cromwell granted the English East India Company a charter to govern Saint Helena and the following year the company decided to fortify the island and colonise it with planters. The first governor, Captain John Dutton, arrived in 1659, making Saint Helena one of Britain's oldest colonies outside North America and the Caribbean. A fort and houses were built. After the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660, the East India Company received a royal charter giving it the sole right to fortify and colonise the island. The fort was renamed James Fort and the town Jamestown, in honour of the Duke of York, later James II of England.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The town of Jamestown and James Fort on the island of Saint Helena were named after James II, who was the Duke of York at the time. This naming occurred after the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660. Prior to the Restoration, Oliver Cromwell had granted the English East India Company a charter to govern Saint Helena in 1657. The purpose of this decision was to fortify the island and establish it as a colony with planters. The first governor, Captain John Dutton, arrived in 1659, making Saint Helena one of Britain's oldest colonies outside North America and the Caribbean. Consequently, a fort and several houses were built on the island. After the monarchy's restoration, the East India Company received a royal charter, which granted them the exclusive right to fortify and colonise the island. To honor the Duke of York, who later became James II of England, the fort was renamed James Fort, and the town was named Jamestown. This was done as a show of respect and recognition for the royal family and the Duke's status within it, as well as to solidify the connection between the English monarchy and the governance of the island. As a result, Saint Helena became an important strategic outpost for British trade during the Age of Exploration. Its location in the South Atlantic allowed the island to serve as a crucial stopover point for British ships traveling to and from the East Indies. The presence of Jamestown and James Fort showcased the influence of the English East India Company and the British Crown, both of which played a significant role in the administration of the island and its integration into the network of British colonies. The naming of the town and fort after James II serves as a reflection of the historical ties between Saint Helena, the English East India Company, and the British monarchy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -442*t - 2856 = -204*t for t.","completion":"To solve the given equation -442*t - 2856 = -204*t for t, we need to isolate the variable t on one side of the equation. Let's follow these steps: 1. Add 442*t to both sides of the equation to get all the t's on one side. -442*t + 442*t - 2856 = -204*t + 442*t This simplifies to: -2856 = 238*t 2. Now we want to isolate t by dividing both sides by the coefficient of t, which is 238. -2856 ÷ 238 = 238*t ÷ 238 This simplifies to: t = -12 So the solution for the equation -442*t - 2856 = -204*t is t = -12."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner Movie plot: \\"The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\\" begins with Colin Smith (Tom Courtenay) running, alone, along a bleak country road somewhere in rural England. In a brief voiceover, Colin tells us that running is the way his family has always coped with the world's troubles, but that in the end, the runner is always alone and cut off from spectators, left to deal with life on his own.Next, we see Colin in handcuffs with a group of other similarly encumbered young men. They are being taken to Ruxton Towers, what we would today term a medium security prison for young juvenile offenders. It is overseen by \\"The Governor\\" (Michael Redgrave), who believes that the hard work and discipline imposed on his charges will ultimately make them useful members of society. Colin, sullen and rebellious, immediately catches his eye as a test of his beliefs.An important part of The Governor's rehabilitation program is athletics, and he soon notices that Colin is a talented runner, able to easily outrun Ruxton's reigning long distance runner. As The Governor was once a runner himself, he is especially keen on Colin's abilities because for the first time, his charges have been invited to compete in a five-mile marathon against a nearby public school, Ranley, and its privileged students from upper class families. The Governor sees the invitation as an important way to demonstrate the success of his rehabilitation program.As the Governor takes Colin under his wing, offering him outdoor gardening work and eventually the freedom of practice runs outside Ruxton's barbed wire fences, we learn in a series of flashbacks how Colin came to be incarcerated. We see his difficult, economically strained family life in a lower-class workers' complex in industrial Nottingham. Without a job, Colin indulges in petty crimes in the company of his best friend, Mike (James Bolam). Meanwhile, at home, his father's long years of toil in a local factory have resulted in a terminal illness for which his father refuses treatment. Colin is angered by the...

After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries.

A:","completion":"A: Given the information in the paragraph, it can be inferred that France would likely have a lower labor supply in comparison to Germany. The reasoning behind this inference is that France implemented a tax rate above the critical rate, which is often associated with pro-socialist governments. This higher tax rate potentially discourages businesses and individuals from expanding or investing in labor, resulting in a lower labor supply. On the other hand, Germany's pro-capitalist governments led to them implementing a tax rate below the critical rate, which would encourage businesses to expand their operations and invest in labor, leading to a higher labor supply compared to France."},{"prompt":"Choose from: [I] fungi.

Months previously, keyboardist Jon Carin had jammed with Gilmour at his Hookend studio, where he composed the chord progression that became \\"Learning to Fly\\", and so was invited onto the team. Gilmour invited Bob Ezrin (co-producer of 1979's The Wall) to help consolidate their material; Ezrin had turned down Waters' offer of a role on the development of his new solo album, Radio K.A.O.S., saying it was \\"far easier for Dave and I to do our version of a Floyd record\\". Ezrin arrived in England in mid-1986 for what Gilmour later described as \\"mucking about with a lot of demos\\".At this stage, there was no commitment to a new Pink Floyd release, and Gilmour maintained that the material might become his third solo album.

We do not come across movies on brother-sister relationship in Indian cinema, or any other language or medium. This relationship has several aspects which have not been exploited in movies or novels. Typically, a sister is depicted as a pile-on who can be used for ransom in the climax. This movie treats the subject in an entirely different light. It is inspired by George Eliot's novel \\"The Mill on the Floss\\". The brother is very prosaic, all-good, the blue-eyed boy who is a conventionally good son and a favorite with his mother. The sister is romantic, wild and defiant of the unwritten rules of the society. In spite of this, the love of the brother-sister is the winner. This movie is about the love of the two siblings who are separated in childhood and revival of the same feeling when they meet years later. It is also the quest of the subdued brother to reunite with his sister who has chosen to be wild to defy the world. Although the movie and the novel are set about 3 centuries apart in two distant countries, yet the sentiments are the same and still hold true.

He told the BBC's Andrew Marr show it would be \\"very difficult\\" for a public who voted to leave the European Union to have a leader who had opposed this. PM David Cameron announced on Friday that he would step down by October. He had urged the country to vote Remain in Thursday's referendum, but the Leave campaign won by 52% to 48%. Since Thursday's vote there has been intense speculation about who will replace Mr Cameron, and when and how the UK will begin formal negotiations to exit the EU. Meanwhile, potential leadership contender Boris Johnson has been meeting with Conservative MPs Jake Berry and Ben Wallace at his home. The BBC understands he also met with justice secretary and fellow Leave campaigner Michael Gove. Several sources have told BBC political editor Laura Kuennsberg that Mr Gove will co-chair Mr Johnson's leadership campaign, if he runs. Mr Johnson, who is widely expected to announce his leadership bid in the coming days, plans to run on a \\"unity\\" ticket, with a prominent Remainer part of the campaign leadership, our editor said. Meanwhile, Home Secretary Theresa May has been canvassing opinion among MPs and is expected to announce her leadership bid in the next couple of days. Our political editor said there was a growing sense among Tory MPs that only two or three names will enter the leadership contest because it is about choosing the next prime minister, rather than a wide field that would be narrowed down by the Parliamentary party. International Development secretary, Justine Greening, suggested today that Boris Johnson and Theresa May should come to a deal rather than having a drawn out contest at all. Mr Duncan Smith, who campaigned for Leave, said: \\"The government itself now had a view... which was to remain, and so now we need to change that position and actually deliver on this very clear mandate from the British people.\\" He said he was \\"incredibly sad\\" Mr Cameron had chosen to go as he wanted him to \\"remain to help stabilise the situation and get us moving\\". \\"But I do think it would be very, very difficult for the public who have voted for leaving the European Union to find that they then had a prime minister who actually was opposed to leaving the European Union. \\"So I think it is quite clear that - at least the leadership end of it - but I would like all the others, Remain and us, to come together.\\" Mr Duncan Smith also ruled himself out of the future Conservative leadership contest. He said the House of Commons had \\"an obligation to deliver on the British people's verdict\\" and progress with leaving the EU. \\"The Conservative party is in a majority in the House of Commons and my view about this is there are also a number of Labour MPs who are very clear they want this to be delivered on,\\" he said. When questioned about the Leave campaign's assertion that leaving the EU would free up Â£350m a week extra to spend on the NHS, Mr Duncan Smith said the NHS would receive \\"the lion's share\\". \\"It is not a promise broken, I never said that during the course of the election,\\" he said. \\"What I said was we would be able to spend the lion's share of that money, now the government is now able to spend, so people can say that there is more money available now for the NHS, categorically more, which is what's required and that's the key point.\\" Asked if UKIP leader Nigel Farage - a key Leave figure - would be involved in the cross-party exit negotiations with Brussels, Mr Duncan Smith suggested the party's sole MP Douglas Carswell would be consulted. \\"There is a UKIP MP who is part of that process in a parliamentary sense, and I'm very happy to discuss... with UKIP about what their expectations are, but the government itself, right now, actually dictates how this will happen,\\" he said. On immigration, he said the Conservative government had to honour its manifesto pledge to bring net migration - the difference between the number of people coming to the UK for at least a year and those leaving - down to below 100,000. Mr Duncan Smith said: \\"I said consistently throughout that we need to get control of our borders and the only way to do that is to leave the European Unionâ€¦ \\"Once we do that we are in a much stronger position to achieve that objective of bringing down migration to tens of thousands within this Parliament - I will stand by that.\\" This article was about:","completion":"This article is about the aftermath of the UK's referendum on leaving the European Union, with a focus on the Conservative party's leadership contest following David Cameron's resignation announcement.

Doncaster dominated most of the first half with Andy Williams forcing a fine save from on-loan Everton goalkeeper Russell Griffiths in the 16th minute.

Cheltenham improved in the second half, bidding to protect an unbeaten home record stretching back to last September when they were beaten 1-0 by Tranmere in the National League.

The equation given is: 568*y - 5218*y = -97650 Step 1: To simplify this, let's combine like terms on the left-hand side of the equation, those being 568*y and -5218*y. Subtracting 5218 from 568, we get -4650. So the equation simplifies to -4650*y = -97650. Step 2: Next we need to solve for y. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of y, which is -4650. This will isolate y on one side of the equation, giving us the solution. Mathematically, this looks like: (-97650) / (-4650) = y. Step 3: Performing this division gives us a solution of y = 21.

Summarize this article: The Price of Football surveys the cost of the cheapest and most expensive match-day and season tickets, as well as the cost of a pie, programme, cup of tea and adult and junior replica shirts. The calculator helps you navigate through this data with ease. Simply enter the name of your club and you'll have all the key data presented and put into context for you. In addition you can work out how much support of your team is costing you. Simply enter your ticket cost, food, drink and programme spend, plus how many replica shirts you buy and the amount you pay on TV sports subscriptions. The calculator will then compare that to a number of costs, such as player wages, transfer fees and other leisure pursuits. Throughout the calculator, we compare how various costs have changed using data from previous BBC Price of Football studies. Some data comparisons are not available for clubs not included in previous years. The 'price of a goal' is calculated by dividing the cost of a club's cheapest season ticket last season by the number of goals scored by the team at home in the same season. Some comparisons are not available for clubs not surveyed last season, or promoted to the National League. Programme costs were not collected from European clubs, as many do not publish match-day programmes in the same way as UK teams. The BBC contacted 227 clubs for the study. Of those, 200 were in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales and another 27 in Europe. The data was collated and verified by BBC Sport journalists. Swansea are omitted from the survey and calculator because they declined to take part. All ticket prices refer to an adult ticket when bought individually. The match-day ticket prices quoted refer to high and low prices available on the day of a game, to reflect the price for fans who decide on match day they would like to attend a game, and not individual offers. Match-day costs reflect categories that are registered with the relevant league, rather than individual, or one-off, offers. The season ticket prices quoted refer to the cheapest possible ticket (including early bird offers), and the most expensive season ticket. Replica shirt prices are listed according to the official cost in the club shop or website - rather than separate retailers.

Around 1560 Russia interacted with Kabardia but thereafter left the region alone except for the Caspian coast. In 1800 Russia annexed eastern Georgia and by 1806 held Transcaucasia from the Black Sea to the Caspian. Since Russia also claimed the steppes north of the mountains its claims were divided by the free mountaineers of the Caucasus. Russia had to hold the Georgian Military Highway in the center so the war against the mountaineers was divided into eastern and western parts. Circassia refers to a region the majority of whose inhabitants before the 1860s were the Adygey ethnic group, known to the West as Circassians. This region consisted for the most part of the region between the westward flowing Kuban River to the north and the Caucasus mountain range to the south, although the Kuban River constituted only part of the northern boundary. The Circassians were never politically united for a long period. The western bulk of Circassia, they belonged to any of about ten tribes, living in communities headed by chieftains. In the east of Circassia were two feudal polities, Greater Kabardá and Lesser Kabardá. In the late 1550s, the ruler of one of the Kabardás, Temryuk , struck a politico-military alliance with Tsar Ivan IV of Russia , for mutual assistance against expansionist attacks by the Persian and Ottoman Empires. In this period of history, the Circassians were Christians; Islam did not begin to penetrate Circassia until the following century. In the 1560s Ivan and Temryuk directed forts to be constructed, including Tumnev at the western end of Circassian lands and at Sunzha Ostrog at the mouth of the Sunzha river, at the eastern end of Circassian lands.

Replace parallel meaning transition words and phrases with “therefore. Include “therefore” to improve sentence flow. Article:","completion":"Title: The Power of \\"Therefore\\": Enhancing Your Writing Style and Flow Introduction Good writing often stems from careful consideration of words and phrases that can improve the overall readability and clarity of your work. One such word that can significantly enhance your writing style and flow is \\"therefore.\\" This simple yet powerful word is a versatile and valuable tool that can replace parallel meaning transition words and phrases while demonstrating cause and effect relationships within your text. In this article, we will explore how using \\"therefore\\" can help you achieve greater coherence and logical progression in your writing. The Magic of \\"Therefore\\" By nature, \\"therefore\\" is a conjunctive adverb that effectively conveys cause and effect relationships. When used appropriately, it can create a natural flow in your writing, providing readers with a clear understanding of the logical progression of your ideas. Moreover, it can replace other transition words and phrases with parallel meanings, simplifying your writing and making it more concise. Take, for example, the sentence: \\"The evidence suggests a strong correlation between poor air quality and respiratory health problems; therefore, improving air quality should be a priority for public health policy.\\" In this instance, \\"therefore\\" demonstrates the cause and effect relationship between air quality and respiratory health, tying the two concepts together and enabling the reader to make a logical connection between them without any ambiguity. Using \\"Therefore\\" to Replace Parallel Meaning Transitions Several transition words and phrases convey cause and effect relationships, such as \\"as a result,\\" \\"consequently,\\" \\"due to,\\" \\"owing to,\\" and \\"thus.\\" While some variety is desirable in writing, using \\"therefore\\" to replace these parallel meanings can help streamline your text and create a more coherent writing style. Consider the following sentences: 1. Jane faced numerous obstacles throughout her journey, and as a result, she learned valuable lessons about self-reliance. 2. John faced many difficulties due to his lack of preparation, which ultimately led to his failure. By incorporating \\"therefore\\" into these sentences, we improve the flow and coherence of the text: 1. Jane faced numerous obstacles throughout her journey; therefore, she learned valuable lessons about self-reliance. 2. John faced many difficulties due to his lack of preparation; therefore, he ultimately failed. Including \\"Therefore\\" to Improve Sentence Flow The proper placement of \\"therefore\\" can dramatically enhance the flow of your writing by guiding readers through a logical progression of ideas. When using \\"therefore,\\" it is essential to place it in a position where it will effectively signal a cause and effect relationship between two clauses or sentences. For example: - Incorrect: \\"Therefore, Sarah skipped breakfast, she was running late for work.\\" - Correct: \\"Sarah was running late for work; therefore, she skipped breakfast.\\" In the correct example, \\"therefore\\" links the cause (running late for work) with the effect (skipping breakfast), creating a clear and logical connection for the reader. Conclusion Mastering the art of using \\"therefore\\" in your writing can have a significant impact on the overall quality and readability of your work. By incorporating this powerful word into your writing style and replacing parallel meaning transition words and phrases, you can successfully establish cause and effect relationships, improve sentence flow, and create a more coherent and logical text for your readers to enjoy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Test sentence: \\"He's a reliable enough man.\\" Is this test sentence a correct grammatical English sentence?","completion":"Yes, the test sentence \\"He's a reliable enough man.\\" is a correct grammatical English sentence. Let's break down its components to understand why it is grammatically correct: 1. Subject: \\"He\\" – This is a singular third person pronoun, which serves as the subject of the sentence. 2. Auxiliary verb: \\"is\\" – The verb \\"is\\" is contracted with the subject to form \\"He's\\". \\"Is\\" is the third person singular form of the verb \\"to be\\" and is an auxiliary verb, which is used to provide additional information about the main verb. In this case, \\"is\\" works as a linking verb to connect the subject \\"he\\" to the predicate (a description or action related to the subject). 3. Adjective + Adverb: \\"reliable enough\\" – \\"reliable\\" is an adjective that describes the subject \\"he\\", and \\"enough\\" is an adverb that modifies the adjective \\"reliable\\". When \\"enough\\" is placed after an adjective, it indicates a sufficient or adequate level of the quality expressed by that adjective. Thus, \\"reliable enough\\" means that the subject possesses a satisfactory level of reliability. 4. Noun: \\"man\\" – This is the noun complement that further specifies the subject \\"he\\". It is connected to the subject by the linking verb \\"is\\" and provides additional information about the subject, describing what or who \\"he\\" is. The sentence follows the basic subject-verb-object (SVO) order, which is common in English sentences. The subject is \\"He\\", the verb is \\"is\\" (in its contracted form), and the object (or noun complement) is \\"man\\". The adjective \\"reliable\\" and the adverb \\"enough\\" together function as an attribute complement in the sentence, providing information about the subject. In conclusion, the test sentence \\"He's a reliable enough man.\\" is a grammatically correct English sentence, as it follows standard English grammar rules, including a subject, verb, and object, along with appropriate modifiers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On 16 June 1808, the townsfolk — armed with little more than ancient swords, spears, and stones — attacked and captured the local French garrison. It's said that a party of local men then set sail from Olhão all the way to Brazil, without maps or navigational aids, to tell the king of the insurrection. The real battle, however, was waged under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington, whose coalition forces expelled the French after two years of bitter fighting. The war left Portugal further weakened, and in 1822 its major empire outpost, Brazil, declared independence. At the same time, a dispute over the crown continually raged between Pedro IV, the absentee monarch who preferred to reign as Emperor of Brazil rather than return to Portugal, and his brother Miguel. The power struggle, with strong overtones of absolutism versus liberalism, excited the interest and intervention of other powers. With British help, Pedro defeated Miguel off Cape St. Vincent in 1833, and his expeditionary force marched to Lisbon. Pedro took the throne, though armed struggle continued for months and the lingering bitterness long after that. By 1892 Portugal, racked by wars and the continuing expense of maintaining its African colonies (including those of Mozambique and Angola), declared itself bankrupt. The seeds of discontent with absolutist rule were sown. Kingdom's End Bloodshed would haunt the remaining years of the Portuguese monarchy. On 1 February 1908, the royal family was riding in an open carriage along the Lisbon river front plaza, Terreiro do Paço, when an assassin opened fire and killed King Carlos and the heir to the throne, Prince Luis Filipe. The prince's younger brother, Prince Manuel, was also hit, but he survived and was thus propelled to the throne at the tender age of 19. Amid republican agitation, a surprise uprising led by elements within the armed forces deposed Manuel in 1910. Having ruled for less than three years, Manuel died in exile in 1932 in England. The sudden end of more than seven centuries of monarchy brought confusion and crisis to the country. Presidents and prime ministers were ushered into and out of office an unbelievable 45 times between 1910 and 1926, until a military revolution suspended Portugal's problematic democracy.

Question: Q: Intensity is defined to be the power per unit area carried by a what? Choices: - filament - shift - wire - wave A: Answer:","completion":"Intensity is defined to be the power per unit area carried by a wave. To provide a more detailed understanding of intensity, let's break down the concept. In the context of physics, intensity is a measure of how much energy is being transmitted through a specific area in a given period of time. This concept is vital across a wide range of applications, such as optics, acoustics, and electromagnetism. A wave is a disturbance or oscillation that travels through space and matter, transferring energy from one point to another. Some common examples of waves include sound waves, electromagnetic waves (such as light, radio, and microwaves), and mechanical waves (like water waves or waves traveling through a rope). The power of a wave refers to the rate at which it carries energy, and is usually expressed in watts (W). Mathematically, power (P) can be defined as the work done (W) per unit time (t): P = W/t When discussing intensity, we're interested in how this power is distributed across a given area. For instance, in the case of sound waves, the intensity of the sound would depend on how much energy is being transferred through the air over a certain area. This area could be the surface of a microphone, eardrum, or the walls of a room. Mathematically, intensity (I) is calculated as the power (P) transmitted per unit area (A): I = P/A Units for intensity are typically watts per square meter (W/m²). Different types of waves may exhibit different intensity distributions. For example, in optics, laser light can have a very high intensity due to the small area over which the energy is concentrated, whereas sunlight spreads its energy over a much larger area, resulting in a lower intensity. In summary, intensity is defined as the power per unit area carried by a wave. This concept is crucial in understanding how waves transmit energy across various media and is applicable to multiple fields, such as acoustics, optics, and electromagnetism. By understanding intensity and how it relates to waves, we can better comprehend and control the energy transfer processes in various applications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On a day it celebrated 50 years of giving free legal advice, Southern Arizona Legal Aid announced it has received two grants totaling more than 7 million. One of the grants includes the creation of a Web site with legal advice for the poor. A three-year grant worth 6.6 million and a separate technology grant were announced at a press conference and dinner held Thursday at Evo. A. DeConcini Federal Courthouse, 405 W. Congress St. Deconcini was one of the organization's early board members. Thursday's celebration was the first public even held at the courthouse. About 100 members of the legal community attended, including state Attorney General Janet Napolitano and Arizona Supreme Court Justice Thomas Zlaket. Both grants come from the Legal Services., a private, nonprofit corporation established by Congress in 1974 to offer poor people equal access to the justice system. It's funded through congressional appropriation. The 6.6 million grant will pay for staffing operations. The Web site, which will be created with a 50,000 grant, is intended to offer legal advice to poor people across Arizona, said Paul Julian, chief executive officer of Southern Arizona Legal Aid. He said he wants every poor person in Arizona to have legal help. \\"This is another step in trying to realize that. We feel like we do a pretty good job of helping people who find us,\\" Julian said. Julian said that though most people do not own computers, they can still access them at libraries, schools, and courthouses. He said the Web site will help bridge the \\"digital divide\\" that keeps the poor from using the Internet as a resource. Southern Arizona Legal Aid was founded in 1951 as the Legal Aid Society of the Pima County Bar Association. It offered free legal advice on civil matters including disputes in small claims court, divorce proceedings and obtaining Social Security benefits. Charles Ares, a member of the board of directors in the 1950s, said the office was kind of a charity operation. Do you have any questions?","completion":"Congratulations to Southern Arizona Legal Aid for achieving 50 years of providing free legal advice and for securing the recent grants to further enhance their services. I do have some questions about the new developments and the organization itself: 1. How will the 6.6 million grant be distributed over the three-year period for staffing operations? Are there specific areas or programs within the organization that will receive more focus or expansion? 2. What specific services or resources will be available on the new website created by the 50,000 grant? Will there be information on various legal issues, ways to find lawyers, or perhaps an online chat service for immediate help? 3. How will Southern Arizona Legal Aid ensure that its services are reaching all poor people in Arizona, especially those who may not have easy access to the internet or are in rural and isolated areas? 4. Are there any plans to collaborate with public libraries, schools, or courthouses across Arizona to ensure that access to these legal resources via the new website is promoted and available to those who need it? 5. How has the organization evolved and expanded over the years in terms of the scope of services offered, staffing, and financial resources? What key milestones or achievements have been made during this 50-year period? 6. Apart from the current grants, what other avenues of funding or support does Southern Arizona Legal Aid rely on to provide free legal advice? Are there any long-term partnerships or collaborations with other organizations or institutions that contribute to its mission? 7. What are some of the most common legal issues that the organization helps people with, and how does the organization measure the impact of its services on alleviating these issues for its clients? 8. How are the volunteers and staff of Southern Arizona Legal Aid trained and supported in providing these services? Are there any continuing education or professional development opportunities offered to ensure their expertise remains current? 9. Can you share any success stories or examples of how Southern Arizona Legal Aid has made a significant difference in clients' lives, particularly those who may not have had access to justice otherwise?

Sadly, not everyone in these countries is so fortunate and many people in rich countries are homeless. The reasons for homelessness are various, but poverty is undoubtedly one of the main causes. The homeless people may have become jobless and then been unable to pay their rent and so no longer have _ . Often, the fact that unemployed people get help from the government prevents this from happening, but not always. Some homeless people are mentally ill and have no one to look after them. Some are young people who, for one reason or another, have left home and have nowhere to live. Many of them have had a serious disagreement with their parents and have left home, choosing to go to a city and live on the streets. Sometimes they have taken such action because they have been unable to get on with a step-parent. Many homeless people get into the habit of begging to get enough money to stay alive, but many of the general public refuse to give anything to beggars.

Help as much as you can. Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Everybody knows that colors are connected with certain feelings. For example, why do some people paint the walls of their rooms yellow and others pink? The same is true in stores. They want us to feel something when we look at their products. Green, for example, tries to show the quality of a product: how good it is for us or for our environment. It also suggests that the product is healthier, has less fat and maybe fewer calories. Red, on the other hand is an aggressive color that is often used for packaging food. Red wants us to become hungry or thirsty. Purple is a kind of color that is often seen as royal. It indicates that it is something special. Producers use purple to show that something is of good quality. Blue is not very often found in food packaging because there are not very many foods that have a blue color. Colors can also have different meaning in different cultures and countries. For example, while the color white is used in many Western countries to represent purity and innocence, it is seen as a symbol of mourning in many Eastern countries. The Egyptian pharaohs wore white crowns. A white sale is a sale of sheets, towels, and other bed and bath items. A white flag is the universal symbol for truce . A white elephant is a rare, pale elephant sacred to the people of India, Thailand, Burma, and Sri Lanka. In these countries, something that is a white elephant is either a possession that costs more than it is worth to keep or an item that the owner doesn't want but can't get rid of. Consumers are aware that certain foods must have certain colors. When Pepsi brought out a crystal clear cola in 1992, it thought that consumers would buy it because clear meant pure and healthy. After a few months Pepsi found out that a cola had to be dark-colored. Crystal Pepsi failed and the company pulled it off the market.

Back at their house by the cemetery, Paul and Chloe found Bee in her room, what Paul referred to as her sanctum sanctorum - although no one else ever got the joke, and he refused to explain the comic book reference. As always, lighting was minimal (as opposed to Bee's workshop out behind the house, which was flooded with fluorescents). A bank of TV sets and computer monitors covered one whole wall, arranged on a precarious system of metal shelves that Bee had installed herself. A low, flat coffee table squatted below the glowing displays, supporting three keyboards, a bank of video editing tools and four different phone carriages. Bee sat in her accustomed place - in the midst of a pile of cushions on the floor, fiddling with a mouse in one hand and typing on one of the keyboards while she talked quietly into her headset. Paul and Chloe didn't bother to knock as they came in - Bee already knew they were there. Paul glanced at one of the screens mounted on the wall. Its display, divided into four quadrants, showed various images from inside the house, including the front door they'd just come through and the stairs they'd just climbed. The screen next to it - which Paul himself had salvaged from a bar on Duval that'd recently renovated into a finedining restaurant - showed images from four other cameras that covered the house's exterior. Nothing happened within fifty yards of their Crew's house that Bee didn't see, and if she had her way, that omniscience would soon extend to cover the entire island. \\"So, Bee, how goes Project Big Brother?\\" Paul asked. \\"I wish you wouldn't call it that,\\" she replied. \\"Sorry, but I have to call it something.\\" \\"You could call it something nice.

We have an equation: -1344 = 41*j + 39*j -24*j First, let's combine those j's that are being multiplied by those numbers (41, 39, and -24). You can imagine this like having 41 apples, 39 apples, and taking away 24 apples.

You can think of this as sharing -1344 pieces of candy evenly among 56 kids, and we need to find out how many pieces of candy each kid gets.

Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"A: Yes, the answer correctly states that the Burns Monument at Alloway was created in 1818. The Burns Monument, also known as the National Burns Monument, was built in memory of the famous Scottish poet and lyricist Robert Burns. The structure is located in Alloway, Ayrshire, Scotland, and was designed by architect Thomas Hamilton in the Grecian style, featuring columns and a cupola surrounding a statue of Burns. The construction of the monument began in 1818 and was completed in 1823. It was funded through public donations and subscriptions, with the intention of creating a lasting memorial to Scotland's national poet. The monument quickly became an important cultural site and a focal point for Burns enthusiasts, as it represents the strong public admiration for his work and the impact it had on Scottish literature and identity. In addition to the monument, the site also includes a museum, known as the Burns Monument Centre, which houses a collection of original manuscripts, artifacts, and artwork related to the life and work of Robert Burns. Since its inception, the monument and museum have attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors, including prominent writers, artists, and politicians, who have sought inspiration from the works of this influential poet.

Let's elaborate on the possible meaning of this. Whenever a driver puts their vehicle into reverse, a Car Backup Camera becomes a handy tool. This gadget displays a clear image of the area behind the vehicle, thus dramatically reducing the risk of hitting nearby objects or vehicles during parking and improving overall safety and convenience. The mentioned \\"Parking Aid\\" feature further simplifies the task of parking the car. It usually visualizes the vehicle's trajectory by superimposing it over the camera image, and thus enables the driver better judge the distances to obstacles and other vehicles. The \\"Waterproof\\" feature means that the camera can withstand harsh weather conditions such as rain, snow, or even high levels of humidity. This ensures that the camera operates optimally and provides high-quality images regardless of the weather. The part \\"Professional Waterproof Car Reverse Camera\\" might suggest that the camera has some advanced features or has a build-quality suitable for professional-grade applications. It might withstand more extreme conditions than typical consumer-grade cameras, have a wider viewing angle, better low light performance, or more precise parking aid functions. Lastly, noting that it is \\"Easy to Install\\" means that even people without intensive technical knowledge should be able to mount this camera on their vehicle.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: If your parents don’t seem comfortable letting you go to homecoming, ask them to explain why. They may be concerned about drugs and alcohol, or they may be worried about who’s driving you. Listen to them calmly and patiently, so they have a chance to express themselves. If you're not sure how to start the conversation, you might say, \\"I know that you're unsure about homecoming. What are you concerned about?\\" It may be difficult, but don’t interrupt your parents when they’re talking. Be respectful and show that you take their concerns seriously. Once you know what your parents’ concerns or objections are, you can try to find ways to address them. In most cases, that means being willing to compromise. For example, they might not want you to go to the post-homecoming activities, so agree that you’ll just go to the dance and come straight home. They may be concerned about your transportation for the evening, so you might suggest that they drive you to and from the dance. Find a way to make you and your parents both at least a little bit happy. Another way to compromise with your parents about homecoming is to suggest periodic check-ins over the course of the night. For example, you might agree to text or call when you arrive at the dance, at some point in the middle, and right before you leave. If you’re headed to post-homecoming activities, you can check in again when you arrive at the locale and when you’re on your way home. If you behave in a mature, responsible way, your parents are more likely to trust you and allow you to go to homecoming. Make a habit of always obeying your curfew, so they know that you'll be home when you say that you will. If they give you chores around the house, do them without your parents having to remind you. You should also be kind to your siblings, and try to resolve conflicts with them without having your parents intervene. Your performance in school can also help convince your parents to let you go. Work to get good grades so they know that you take your responsibilities seriously. If your parents ultimately decide not to allow you to go to homecoming, accept the decision calmly and maturely. Avoid whining or yelling because you didn’t get what you wanted. That will only make your parents angry, so they’re less likely to allow you to attend other events in the future. It can also help convince them that they made the right decision. If you feel yourself getting upset about your parents’ decision, take a moment to count to 10 in your head. That can often help you calm down. Summary:","completion":"If your parents don't want you to go to homecoming, ask them why and listen to their reasons. Be respectful and try to find a solution that makes both you and your parents happy, like agreeing to check in with them during the night. Show them you are responsible by doing chores, being kind to siblings, and getting good grades. If they still say no, stay calm and don't get upset, as it could make things worse."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Premise: Two women holding checkered flags near an orange car. The presence of checkered flags and a car might hint at a car race event. Checkered flags are commonly used in auto racing to indicate the start or end of a race, and two women holding them could signify they are either \\"grid girls\\" or race officials responsible for signaling those crucial race moments. Furthermore, bright-colored cars like orange are often used in races to make them more visually distinctive on the track. Hypothesis: Women are holding flags, ready to wave them for the car race. Seeing two women with checkered flags near an orange car might suggest that they are preparing for a car race event. However, the information provided in the premise is limited, and not enough to definitively confirm that the circumstance is related to a car race. There are possible alternative explanations for the given premise: 1. The women could be promoting an event or a car show: The women holding the checkered flags could be working as brand ambassadors, promoting an automobile event, or drawing attention to a new car launch. 2.

A thematic party or gathering: The women might be involved in a car-racing-themed social event or a party where the checkered flags and the orange car are elements of the party décor. In summary, while the hypothesis is plausible based on the information available in the premise, we cannot definitively conclude that it is an accurate portrayal of the situation. The context described in the premise provides clues that might lead us to believe that the hypothesis could be true, but we would require additional specific information to confirm it with certainty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think of the savings in terms of fuel bills and unfriendly emissions. Such houses in fact exist, called \\"passive houses\\". The concept of these highly energy-efficient buildings took root in the 1990s, before slowly consolidating as a niche construction concept in the 2000s. Are passive houses now actively moving into the mainstream as sustainable buildings? For Brian McGarry, an economics lecturer who built a family house based on passive housing criteria in the Pyrenees this year, the arguments look convincing. As his first full winter in the low energy house draws in, we asked him to keep us informed. Do passive houses work? I had never heard of a passive house in February 2012, when I purchased a plot of land. Nor did I expect that I would be persuaded to build a pre-constructed, custom-designed house based on energy-efficient passive house criteria. It promised to be easier and quicker to build, cheaper to run, and more comfortable to live in. The objective was to incorporate the fundamental concepts of passive energy management into my project: an airtight and highly insulated building envelope; large southfacing double or triple-glazed windows (if possible, filled with argon gas) that passively capture the energy of the sun; a heat recovery ventilation system to provide fresh air; and a simple, low-cost heating system consisting of a modern wood-burning stove, a bathroom heater and a portable radiator backup for when the sun doesn't shine and temperatures decline. No significant limitations were placed on the design, and it had excellent environmental credentials. Moreover, the cost was no more than a conventional build. After six months in use, the house is proving to be both cheap to run and remarkably comfortable-staying cool in the hot summer was effortless, as long as the windows were shuttered or shaded from the sun.

Help as much as you can. Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: The filming was kind of a long process, but maybe it didn’t need to be? Or maybe it did? The first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie’s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie’s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell’s script and getting any other shots we needed to get. Perhaps we didn’t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn’t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn’t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I’m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects. I get a tad obsessive if I’m allowed, which can often benefit me, although I do become a giant pain in everyone else’s ass. The main thing I learnt from the filming process was that you can plan out exactly what you want to do, and how your going to do it, but once you get into the location with the actors this plan often changes – however, you are still much better of having the plan than none at all! As the neurotic freak I am, I had all the shots I wanted to use storyboarded. I had originally planned to shoot all the establishing shots, stick them in a timeline and then also shoot the other shots (with fill in actors) and add them to the timeline to see how it looked. Of course no one else was interested in spending an entire night shooting the film – but with them as stands in – just so I could complete my psychotic endeavour of...

The Cambrian is a major division of the geologic timescale that begins about 541.0 ± 1.0 Ma. Cambrian continents are thought to have resulted from the breakup of a Neoproterozoic supercontinent called Pannotia. The waters of the Cambrian period appear to have been widespread and shallow. Continental drift rates may have been anomalously high. Laurentia, Baltica and Siberia remained independent continents following the break-up of the supercontinent of Pannotia. Gondwana started to drift toward the South Pole. Panthalassa covered most of the southern hemisphere, and minor oceans included the Proto-Tethys Ocean, Iapetus Ocean and Khanty Ocean. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): When did Pannotia begin to drift towards the South Pole?","completion":"The question does not provide enough information to give an exact timeframe of when Pannotia began to drift towards the South Pole. However, it does mention that the breakup of Pannotia led to the formation of Cambrian continents around 541 million years ago. Gondwana, which formed as a result of the breakup, started to drift toward the South Pole. So, we can infer that Pannotia likely began to drift and break apart sometime before the start of the Cambrian period, around 541 million years ago.

Fred started eating junk food and other fatty foods in his 30's. His cholesterol is very high now. Vic became a vegan later,and he is in a very good physical shape. But I can use this background: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. What is an answer for this question: Which friend had a decreased blood flow to the heart? A:","completion":"Based on the given information and background, it is most likely that Fred, who started eating junk food and other fatty foods in his 30's and now has very high cholesterol, experienced a decrease in blood flow to the heart. This is due to the role of cholesterol in the development of atherosclerosis, as described in the background. When Fred consumed excessive amounts of junk food and fatty foods, his cholesterol levels increased. High cholesterol is one of the factors that contribute to atherosclerosis, a disorder in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. Over time, these deposits form plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through blood vessels. Restricted blood flow in the coronary arteries can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. In more severe cases, it can result in a complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart, causing a heart attack, which can lead to significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, and in some cases, death. On the other hand, Vic became a vegan later in life and is now in excellent physical shape. By choosing a plant-based diet, he likely eliminated many sources of unhealthy fats and cholesterol, reducing his risk of developing atherosclerosis and, subsequently, having decreased blood flow to the heart. In conclusion, Fred, with his unhealthy dietary habits and high cholesterol levels, is the friend who likely experienced a decreased blood flow to the heart. Adopting a healthier lifestyle, like Vic's vegan diet, can help reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases and maintain overall heart health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: a). negative; b). positive;","completion":"Based on the preceding review, the movie was seen negatively. The review refers to it as a \\"mediocre fable from Burkina Faso,\\" which suggests that the critic did not find it an outstanding or impressive film. The word \\"mediocre\\" specifically indicates that the film was average or unexceptional, with the reviewer seemingly unimpressed by the story or its presentation. Option (a) \\"negative,\\" is the correct answer in this case, implying that the movie has not received a favorable review. The reviewer's choice of language suggests disappointment or dissatisfaction with the film's quality, and there is a strong indication that it has not met their expectations. Furthermore, it gives the impression that the movie simply did not leave a lasting or favorable impact on the critic, tarnishing its overall reputation. On the other hand, option (b) \\"positive,\\" does not apply in this situation. If the movie was seen positively, the reviewer would likely use words like \\"brilliant,\\" \\"captivating,\\" or \\"remarkable.\\" Those words would suggest a better reception of the movie and indicate that it managed to leave a strong impression on the audience.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte. After reading the above, is \\"Japanese\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What are some of the languages are now spoken by employees of the NLS?\\"?","completion":"Yes, \\"Japanese\\" is the correct answer to the question, as the text indicates that Neighborhood Legal Services (NLS) has expanded their capacity to include staff who are proficient in a number of Asian languages including Japanese. The text details how NLS, an organization dedicated to providing free legal services to the economically disadvantaged, has broadened its presence in the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys where there is a significant Asian population. The non-English speaking Asian population traditionally faced several barriers to accessing such services including language limitations, cultural isolation, and the legal service providers' own lack of cultural expertise. However, in response to the particular needs of these communities, NLS has sought to enhance its language capabilities as part of its service expansion. As NLS executive director, Neal Dubovitz, specified, there was an objective to increase language diversity comparable to the Spanish-English bilingual capability which is now common in their legal offices. This expansion incentive gave rise to the hiring of around 13 attorneys capable of speaking different Asian languages. Attorney Rebecca Yee lists these languages as Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese, and Tagalog. One case illustrates Family Law Attorney Irene Mak who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin, and Thai and was hired to work on domestic violence cases. Mak's own experience, her zeal to serve the Asian community, along with her language skills, epitomize the broader goal of the NLS; to diversify and expand their services to cater to diverse communities and cultures. Therefore, with the inclusion of Japanese-speaking staff as a part of their expansion, NLS has made an important step towards enhancing accessibility and inclusivity in their services for the Asian communities in the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys. So, \\"Japanese\\" is indeed a correct reference to the languages now spoken by employees of the NLS."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

But when bad weather gives you trouble, can you still make it before the bell rings? In northern China during spring, big sandstorms often make trouble for students and everyone else. When the sky is dark with sand, buses and cars all move much more slowly. Sometimes, people can't even see for 20 metres. Sandstorms usually happen in spring. This year, sandstorms started in late March. They have happened in more than 10 provinces in northern China this year. More than 70 million people have had problems in those places because of the sandstorms. People in southern China don't have to worry about this kind of bad weather. Most of the sand comes from Gansu and Inner Mongolia . In northern China, lots of places have few trees and don't get much rain. People there have been cutting down too many trees. When there aren't many trees, the ground can't keep enough water. Over the years, the ground dries up and turns to sand. When spring comes and the ice melts , the ground becomes looser . Strong winds take the loose sand into the sky. Sandstorms are bad for people's health. If people breathe too much sand, they could cough or have asthma . Sandstorms also give farmers lots of problems. Sometimes their sheep get lost in the storms and never get back home. The winds also tear down farmers' houses. What can you do to stop sandstorms? Here's an idea: Ask you parents to help you plant some trees this spring. If you see people cutting down too many trees, tell them about the dangers of sandstorms, and ask your government to stop them from cutting.

Which case would see smaller opportunity for food sources, case A or case B? Greg was studying behavior of different organisms. He noticed that some organisms were showing inquiline behavior. He noted that behavior as case A. Then he noticed some other organisms didn't show any inquiline behavior. He noted that behavior as case B. He was astonished by the complicated interactions among organisms. Hint: Ants form symbiotic associations with a range of species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, and fungi. They also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this ant mimicry (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving Batesian mimicry, where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show Wasmannian mimicry, a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Case A would see smaller opportunity for food sources. In case A, organisms exhibit inquiline behavior, which means they live within the ant nests and can have a complex relationship with the host ants. These organisms may compete for the same food sources as the ants (e.g., larvae, eggs, and food stores), or they may depend on the ants for their own survival (e.g., through Wasmannian mimicry). On the other hand, in case B, organisms do not exhibit inquiline behavior and therefore do not rely on the ants' resources as a food source or as a means for survival. These organisms would have access to a wider range of food sources available in their environment, which would ultimately present more opportunities for food sources when compared to case A."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: Page Content WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Treasury today imposed sanctions on two al-Qa'ida supporters based in Qatar and Yemen. Abd al-Rahman bin 'Umayr al-Nu'aymi (Nu'aymi) and \`Abd al-Wahhab Muhammad \`Abd al-Rahman al-Humayqani (Humayqani) were named as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs) pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13224. Nu'aymi was designated for providing financial support to al-Qa'ida, Asbat al-Ansar, al-Qa'ida in Iraq, and al-Shabaab, and Humayqani was designated for providing financial support to and acting on behalf of al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). \\"It is essential for countries to take proactive steps to disrupt terrorist financing, especially where al-Qa'ida and its affiliates are concerned. We will continue to work with our partners in the Gulf to ensure that charitable donations are not used to support violence in the region or elsewhere,\\" said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen. Nu'aymi is a Qatar-based terrorist financier and facilitator who has provided money and material support and conveyed communications to al-Qa'ida and its affiliates in Syria, Iraq, Somalia and Yemen for more than a decade. He was considered among the most prominent Qatar-based supporters of Iraqi Sunni extremists. Humayqani has used his Yemen-based charity as a cover for funneling financial support to AQAP and has frequently traveled throughout the Arabian Peninsula while conducting business for AQAP. During political unrest in Yemen, Humayqani reportedly assisted AQAP in gaining a foothold and safe haven in al-Bayda' Governorate, Yemen and as of mid-2011 served as the acting AQAP amir there. Both Nu'aymi and Humayqani are at the center of global support networks that fund and facilitate terrorism. As a result of today's designation, any assets these individuals may have under U.S. jurisdiction are frozen, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from doing business with them. 'Abd al-Rahman bin 'Umayr al-Nu'aymi In 2013, Nu'aymi ordered the transfer of nearly 600,000 to al-Qa'ida via al-Qa'ida's representative in Syria, Abu-Khalid al-Suri, and intended to transfer nearly 50,000 more. Nu'aymi has facilitated significant financial support to al-Qa'ida in Iraq, and served as an interlocutor between al-Qa'ida in Iraq leaders and Qatar-based donors. Nu'aymi reportedly oversaw the transfer of over 2 million per month to al-Qa'ida in Iraq for a period of time. He also served as an interlocutor between these Qatari nationals and al-Qa'ida in Iraq leaders. Between 2003 and 2004, Nu'aymi provided support to the Iraqi insurgency more broadly and served as a conduit for their broadcast materials to media outlets. Nu'aymi as of mid-2012 provided approximately 250,000 to two U.S.-designated al-Shabaab figures, Mukhtar Robow and Sheikh Hassan Aweys Ali, the latter of whom is also designated by the United Nations (UN). Also in 2012, Nuaymi provided financial support to a charity headed by Yemen-based Abd al-Wahhab Muhammad 'Abd al-Rahman al-Humayqani, who channeled funding to AQAP. \`Abd al-Wahhab Muhammad \`Abd al-Rahman al-Humayqani In his capacity as the head of a Yemen-based charity, Humayqani has used his status in the charitable community to fundraise and has provided some of that funding to AQAP and has facilitated financial transfers from AQAP supporters in Saudi Arabia to Yemen in support of AQAP operations. As of 2012, Humayqani was an important figure within AQAP and reportedly had a relationship with important AQAP leaders. Humayqani and others in March 2012 reportedly orchestrated an AQAP attack on a Yemeni Republican Guard base in al-Bayda' Governorate, Yemen. The attack employed multiple vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices and killed seven. He is suspected to have recruited individuals to AQAP who were involved in a plot to assassinate Yemeni officials. Humayqani has provided financial support and other services to AQAP and acted for or on behalf of the group. He has represented AQAP in meetings with Yemeni officials to negotiate the release of Yemeni soldiers held by AQAP and worked with AQAP operatives to coordinate the movement of AQAP fighters within Yemen. Humayqani has directed a group of armed AQAP associates that intended to carry out attacks on Yemeni government facilities and institutions, including a Yemeni government building in al-Bayda Governorate. He has also recruited individuals in Sana, Yemen on behalf of AQAP in support of AQAP efforts in southern Yemen. Along with the U.S. and UN designated cleric Shaykh Abd al-Majid al-Zindani, he has issued religious guidance in support of AQAP operations. Humayqani and AQAP leadership have planned to establish a new political party in Yemen, which AQAP planned to use as a cover for the recruitment and training of fighters and a means to attract broader support. AQAP leadership decided that Humayani would play a public role as a leader and spokesman for the new political party.

The 59-year-old educator had a stellar résumé that included extensive fundraising experience and years of work with international human rights groups. But one apparent accomplishment was omitted from the list: According to U.S. officials, Nu’aymi also was working secretly as a financier for al-Qaeda, funneling millions of dollars to the terrorist group’s affiliates in Syria and Iraq even as he led campaigns in Europe for greater freedoms for Muslims. Nu’aymi was one of two men identified by Treasury Department officials last week as major financial backers of al-Qaeda and its regional chapters across the Middle East. Although U.S. officials routinely announce steps to disrupt terrorist financing networks, the individuals named in the latest case are far from ordinary. Both men have served as advisers to government-backed foundations in Qatar and have held high-profile positions with international human rights groups. The second man, a Yemeni, is heavily involved in his country’s U.S.-backed political transition. Their alleged dual roles — promoting humanitarian causes and civil rights while simultaneously supporting extremist groups — reflect a growing challenge for counterterrorism officials attempting to monitor the torrents of cash flowing to Islamist rebel groups in Syria, current and former U.S. officials say. “Individuals with one foot in the legitimate world and another in the realm of terrorist financing provide al-Qaeda with a cloak of legitimacy,” said Juan Zarate, a former Treasury Department official and author of “Treasury’s Wars,” a book that describes U.S. efforts to penetrate terrorist financial networks. Zarate said such cases greatly complicate the “financial diplomacy” involved in attempting to disrupt terrorist support networks, especially private funding from wealthy Persian Gulf donors seeking to help Syria’s rebels. Despite attempts by gulf states to crack down on jihadist financial networks, former and current U.S. officials have described a surge in private support for Islamist extremists in Syria, particularly in Qatar and Kuwait. The Obama administration has repeatedly urged both countries to rein in private donations to jihadists, while acknowledging that new tactics, including the widespread use of Twitter and other social media, make fundraising more difficult to track. “It is essential for countries to take proactive steps to disrupt terrorist financing, especially where al-Qaeda and its affiliates are concerned,” David S. Cohen, the Treasury Department’s undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in announcing financial restrictions against Nu’aymi and the Yemeni national, Abd al-Wahhab al-Humayqani. Cohen said the Obama administration would continue to work with the gulf region’s capitals to “ensure that charitable donations are not used to support violence.” The administration’s action last week named both men as “specially designated global terrorists,” a determination that allows U.S. officials to freeze their financial assets and bar American citizens and companies from doing business with them. Treasury Department documents alleged that both men used their charity work to conceal efforts to raise millions of dollars for al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups, from Syria to the Horn of Africa. The naming of the two officials raised eyebrows in Qatar and Yemen, where supporters viewed the allegations as politically motivated. Both men have been prominent critics of U.S. counter­terrorism policies, particularly the use of drone strikes against terrorism suspects. Nu’aymi, a Qatar University professor and former president of the Qatar Football Association, was a founding member of a prominent charity — the Sheik Eid bin Mohammad al-Thani Charitable Foundation, named for a member of the country’s ruling family. In recent years, Nu’aymi had gained renown as an international activist, serving as president of Alkarama, a Geneva-based human rights organization that works closely with the United Nations and major international activist groups to advocate for Muslims’ civil rights. Alkarama lobbies on behalf of Islamist detainees around the world, and it accuses Western and Arab governments of suppressing the rights of political groups that promote Islamic rule for the Middle East. Recently, the group has spoken out against U.S. drone strikes. Some of the group’s former clients are linked to Islamist militias seeking to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Humayqani is an Alkarama founding member and onetime adviser to Qatar on charitable giving, according to his résumé. He is a founding member of Yemen’s conservative Rashad Union party and has served on the country’s National Dialogue Conference, a group established in the wake of the Arab Spring uprising to advise the government on political and economic reforms. The U.S. government strongly backs the National Dialogue with political and financial support. Nu’aymi, in a response posted on Twitter last week, said the U.S. allegations were in retaliation for his criticism of American policies, including drone strikes in Yemen and U.S. support for the recent overthrow of Egypt’s democratically elected government. He said the U.S. claims about his fundraising work were “far from the truth.” Humayqani was traveling and could not be reached for comment. A statement released by his Rashad Union party condemned what it called “false accusations” by the United States and urged Yemen’s government to rally to his defense. The allegations against Nu’aymi come at a time of increasing U.S. concern about the role of Qatari individuals and charities in supporting extreme elements within Syria’s rebel alliance. One charity, Madid Ahl al-Sham, was cited by Jabhat al-Nusra in August as one of the preferred conduits for donations intended for the group, which has pledged loyalty to al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri.

She also told some really funny jokes that made us all giggle. The ice cream was super, duper yum! It was so creamy, just like when we make milkshakes at home. My favorite was Chocolate Peanut Swirl because it tasted like a blend of mommy's chocolate chip cookies and peanut butter sandwiches. They also gave us a big scoop, that was almost bigger than my head! The shop was very clean and colorful, with cool pictures of ice creams on the walls.

Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Bill Javis took over our village news-agency at a time of life when most of us only want to relax. He just thought he would like something but not too much to do, and the news-agency was ready-made. The business produced little enough for him, but Bill was a man who only wanted the simplicity and order and regularity of the job. He had been a long-serving sailor, and all his life had done everything by the clock. Every day he opened his shop at six a.m. to catch the early trade; the papers arrived on his door-step before that. Many of Bill's customers were city workers, and the shop was convenient for the station. Business was _ by 10 o'clock, so at eleven sharp Bill closed for lunch. It was hard luck on anybody who wanted a paper or magazine in the afternoon, for most likely Bill would be down on the river bank, fishing, and his nearest competitor was five kilometers away. Sometime in the afternoon, the evening paper landed on the doormat, and at 4 o'clock Bill reopened. The evening rush lasted till seven, and it was worthwhile. He lived in a flat above the shop, alone. Except in the very bad weather, you always knew where to find him in the afternoon, as I have said. Once, on a sunny afternoon, I walked home along the river bank from a shopping trip to the village. By my watch it was three minutes past four, so I was astonished to see Bill sitting there on his little chair with a line in the water. He had had no luck, I could see, but he was making no effort to move. \\"What's wrong, Bill?\\" I called out from the path. For answer, he put a hand in his jacket and took out a big, golden object. For a moment I had no idea what it could be, and then it suddenly went off with a noise like a fire engine. Stopping the bell, Bill held the thing up and called back, \\"Ten to four, you see, and this is dead right.\\" I had never known anyone carrying a brass alarm clock round with him before.

Identify the context: The word \\"perversity\\" is presented without any additional context or surrounding words. It stands alone as a single-word sentence. 2. Determine the meaning of the word: \\"Perversity\\" refers to a deliberate and stubborn desire to behave in a way that is unreasonable or unacceptable, often despite the consequences. It can have negative connotations and is often associated with rebellion, disobedience, or immorality. 3. Evaluate the sentiment: Based on the meaning of \\"perversity,\\" the sentiment could be considered negative or unfavorable, as it suggests disobedience, immorality, or unreasonableness. 4. Consider the limitations of the analysis: Since there is no additional context provided, it's important to note that the sentence could be perceived differently based on the context in which it is presented. The word \\"perversity\\" on its own does not provide any clear indication of the intended sentiment or emotion behind the sentence. In conclusion, based on the meaning of the word \\"perversity\\" and the lack of context, the sentiment of this sentence would likely be perceived as negative or unfavorable.

How do you do this: push pin","completion":"To use a push pin, you'll need a push pin and a surface to pin it into, such as a corkboard or wall. Here's a step-by-step process on how to use a push pin: Step 1: Choose the location Identify the spot on the surface where you want to place the push pin. This can be determined by assessing where it will be most visible, most useful, or by some other criterion, such as avoiding damage to the surface behind it. Step 2: Hold the push pin correctly Hold the push pin between your thumb and index finger. Make sure to grip it by the larger, round, or flat part (the head) opposite the sharp pointy end (the pin) to avoid any injuries. Step 3: Position the push pin Place the sharp pointy end of the push pin on the chosen location on the surface. Ensure that the head of the push pin is facing outward, away from the surface. Step 4: Apply pressure Slowly and steadily apply pressure on the head of the push pin with your thumb, while keeping the pin perpendicular to the surface. This helps distribute the force evenly and make it easier to insert the push pin. Ensure that your other fingers are safely out of the way to prevent accidentally pricking yourself. Step 5: Monitor the penetration As you continue to apply pressure, the sharp end of the push pin should begin to penetrate the surface. Keep an eye on the progress, making sure the pin goes in straight and doesn't bend or break. Step 6: Stop pushing when secure Once the push pin has penetrated the surface enough to hold itself in place, stop applying pressure. The pin should now be secure and stable in its position, with the head protruding outward for easy manipulation in the future. Step 7: Use the push pin as needed Hang or attach the desired item, such as a note, photo, or piece of paper, onto the push pin by slipping it beneath the head. The push pin acts as an anchor, keeping the item securely in place on the surface. Keep in mind that push pins can be sharp and should always be handled with care, especially when small children are around."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize this article: A group of hackers affiliated with ISIS have reportedly posted a “kill list” together with the names and personal details of 36 policemen in Minnesota. The list, published by the “Caliphate Cyber Army” on Telegram includes full names, home addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers of all the men. The targets allegedly live in cities geographically distributed throughout Minnesota, with the highest concentration in and around the Twin Cities. The individual cards were shared on Telegram and discovered by Vocativ’s deep web analysts. This isn’t the first time a cyber group affiliated with the Islamic State has hacked personal details of American law enforcement and security officials. Last year, a similar attack by hackers penetrated the Twitter account of the United States Central Command. In November, a group called “Islamic State Cyber Army” posted names and addresses of people who have worked with American security agencies, although Vocativ found at least some of those details were previously posted online. One of the “cards” published by ISIS hackers ISIS has in the past released names and details of American servicemen at the end of execution videos it has broadcast, urging its followers to target the troops wherever they are able to. Last week the Caliphate Cyber Army posted a threat on its Telegram channel, warning that their next attacks would be financial in nature. “It will include banks, money transfer services, stocks and so on. Beware of us, economical war has just started,” the message said. It’s unclear how effective the cyber hackers are. Last month Vocativ found they had falsely boasted about hacking Google. Another group calling itself “the sons of the Caliphate army” has also threatened Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey in retaliation for efforts to suspend ISIS-affiliated social media accounts. According to a report by the Congress from last November, one in four of Americans who has attempted to join ISIS is from Minnesota, CBS news reported. The Cedar Riverside community in Minneapolis has the largest Somali population in the country. An alarming number of young Somali men from this neighborhood have left to join extremist groups. Since 2007, two dozen have joined al-Shabaab in Somalia. ||||| 36 Minnesota police officers on 'kill list' released by ISIS hackers News ISIS hackers release 'kill list' with names of Minnesota police officers A group of hackers affiliated with ISIS have released a “kill list” that contains the names and personal information of more than three dozen Minnesota law enforcement officials, a spokesperson for the FBI confirmed Tuesday to Fox 9. - A group of hackers affiliated with ISIS have released a “kill list” that contains the names and personal information of more than three dozen Minnesota law enforcement officials, a spokesperson for the FBI confirmed Tuesday to Fox 9. The list was published by the \\"Caliphate Cyber Army\\" and reportedly includes the full names, home addresses, email addresses and phone numbers of the officers, according to the news website Vocativ. The FBI said they are taking the list very seriously. \\"Clearly, in law enforcement we don’t want this information out there at all possible. As far as whether it’s chilling, it is something that is not wanted,\\" FBI spokesman Kyle Loven said. According to the FBI, the supposed law enforcement targets are spread out all across Minnesota and the Dakotas. St. Paul Police Department confirmed four of their officers are on the list and they are taking necessary precautions to protect them. Minneapolis Police Department along with Bloomington and Brooklyn Park said their officers names were not included on the list. ||||| An alleged ISIL \\"kill list\\" containing the personal information of dozens of Minnesota law enforcement officers is the focus of an investigation by state and federal agencies. The list, purportedly created by a group of hackers affiliated with the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, includes the names, addresses and telephone numbers of officers from across Minnesota. Authorities acknowledge that they are still gauging the seriousness of the threat posed by the group, which calls itself the Caliphate Cyber Army. The personal information of at least 36 law enforcement officers — apparently including a Sauk Rapids police officer, five St. Paul police officers and a St. Louis County sheriff's deputy — along with instructions to kill were recently posted on the encrypted messaging app Telegram, according to news reports and screenshots of the list obtained by the Star Tribune. The screenshots depict what appears to be an ISIL logo superimposed over a photo of masked fighters. Along with the personal information, the message says \\"Wanted to be killed.\\" \\"It is on our radar and we have been working with the various agencies which have been both named and unnamed,\\" FBI spokesman Kyle Loven said of the list. \\"We're proceeding forward with this matter and treating it as a serious threat.\\" Loven said that agents from the FBI's Minneapolis field office began working this week with several local agencies to track down the hackers. The FBI is \\"trying to make certain that law enforcement officers have the appropriate information\\" regarding the activities of the group, Loven said. The group has posted similar threats against security and law enforcement officials. The state Department of Public Safety said Tuesday that it was conducting its own investigations into the online posts, but referred further questions to the FBI. The list's existence was first reported on Monday by the website Vocativ. According to the Vocativ report, the full list was recently posted on Telegram, which the extremist group frequently uses for propaganda and crowdfunding money for arms. St. Paul police officials say that five of the officers identified have ties to the department — four are on active duty and one is retired. The department is working closely with the FBI to assess the threat from the group. \\"We're doing everything that we can to ensure the safety of the officers,\\" said department spokesman Steve Linders, adding that it's unclear whether any of them have been reassigned since the list was released. Seamus Hughes, deputy director of George Washington University's Program on Extremism, said the group, a \\"known commodity online,\\" has used similar \\"doxing tactics\\" to publish the home addresses of U.S. military personnel \\"with the implied and explicit calls for violence against them.\\" Hughes said the group also recently targeted New Jersey Transit police. The group of self-identifying ISIL supporters hasn't been publicly linked to any known failed or foiled extremist plots. Little else is known about the group's members, he said. Loven wouldn't comment on how many names appeared on the list and which law enforcement agencies were included. The Vocativ report suggested that most of the named officers were from the Twin Cities area. While some local authorities said that they were aggressively investigating the online postings given the seriousness of the threat, they cautioned against reading too much into the list, which some saw as propaganda intended to sow fear and confusion. Several officials pointed to other recent jihadi-linked threats against local targets, including one earlier this year when the extremist group Al-Shabab called for attacks on the Mall of America and other western malls, which never materialized. Minneapolis police spokesman John Elder said the department was aware of the list but declined to comment further since none of its officers appeared to have been targeted. The Hennepin County Sheriff's office declined to comment.

A study found that people decide where they stand based on a micro social hierarchy,established within seconds of entering the lift. Rebekah Rousi,a Ph.D.student in cognitive science,conducted all ethnographic study of elevator behaviour in two of the tallest office buildings in Adelaide,Australia. As part of her research,she took a total of 30 lift rides in the two buildings,and discovered there was an established order to where people tended to stand. In a blog for Ethnography Matters,she writes that more senior men seemed to direct themselves towards the back of the elevator cabins. She said,\\"In front of them were younger men,and in front of them were women of all ages.\\" She also noticed there was a difference in where people directed their gaze half way through the ride. Men watched the monitors,looked in the side mirrors(in one building)to see themselves,and in the door mirrors(of the other building)to also watch others. Women would watch the monitors and avoid eye contact with other users(unless in conversation)and the mirrors,she writes. The doctorate student concluded it could be that people who are shyer stand toward the front,where they can't see other passengers,whereas bolder people stand in the back,where they have a view of everyone else. Which of following best summarizes the main idea of the passage? A) Women are more attentive than men in the lift. B) Both women and men like to watch the monitors in the lift. C) The shyer you are,the more likely you are to stand at the back in the lift. D) Why where you stand in the lift reflects your social status. The answer is:","completion":"D) Why where you stand in the lift reflects your social status. The main idea of the passage revolves around the research conducted by Rebekah Rousi, a Ph.D. student in cognitive science, who studied elevator behavior in two of the tallest office buildings in Adelaide, Australia. Through her study of 30 lift rides, Rousi observed that people tend to establish a micro social hierarchy in the elevator based on factors such as age, gender, and position within the company. According to Rousi's findings, more senior men tend to stand at the back of the elevator, while younger men usually position themselves in the middle, and women of all ages stand at the front. This subconscious power struggle plays out within moments of passengers entering the lift. In addition to where people stand, Rousi also noticed that there was a difference in where men and women directed their gaze during the elevator ride. Men tended to watch the monitors, look in the side mirrors to see themselves, and in the door mirrors to observe others. On the other hand, women generally focused on the monitors and avoided eye contact with other passengers, unless they were engaged in conversation, and they also tended to avoid looking in the mirrors. Rousi's research suggests that one's social status, shyness, and possibly personality traits may influence where they stand in an elevator. Shyer individuals might choose to stand at the front, away from the gaze of others, while bolder individuals may prefer the back, where they have a view of everyone else. Therefore, the main idea of the passage is about understanding how a person's position in an elevator relates to their social status and the underlying dynamics that affect this behavior."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],q={key:0},R={key:1};function E(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",M,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",j,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
