The reason often given is that if eat you too much food at night, the body will store all those excess kilojoules as fat because we’re inactive until the next day. The reason sounds plausible, but if it was one hundred percent true then world hunger could be solved by just feeding people one meal at night time. What really matters is how much is eaten over days and weeks for weight gain or weight loss, not so much when it is eaten. There is merit though in advice to eat less at night time as it can help a person to cut back on the total quantity of food eaten. Eating lots of food in the evening can also be a marker for unhealthy dietary habits, especially if much of that extra food is going to fuel couch surfing exploits. So even though advice to eat less at night time seems logical, it hasn’t actually been well tested by science to see how effective it can be for losing weight. Filling this gap, a short-term study involving 29 healthy men looked at how 2 weeks of restricted night time eating fared against 2 weeks of ‘normal’ evening eating. Advice on restricting night eating was very clear: avoid any food or drink containing kilojoules between the hours of 7 pm and 6 am the next morning. No other changes to the participants’ diet or lifestyle was required so each person was free to eat whatever they wished during the day time hours until early evening. Twenty seven of the twenty nine people complied with following this advice for 2 weeks as well as the 2 week control period. Eating at night a waistline hazard So did people eat less when restricting night time eating? Yes, equal to 1000 kilojoules (about 250 Calories) per day less than during their normal eating pattern. This small energy difference was enough to see the men lose 0.4 kg over the 2 week restriction period, and gain 0.6 kg over the 2 week control period. After completing the study, how does the author feel about the results? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. They believe restricting eating at night did result in a small amount of weight lost B. not enough information C. They believe they have unhealthy dietary habits D.

Perhaps I have said enough on that subject. More specifically, if you are looking for a book based in historical facts, look somewhere else. Is this product review negative?","completion":"The product review provided is indeed negative in its essence. The reviewer expresses a critical opinion about both the people in Richmond, VA, as well as the book being reviewed. Let's analyze the review in more detail to understand the reasons behind the negative perception. 1. The reviewer starts by mentioning that people in Richmond, VA love the book, but this is immediately followed by a negative judgment about Richmond itself. The phrase \\"an open mind would be an endangered species there\\" is an implicit way of implying that people in the town are likely to be close-minded or lack intellectual curiosity, which may not be a fair generalization. The statement could potentially lead readers to assume that people from Richmond love the book due to their lack of open-mindedness, influencing the way they perceive the book. This sets a negative tone for the review, despite briefly stating that people in the town love it. 2. The reviewer then emphasizes that they have said enough on the subject of Richmond, demonstrating reluctance to discuss it further. This implies that the opinions shared about Richmond are strong and, to some extent, reinforces the negatively charged stereotype mentioned earlier. 3. Finally, the reviewer addresses the book in question and expresses dissatisfaction with its historical accuracy. The statement \\"if you are looking for a book based in historical facts, look somewhere else\\" is a clear indication that the reviewer doesn't believe the book provides accurate information. This assertion can be seen as the most significant critique of the product itself and will likely leave a lasting impression on potential buyers, who may then perceive the book as unreliable or not worth their time. Overall, the product review is negative because it casts doubt on the opinions of people who enjoy the book, insinuates that the book may not be accurate in its historical facts, and does not offer any redeeming qualities or points of praise. It dismisses the book's value in a notable way, which could deter potential readers from considering it as a viable option."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Determine the sentiment: After waking up at 3:30 in the morning and not being able to go to sleep, I decided that I may as well be entertained while I suffered from sleep deprivation. This movie was on HBO and I decided to watch it. What a mistake! Here is the plot (potential spoilers, if you even care) : a neurotic man with an addiction to candy (Josh Kornbluth) works as a temp for some ridiculous company. Suddenly, he is offered the chance to \\"go perm,\\" which seems to be the favorite catch-phrase of this movie. But with a secure job and a secure income within his grasp, Josh decides for whatever stupid reason that he doesn't want to do it. He hopelessly bungles several minor tasks and his laziness and lack of ambition fill me with contempt. His inability to send several \\"very important\\" letters within a given amount of time is supposed to be hilarious, but is merely stupid. Josh meets and deceives a lawyer woman and they wind up in bed together (obviously a fantasy of Josh's in real life, as such a thing would never happen). A bunch of other stuff happens, but it's too trite and inane to go into now. Despite the fact that this movie is billed as a comedy, I only laughed twice during it; the first time was the opening shot of Josh Kornbluth (my initial reaction was one of stifling fear) and the second was when he was in bed with the attractive woman (yeah, right). Josh Kornbluth is perhaps the most terrifying-looking person I have ever seen in my life. He is an unattractive, overweight, balding Jewish man who I am supposed to believe has sex with beautiful women. I do not at all sympathize with Josh's character. He is lazy and unmotivated and I just don't appreciate the failed attempts at humor. Skip it, even if your life depends upon it.","completion":"This review can be characterized as expressing a predominantly negative sentiment. Here are the steps I took to determine this: 1. Gloss the entire text: The first step in sentiment analysis is to look at the text as a whole and try to understand the general tone. 2. Identify emotional words or expressions: The reviewer uses phrases like 'What a mistake!', 'stupid reason', 'filled me with contempt', 'merely stupid', 'too trite and inane', and 'failed attempts at humor'. These phrases imply dissatisfaction or disapproval which represent negative emotions. 3. Analyze the emotion intensity: The use of extreme language, such as 'the most terrifying-looking person I have ever seen in my life', 'skip it, even if your life depends on it', indicate a high intensity of negative feelings. 4. Identify the sentiment target: The negative sentiment is not just about the character or actor, keywords like 'movie', 'plot' indicate the sentiment is about the movie itself. Hence, the negative sentiment from the review is not just about a specific actor or character in the movie, but extends to the script, plot and overall structure of the movie as well. The user expresses strong negative sentiments throughout the comment, indicating a sense of frustration, disappointment, and contempt."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Once all materials and tools are prepared and available, the following steps can be taken to construct the transponder: 1. Assemble the circuitry: First, follow the schematic plan to carefully connect all electronic components, such as the microprocessor, RF transmitter and receiver, and the resonator. Use a soldering iron to attach the connections securely and verify that no short circuits or undesired connections are present. 2. Attach the antenna: The antenna allows the transponder to effectively transmit and receive signals, making it a crucial component. Depending on the design specifications, the antenna may be directly soldered to the circuitry or mounted separately and connected via appropriate wiring. 3. Install the power source: Ensure that the battery or other chosen power source is securely integrated into the circuit and properly connected to provide power to the transponder's components. Check that the device is receiving power as expected before proceeding. 4. Test the transponder's functionality: Before assembling the device, it is essential to verify that the transponder is operating correctly. To do this, use a diagnostic tool or debugging software to test the signal transmission and reception, as well as any additional features specific to the transponder's intended function. 5. Enclose the transponder: Once all components have been verified to be functioning as expected, place the entire assembly into an appropriate casing. Ensure that the device remains securely enclosed while still allowing for any necessary user interaction, signal transmission, and reception. 6. Perform a final test: After securing the transponder within its casing, perform a final test to ensure that it is operating as desired and can communicate effectively with the relevant systems. By diligently following these steps and checking for proper functionality throughout the process, it is possible to quickly and efficiently build the transponder to replace the broken key. With the new transponder in hand, access and communication can be restored, allowing for a swift resolution to the circumstances created by the broken key."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What movie does the accountant watch?, using the article: A timid accountant in a Scottish Tweed weaving company cleverly bests the brash modern American efficiency expert whose ideas threaten his way of life. The film opens with Martin in Edinburgh buying whisky and cigarettes on the Royal Mile. We then see him at work as a head accountant in a very old-fashioned firm in the New Town. The Justerini & Brooks premises in George Street serves as their shop in the film. Martin is called to the death-bed of the owner, old MacPherson, at Moray Place. He is offered a whisky and declines. Old MacPherson drinks both and promptly dies. The new owner of the Tweed company, played by Robert Morley, is enamoured of a zealous American woman who is an efficiency expert and who wants to turn her hand to revolutionise the very traditional company. She insists on visiting \\"the factory\\" on the island, only to discover the task is done by old couples, on crofts where they spin the wool. She plans to replace the 700 weavers, dotted across the islands, with a single large factory. Whilst being driven through the city she even says the company should change to synthetic fibres, causing the chauffeur to drive into the back of a brewer's dray in the Grassmarket. Martin watches a Sherlock Holmes film at the cinema and is inspired to kill Mrs Barrows. As he is a non-smoker and a non-drinker, he decides he should mislead any future investigation by smoking and drinking at the scene of the planned crime. He buys a half-bottle of whisky and packet of Capstan cigarettes. In her flat though, after a series of botched attempts his conscience gets the better of him and he cannot kill her. He tries to remove all evidence when Mr MacPherson appears suddenly, and manages to avoid detection. Back in the office MacPherson interrogates Martin and finds his denial more plausible than Mrs Barrows's claims. She cannot take any more, accusing them all of being mad, and she leaves for good.

Lyon Gaultier is a paratrooper in the French Foreign Legion, stationed in Djibouti, North Africa. His brother, who is married to an American woman in Los Angeles, is burned alive during a drug deal gone wrong and suffers third-degree burns, dying shortly afterward. Lyon deserts his legion when he finds out they have been withholding letters from his brother's wife and ultimately refuse to let him see his dying brother. He steals a jeep and escapes through the desert, finding work on a tramp steamer headed for the U.S. Meanwhile, the Legion Commandant travels to Paris, arriving at the government Consulate, where he is told that Lyon's desertion is ranked at low importance with the LAPD, so the Commandant suggests sending two of his own men to bring Gaultier back, which is approved. Lyon arrives pennyless in New York City and is attracted to an illegal street fighting match that is being run by a New Yorker called Joshua, a man who runs fights for money. Gaultier steps forward to take part in the next fight and destroys his opponent, leaving Joshua looking astounded at what he just saw. Joshua takes Lyon to meet a person called Cynthia, also known as 'The Lady' who organizes underground fights for the rich elite and she decides to sponsor him.

The company said its testing method for 16 models was not in line with official regulations, but it insisted that new tests showed no need to amend the data. \\"Any wrongdoing, such as manipulation of fuel efficiency data, were not found,\\" Suzuki said. It comes after Mitsubishi's admission last month that it had falsified fuel economy data for its vehicles. Mitsubishi has said its president, Tetsuro Aikawa, will step down in the wake of the test-fixing scandal. Japan's transport ministry had ordered all of the country's car makers to present their compliance with government testing methods. Earlier in the day, media reports had suggested that Suzuki would reveal fuel testing problems and the company's shares fell 9% in response to that.

Instructions: In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words. Input: Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to HIV-1 can evolve after years of an iterative process of virus escape and antibody adaptation that HIV-1 vaccine design seeks to mimic. To enable this, properties that render HIV-1 envelopes (Env) capable of eliciting bnAb responses need to be defined. Here, we followed the evolution of the V2 apex directed bnAb lineage VRC26 in the HIV-1 subtype C superinfected donor CAP256 to investigate the phenotypic changes of the virus populations circulating before and during the early phases of bnAb induction. Longitudinal viruses that evolved from the VRC26-resistant primary infecting (PI) virus, the VRC26-sensitive superinfecting (SU) virus and ensuing PI-SU recombinants revealed substantial phenotypic changes in Env, with a switch in Env properties coinciding with early resistance to VRC26. Decreased sensitivity of SU-like viruses to VRC26 was linked with reduced infectivity, altered entry kinetics and lower sensitivity to neutralization after CD4 attachment. VRC26 maintained neutralization activity against cell-associated CAP256 virus, indicating that escape through the cell-cell transmission route is not a dominant escape pathway. Reduced fitness of the early escape variants and sustained sensitivity in cell-cell transmission are both features that limit virus replication, thereby impeding rapid escape. This supports a scenario where VRC26 allowed only partial viral escape for a prolonged period, possibly increasing the time window for bnAb maturation. Collectively, our data highlight the phenotypic plasticity of the HIV-1 Env in evading bnAb pressure and the need to consider phenotypic traits when selecting and designing Env immunogens. Combinations of Env variants with differential phenotypic patterns and bnAb sensitivity, as we describe here for CAP256, may maximize the potential for inducing bnAb responses by vaccination.

Keep in mind that using a VPN might slow down your internet connection. 2. Use a Proxy Server: A proxy server acts as an intermediary between you and the website you want to access, in this case, Kik. By routing your web traffic through the proxy server, you may be able to bypass your school's block on the Kik website. You can find a list of free proxy servers online, but the reliability and safety of these services may vary. 3. Use a Mobile Hotspot: If you have a smartphone with mobile data, you can create a Wi-Fi hotspot and connect your device (such as a laptop) to the hotspot. This will allow you to access the internet outside of your school's network, potentially enabling you to access Kik. Note that this will consume your mobile data and may incur additional charges, so be mindful of any data limitations on your plan. Detailed answer for Question 2: Unfortunately, Kik messenger does not have an official application for macOS or MacBook Pro. However, there are alternative ways to run the Kik app on a MacBook Pro using an Android emulator. Here's a step-by-step guide: 1. Download an Android emulator.

The narrator is much tanner than the man .. B). The narrator is olive skinned .. C). None of the above choices .. D). The narrator is very tan .. Q: Why may the narrator be self conscious next to the man ?","completion":"The narrator may be self-conscious next to the man due to various reasons, outlined below: 1. Contrast in skin color: From the description provided, it is apparent that there is a noticeable difference between the narrator's skin color and that of the man. The statement \\"I was as white as a ghost\\" suggests that the narrator is very pale, while the man has a healthy skin tone. This contrast may make the narrator feel self-conscious since they might be comparing themselves to the man and possibly feeling like they lack the same vibrancy and energy that the man's healthy color portrays. Therefore, none of the given options (A, B, or D) accurately describe the narrator's skin tone. 2. Differences in overall appearance: The mention of the man's hair reaching his neck suggests that he might have a distinct and possibly fashionable or trendy hairstyle. If the narrator perceives themselves as having a less attractive or plain hairstyle, they might feel self-conscious due to the visual disparity between them and the man. This dissimilarity in appearance can contribute to feelings of inadequacy and self-consciousness. 3. Perception of attractiveness: The healthy color of the man might be associated with attractiveness and vitality. In contrast, the narrator's self-description as \\"bloodless\\" and \\"colorless\\" implies they may consider themselves to be less attractive or less visually appealing. This belief could be an underlying cause of their self-consciousness while standing next to the man. 4. Social expectations and norms: In many cultures, having a tan or healthy skin color is considered desirable. The narrator, being very pale, might feel like they do not meet these societal standards and expectations, resulting in a sense of self-consciousness. It is also possible that they have faced teasing or negative comments about their skin tone in the past, which has left them more self-aware and anxious about their appearance. 5. Personal insecurities: The narrator's self-consciousness might not solely be due to the specific situation or the man's appearance. They could be generally insecure about their looks or have low self-esteem, causing them to feel self-conscious in various social situations. In conclusion, the narrator may feel self-conscious next to the man due to the contrast in skin color, differences in overall appearance, perceived attractiveness, social norms, and personal insecurities. These factors, combined with the comparison between the two, could result in the narrator feeling inadequate or uncomfortable in the situation."},{"prompt":"- known for is ammonite evolution - fields is paleontology -lrb- paleomalocology -rrb- - work institutions is museum für naturkunde , berlin - birth date is 1958 - nationality is german - birth place is sundern -lrb- westphalia -rrb- Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

You should already be familiar with the temperament and personality of the horse you are trying to train, and the horse should already be able to stand still on command. Horses differ drastically in their level of energy, attention and patience, just like people. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? It's simple to teach a horse how to bow Possible answers: a. Yes. b. It's impossible to say. c. No.","completion":"c. No. To teach a horse to bow, follow these steps: 1. Prepare the environment: Choose a flat and quiet area with good footing, away from distractions. This will help your horse focus on the training session. 2. Warm up your horse: Before starting any training session, it's crucial to warm up your horse. This will stimulate blood flow, improve flexibility, and prevent injuries. Walk and trot your horse in both directions for approximately 10 minutes. 3. Build trust: Start your session by spending quality time with your horse. Grooming, petting, and speaking calmly to your horse can help build trust and establish a positive bond. This will make your horse more receptive to your instructions. 4. Train with positive reinforcement: When attempting to teach your horse to bow, use positive reinforcement to reward good behavior. This will encourage your horse to cooperate. Food rewards, such as apples or carrots, are particularly effective as they provide a clear incentive for your horse to learn. 5. Teach the cue: Begin with a verbal cue or command, such as \\"bow\\" or \\"down.\\" Then, pair this with a physical gesture, like touching the horse's foreleg. Repeat the verbal cue and touch the horse in a consistent manner, so the horse learns the association between the cue and the action. 6. Apply gentle pressure: While giving the cue, apply gentle pressure with your hand on the horse's chest, encouraging the horse to lower its head and neck. Maintain this pressure until the horse bows. Be patient with this step and adjust accordingly to your horse's individual personality. 7. Reward correct behavior: As soon as your horse bows, reward the behavior with a treat and praise. This will help the horse make a strong connection between the bowing behavior and your cue. 8. Gradually increase the bow's depth: As your horse becomes more accustomed to bowing, gradually ask for a deeper bow by applying more pressure on the chest. Remember to be patient and consistent with your cues. 9. Practice regularly: Practicing the bow regularly, both in training sessions and during everyday interactions, will help reinforce the behavior and make it more natural for your horse. 10. Be patient and consistent: Teaching a horse to bow requires consistency and patience. Allow your horse to progress at its own pace while maintaining a positive and encouraging attitude. In summary, the statement \\"It's simple to teach a horse how to bow\\" does not follow the preceding text, as teaching a horse to bow requires patience, consistency, practice, and regular training sessions in a suitable environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

As I mentioned in my previous post on Sacré-Coeur, one of the other places I didn’t get a chance to see when I was in Paris last summer was the catacombs so I wanted to be sure to fit in a visit this time around. Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€.

Here is a news article: Hours after opening her eyes for the first time, doctors are performing “aggressive physical therapy” on U.S. Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and are nothing short of astounded by her progress. Doctors have her up in bed with her legs dangling over the side. “She is starting to become aware of her surroundings,” said Dr. Michael Lemole. “This is a major leap forward, this is a major milestone,” he said. Doctors hope that tomorrow she’ll be up in a chair. She can move both of her legs and both her arms, and is keeping her eyes open for 10-15 minutes at a time, doctors said. Her recovery is so miraculous that Lemole said it can’t all be chalked up to modern medical care. \\"Yes, miracles happen every day,” he said. Doctors like to attribute progress to science, he said, but “ we would be wise to acknowledge miracles.” ||||| FILE - In this Jan. 11, 2011 file photo, Dr. Peter Rhee, Trauma and Critical Care Emergency Surgery doctor at University Medical Center, describes in more detail the gunshot wound Rep. Gabrielle Giffords,... (Associated Press) FILE - In this Jan. 8, 2011 file photo, emergency personnel and Daniel Hernandez, an intern for U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, second right, move Giffords after she was shot in the head outside a shopping... (Associated Press) Few people who take a bullet to the brain _ just 10 percent _ survive such a devastating wound. Yet doctors say the critically injured congresswoman has been making steady progress each day since an attempted assassination Saturday. Giffords is moving both legs and both arms, has opened both eyes and is responding to friends and family, doctors said Thursday. They've helped her sit up and dangle her legs from the bed, and she is able to lift her legs on command. With her closest friends from Congress holding her hand Wednesday evening, Giffords opened her left eye and tried to focus on loved ones for the first time. \\"It was raw courage. It was raw strength. It was so beautiful and so moving,\\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. \\"She wanted us to know that she was with us a hundred percent and understood everything we were saying.\\" Giffords' neurosurgeon, Dr. Michael Lemole, called it \\"a major milestone,\\" and said the congresswoman was clearly responding to the gathering of friends and family. After five days of pushing for caution, Lemole acknowledged: \\"We're wise to acknowledge miracles.\\" The next milestone will be removing her breathing tube, and perhaps have her sit in a chair on Friday, said Dr. Peter Rhee, trauma chief at University Medical Center, who has treated soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. It's a far cry from Saturday when a shocked nation braced for the worst for the 40-year-old Arizona congresswoman. Several news outlets erroneously declared her dead soon after the shooting rampage that killed six. Stunned by the day's events, crowds held candlelight vigils outside the hospital and Giffords' Tucson office. After her surgery, Dr. Richard Carmona, the former surgeon general and family friend who looked at Giffords' brain scans, gave a bleak outlook. \\"With guarded optimism, I hope she will survive, but this is a very devastating wound,\\" he said. But as the days ticked by, doctors shared signs of improvement even as they cautioned about a long and uncertain path to recovery. There was a glimmer of hope early on: Giffords was able to squeeze a doctor's hand in the emergency room. By Sunday, her neurosurgeon Dr. Michael Lemole said he was \\"cautiously optimistic\\" about her survival. She could follow basic commands when they briefly eased up on her sedation. Giffords' condition was unchanged Monday, which doctors took as a good sign. There was no further brain swelling. She could raise two fingers of her left hand and even flashed a thumbs-up, doctors reported. The following day, doctors said Giffords was breathing on her own, but still connected to a respirator as a precaution. She was also moving both arms. Doctors gave their most confident prognosis yet: She will survive. Rhee said he was \\"101 percent\\" sure she'd pull through. \\"She has no right to look this good and she does,\\" Lemole said. As her sedation was scaled back, Giffords became more alert and moved on her own _ touching her wounds and fixing her hospital gown. She even scratched her nose, Lemole said. The encouraging news continued when Gillibrand and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., stood in the hospital room Wednesday, talking, joking and touching their friend. \\"She was rubbing our hands and gripping our hands so ... we knew she could hear and understand what we were saying and she moved her leg, and so we knew she was responding,\\" Gillibrand said. \\"And the more we joked about what we were going to do, she started to open her eyes.\\" Giffords' husband, Mark Kelly, realized the significance of the moment. \\"Gabby, open your eyes, open your eyes,\\" he said, according to Gillibrand. Said Schultz: \\"It felt like we were watching a miracle.\\" So how did Giffords survive the gunshot wound? The path of the bullet, quick and quality medical care, and a stroke of luck meant the difference between life and death, say her doctors and brain experts. Doctors think the bullet pierced the front of Giffords' head and exited the back, slicing the left side of the brain, which controls speech abilities and muscles on the right side of the body. Had the bullet damaged both sides of the brain or struck the brain stem, which connects to the spinal cord, the outcome would likely be worse _ extensive permanent damage, vegetative state or death. \\"So far, she's passed with flying colors of each stage\\" of her recovery, said neurologist Dr. Marc Nuwer of the University of California, Los Angeles, who is not involved in the congresswoman's treatment. Most gunshot victims are not that fortunate. Several years ago, a Tucson police officer was shot in the head during a chase. His heart was beating when he was rushed to University Medical Center, but doctors couldn't control the bleeding in the brain and he died, Rhee said. When Giffords arrived at the hospital, doctors first checked to make sure she didn't have any other injuries. They took a brain scan and wheeled her to the operating room in a swift 38 minutes. The same attack in the desert many miles away from a trauma center may have led to a different ending. \\"She's just lucky in so many ways,\\" said UCLA's Nuwer. \\"The breaks have been in her favor. That's not to say they'll continue to be in her favor.\\" It's too early to tell the extent of damage Giffords suffered, but experts say it's rare for people with gunshot wounds to the head to regain all of their abilities. Damage to the left side of the brain can result in memory loss, difficult reading and hand-eye coordination problems. Giffords' doctors have not been able to determine how well she can speak since she still has a breathing tube. \\"Her full-time job now for the next year is working on her recovery and rebuilding her life around her disability whatever it may be,\\" said Dr. Stephan Mayer, professor of clinical neurology at Columbia University Medical Center in New York, who has no role in Giffords' care. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"U.S. Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was critically injured after being shot in the head, is making miraculous progress in her recovery, according to her doctors.

Before bringing Supernatural to television, creator Eric Kripke had been developing the series for nearly ten years, having been fascinated with urban legends since he was a child.

The concept went through several phases before becoming the eventual product, shifting from the original idea of an anthology series to one of tabloid reporters driving around the country in a van \`\`fighting the demons in search of the truth''. Kripke wanted it to be a road trip series, feeling that it was the \`\`best vehicle to tell these stories because it's pure, stripped down and uniquely American... These stories exist in these small towns all across the country, and it just makes so much sense to drive in and out of these stories.'' Is it true that is the tv show supernatural based on a book?","completion":"No, the TV show Supernatural is not based on a book. The concept of the show was created and developed by Eric Kripke. As mentioned earlier, Kripke had been fascinated with urban legends since his childhood, and these legends served as a primary inspiration for the show. Although not based on a specific book, the series does draw from various sources, including folklore, mythology, religion, and popular culture. Throughout its 15-season run, Supernatural followed the lives of two brothers, Sam and Dean Winchester, as they embarked on a journey to hunt and eliminate various supernatural entities, such as demons, ghosts, and even deities. Starting as a monster-of-the-week format, the show eventually evolved into exploring more complex storylines and themes, focusing on the brothers' relationships with each other and other characters. In the process of creating this rich universe, the writers of Supernatural often took inspiration from other works, such as famous pieces of literature (e.g., Dante's Inferno) and real-life subjects like demonology, angelology, and magical artifacts. However, the series as a whole is an original creation and not a direct adaptation of a book or series of books. That said, due to the popularity of the show, several tie-in novels, comic books, and other supplementary materials have been published since the beginning of the series. These additional works expand on the show's mythos and characters and can provide fans with even more stories set in the Supernatural universe. But it is essential to note that these were created as a result of the show's success and not the other way around."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When the Entente Powers promised Romania Transylvania and Banat, large territories of eastern Hungary, in exchange for Romania's declaring war on the Central Powers, the Romanian government renounced its neutrality. On 27 August 1916, the Romanian Army launched an attack against Austria-Hungary, with limited Russian support. The Romanian offensive was initially successful, against the Austro-Hungarian troops in Transylvania, but a counterattack by the forces of the Central Powers drove them back. As a result of the Battle of Bucharest, the Central Powers occupied Bucharest on 6 December 1916. Fighting in Moldova continued in 1917, resulting in a costly stalemate for the Central Powers.

Dylan apparently knows who it is, and begs the invisible man not to kill him, as he \\"doesn't have it\\", but the invisible man persists as he's \\"getting worse\\" and he's \\"running out of time\\". Though he does not know how to make more, Dylan mentions that another scientist, Maggie Dalton (Laura Regan), knows the formula. Seemingly accepting this, the invisible man releases Dylan and tells him not to tell anyone he was here, to which he agrees. No sooner has he left, than Dylan attempts to call someone on his cell phone, but the invisible man, who only pretended to leave to see if Dylan would stay silent, smashes the phone on the ground, and slashes Dylan's neck with the broken circuit board, killing him.The police arrive at the laboratory to conduct an investigation, but the military supervisor of the laboratory, Colonel Gavin Bishop (William MacDonald), insists it is an internal military situation and the police have no jurisdiction over the crime, and refuses to relent even when one of the detectives, Frank Turner (Peter Facinelli), points out that they have no experience conducting a proper criminal investigation.Fearing another attack on the remaining scientists, the lab company owner, Dr. William Reisner (David McIlwraith), employs Turner and his partner, Detective Lisa Martinez (Sarah Deakins), to protect Maggie (despite the military forcing the police out of the investigation), but refuses to divulge any information to the detectives on the nature of the work they are doing, which includes refusing to tell them that an invisible killer is on the loose.Turner and Lisa, after gaining Maggie's reluctant cooperation,... A:","completion":"What is the motive behind the invisible man's attack on Dylan and his subsequent interest in Maggie Dalton, and how does this mysterious situation challenge the investigative abilities of detectives Frank Turner and Lisa Martinez?"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a title for this article: A US judge has cleared the way for a former Salvadoran colonel to face charges in Spain that he helped plan the 1989 slayings of six Jesuit priests during El Salvador’s civil war. The approval of extradition for Inocente Orlando Montano Morales marks a significant step in efforts to prosecute high-level Salvadoran military officials on charges of murdering the priests, most of whom were Spanish natives. Related: El Salvador ex-colonel fights extradition for notorious murder of Jesuit priests Montano has been the only one within reach of Spanish authorities because of legal issues in El Salvador where most of them still live. Federal magistrate judge Kimberly Swank ordered that US marshals take custody of Montano so he can be turned over to Spain, pending final approval by the State Department. The step is largely seen as a formality because lawyers for the diplomatic agency had already reviewed the case before turning it over to federal prosecutors. “In short, the government’s evidence shows (Montano) was a decision-maker and member of a group of officers who collectively ordered the unlawful killings of Jesuit priests,” Swank wrote. Montano, 73, has denied involvement in the killings. His lawyer also questioned a Spanish court’s findings on the nationalities of the five priests supposedly born in Spain and whether the “terrorist murder” counts against Montano align with similar charges in the US. Swank rejected those arguments, writing the defense was asking her to “disregard the Spanish magistrate’s interpretation and application of Spanish law ... This is no small request”. The judge also cited evidence that Montano provided information to the killers, including the location of a priest who was considered a primary target, then later threatened a witness’ wife to help conceal the crime. Montano served as the country’s vice-minister of public security and was part of an inner circle of powerful military officers. Patty Blum, a human rights lawyer who helped persuade Spanish authorities to take up the case, praised the judge for advancing a complex case with international implications. “It’s a significant finding about the role of these kinds of illegal acts committed conspiratorially by military regimes,” said Blum, a senior attorney for the nonprofit Center for Justice and Accountability. The unusual extradition fight began in 2011 when a Spanish judge issued an indictment charging Montano with the murder counts. Nineteen others were charged by Spain, with most still living in El Salvador. Blum said efforts to bring the others to Spain are essentially at a “stalemate” because of questions by Salvadoran authorities about international warrants, as well as El Salvador’s amnesty law for the war that ended in 1992. Court documents say that early on the morning of 16 November 1989, members of the Salvadoran military killed the six priests, their housekeeper and her daughter at a university in the country’s capital. The priests had been calling for discussions to end the fighting, with one of them serving as an intermediary between the government and a leftist group. The killings sparked international outrage and helped erode US support – which had included money, weapons and training – for the rightwing Salvadoran government. While two officers served short sentences in El Salvador, Montano and other high-level officials were never charged by authorities there in the priests’ killings. Montano arrived in the US in the early 2000s and worked for six years at a candy factory in a Boston suburb. He was arrested in 2011 and sentenced to nearly two years for immigration fraud and perjury. He served his time in a federal prison in North Carolina, which is why his extradition fight played out in the state. A lawyer who represented Montano during the extradition process did not immediately return a message seeking comment.","completion":"\\"Big Step to Justice: US Judge Says Former Colonel Can Face Trial in Spain for Bad Things He Did Long Ago\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: In the period between the two world wars, the Danish navy had low priority for the politicians, especially between 1929 and 1942 under Thorvald Stauning. During the first year of the German occupation , the navy assisted the occupying German forces with minesweeping, because of the political demand of keeping the infrastructure up and running. The tensions between the German soldiers and the Danish armed forces rose slowly and, on 29 August 1943, they managed to scuttle 32 of its larger ships, while Germany succeeded in seizing 14 of the larger and 50 of the smaller vessels. This was due to a secret order, given directly to the captains by word of mouth by commander of the navy, Vice Admiral A. H. Vedel \\"to try to flee to the nearest neutral or nazi-opposed port. If that was not possible, the ship should be scuttled at as deep a location as possible\\". The Germans later succeeded in raising and refitting 15 of the sunken ships. A number of vessels had been ordered to attempt to escape to Swedish waters, and 13 succeeded. The fleet flagship, Niels Juel, attempted to break out in the Battle of Isefjord but the crew was forced to beach and partly scuttle her. The score for the larger vessels was therefore: 32 vessels were sunk, 2 were in Greenland, 4 reached Sweden, 14 were captured by the Germans. As for the smaller vessels: 9 \\"patruljekuttere\\" reached Sweden, 50 others were captured by the Germans. By the autumn of 1944, these ships officially formed a Danish naval flotilla in exile. In September 1943, A. H. Vedel was fired by order of the prime minister Vilhelm Buhl because of his hostile actions towards the Germans. Question: How many years did Thorvald Stauning run the Danish navy? Answer:","completion":"Thorvald Stauning did not directly run the Danish navy; however, he was the Prime Minister of Denmark during the period between 1929 and 1942. This means he served as the Prime Minister for 13 years, during which the Danish navy had low priority in the political agenda."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This article: Scary Monsters and Super Creeps (1980) produced the number-one hit \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", featuring the textural work of guitar-synthesist Chuck Hammer and revisiting the character of Major Tom from \\"Space Oddity\\". The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club \\"Blitz\\"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While Scary Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Chuck Hammer, and Pete Townshend. As \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a three-month run on Broadway on 24 September, starring as John Merrick in The Elephant Man.Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, \\"Under Pressure\\". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number-one single. Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1982 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play Baal. Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track EP of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal. In March 1982, the month before Paul Schrader's film Cat People came out, Bowie's title song, \\"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\\", was released as a single, becoming a minor US hit and entering the UK Top 30.Bowie reached his peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with Let's Dance. Co-produced by Chic's Nile Rodgers, the album went platinum in both the UK and the US. Its three singles became Top 20 hits in both countries, where its title track reached number one. \\"Modern Love\\" and \\"China Girl\\" each made No. 2 in the UK, accompanied by a pair of \\"absorbing\\" promotional videos that biographer David Buckley said \\"activated key archetypes in the pop world.

Write some highlights for the following article: Jennifer Lawrence ‘blindsided’ Chris Martin by breaking up with him after an intense four-month romance, it has been revealed. Friends said today that Oscar-winner Lawrence, 24, split with Martin, 37, late last week, leaving the Coldplay frontman ‘really sad’. She made the decision to end the relationship before embarking on a six-week promotional tour around the world for her new movie Mockingjay, the latest episode in the Hunger Games series, prompting the announcement on Monday. Scroll down for video. Out again: Jennifer Lawrence looked downcast as she headed to dinner with her dad Gary on Monday night in LA - just hours after confirming she had split from Chris Martin. Her main man: Jennifer turns to father Gary Lawrence after splitting with boyfriend Chris Martin. The actress is believed to have been speaking openly about the problems in the relationship to friends while promoting Mockingjay in the US. One friend said: ‘Chris wanted to spend all his free time with Jen – there was a discrepancy between how they viewed their relationship, she’s so easy going and he’s quite intense.’ And she also told friends that the Coldplay frontman, 37, was so keen on their being together that he wanted to spend all his free time with her. But throughout the brief relationship, Martin remained close to his estranged wife Paltrow, with whom he has two children, daughter Apple, ten, and Moses, eight - another source of strain for the pair. He and Paltrow, 42, announced in March that they were 'consciously uncoupling' after ten years of marriage. The source told MailOnline: ‘Jennifer said Chris is an all or nothing kind of guy, so she chose nothing. She broke up with him late last week. ‘He was completely blindsided, he was really sad about it. ‘Jen is contractually obliged for the next six weeks to promote Mockingjay and she just couldn’t see how it was going to work. ‘. Starring role: Jennifer Lawrence plays heroine Katniss Everdeen in the Hunger Games franchise. She is about to embark on a six-week global promotional tour ahead of the release of Mockingjay. Not enough time: Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence told friends she could not devote enough time to smitten Chris Martin. The couple were first publicly linked in August, shortly after Jennifer split from her long-term boyfriend, British actor Nicholas Hoult, but are believed to have first struck up a romance as early as June. They quickly became a hot item and were spotted enjoying an intimate afternoon for two at the Wolffer Estate Vineyard just a few days before Jennifer’s birthday on August 15. A source told E! News at the time: 'They were there on a date. They were very low-key, nobody realised who they were. The setting was super-romantic.' The pair were seen sampling wines together, with the source adding: ‘They watched the sun go down together, then quietly left.' They then shared a string of quiet date nights at Martin's Malibu home and the romance seemed to move further into the spotlight on September 19, when Lawrence attended Coldplay's performance at the iHeartRadio music festival in Las Vegas. But throughout everything, Chris stayed close to his ex-wife Gwyneth. The ex-couple were even pictured enjoying an intimate sushi dinner in LA last week with Oscar winner Gwyneth tenderly stroking Chris's face as she left. The singer met up with Jennifer later that night. And another source claimed to MailOnline on Monday: 'Jen got tired of watching Chris play happy families with Gwyn and was annoyed that he was trying to keep her hidden away.' Still close: Gwyneth Paltrow reached out of her car to caress her ex-husband Chris Martin's face as they stopped for a chat on the side of the road following their family dinner in LA last week. Not herself: The usually bubbly actress failed to crack a smile as she headed out with her father in LA on Monday night. But a source close to Martin told US Weekly that their relationship had been ‘rocky’ due to their ‘insane’ schedules, adding: ‘They really like each other, but it’s just so complicated with so much going on.’ And while Lawrence is believed to have had a crush on Martin since she was a teenager, another source told US that the British singer was equally enamored and believed she was ‘the real deal’. Hours after the split was confirmed, a rather downcast looking Jen was seen going to dinner with her dad Gary in LA. A source confirmed to People magazine that it was indeed Jennifer who did the dumping, saying: ‘Jen is the one who broke it off with Chris.’ Mockingjay, the first part of the final two movies from the Hunger Games series, is released on November 21 by Lionsgate. Representatives for both Jennifer and Chris declined to comment. Caught out: Jennifer and Chris enjoyed a very secretive relationship, but she was pictured in Las Vegas after attending his iHeartRadio Music Festival performance in September. Happy man: Chris looked like a transformed man in the months that he was dating Jennifer, walking through Malibu in bare feet on one occasion. Highlights:","completion":"1.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of respiration if the lungs are not healthy and unable to expand properly. The main components of the respiration process are inhalation, gas exchange, and exhalation. If the lungs cannot expand fully, this will impact each stage of the process as detailed below: 1. Inhalation: When the lungs are unable to expand properly, the volume of air that can be drawn in during inhalation is limited. This can result in insufficient oxygen intake for the body's needs, potentially leading to shortness of breath, fatigue, and other symptoms. 2. Gas Exchange: In healthy lungs, oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses into the bloodstream through the alveoli (tiny air sacs in the lungs), while carbon dioxide in the blood diffuses into the alveoli and is subsequently exhaled. If the lungs cannot expand fully, the surface area for gas exchange may be reduced, leading to decreased efficiency in the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. This can cause a buildup of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream and reduced levels of oxygen, which can have negative effects on various bodily functions. 3. Exhalation: If the lungs are unable to expand adequately, the muscles responsible for exhalation may have to work harder to expel the air from the lungs to create space for fresh air. This can lead to increased breathing effort and an overall decline in respiratory efficiency. The direct effects of the perturbation would include reduced oxygen intake, impaired gas exchange, and increased breathing effort. Indirectly, these effects could lead to a range of health issues, including fatigue, dizziness, impaired cognitive function, decreased exercise tolerance, and even organ damage due to sustained low oxygen levels. In severe cases, respiratory failure could occur if the lungs are incapable of providing sufficient oxygen or removing carbon dioxide from the body. It is essential to address any underlying lung conditions or factors causing reduced lung expansion to maintain optimal respiratory function and overall health. Some common conditions that can cause lung problems include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, pneumonia, and lung cancer."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Both speakers seem to agree that they have come through a period of hardship or difficulty about ten years ago but believes that conditions or the situation has improved now. The phrase \\"they're shoddy\\" typically means \\"they are of poor quality\\", and without specific context as to what is being referred to as 'they', we can only infer that the speakers do not consider whatever they're discussing to be of poor quality at the present moment. Speaker A expresses a belief that things are better now relative to the past, while Speaker B corroborates this view by stating, \\"I think so. I don't think they're shoddy\\". In other words, both parties have not explicitly or even implicitly agreed that \\"they\\" (whatever they're referring to) are presently shoddy. Instead, the given dialogue suggests that both Speaker A and Speaker B believe the quality of \\"they\\" has improved and is not currently poor. However, it's worth noting that the conversation does not provide enough details to figure out what \\"they\\" refers to. It could be a reference to an economic situation, a product, a building or structures, an institution, or any countless number of entities or circumstances. Regardless, the speakers' comments and their shared agreement suggest that they believe things have improved and are not now \\"shoddy\\". It's always important to put these conversations into context as it could change the actual interpretation of the dialogue. But based on the dialogue solely it can be inferred that neither speaker A nor speaker B believes that “they” are “shoddy.” So, based solely on this dialogue the answer to the query \\" can we conclude that \\"they're shoddy\\"? would be, no, we cannot conclude that \\"they're shoddy\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: The most popular names in the west Every year in Englishspeaking countries,people list the most popular names. Here are some examples. In the United States at the moment the three most popular names for girls are Emily,Emma and Madison. For boys,they are Michael,Joshua and Mathew. In Britain a parent today might call their little girl Grace,Jessica or Ruby. If they have a little boy they could call him Jack,Thomas or Oliver. In China names have very clear meanings. If a girl is called Mei,her name means \\"beautiful\\". If a boy is called Wu,his name means \\"like a soldier\\". Names in Englishspeaking countries are like this too. The girl's name Joy is probably partly chosen because the parents wish their daughter to be joyful and bring joy to others. If a girl is called Ruby,it may be because of the beautiful red precious stone. Parents often pick names that can be shortened. This can be confusing for Chinese people. Parents might choose such names because they want to be able to speak to their kid in a personal way. For example,a popular name is William. But William can be shortened to Will,Willy,Bill and Billy. The same is true of the favourite old name for a girl,Elizabeth. Elizabeth can be shortened to Beth,Liza and Liz. Another reason why kids get the names they do is that parents want to name their boy or girl after someone who is famous,such as an actor,a pop music star or a sports star.

Here are the steps I would take to answer your question: Step 1: Define the criteria for evaluation. In order to compare different batsmen, we need to consider the following aspects: career statistics (such as batting average, runs scored, and centuries), consistency, adaptability to different conditions and formats, their overall impact on their team and the sport, and the level of competition they faced during their era. Step 2: Gather data about candidates. Collect the available statistics and related information about legendary batsmen in cricket history. This list may include Sir Don Bradman, Sachin Tendulkar, Sir Vivian Richards, Brian Lara, Ricky Ponting, Virat Kohli, and others. Step 3: Analyze the data and compare the candidates. Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each player based on the criteria defined in step 1. Look at how they performed against the best bowling attacks, their ability to dominate the opposition and influence the game result, and the longevity of their careers. Step 4: Consider opinions from cricket experts and former players. By factoring in expert opinion, we can better assess how these batsmen are perceived within the cricket community and how their performances stand the test of time. Step 5: Make a conclusion. After evaluating all the data, form a conclusion to answer the initial question. Based upon statistics, cricket experts' opinions, and impact on the game, Sir Don Bradman is often considered the best batsman of all time, with a test batting average of 99.94. However, this is subjective, and others might argue in favor of different batsmen based on their personal preferences or other criteria."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Find a friend to help you.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: The Ultimate Guide to Choosing and Dyeing Your Hair at Home Introduction: Dyeing your hair at home can be a fun, exciting way to change up your look without breaking the bank. With endless possibilities for colors and styles, there's no limit to the type of transformation you can achieve. However, to ensure the best results, it's important to plan and prepare properly. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of getting a haircut, considering your natural hair color, choosing the right dye, assembling a hair dyeing kit, and finding a friend to help you achieve your dream look. Step 1: Get a Haircut A fresh haircut is an essential first step before dyeing your hair. This will ensure your hair is in its best condition, allowing the color to look even and last longer. Consider getting a trim to eliminate split ends, or try a new hairstyle that will complement your desired hair color. Remember, a good stylist will also be able to offer advice on the right color and style for you. Step 2: Consider Your Natural Hair Color By taking into account your natural hair color, you can make smarter decisions when choosing a dye. Understanding your hair's undertones, whether they are warm or cool, will help you select colors that will enhance your natural features and work harmoniously with your complexion. If you are unsure of your hair's undertones, a good trick is to observe the veins in your wrist – if they appear more blue, you likely have cool undertones, while green veins signal warm undertones. Step 3: Choose a Color That Suits You Now that you know your natural hair color and undertones, it's time to select the perfect dye shade. Consider your skin tone, eye color, and personal style. If you're not comfortable going bold with a bright hue, you can opt for more natural or subtle shades. It's always a good idea to start with semi-permanent or temporary dyes to see if the color suits you before committing to a long-lasting change. Step 4: Assemble a Hair Dyeing Kit In order to dye your hair properly at home, you'll need to gather some essential tools. This includes: - Hair dye of your chosen color - Developer, if needed (check your hair dye instructions) - Gloves to protect your hands - A plastic mixing bowl and brush or applicator bottle - Petroleum jelly or barrier cream to protect your skin from staining - Hair clips to section off your hair - Old towels or a cape to protect your clothes and surroundings - Timer or clock to track processing time - Shampoo and conditioner to wash out the dye Having all these items ready will make the process smoother and help you avoid any potential mishaps. Step 5: Find a Friend to Help You Enlisting a friend to assist you with the dyeing process can make everything much easier and more fun. They can help you reach difficult areas, apply the dye evenly, and provide moral support. If possible, choose someone who has experience dyeing hair, as they can offer valuable advice and guidance throughout the process. Conclusion: By taking the time to prepare and follow the steps outlined in this guide, you can confidently dye your hair at home for a gorgeous, new look. Remember to always perform a strand and patch test before using any hair dye to ensure your safety and satisfaction. Happy dyeing!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Chris Cornell mixes classics, covers, new songs on solo tour Chris Cornell has worked on so many projects in his career — as a member of Soundgarden, Temple of the Dog, and Audioslave, as well as his own sonicially diverse solo albums — that he feels like there just isn’t enough time to do everything his fans might want to hear. “No matter what I do,” he says with a laugh of his current solo acoustic tour, “somebody’s leaving sort of pissed off.” Hopefully, that won’t be the case when the golden-throated rocker touches down on Wednesday for a sold-out show at the intimate Citi Shubert Theatre, in support of his ruminative new album, “Higher Truth.” On the phone from a Jersey City tour stop, Cornell says the album grew out of the “Songbook” tours he has been performing on and off for the last few years of Soundgarden’s hiatus, and in the breaks after its reformation in 2010. “It’s a form that I have really enjoyed,” he says of the stripped-down but lengthy performances, which touch on all facets of his catalog as well as covers of everyone from Bob Dylan to Prince. “It feels almost like live rehearsals to me. I can do anything that I want, and there’s an intimacy in the relationship that I can have with the audience that I otherwise would never be able to have. I wanted it to be a living, breathing thing, so rather than just being a look back, it has to be a look at now and even a look ahead. And that’s what motivated me to do [‘Higher Truth’], which is generally acoustic-based.” Q. With such a deep and varied catalog, how do you work out the set list? A. I do about half of the new album, give or take, and some other songs I’ve never done before catalog-wise. There’s still a group of songs that I continue to play mainly because people are yelling them out at me, so there’s Temple of the Dog and Audioslave and Soundgarden songs that I play. And I do have accompaniment on not quite half of the songs. Bryan Gibson plays cello and mandolin, and that’s kind of added a different wrinkle to it a little bit. I would always see stories about classic shows, and somebody like David Bowie that would show up and just play the whole new album. And I get that, but I have never been that guy. I love playing new material. The new album feels refreshing and every song I play from it is completely different from anything else in the set. It feels like what this is is growing and moving into the future because there’s new material. But I also feel like if I get halfway through the set and I’m not touching on some classics that people. . . really, it’s partly why they bought a seat — that just doesn’t seem right to me. Q. It must be interesting for you to go from the high-volume environment of Soundgarden to this quieter but still intense place onstage. A. There’s no competition with other instruments, and especially the sonically aggressive approach of those instruments. And I also think what happens that is really good is it kind of draws a line through all of the different bands and projects that I’ve done. When you strip down these songs to the bare essentials, you start to get the idea that they can exist in the same family and they did come from one guy. If there’s been a challenge to my career, it’s been that. I’ve been so eclectic in the context of one band, let alone three, and all of the different solo projects, in which I’ve been almost abusive of the fact that we came from the post-punk indie world where you can do anything you want, and I’ve been married to that idea. Q. It seems like since the reunion Soundgarden has come to a good place where you all see it as a going concern, but take time for your own pursuits like “Higher Truth.” A. Yeah. I think when we took the calendar out of the equation, we kind of solved all of our problems, really. I think it does work itself out and it keeps everybody wanting to do it. It’s been nothing but positive since we got back together in 2010. There hasn’t been one moment that didn’t feel good. We do it in our own time, and when everybody is ready to get in a room, so I think that’s the formula. Q. One of the covers you have been playing is Bob Dylan’s “The Times They Are A-Changin’,” and you have tinkered with it a bit, adding new lyrics. That’s a bold move. A. The idea just occurred to me one day. I was born mid-civil rights movement and mid-coffeehouse, topical folk-music scene, and where did all that hope go to? You always sort of get this badminton game of people saying it’s the artists and the songwriters and the poets and the authors and the screenwriters that are the ones that cry out for that kind of change or hope. On the other hand, if you do that, you just get murdered on the other side of that, with people who say “[Expletive] off, you’re a songwriter and a rock singer and nobody gives a [expletive] what you think.” To some degree I think that that does make some sense, particularly if you’re a musician that has had a certain degree of success. I’ve been very lucky being able to do what I do for a living. I always try to look at both sides. And occasionally I like to say, “Hi, I’ve thought about this and it kind of pissed me off.” Q. As you have been performing it, you must have thought, Bob Dylan is going to hear this and have an opinion about it. A. I recorded a version of it and sent it to him. And I never got a response back. Q. I’m guessing no news is good news in that case? A. Yeah, I feel like that’s a good thing.

Cornell enjoys the stripped-down, intimate performances and notes that when songs are broken down to their essentials, it becomes clear that they all come from one person, despite the diverse range of bands he has been a part of. Soundgarden has come to a good place as a band since reuniting in 2010, allowing its members to also pursue individual projects.

This led to the discovery the following month of the well-preserved skeleton of a new large theropod dinosaur. Only one other theropod specimen comprising more than a few bones had ever been found in Britain, and that discovery was more than a century ago. Indeed, no large theropod, reasonably complete, had previously been discovered in Lower Cretaceous rocks anywhere in the world. Our study so far suggests that the Surrey dinosaur was a typical large theropod in certain respects, resembling, for example Allosaurus. In several other respects, however, it differs sufficiently from all known dinosaurs to merit designation as the representative of a new species, genus and family.

As the organist, keyboardist and saxophonist for Canadian-American rock group the Band, he was a principal architect of the group's unique sound. Hudson has been called \\"the most brilliant organist in the rock world\\" by Keyboard magazine. As of 2018, Hudson and fellow musician Robbie Robertson are the last original members of The Band who are still alive. Under the strict supervision of Hawkins, the Hawks became an accomplished band. They split from Hawkins in 1963, recorded two singles and toured almost continually, playing in bars and clubs, usually billed as Levon and the Hawks. Hudson started work as a session musician in 1965, playing on John Hammond, Jr.'s So Many Roads along with Robertson (guitar) and Helm (drums). In August 1965, they were introduced to Bob Dylan by manager Albert Grossman's assistant, Mary Martin. In October, Dylan and the Hawks recorded the single \\"Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?\\", and in January 1966 they recorded material with Dylan for what would turn into the Blonde on Blonde album. Dylan recruited the band to accompany him on his controversial 1966 \\"electric\\" tour of the United States, Australia and Europe. (An album of Dylan's 1966 performance with his band, The \\"Royal Albert Hall\\" Concert, was finally released in 1998.) Subsequent to Bob Dylan's motorcycle accident in July 1966, the group settled in a pink house in West Saugerties, New York, near Woodstock. Dylan was a frequent visitor, and Hudson's recordings of their collaborations resulted in The Basement Tapes. By 1968, the group recorded its debut album, Music from Big Pink. The album was recorded in Los Angeles (at Capitol) and New York (at A&R Studio). Capitol originally announced that the group would be called the Crackers, but when Music From Big Pink was released they were officially named the Band. The album includes Hudson's organ showcase, \\"Chest Fever\\", a song that in the Band's live shows would be vastly expanded by a solo organ introduction, entitled \\"The Genetic Method\\", an improvisational work that would be played differently at each performance. An example can be heard on the live album Rock of Ages. Hudson is also adept at the accordion, which he played on some of the group's recordings, such as \\"Rockin Chair\\", from \\"The Band\\"; the traditional \\"Ain't No More Cane\\", from \\"The Basement Tapes\\"; Dylan's \\"When I Paint My Masterpiece\\"; and Bobby Charles's \\"Down South in New Orleans\\" during the Last Waltz. His saxophone solo work can be heard on such songs as \\"Tears of Rage\\" (from Big Pink) and \\"Unfaithful Servant\\" (from The Band). Hudson is credited with playing all of the brass and woodwinds on the studio version of \\"Ophelia\\", from the 1975 album Northern Lights - Southern Cross as well. This album, the first to be recorded in the Band's Shangri-La recording studio in Malibu, California, also saw Hudson adding synthesizers to his arsenal of instruments. Hudson provided innovative accompaniment. For example, the song \\"Up on Cripple Creek\\" features Hudson playing a clavinet through a wah-wah pedal to create a swampy sound reminiscent of a Jew's harp or the croak of a frog. This clavinet-wah wah pedal configuration was later adopted by many funk musicians. After years of continuous touring, the Band made its final bow as a touring band with a lavish final concert on Thanksgiving Day 1976 at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, an all-star tribute concert documented in The Last Waltz.","completion":"This text is about Eric Garth Hudson, a Canadian multi-instrumentalist who is best known as the organist, keyboardist, and saxophonist for the Canadian-American rock group the Band.

Paragraph: Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.

In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements: Paragraph: Planet Neptune is not only very cold but also farther from the Sun than the Earth. In fact, it is the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. On the other hand, the Earth enjoys a close proximity to the Sun. Only Mercury and Venus are closer to the Sun than the Earth.

Perry will have none of it and tells Lois to let it go, then urges Clark Kent to be careful on his foreign correspondent assignment--and to try to remember to write the occasional story. Clark bids Lois and Jimmy Olsen goodbye.Later, at his Fortress of Solitude, Superman agonizes over the fact that even with all his amazing powers he cannot come up with a cure for cancer, lamenting that he wants to be more than Earth's resident strongman. Lois asks Superman why he insists on bringing her to the Fortress so they can be alone, and then accuses him of hiding his greatest secret from her--his true identity, which she claims she all but knows for certain already. Superman claims that he's doing so to keep her protected, but she insists he's doing it because he's afraid to commit.Elsewhere, outside of Metropolis, scientists working for Luthor uncover an alien spaceship. They accidentally open the ship, releasing a monster who kills them all and begins a destructive and murderous rampage towards the city.

The Giants and Bucs were confronted with winds greater than 40&#160;mph at the Meadowlands, but the Giants' defense dominated early and often. The Giants were able to hold the Bucs to six three and outs in their first seven possessions. On offense, Eli Manning and Tiki Barber were effective if not spectacular. Near the end of the first quarter, the Giants started a 54-yard drive, culminating on a seven-yard touchdown pass from Manning to Plaxico Burress. Midway through the second quarter, the defense struck again as Cadillac Williams fumbled a pitch and tackle Fred Robbins recovered for New York at the Bucs' 28. The Giants then used a deep pass to Burress and hard-nosed running to extend their lead to 14-0. The touchdown was scored on a one yard plunge by Brandon Jacobs. Tampa Bay had chances to get back into the game over the next 20 minutes, but several dropped passes and questionable fourth down plays doomed them. Overall, rookie quarterback Bruce Gradkowski played well for Tampa Bay, but it wasn't enough. The Giants clinched the win late in the fourth quarter with some power running from Jacobs and Barber.

Please answer the following question: Q: All matter in the universe is composed of one or more unique pure substances called what? Choices: - atoms - molecules - compounds - elements A: Answer:","completion":"A: The correct answer to the question is \\"elements.\\" All matter in the universe is composed of one or more unique pure substances called elements. Elements are the fundamental building blocks of everything around us. They cannot be broken down into more straightforward substances by any ordinary chemical means, making them distinct from compounds and molecules. There are currently 118 known elements, out of which 94 occur naturally on Earth. The remaining 24 are synthetic, created in laboratories through various processes. The elements are organized in the periodic table, a systematic arrangement that categorizes them based on their atomic number, which is the number of protons an element possesses in its nucleus. Elements also consist of electrons and neutrons, which are found in their respective atomic shells. The concept of elements dates back to ancient times when philosophers proposed the idea of basic substances that constituted all matter. However, it was not until the late 18th and early 19th centuries when Antoine Lavoisier, a French chemist, began systematically studying and organizing the elements that were known at the time. His work paved the way for the modern periodic table, which has since evolved as new elements have been discovered or created. Elements can be found either in their pure form or combined with other elements to form compounds and mixtures. For example, water is a compound made of two hydrogen elements and one oxygen element (H₂O). When elements bond together through chemical reactions, they result in the formation of molecules. Molecules can be composed of one or more elements, such as molecular oxygen (O₂) or a more complex carbon-based molecule like glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆). In summary, elements are the unique pure substances that make up all matter in the universe. They are distinct from atoms, molecules, and compounds, which are all derived from interactions between elements. Organized in the periodic table based on their atomic number, elements play a crucial role in our understanding of the composition and properties of all materials in the universe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

They help the animals get food for energy, make sure their young survive, or ensure that they, themselves, survive. Behaviors that help animals or their young survive, increase the animals’ fitness. Animals with higher fitness have a better chance of passing their genes on to the next generation. If genes control behaviors that increase fitness, the behaviors become more common in the species. This occurs through the process of evolution by natural selection. and the situation: David is a biologist. He was in the African savanna to study different species.

There is no official definition of its area but its characteristics are understood to include a high density built environment, high land values, an elevated daytime population and a concentration of regionally, nationally and internationally significant organisations and facilities. Over time a number of definitions have been used to define the scope of central London for statistics, urban planning and local government. - London Wall was the defensive wall first built by the Romans around Londinium, their strategically important port town on the River Thames in what is now London, England, and subsequently maintained until the 18th century. - Whitechapel is a district in the East End of London, England, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. - The City of London is a city and county within London. It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders. The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the City of Westminster). - Norton Folgate is a short length of street in London, connecting Bishopsgate with Shoreditch High Street, on the northern edge of the City of London. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages. - The mitre (Greek: , \\"headband\\" or \\"turban\\"), also spelled miter (see spelling differences), is a type of headgear now known as the traditional, ceremonial head-dress of bishops and certain abbots in traditional Christianity. Mitres are worn in the Orthodox Church, Roman Catholic Church, as well as in the Anglican Communion, some Lutheran churches, and also bishops and certain other clergy in the Eastern Catholic Churches and the Oriental Orthodox Churches. The Metropolitan of the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church also wears a mitre during important ceremonies such as the Episcopal Consecration. - The London Assembly is an elected body, part of the Greater London Authority, that scrutinises the activities of the Mayor of London and has the power, with a two-thirds majority, to amend the Mayor's annual budget and to reject the Mayor's draft statutory strategies. The assembly was established in 2000 and meets at City Hall on the South Bank of the River Thames, close to Tower Bridge. The assembly is also able to investigate other issues of importance to Londoners (transport, environmental matters, etc.), publish its findings and recommendations, and make proposals to the Mayor. - Kent is a county in South East England and one of the home counties. It borders Greater London to the north west, Surrey to the west, East Sussex to the south west, and Essex across the Thames Estuary to the north. The county town is Maidstone. - Camomile Street is a short street in the City of London, the financial and historic centre of London. - The Shard, also referred to as the Shard of Glass, Shard London Bridge and formerly London Bridge Tower, is a 95-storey skyscraper in Southwark, London, that forms part of the London Bridge Quarter development. Standing high, the Shard is the tallest building in the United Kingdom, the fourth-tallest building in Europe and the 105th-tallest building in the world. It is also the second-tallest free-standing structure in the United Kingdom, after the concrete tower at the Emley Moor transmitting station. - Houndsditch is a one-way street in London linking Outwich Street in the north-west to St. Botolph Street in the south-east. It runs through parts of the Portsoken and Bishopsgate Without wards of the City of London, the historic nucleus and modern financial centre of London. It marks the route of an old ditch that ran outside a part of the London Wall, renowned for being used as a site for disposing of waste and, particularly, deceased dogs. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Westminster is an area of central London within the City of Westminster, part of the West End, on the north bank of the River Thames. Westminster's concentration of visitor attractions and historic landmarks, one of the highest in London, includes the Palace of Westminster, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and Westminster Cathedral. - Londinium was a settlement established on the current site of the City of London around 43. Its bridge over the River Thames turned the city into a road nexus and major port, serving as a major commercial centre in Roman Britain until its abandonment during the 5th century. - A dual carriageway (North American English: divided highway) is a class of highway with carriageways for traffic travelling in opposite directions separated by a central reservation (North American English: median). Roads with two or more carriageways which are designed to higher standards with controlled access are generally classed as motorways, freeways, etc., rather than dual carriageways. - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments. - The Eastern Catholic Churches, also called the Oriental Catholic Churches and historically known as the Eastern-rite Catholic Churches or Uniate Churches, are 23 Eastern Christian particular churches \\"sui iuris\\" in full communion with the Pope in Rome. With about 18 million members, they make up a small part (about 1.5 percent) of the Catholic Church together with the Latin Church (Western Church). - Shoreditch High Street is the old main street of Shoreditch, London. It is part of the A10 road and connects Norton Folgate to the south with Kingsland Road to the north. It constitutes a segment of the Roman Ermine Street, which ran directly north from London to Lincoln and York. The parish church of St Leonard's, Shoreditch is situated at the north-east end of the road at the crossroads where it meets with Hackney Road. This part of the road is wholly within the London Borough of Hackney; below Boundary Street, the eastern side lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. The high street enters the City of London at Norton Folgate. - A borough is an administrative division in various English-speaking countries.

Write the next sentence in this paragraph: How to apply a horse tail bandage Use only tools and products that are meant for your horse's tail. Don't use products meant for humans, like human hair brushes. Use a wide-toothed horse comb to comb out your horse's tail and gently remove debris and knots.","completion":"Once the tail is free of debris and knots, begin by dampening it slightly with water, ensuring an even distribution without soaking it excessively; this will make the application of the tail bandage easier and reduce the chances of breakage. Next, gather your horse's tail and carefully position it toward the side that's most comfortable for your horse, ensuring that the tailbone is in proper alignment and free from any twisting. At this point, delicately wrap the tail with a soft, padded tail wrap or a protective tail guard, starting from the base and working your way down. It is crucial to apply even pressure throughout the wrapping process, to assure proper blood flow and prevent any constriction, while maintaining a snug and secure fit. As you wrap the tail, pause every few inches to double-check your work, ensuring smoothness and precision in your methodology. It is also advisable to use a specially designed horse tape or tail bandage, which is designed with elasticity and breathability in mind, keeping the horse's tail protected without causing undue stress. Upon reaching the bottom of the tailbone (usually a few inches above the bottom), you may secure the tail wrap or guard in place using a suitable fastening method, such as Velcro, clips, or ties, ensuring that it's not too tight or too loose, which could lead to slippage or discomfort. Make sure to leave enough room under the fastening point so that your horse can swish its tail naturally to ward off insects and express emotions. Monitor your horse's tail regularly, checking for any signs of irritation, discomfort, or swelling, and adjust the bandage accordingly. Generally, it's wise to remove and reapply the tail bandage every day or two to inspect the tail thoroughly and gently comb out any tangles that may have formed. This process also gives you the opportunity to clean and air out the tail bandage or guard, ensuring a hygienic, well-fitting, and comfortable solution for your horse. In conclusion, applying a horse tail bandage requires attentiveness, precision, and care, as well as the use of appropriate tools and products to guarantee your horse's comfort and well-being. By following these steps and maintaining consistent vigilance, you can ensure that your horse's tail remains in excellent condition, safeguarded and supported by a properly applied tail bandage."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which person studied more about the ways female fish release very high numbers of eggs? Answer:","completion":"Tim is the person who studied more about the ways female fish release very high numbers of eggs, as his focus was on fish reproduction. Tim's study of fish reproduction would have encompassed various aspects related to the reproductive biology and behavior of fish, allowing him to gain a profound understanding of the mechanisms and factors that influence fish reproduction. One of the major aspects undoubtedly studied by Tim would be fish spawning, which refers to the process of releasing eggs, sperm, or both by adult fish in order to reproduce and fertilize the eggs. Female fish have diverse reproductive strategies for releasing eggs, with many species being notable for producing high numbers of eggs. There are two main spawning strategies commonly found in fish: broadcast spawning and demersal spawning. In broadcast spawning, females release their eggs into the water column, allowing them to be carried by currents and dispersed over a wider area. This strategy often results in the production of a large number of eggs, increasing the chances of survival for the offspring. In contrast, demersal spawning involves releasing eggs onto a substrate or nesting site, where they become attached and fertilized. Although demersal spawners may produce fewer eggs per individual, the eggs often have higher survival rates due to more parental care and protection from predators. Throughout his studies, Tim would have also learned about factors that can affect the number of eggs produced by female fish, such as their age, size, and environmental conditions. He would also have explored the significance of fecundity (the number of eggs produced) in relation to population dynamics and fishery management, as well as the mechanisms by which fish synchronize their reproductive behaviors to optimize the success of reproduction. Tim's college coursework on fish reproduction would have provided him with a comprehensive understanding of various aspects of the reproductive biology of fish, particularly the ways in which female fish release high numbers of eggs. On the other hand, Dan studied plant reproduction, which would have provided him with detailed knowledge regarding the reproductive processes, strategies, and mechanisms involved in the sexual and asexual reproduction of plants. While Dan's coursework may have covered a wide array of topics, such as pollination, fertilization, seed development, and vegetative propagation, his studies would have been focused on the reproductive systems and processes specifically related to plants. Consequently, Dan's education would not have encompassed the same depth or level of detail regarding fish reproduction, and as such, he would not be as knowledgeable about the ways female fish release high numbers of eggs compared to Tim, who specialized in fish reproduction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lester Burnham, a despondent middle-aged advertising executive, becomes infatuated with his daughter's best friend, Angela. Ricky Fitts, the enigmatic teenage neighbor, documents everything he sees with his video camera, including the mysterious happenings in the Burnham household. Col. Fitts, a retired and strict Marine Colonel, starts to notice his son's unusual behavior and growing friendship with Lester. As Ricky and Lester's bond deepens, an unexpected connection develops between them. They discover a shared disillusionment with their mundane suburban lives. Act II: One day, Col. Fitts comes across one of Ricky's videotapes, which contains intimate footage of Lester working out in his garage. The Colonel becomes increasingly suspicious of their relationship, and his paranoia intensifies. He starts investigating Lester's life, believing that his son Ricky is having an affair with him. As the story unfolds, Lester and Ricky's friendship becomes a catalyst for change in both families. Carolyn, Lester's wife, becomes aware of her husband's downward spiral and starts a secret affair with a local real estate rival, Buddy Kane.

Ricky, indignant at his father's accusations, decides to reveal a part of his father's life that no one, not even Col. Fitts himself, would have ever imagined—the Colonel's suppressed homosexuality. Ricky seizes the moment to confront his father, telling Col. Fitts that it's not him having an affair with Lester, but instead, it's the colonel who is projecting his repressed desires onto him. This shocking revelation for Col. Fitts forces him to face the truth about himself, challenging the very foundations of his identity. Act IV: The film reaches its climax as Col. Fitts contemplates what to do with the information revealed by Ricky. Instead of accepting it, he decides to put an end to the perceived threat to his life and his relationship with his son.

The film concludes with a narration by Ricky about the strength of the human spirit and the importance of embracing the truth, no matter how challenging it may be.

Options: - rise early - water plants - raise crops - plant - can produce Explain why a human would choose \\"water plants\\" to answer the question above:","completion":"A human would choose \\"water plants\\" as the correct answer to the question because when there is no precipitation, the primary concern for a farmer is to ensure that their crops receive adequate water in order to grow and thrive. Precipitation is a natural source of water for agricultural lands and plants. When there is an absence of precipitation, such as during a dry spell or in a region experiencing drought, the responsibility falls on the farmer to find alternate means of providing water to their crops. The other provided options do not specifically address the issue in the context of the given question: 1. Rising early: Although farmers may rise early to tend to their daily duties, this action alone does not address the lack of precipitation. Waking up early could potentially help them monitor and manage their irrigation system, but the act of rising early itself is not a direct solution to the identified problem. 2. Raising crops: This option refers to the general practice of cultivating and growing crops. While it is the primary goal of the farmer, it does not specifically address the concern of the lack of precipitation, nor does it mention how a farmer could overcome this challenge. 3. Planting: Planting refers to the act of putting seeds or plants into the ground to grow. Although it is a crucial part of a farmer's role, it is not a direct solution for ensuring adequate water supply to crops when there is no precipitation. 4. Can produce: It is unclear what this option refers to in the given context. It could imply that the farmer can still produce crops despite the lack of precipitation. However, this option does not provide a practical solution for the farmer in the absence of rainfall. Ultimately, the best answer would be \\"water plants,\\" as it specifically addresses the challenge posed by a lack of precipitation and highlights the importance of a farmer providing artificial irrigation to support the growth and health of their crops during dry periods. An effective irrigation system, coupled with appropriate water management strategies, will help farmers ensure that their crops receive the necessary moisture, despite the absence of natural rainfall, to grow into healthy and productive plants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A famous young celebrity found herself at the center of an unsolicited and distasteful act. [Step 2: Contextualize the pervy pap incident and show its implications.] In what can only be described as a disgraceful invasion of privacy, a paparazzo went beyond the limits of ethical journalism in pursuit of a controversial photograph. This incident sheds light on profound issues that famous personality and public figures often face on a daily basis: the struggle to maintain personal boundaries and respect during the constant spotlight. [Step 3: Breakdown the incident and explain the details the pervy pap encounter.] The young celebrity, who we will refer to as Paris, was attending a high-profile event, swarming with paparazzi eager to capture the perfect picture. As she walked down the street with her entourage, one bold and unscrupulous photographer chose to cross the line of decency and professionalism. The paparazzo crouched down and attempted to snap a scandalous up-skirt photograph, violating Paris' privacy and undermining her dignity in public. [Step 4: Describe the immediate aftermath and the shock Paris and onlookers experienced.] Witnesses at the scene described Paris' visible shock and discomfort, as she realized what had happened. Onlookers immediately intervened, stepping in to shield Paris and block the paparazzo's view. Swathed in strong support from her entourage and the public, Paris was able to exit the scene safely and regain her composure. [Step 5: Discuss the implications of such incidents on celebrity culture and the need for change.] This appalling incident raises questions about the boundaries between public life and personal privacy for celebrities. The actions of the overzealous paparazzo not only infringed upon Paris' personal space but also exposed a deeper issue within the world of celebrity culture. The constant battle for sensational photographs and headlines often leads to unacceptable invasions of privacy and can negatively impact the mental health and well-being of public figures. It's time for a change in the industry. Speaking out against such transgressions and holding individuals accountable for their actions will be essential in promoting a safer and more respectful environment for celebrities and public figures alike. Together, we can work to prevent incidents like the one involving Paris from repeating themselves and become an example of a boundary-respecting society."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Using metal spoons: When you put a metal spoon into your hot coffee, the spoon gets warm because it's taking away a little bit of heat from the coffee. But a spoon is very small compared to the amount of coffee, so it can't take away too much heat.

What might be the first step of the process?","completion":"The first step in the process of a bird's life cycle begins with the formation of an egg. This step involves a series of intricate biological processes that lay the foundation for the genesis of a new life. To understand this initial stage better, let's dive deeper into the various sub-steps and aspects involved in the formation of a bird's egg. 1. Hormonal stimulation: The bird's reproductive system is activated due to hormonal changes triggered by external factors such as daylight, weather, or food availability. The hormones involved include gonadotropins, produced by the pituitary gland, and sex hormones like estrogen and progesterone, secreted by the reproductive organs (ovaries in females and testes in males). 2. Follicle development: As a result of hormonal stimulation, the ovarian follicles found within the female bird's ovaries begin to mature. Each follicle contains a germ cell, which will eventually develop into an ovum (egg cell). 3. Ovum development: The germ cells within the follicles develop into ova, triggered by the released hormones. Once an ovum is fully matured, it detaches itself from the follicle wall. This ovum carries half of the genetic material required to make a complete individual. 4. Yolk formation: Simultaneously, nutrients such as proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and vitamins are accumulated within the ovum. This will form the yolk, which serves as the main source of nourishment for the embryo once fertilization occurs. 5. Ovulation: Upon full maturation, ovulation follows, where the ovum is released from the ovary into the oviduct (a series of tubes connecting to the uterus). Ovulation in birds typically occurs 2-4 hours before the process of laying an egg begins. 6. Fertilization: If a female bird has mated, sperm from the male bird travels up the oviduct to fertilize the ovum, combining the genetic material of both parents to create a new individual. The fertilized ovum then transforms into a zygote. 7. Albumen Secretion: As the zygote moves down the oviduct, layers of a protein-rich fluid called albumen are deposited around it. The albumen serves as a shock-absorber and a water source, protecting the embryo during incubation. 8. Shell membrane formation: Next, the shell membranes are formed around the albumen. These membranes are crucial for holding the contents of the egg intact while facilitating gas exchange between the developing embryo and its environment. 9. Shell Formation: The final sub-step involves the calcification of the eggshell in the uterus, utilizing calcium stored in the bird's body. The hard yet porous shell protects the egg contents while still permitting air and moisture exchange. 10. Egg-laying: The fully formed egg is then laid by the female bird and incubation begins, either by the mother or both parents, depending on the bird species. Incubation is vital for maintaining the proper temperature and humidity required for the embryo's growth and development. In conclusion, the first step in the process of a bird's life cycle is the formation of an egg, which involves a series of intricate biological events initiated by hormonal stimulation and culminating in the laying of a fully-formed egg, ready for incubation and hatching into a baby bird."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: The Little Prince was written by a French pilot and writer Antoine de Saint--Exupery.

North Korea requested the meeting between Kim and Moon after U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday canceled the Singapore summit. Trump said his decision was based on the “tremendous anger and open hostility displayed” by North Korea officials recently over U.S. demands that Pyongyang follow the Libya denuclearization model. North Korea sees that model for rapid and complete denuclearization as a threat to the Kim government’s security, since Libyan leader Moammar Ghadafi was later overthrown and killed by his own people, with support from a multinational military coalition that included the U.S. Pyongyang has called for a more incremental process that links concessions to partial nuclear reductions and postpones complete denuclearization until the North’s security demands are met.

Gina's sister, Sara watches from a nearby window. Leatherface hears Sara outside, and after she flees, he briefly checks outside before going back to work. Some time later, Michelle and her boyfriend Ryan, a couple that constantly argues, both traveling through Texas, pass through a security checkpoint near the excavation of a large number of butchered bodies, a cop approaches them and interrogates them, shortly after they leave and reach the Last Chance Gas Station. At the station, they meet a hitchhiking cowboy named Tex and the station's perverted owner Alfredo. Tex shows Ryan a route on the map that can get them to a town. A fight soon breaks out between Tex and Alfredo when Tex finds the latter spying on Michelle while she uses the station restroom. As Michelle and Ryan flee from the station in their car, they witness Alfredo apparently killing Tex with a shotgun. As night falls, Ryan and Michelle, having taken the route Tex recommended, become lost. As they begin to bicker, a large truck appears and the driver attacks them.

Since Erin owned an acoustic guitar while Victoria owned an electric one, Available options: 1). Erin played quieter songs without an amp.. 2). Victoria played quieter songs without an amp..","completion":"Since Erin owned an acoustic guitar while Victoria owned an electric one, the two friends often found themselves exploring contrasting styles of music based on the unique characteristics of their respective instruments. 1) Erin played quieter songs without an amp. This enabled her to fully embrace the natural richness and resonance of her acoustic guitar, which relied solely on the innate acoustics of the wooden body to amplify the sound. Erin gravitated towards more folk and indie music, giving her a chance to immerse herself in the pure, organic tones of her guitar. Practicing her fingerpicking technique, Erin mastered the art of creating an intimate musical experience, where the listener could easily delve into the emotion and nuance behind each song. The choice of playing without an amp further deepened the connection she established with her music, as Erin realized that the subtle complexities of the acoustic guitar could shine through even better in the absence of external amplification. Moreover, playing quieter songs on her acoustic guitar facilitated an atmosphere of introspection and thoughtfulness, inspiring Erin to experiment with songwriting as well. Within the undisturbed tranquility of her musical sanctuary, Erin began creating her own compositions, weaving together intricate narratives drawn from her personal experiences and emotions. As her songwriting naturally complemented her guitar-playing style, Erin soon became known amongst her friends and family as a remarkably talented, authentic, and poignant musician. 2) On the other hand, Victoria played quieter songs without an amp, too. Even though electric guitars are renowned for their ability to deliver stunningly loud and crunchy sounds when plugged into an amplifier, Victoria discovered the unique versatility of playing her electric guitar without an amp. Stripping away the distortion effects and volume, she found a serene beauty in the muted tones and gentle resonance of the guitar's solid body, which emanated a different vibe altogether. With this newfound appreciation for the quieter, unplugged side of her electric guitar, Victoria dabbled into genres such as jazz, blues, and surf rock, which focused heavily on intricate fingering patterns and melodic chord progressions. Her electric guitar - which had once epitomized rock 'n' roll - transformed into a versatile companion that could adapt to any genre or style with ease. Victoria's exploration of different music styles eventually gave her a profound understanding of her instrument, as well as the knowledge and skill to seamlessly merge genres and create a distinct sound. Despite their differing approaches, Erin and Victoria's mutual love for music and their respective guitars brought them even closer as friends. They often collaborated on both original compositions and popular songs, creating a unique blend that showcased the complementary nature of acoustic and electric guitars. The harmonious juxtaposition of Erin's warm, wooden tones with Victoria's sleek, electric sound became their signature, enabling their musical partnership to transcend the limitations of genres or style."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 - June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, and dancer. Dubbed the \\"King of Pop\\", he was one of the most popular entertainers in the world, and was the best-selling music artist during the year of his death. Jackson's contributions to music, dance, and fashion along with his publicized personal life made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades. The eighth child of the Jackson family, Michael made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5. Beginning in May 2002, Jackson allowed a documentary film crew, led by British TV personality Martin Bashir, to follow him around nearly everywhere he went. On November 20 of that year, Jackson brought his infant son Prince onto the balcony of his room at the Hotel Adlon in Berlin as fans stood below, holding him in his right arm with a cloth loosely draped over Prince's face. Prince was briefly extended over a railing, four stories above ground level, prompting widespread criticism in the media. Jackson later apologized for the incident, calling it \\"a terrible mistake\\". Bashir's crew was with Jackson during this incident; the program was broadcast in March 2003 as Living with Michael Jackson. In a particularly controversial scene, Jackson was seen holding hands and discussing sleeping arrangements with a young boy. As soon as the documentary aired, the Santa Barbara county attorney's office began a criminal investigation. After an initial probe from the LAPD and DCFS was conducted in February 2003, they had initially concluded that molestation allegations were \\"unfounded\\" at the time. After the young boy involved in the documentary and his mother had told investigators that Jackson had behaved improperly, Jackson was arrested in November 2003 and charged with seven counts of child molestation and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent in relation to the 13-year-old boy shown in the film. Jackson denied the allegations, saying the sleepovers were not sexual in nature. The People v. Jackson trial began on January 31, 2005, in Santa Maria, California, and lasted until the end of May. On June 13, 2005, Jackson was acquitted on all counts. After the trial, in a highly publicized relocation, he moved to the Persian Gulf island of Bahrain as a guest of Sheikh Abdullah. Unknown to Jackson, Bahrain was also where the family had intended to send Jackson if he had been convicted, according to a statement by Jermaine Jackson printed in The Times of London in September 2011. On November 17, 2003, three days before Jackson's arrest, Sony released Number Ones, a compilation of Jackson's hits on CD and DVD. In the U.S., the album was certified triple platinum by the RIAA; in the UK it was certified six times platinum for shipments of at least 1.2 million units.","completion":"This text is about Michael Joseph Jackson.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time. The payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort. David Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following: Doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency – and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. Many studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress – which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix. Imagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles. The mind is the same. The more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task. The more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become. But . . . that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand. Let your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the “top-of-mind” because everything that happens... Question: After this semester, what class will David Meyer teach?

Expected to train extensively with sponsor. General Falconer May have up to three wild-caught birds at once. Additional variety of birds available for capture (see state bill WAC 232-30-152 for more information.) May sponsor an apprentice after two years at the General level. Master Falconer Must demonstrate \\"at least five years experience as a General Falconer and show expertise in successful hunting and care of their birds, and experience with more than one species of raptor.\\" May have up to five wild-caught birds at once.

This sets a positive tone for the remainder of the message, as it demonstrates a sense of amicability and kindness towards the individual being addressed. Next, the extensive use of parentheses enclosing the word \\"Snuggles\\" is a unique formatting choice that can be interpreted as an attempt to visually emphasize the affection and closeness the user wishes to convey through their text. The word \\"snuggles\\" itself denotes a feeling of comfort, intimacy, and emotional warmth. This choice of phrasing further solidifies the positive emotion being expressed within the tweet. Lastly, the user incorporates a heart symbol (\\"<3\\") at the end of their message, which is a widely recognized symbol of love and affection. The usage of this symbol contributes to the overall positive sentiment of the tweet, as it implies that the user wishes to express their genuine and heartfelt emotions towards their recipient. Taking all these elements into consideration, it becomes clear that the sentiment of this tweet is indeed positive. The user is conveying warmth, friendliness, and affection through their choice of greeting, use of visually emphasized affectionate words, and the inclusion of a universal symbol for love and affection."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the lake that dropped to its lowest level on January 22, 1977? from the following article ? For years, stories circulated of a treasure being buried within the amphitheater. W. T. McWhorter was determined to find out if it was true, so he planned to dynamite the amphitheater on the day he was to transfer the deed to the CoE. Spectators attended the planned explosion, but it was stopped just in time by CoE attorney David Waid.The dam was completed, and Beaver Lake was at full height by June 1966. For all intents and purposes, Harvey's Monte Ne was gone. However, in times of drought, some of the structures become visible again. The lake dropped to its lowest level on January 22, 1977, more than 27 feet (8 m) below its average depth, and the amphitheater and bridges were visible for the first time in more than 10 years. Before the water flooded downtown Monte Ne again, the rest of the buildings were either bulldozed or moved to avoid problems for swimmers, boaters, and fishermen. The few bridges that spanned the lagoon and the amphitheater were not demolished.In 2006, the waters of Beaver Lake once again receded to their lowest level since 1984, just above 1,100 feet (335 m). This generated a new brief interest in Monte Ne and people were once again attracted to the edge of the lake to explore the remains. The upper part of the amphitheater and the retaining wall built for the never constructed pyramid were exposed for a time before being once again swallowed by the lake.The flooded Monte Ne has become a site of interest for scuba divers who dive by the amphitheater to get a look at the submerged structure. The water is moderately clear and temperatures comfortable.

At its center are two children of the Nuclear Age one a savvy, cynical, modern L.A. woman; the other an innocent, naïve young man cocooned since 1962 in a bomb shelter. Brendan Fraser is Adam, a man out of time. Alicia Silverstone is Eve, a woman of her times. When these two polar opposites begin to attract, the result is a wondrous chain reaction.Adam was born in a steel bunker buried in his parent's backyard, an unforeseen product of the \\"duck-and-cover\\" era taken to its extreme. The son of brilliant-but-paranoid scientist Calvin Webber (Christopher Walken) and picture-perfect suburban wife Helen (Sissy Spacek), Adam's bizarre upbringing was the result of a major tactical mistake. In the midst of the fearsome Cuban Missile Crisis, the Webbers witnessed a blast they thought must be the Big One, but was actually a plane crashing into their yard.So it was that they ensconced themselves in their elaborately engineered bomb shelter to wait out the half-life of radioactive contamination. For 35 years, Adam was raised on Jackie Gleason re-runs, Perry Como records and dreams about life on the surface. While his father taught him about science, baseball and avoiding Communists, his mother taught him about dancing, manners and charming girls. Meanwhile, he waited and waited for a chance to see the sky.Eve, on the other hand, grew up in a rapidly changing Los Angeles and emerged as a woman suspicious of intentions, savagely smart about survival and pretty darned uncertain about the possibilities of love. Her life has been a series of dead-end jobs, shallow boyfriends and dashed hopes.Now, for the first time, Adam is about to leave the safety of the underground for the overwhelming complexity of the '90s and Eve is about to get a whole new perspective on life.

The band originally formed in 2000 and has released three studio albums, All Rise (2001), One Love (2002) and Guilty (2003) that all peaked at number one in the United Kingdom alongside releasing 16 singles, over a four-year period. The group also worked alongside artists such as Stevie Wonder, Elton John and Lil' Kim. In late 2004, the group announced a hiatus and released their first compilation album, Best of Blue, on 15 November 2004. It was announced on 29 January 2011 that Blue would reunite and also represent the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 2011, with their entry \\"I Can\\". It coincided with the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the band in 2001 and a one-hour documentary, Eurovision: Your Country Needs Blue, was broadcast in April 2011 celebrated their preparations for the final. It was the third time the group has Eurovision ambitions as group member Lee Ryan wrote and composed \\"Guardian Angel\\", Andy Scott-Lee's song for the 2005 edition of Making Your Mind Up. Furthermore, Antony Costa came second in the 2006 edition of the show with the song \\"It's A Beautiful Thing\\". Group member Duncan James was a panellist on all episodes of the Eurovision: Your Country Needs You series in 2009, which Jade Ewen won. He also announced the UK votes in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 final. Blue became the first UK representatives since The Shadows in 1975 to have had multiple no.1 singles in the UK chart prior to appearing in Eurovision, and the first since Sonia in 1993 to have had a no.1 at all before entering the competition. The song \\"I Can\\" premiered on 11 March 2011, on The Graham Norton Show. In the contest, they came 11th with 100 points. After the contest Blue said they were the victims of political voting, claiming they would have finished higher if countries had voted for the performance rather than their neighbours. It later turned out when the European Broadcasting Union (who runs Eurovision) released the split Televote & Jury results, That Blue came in 5th place with the European voters and the final result was down to coming in 22nd place on the Jury vote. Duncan James insisted that the result of their Eurovision bid won't affect their UK comeback, adding: \\"Should the worst happen, we're still going to press ahead with the album. It won't be the last of us - we're all fully committed to this band again.\\" The band revealed during an interview that they had recorded a collaboration with American R&B superstar Bruno Mars for their upcoming fourth studio album. Discussing the record with Digital Spy, Lee Ryan said: \\"We've been writing with Ne-Yo, and I've written at least a couple of songs on my own that will probably make the album. We've also been working with Bruno Mars on a song called \\"Black and Blue\\" - he's sending his parts over from a demo we recorded a while ago. It's got some haunting notes on the chorus.\\" They also revealed that three tracks on the album had been produced by RedOne, and that they felt that the material was \\"their best work to date\\". During February 2012, the band embarked on a small tour across Manila, performing with fellow boyband A1 and Jeff Timmons in three special concerts, two of which included the Smart Araneta Coliseum on 25 February 2012, and the Singapore Indoor Stadium on 28 February.

Information: - Westminster was a parliamentary constituency in the Parliament of England to 1707 , the Parliament of Great Britain 1707 -- 1800 and the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 . It returned two members to 1885 and one thereafter . The constituency was first known to have been represented in Parliament in 1545 and continued to exist until the redistribution of seats in 1918 . The constituency 's most famous former representatives are Charles James Fox and John Stuart Mill. - The Parliament of Great Britain was formed in 1707 following the ratification of the Acts of Union by both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland. The Acts created a new unified Kingdom of Great Britain and dissolved the separate English and Scottish parliaments in favour of a single parliament, located in the former home of the English parliament in the Palace of Westminster, near the City of London. This lasted nearly a century, until the Acts of Union 1800 merged the separate British and Irish Parliaments into a single Parliament of the United Kingdom with effect from 1 January 1801. - The Palace of Westminster is the meeting place of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, the two houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Commonly known as the Houses of Parliament after its occupants, it is also known as the 'heart of British politics'. The Palace lies on the north bank of the River Thames in the City of Westminster, in central London. - The Parliament of England was the legislature of the Kingdom of England. In 1066, William of Normandy introduced what, in later centuries, became referred to as a feudal system, by which he sought the advice of a council of tenants-in-chief (a person who held land) and ecclesiastics before making laws. In 1215, the tenants-in-chief secured Magna Carta from King John, which established that the king may not levy or collect any taxes (except the feudal taxes to which they were hitherto accustomed), save with the consent of his royal council, which gradually developed into a parliament. - The Parliament of the United Kingdom, commonly known as the UK Parliament or British Parliament, is the supreme legislative body in the United Kingdom, British Crown dependencies and British overseas territories. It alone possesses legislative supremacy and thereby ultimate power over all other political bodies in the UK and its territories. Its head is the Sovereign of the United Kingdom (currently Queen Elizabeth II) and its seat is the Palace of Westminster in the City of Westminster, London. - The Kingdom of England was a sovereign state on the island of Great Britain from the 10th centurywhen it emerged from various Anglo-Saxon kingdomsuntil 1707, when it united with Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. - The charter became part of English political life and was typically renewed by each monarch in turn, although as time went by and the fledgling English Parliament passed new laws, it lost some of its practical significance. At the end of the 16th century there was an upsurge in interest in Magna Carta. Lawyers and historians at the time believed that there was an ancient English constitution, going back to the days of the Anglo-Saxons, that protected individual English freedoms. They argued that the Norman invasion of 1066 had overthrown these rights, and that Magna Carta had been a popular attempt to restore them, making the charter an essential foundation for the contemporary powers of Parliament and legal principles such as \\"habeas corpus\\". Although this historical account was badly flawed, jurists such as Sir Edward Coke used Magna Carta extensively in the early 17th century, arguing against the divine right of kings propounded by the Stuart monarchs. Both James I and his son Charles I attempted to suppress the discussion of Magna Carta, until the issue was curtailed by the English Civil War of the 1640s and the execution of Charles. The political myth of Magna Carta and its protection of ancient personal liberties persisted after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 until well into the 19th century. It influenced the early American colonists in the Thirteen Colonies and the formation of the American Constitution in 1787, which became the supreme law of the land in the new republic of the United States. Research by Victorian historians showed that the original 1215 charter had concerned the medieval relationship between the monarch and the barons, rather than the rights of ordinary people, but the charter remained a powerful, iconic document, even after almost all of its content was repealed from the statute books in the 19th and 20th centuries. - The Acts of Union 1800 (sometimes erroneously referred to as a single Act of Union 1801) united the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland (previously in personal union) to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with effect from 1 January 1801. Both Acts, though since amended, still remain in force in the United Kingdom, but have been repealed in the Republic of Ireland. - The Parliament of Scotland, officially the Estates of Parliament, was the legislature of the Kingdom of Scotland. The parliament, like other such institutions, evolved during the Middle Ages from the king's council of bishops and earls. It is first identifiable as a parliament in 1235, during the reign of Alexander II, when it was described as a \\"colloquium\\" and already possessed a political and judicial role. By the early fourteenth century, the attendance of knights and freeholders had become important, and from 1326 commissioners from the burghs attended. Consisting of the \\"three estates\\" of clergy, nobility and the burghs sitting in a single chamber, the parliament gave consent for the raising of taxation and played an important role in the administration of justice, foreign policy, war, and all manner of other legislation. Parliamentary business was also carried out by \\"sister\\" institutions, such as General Councils or Convention of Estates. These could carry out much business also dealt with by parliament taxation, legislation and policy-making but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament. - The Kingdom of Great Britain, officially Great Britain , was a sovereign state in western Europe from 1 May 1707 to 31 December 1800. The state came into being following the Treaty of Union in 1706, ratified by the Acts of Union 1707, which united the kingdoms of England and Scotland to form a single kingdom encompassing the whole island of Great Britain and its outlying islands. It did not include Ireland, which remained a separate realm. The unitary state was governed by a single parliament and government that was based in Westminster. The former kingdoms had been in personal union since James VI, King of Scots, became King of England and King of Ireland in 1603 following the death of Queen Elizabeth I, bringing about a \\"Union of the Crowns\\". Also after the accession of George I to the throne of Great Britain in 1714, the kingdom was in a personal union with the Electorate of Hanover. - The 14 British Overseas Territories (BOT) are territories under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United Kingdom. They are those parts of the former British Empire that have not chosen independence or have voted to remain British territories. Most of the inhabited territories are internally self-governing, with the UK retaining responsibility for defence and foreign relations. The rest are either uninhabited or have a transitory population of military or scientific personnel. They share the British monarch (Elizabeth II) as head of state.

Two relatives of Mariano Rivera's wife were electrocuted while cleaning the pool at the Panama home of the New York Yankees closer.","completion":"This incident refers to a tragic event that occurred at the Panama home of Mariano Rivera, who is primarily known for his phenomenal career as a closer for the New York Yankees in Major League Baseball (MLB). Known for his exemplary skill, sportsmanship, and contribution to his team's victories, Rivera is a well-respected figure in the sporting world. However, the event in question pertains to a personal tragedy, one that is unrelated to his professional career. In this situation, two individuals, who were relatives of Mariano Rivera's wife, were electrocuted while cleaning the swimming pool at Rivera's residence in Panama. Unfortunately, the cleaning process took a disastrous turn as a result of an electrical fault. It is rather foreseeable with electrical devices or systems placed near water bodies, which could lead to short-circuiting, causing fatal electrical shocks. In this case, the victims were working in or around the pool, making them vulnerable to the impact of the malfunction. Although the technical specifics might vary, such scenarios often involve faulty wiring or malfunctioning electrical equipment. Pool lights, pumps, or other motorized cleaning equipment being improperly grounded or having a defective insulation could cause the water to become electrified. Those who happen to be in or near the water during such malfunction could suffer fatal electrocution, as what happened in the case of Rivera's in-laws in this tragic incident. The shock of this event extended far beyond Rivera's immediate family. As a notable public figure, the news quickly circulated among Rivera's fans and the broader sports community. This tragic event underscores the inherent hazards associated with electricity, particularly in close proximity to water. Preventative measures, including regular safety checks of electrical equipment and emergency response preparedness, might help in averting such dire incidents in the future. While Mariano Rivera is internationally recognised for his professional career in baseball, this incident brings attention to his personal life. Moreover, it reminds us that irrespective of one's professional accolades or public identity, everyone is susceptible to personal hardships and tragedies, signaling the universal human vulnerability to unexpected incidents. Although this event was both tragic and personal, its repercussions were felt on both the local and international stage due to Rivera's standing in the sporting world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro says he plans to extend price controls to all consumer goods, if he is given powers to govern by decree.","completion":"Title: Venezuelan President Maduro Seeks Decree Powers to Implement Sweeping Price Controls on Consumer Goods Introduction Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced plans to extend price controls to all consumer goods, should he obtain the power to rule by decree. This move comes as a response to rising inflation and ongoing economic challenges faced by the country. Amid these crises, Maduro seeks decree powers in an effort to stabilize Venezuela's economy and prevent further destabilization. The question remains as to whether such measures will aid in the country's long-term economic stability and help alleviate the current hardships faced by its citizens. Background of Venezuela's Economic Challenges Venezuela's economy has been in a persistent state of crisis for the past several years. Issues such as dwindling oil reserves, a shrinking GDP, and an unsustainable fiscal policy have contributed to the dire situation. Combating the economic downturn is further complicated due to political tensions, corruption, and mismanagement within the nation. The downturn of the oil market has had a particularly pronounced impact on Venezuela, which relies heavily on oil revenues to fund government spending. Inflation rates in Venezuela have soared to unprecedented levels, contributing to a decreasing standard of living for citizens and widespread social unrest. As the value of the Venezuelan Bolívar decreases, the cost of basic goods and services has skyrocketed, putting them out of reach for many of the country's inhabitants. Price Controls: An Overview Price controls are government-mandated mechanisms by which the price of goods and services are regulated and controlled within an economy. Authorities may impose price ceilings, which limit the maximum price a seller can charge for a good, or impose price floors, setting a minimum price sellers are obligated to charge. Historically, price controls have been implemented in times of crisis, such as during extreme inflation, to aid in stabilizing an economy and preventing price gouging. However, these measures are not without negative consequences and could potentially lead to adverse long-term effects. The Implementation of Price Controls in Venezuela In his pursuit of robust price controls, President Nicolas Maduro's proposed extension covers all consumer goods in Venezuela. Maduro's plan to impose these controls comes as a response to the rising inflation rates, which have reached as high as 130,000% in recent years, according to the International Monetary Fund. Opponents of this strategy worry that such aggressive controls will contribute to further instability in the country and potentially make the situation worse. They argue that price controls often lead to artificial shortages and the prevalence of black markets, as manufacturers and sellers may be disincentivized from producing or selling goods at the mandated price. Economists who disapprove of this policy also emphasize that price controls do not necessarily address the root causes of hyperinflation, such as the continuous printing of money by the government to fund expenditures. Instead, they argue that implementing structural reforms and addressing corruption should be the central focus. The Potential Effects of Price Controls in Venezuela The effectiveness of President Maduro's proposal to extend price controls to all consumer goods remains to be seen. It is uncertain whether these measures will help stabilize the nation's economy and address the issue of skyrocketing inflation. Potential positive outcomes may include: 1. Preventing price gouging and ensuring consumer goods remain accessible to the public. 2. Contributing to short-term stabilization of the economy by curbing hyperinflation. 3. Protecting vulnerable populations, such as low-income households, from further economic hardship. Potential negative outcomes may include: 1. Contributing to further destabilization in the country due to artificially enforced price structures. 2. Encouraging the growth of the black market as a result of shortages in the legal market. 3. Discouraging domestic and foreign investment, exacerbating economic hardships. Conclusion As Venezuela's ongoing economic challenges continue to worsen, President Maduro's proposal to implement sweeping price controls on consumer goods has stirred both support and opposition. While the government aims to stabilize Venezuela's economy and prevent further societal unrest, experts contend that it is crucial to address the root causes of the nation's financial woes. The efficacy of Maduro's plan and its potential impact on the country's economy and citizens, however, remains undetermined."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They piloted the explosives-laden boat alongside the USS Cole, made friendly gestures to crew members, and detonated the bomb. Quso did not arrive at the apartment in time to film the attack. Back in Afghanistan, Bin Laden anticipated U.S. military retaliation. He ordered the evacuation of al Qaeda's Kandahar airport compound and fled- first to the desert area near Kabul, then to Khowst and Jalalabad, and eventually back to Kandahar. In Kandahar, he rotated between five to six residences, spending one night at each residence. In addition, he sent his senior advisor, Mohammed Atef, to a different part of Kandahar and his deputy, Ayman al Zawahiri, to Kabul so that all three could not be killed in one attack. There was no American strike. In February 2001, a source reported that an individual whom he identified as the big instructor (probably a reference to Bin Laden) complained frequently that the United States had not yet attacked. According to the source, Bin Laden wanted the United States to attack, and if it did not he would launch something bigger. The attack on the USS Cole galvanized al Qaeda's recruitment efforts. Following the attack, Bin Laden instructed the media committee, then headed by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, to produce a propaganda video that included a reenactment of the attack along with images of the al Qaeda training camps and training methods; it also highlighted Muslim suffering in Palestine, Kashmir, Indonesia, and Chechnya. Al Qaeda's image was very important to Bin Laden, and the video was widely disseminated. Portions were aired on Al Jazeera, CNN, and other television outlets.

Given the question: Given the following context: Having been tried and found guilty of murder, Nero has now been hanged and his body taken for the ignominious process of public dissection. The year after the prints were issued, the Murder Act 1752 would ensure that the bodies of murderers could be delivered to the surgeons so they could be \\"dissected and anatomised\\". It was hoped this further punishment on the body and denial of burial would act as a deterrent. At the time Hogarth made the engravings, this right was not enshrined in law, but the surgeons still removed bodies when they could.A tattoo on his arm identifies Tom Nero, and the rope still around his neck shows his method of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown to have as much feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims; his eye is put out just as his horse's was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one of its kind in the first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it to heighten the fear for the audience. Just as his murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection, in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display, indicating his ultimate fate. While the surgeons working on the body are observed by the mortar-boarded academics in the front row, the physicians, who can be identified by their wigs and canes, largely ignore the dissection and consult among themselves. The president has been identified as John Freke, president of the Royal College of Surgeons at the time. Freke had been involved in the high-profile attempt to secure the body of condemned rioter Bosavern Penlez for dissection in 1749.

Movie plot title: Red Scorpion Movie plot: Nikolai Petrovitch Rachenko, a Soviet Spetsnaz operative is sent to an African country where Soviet, Czechoslovakian and Cuban forces are helping the government fight an anti-communist rebel movement. He is tasked with the mission to assassinate the rebel leader. In order to infiltrate the rebel movement and get within striking distance of his target, he stirs up trouble in the local bar and gets arrested for disorderly conduct. He is put in the same cell as a captured resistance commander and gains his trust in facilitating the escape. Upon finally reaching the rebel encampment he is met with distrust by the rebels. During the night he attempts to assassinate his target but does not succeed when the distrustful rebels anticipate his actions. Disgraced and tortured by his commanding officers for failing his mission, he breaks out of the interrogation chamber and escapes to the desert, later to be found by native bushmen. He soon learns about them and their culture, and after receiving a ceremonial burn scar in the form of a scorpion (hence the title), he rejoins the freedom fighters and leads an attack against the Soviet camp after a previous attack on the peaceful bushmen. Nikolai obtains an AO-63 from the armory, confronts his corrupt officers and hunts down General Vortek, who attempts to escape in a Mil-24 Hind only to be shot down after takeoff. Nikolai defeats and kills Vortek, as the freedom fighters finally defeat the Soviet oppression.

Here are the simple steps to achieve this task: 1. Choose the bell peppers: Pick 4-6 medium-sized, fresh, and firm bell peppers of any color you prefer. 2. Prepare the bell peppers: Wash the bell peppers thoroughly, then cut off the tops and remove the seeds and membrane from inside. Try to keep the base as intact as possible to hold the stuffing. 3. Choose the filling: Decide on the stuffing ingredients you would like to use. Commonly used ingredients include ground meat (beef, turkey or chicken), cooked rice or quinoa, vegetables (onions, tomatoes, corn, etc.), spices, and herbs. 4. Prepare the filling: Cook the ground meat in a pan, then mix it with cooked rice or quinoa and the chopped vegetables. Season with salt, pepper, and any additional spices or herbs you like. 5.

How can the drive from Edmonton to Auckland be described, and how do these cities' attractions compare to those in Windsor? How can the drive from Edmonton to Auckland be described, and how do these cities' attractions compare to those in Oshawa? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"The two questions are not the same, as they are comparing different sets of cities. The first question is comparing the drive and attractions of Edmonton and Auckland to those in Windsor, while the second question is comparing the drive and attractions of Edmonton and Auckland to those in Oshawa. However, both questions involve the description of the drive from Edmonton to Auckland. To analyze these questions, I will: 1. Describe the drive from Edmonton to Auckland. 2. Compare the attractions in Edmonton and Auckland to those in Windsor. 3. Compare the attractions in Edmonton and Auckland to those in Oshawa. Step 1: Describe the drive from Edmonton to Auckland Since Edmonton is in Canada and Auckland is in New Zealand, it's impossible to drive directly between the two cities, as they are separated by vast distances and expanses of water. You would need to fly from Edmonton to Auckland with a connecting flight, likely through cities like Vancouver or Los Angeles. Step 2: Compare attractions in Edmonton and Auckland to those in Windsor Edmonton attractions: - West Edmonton Mall - Fort Edmonton Park - Royal Alberta Museum - Elk Island National Park - Art Gallery of Alberta Auckland attractions: - Sky Tower - Auckland War Memorial Museum - Waiheke Island - Auckland Harbour Bridge - Piha Beach Windsor attractions: - Caesar's Windsor - Willistead Manor - Art Gallery of Windsor - Ojibway Nature Centre - Adventure Bay Family Water Park Edmonton and Auckland offer more diverse and unique attractions than Windsor. Edmonton has large shopping and entertainment complexes while Auckland features iconic landmarks and beautiful natural landscapes. Both cities offer cultural attractions like museums and galleries. Windsor has historical attractions and family-centered entertainment, but it is not as varied as Edmonton and Auckland. Step 3: Compare attractions in Edmonton and Auckland to those in Oshawa Oshawa attractions: - Canadian Automotive Museum - Parkwood National Historic Site - The Ontario Regiment RCAC Museum - Oshawa Valley Botanical Gardens - Oshawa Zoo Edmonton and Auckland again have a broader range of attractions than Oshawa. Oshawa does have some interesting museums and a beautiful botanical garden, but the variety and scale of attractions in Edmonton and Auckland are greater. In conclusion, the drive from Edmonton to Auckland cannot be done directly and requires a flight. Edmonton and Auckland offer more varied and unique attractions compared to Windsor and Oshawa. While Windsor and Oshawa have some interesting attractions, they may not be as diverse or iconic as those in the larger cities of Edmonton and Auckland."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize this article: While it might be best to let the diarrhea resolve on its own, you may want to slow down the diarrhea using medication. You can take over-the-counter medications like bismuth subsalicylate or a fiber (psyllium) supplement. Adults can take 2.5 to 30g of psyllium a day in divided doses. Bismuth subsalicylate can be used to treat \\"traveler's diarrhea\\" and contains mild antibacterial properties. Psyllium is safe to take during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. For vomiting associated with food poisoning, gastroenteritis and most other non-serious causes, take 1000–4000 mg of ginger (in four divided doses throughout the day. For example, take 250–1000 mg four times a day. Ginger has been used to treat nausea and vomiting of many different causes including chemotherapy-induced nausea, and the nausea of early pregnancy. Studies have shown ginger to be effective at relieving post-surgical nausea. It inhibits or suppresses certain types of brain and gut receptors that are related to the sense of nausea. Wash fresh ginger and cut off a two-inch piece. Peel the tan colored \\"skin\\" or peel to get to the pale ginger. Cut or grate it into small pieces to get a tablespoon. Add the ginger to two cups of boiling water. Cover the pot and boil it for another minute. Turn off the heat and let the ginger tea steep for three to five minutes. Pour into a cup and add honey if you like. Drink four to six cups of ginger tea a day. Use fresh ginger, not ginger ale. Most ginger ales do not contain real ginger and contain high levels of sweetener. You should avoid sweeteners while nauseous because sugar generally makes you feel worse. While more research is needed, some herbs are believed to reduce viral or bacterial infections that cause nausea. If anything, herbal teas may simply let you relax and minimize your sense of nausea. To make herbal teas, add 1 teaspoon of dried powder or leaf and steep it in 1 cup of boiled water. You can add honey and lemon to taste. Use the following: Peppermint Clove Cinnamon Take peppermint or lemon essential oil and place a drop of oil on both of your wrists and temples. Both peppermint and lemon oil have been traditionally used to treat nausea. Studies suggest that these oils reduce nausea by relaxation or by influencing the part of the brain that controls nausea. Make sure you don’t have a skin sensitivity. Either put a single drop of oil on your wrist. If you have a sensitivity, you may experience a rash, redness or itching. If so, try the other oil or another method. Only use essential oils, since candies or scents probably don't have real peppermint or lemon oil and are unlikely to have high enough levels of the oil to be helpful. Lie flat on your back and place pillows under your knees and neck for comfort. Put your hands palm down on your stomach below the rib cage. Place the fingers of your hands together so you can feel them separate. This will let you know you are doing the exercise correctly. Take a long, slow deep breath by expanding your belly, breathing through your diaphragm instead of your rib cage. The diaphragm creates suction that pulls more air into your lungs than can be achieved by expanding the rib cage. Research has shown that controlled, deep breathing can help relieve nausea. Other studies have indicated that breathing can help control nausea after surgery.

Process: - Oil is gathered through mining operations - The oil is transported to stores - Oil is purchased by homeowners - Oil is placed into a stove in the house - The oil is lit on fire, and burns for a long time - The warm air off of the oil travels through the house - Question: suppose less heating by electricity happens, how will it affect more oil placed in a stove. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"If there is less heating by electricity, it is likely that more oil will be placed into stoves in houses for heating purposes. This is because, when the demand for electric heating decreases, homeowners will seek alternative sources of heating to maintain a comfortable temperature in their homes. One such alternative is using oil stoves. The increased usage of oil in stoves will have a two-fold effect: 1. More oil consumption: As more homeowners turn to oil stoves for heating, the overall demand and consumption of oil will increase. This could lead to higher prices for oil due to the increased demand and potentially contribute to negative environmental impacts, such as increased carbon emissions and pollution from burning oil. 2. Changes in the heating market: In response to the reduced demand for electric heating, suppliers may lower their prices or offer incentives to attract customers back to using electricity for heating purposes. Conversely, the increased demand for oil as a heating source could lead to the emergence of new products and innovations in oil heating technology. In summary, less heating by electricity will likely result in more oil being placed in stoves, which can further affect oil consumption and the overall heating market."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Build a movie plot around this: Where does Shabnam learn to project her voice? On the sets A:","completion":"Title: \\"Echoes on Set\\" 1. Introduction: The movie begins with a young, introverted girl named Shabnam who lives in a small town in India. She has a passion for acting and a natural talent for it. However, she has always been constrained by her soft-spoken nature, lacking the powerful voice needed to command a stage or film set. Justification: A protagonist with a problem or flaw to overcome is a common technique to build empathy for the character among the audience. 2. Setting: The story shifts to the bustling city of Mumbai where a renowned movie director, named Aman, is struggling to find a lead actress with innocence yet strength in her eyes. Justification: The journey to the city brings a sense of progression and challenge to Shabnam's rural, simple life, while introducing another central character with a related problem. 3. Meeting: In a twist of fate, Aman discovers Shabnam's acting skills through a clip of a community theater performance and recognizes her potential. However, her voice lacks the strength and volume to carry emotion to a wider audience. He invites Shabnam to Mumbai to work on his upcoming project. Justification: The director noticing Shabnam presents a believable scenario for her to move to the big city and introduces the main challenge that Shabnam needs to overcome. 4. Training: Shabnam moves to Mumbai and begins a challenging training period. This part of the movie focuses on Shabnam's growth, learning to project her voice on the sets with Aman's help and the additional help of a voice coach. Justification: Training scenes add a sense of progress and upward momentum to the movie, while adding depth to the characters' relationships and showcasing their determination and hard work. 5. Conflict: As Shabnam begins to grasp the art of voice projection and nuances of acting, a talent agency wants Aman to replace Shabnam with a famous actress. Aman is torn between taking a safer route for his movie's success and giving chance to a new talent. Justification: A conflict or some sort of challenge is vital for a movie plot. It keeps the audience engaged and invested in what might happen next. 6. Climax: After deliberation, Aman decides to stand up against the talent agency and continues with Shabnam as his leading lady. Shabnam, realizing her dream is on the line, delivers an outstanding on-set performance with not just projected voice but internal strength. Justification: Climax where the conflict reaches its peak and starts getting resolved, shows character growth and resolve. Shabnam acquiring the skills and confidence she needs, resolves the central challenge of the plot. 7. Conclusion: The movie produced is a major hit. Shabnam's voice echoes in every theatre, earning her respect in the film industry and giving Aman the hit he needed. The movie ends with Shabnam giving an interview about her journey from a small village to becoming a successful actress. Justification: A happy ending with the protagonist's success is a satisfying resolution to the storyline. It gives a sense of closure to the audience and the interview would serve as a means to reflect on Shabnam's growth and the themes presented in the movie."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Daniel, a young Jewish man, was brought forth to help interpret this dream.

The proposed suggestion accurately reflects the Biblical account: \\"God gives Daniel a vision in the night to reveal the king's dream.\\" In Daniel chapter 2, God revealed to Daniel the content of the dream as well as its meaning. The dream was an overview of a succession of kingdoms, represented by a statue made of various materials. Daniel explained to the king that his dream symbolized major events throughout world history, with each part of the statue representing different empires. Daniel's ability to interpret Nebuchadnezzar's dream earned him the trust and favor of the king, who ultimately appointed him as an important advisor, and Chapter 3 unfolds the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego (associates of Daniel), with Nebuchadnezzar's new statue and a test of their faith.

Cousy played point guard with the Boston Celtics from 1950 to 1963 and briefly with the Cincinnati Royals in the 1969-70 season. Making his high school varsity squad as a junior, he went on to earn a scholarship to the College of the Holy Cross, where he led the Crusaders to berths in the 1948 NCAA Tournament and 1950 NCAA Tournament and was named an NCAA All-American for 3 seasons. Cousy was initially drafted by the Tri-Cities Blackhawks as the third overall pick in the first round of the 1950 NBA draft, but after he refused to report, he was picked up by Boston. After retiring as a player, Cousy published his autobiography Basketball Is My Life in 1963, and in the same year became coach at Boston College. In the 1965 ECAC Holiday Basketball Festival at Madison Square Garden, Providence defeated Boston College 91-86 in the title game, when the Friars were led by Tourney MVP and All-American Jimmy Walker. Providence was coached by Joe Mullaney, who was Cousy's teammate at Holy Cross when the two men were players there in 1947. In his six seasons there, he had a record of 117 wins and 38 losses and was named New England Coach of the Year for 1968 and 1969. Cousy led the Eagles to three NIT appearances, including a berth in the 1969 NIT Championship and two National Collegiate Athletic Association tournaments, including the 1967 Eastern Regional Finals. Cousy grew bored with college basketball and returned to the NBA as coach of the Cincinnati Royals, team of fellow Hall-of-Fame point guard Oscar Robertson. He later said about this engagement, \\"I did it for the money. I was made an offer I couldn't refuse.\\" In 1970, the 41-year-old Cousy even made a late-season comeback as a player to boost ticket sales. Despite his meager output of 5 points in 34 minutes of playing time in seven games, ticket sales jumped by 77 percent. He continued as coach of the team after it moved from Cincinnati to Kansas City/Omaha, but stepped down as the Kings' coach early in the 1973-74 NBA season with a 141-209 record. In later life, Cousy was Commissioner of the American Soccer League from 1974 to 1979. He has been a color analyst on Celtics telecasts since the 1980s.\\" In addition, Cousy had a role in the basketball film Blue Chips in 1993, in which he played a college athletic director. Today he is a marketing consultant for the Celtics, and occasionally makes broadcast appearances with Mike Gorman and ex-Celtic teammate Tom Heinsohn.

Moment 'drunken Brit is arrested for exposing himself and making death threats on flight from the US to Germany' Oliver Charles Halliday Gee, 34, was arrested last week SHOCKING images have emerged of the Brit facing jail who police say drunkenly exposed himself and made death threats on an international flight. Oliver Charles Halliday Gee, 34, a British national who lives in Mexico, was arrested last week when a flight by German charter airline Condor from Cancun, Mexico to Frankfurt, Germany, made an emergency landing in Jacksonville, Florida. The charges Gee is facing have yet to be confirmed, but reports suggest they may include assault or intimidation of a flight crew, and he could face up to 20 years in prison. A Swiss passenger who was on board the flight witnessed the incident. He said: “He got up, took off his t-shirt and his pants, and kept shouting ‘I prefer drugs to alcohol.’” According to the passenger, the drunkard was very angry and the Swiss man had to prevent him from coming too close to his daughter. Gee had allegedly demanded to be served alcohol even before takeoff and was behaving aggressively. After takeoff, Gee allegedly threatened to kill another passenger and threatened and intimidated a three-year-old child. It is also claimed he insulted flight attendants and started to remove his clothes, exposing his genitals in the process. According to accounts from other passengers, Gee wanted to urinate in the cabin and therefore was assisted to the toilet by a flight attendant and a passenger who volunteered to help. Gee then allegedly slapped both of them, before threatening that he knew people in Mexico who would gladly kill for him. Gee was restrained by the passenger and the flight attendant, and the flight was diverted to Jacksonville after the American authorities were warned about the emergency landing. Gee was arrested by the FBI, after which the flight continued its journey to Frankfurt. We pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?

It's important, first and foremost, to see yourself as lovable, because you are lovable. OPTIONS: 1). Expecting people to find you lovable if you don't find yourself lovable is putting way too much pressure on other people. It also takes the control out of your hands and puts it into the hands of other people, who may or may not be good enough for that. 2). That means if you really make it a point to stand up for yourself and put others before yourself you will see your flaws as flaws. Being lovable doesn't mean accepting challenges or being shut down by others without your own best effort. 3). Learn to identify the negative qualities of others, and make a point of being positively matched to those qualities. This isn't an easy task, but it's certainly still something you can do, for a lot of people, even if you're a mean person. 4).

Explanation: This is the best fit considering the context as it directly continues from the previously given paragraph with logical consistency about self-perception and its influence on how others perceive you. Incorrect Answers: 2). This choice has somewhat contradicting points. Standing up for oneself and putting others first can be conflicting behaviors. Furthermore, it strays from the main theme by suggesting that being lovable equates to accepting challenges or being shut down by others, which is not true. 3). This statement advocates for identifying negative qualities in others and trying to match them positively, which diverts from the main topic about self-love and how personal perception influences others' views about us. 4).

To do this, we'll add 25 to both sides of the equation: -15 + 25 = -2*y - 25 + 25 This simplifies to: 10 = -2*y Step 2: Now we need to isolate y. Since y is being multiplied by -2, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -2 to get y by itself: 10 / (-2) = (-2*y) / (-2) This simplifies to: -5 = y So, the solution to the given equation -15 = -2*y - 25 is y = -5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Two mycologists studied about mushrooms. Bert studied mycorrhizal fungi, while Vince studied saprophytic mushrooms. Hint: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil.

Будет еще точнее сказать, что в ближайшие месяцы успешность ХАМАСа будет определяться больше своим ответом на эти вопросы, чем чем-либо еще. Важными аспектами, которые обязательно окажут влияние на решения и взгляды организации, являются социальные и экономические проблемы, конфликтные ситуации, политические амбиции и международный контекст. Проанализируем каждый из этих аспектов более подробно. В социальной и экономической сфере, ХАМАС следует тщательно обратить внимание на потребности населения и сложности, с которыми ежедневно сталкиваются граждане. Борьба с безработицей, нищетой и неравенством — это ключевые приоритеты, которыми должна заняться организация для того, чтобы укрепить свою позицию и поддержку населения. Следующим важным аспектом являются конфликтные ситуации. ХАМАС должен продолжать искать мирные пути разрешения споров с Израилем и другими сторонами, при этом не позволяя конфликтам угрожать собственной безопасности и стабильности региона. Дипломатические усилия могут оказаться ключом к успешному решению многих проблем. Третья ключевая задача перед ХАМАСом заключается в политических амбициях. Организация должна наладить отношения с другими палестинскими группами и правительствами, чтобы объединить усилия в достижении долгосрочных интересов и национального единства. Проведение демократических выборов и активное участие ХАМАСа в них может способствовать этому процессу.

Это включает сотрудничество с ООН, арабскими и европейскими государствами, а также странами, разделяющими общие интересы, такими как Россия и Китай. В целом, успех ХАМАСа в ближайшие месяцы будет в значительной степени зависеть от его способности адекватно реагировать на все эти вопросы и потребности.

Movie title: Fahrenheit 9/11 Context: The movie begins by suggesting that friends and political allies of George W. Bush at Fox News Channel tilted the election of 2000 by prematurely declaring Bush the winner. It then suggests the handling of the voting controversy in Florida constituted election fraud. The film then segues into the September 11 attacks. Moore says Bush was informed of the first plane hitting the World Trade Center on his way to an elementary school. Bush is then shown sitting in a Florida classroom with children. When told that a second plane has hit the World Trade Center and that the nation is \\"under attack\\", Bush allows the students to finish their book reading, and Moore notes that he continued reading for nearly seven minutes. Moore then discusses the complex relationships between the U.S. government and the Bush family; and between the bin Laden family, the Saudi Arabian government, and the Taliban, which span over three decades. Moore alleges that the United States government evacuated 24 members of the bin Laden family on a secret flight shortly after the attacks, without subjecting them to any form of interrogation. Moore moves on to examine George W. Bush's Air National Guard service record. Moore contends that Bush's dry-hole oil well attempts were partially funded by the Saudis and by the bin Laden family through the intermediary of James R. Bath. Moore alleges that these conflicts of interest suggest that the Bush administration does not serve the interests of Americans. The movie continues by suggesting ulterior motives for the War in Afghanistan, including a natural gas pipeline through Afghanistan to the Indian Ocean. Moore alleges that the Bush administration induced a climate of fear among the American population through the mass media.

Over the course of the previous year, the company had faced several challenges that required quick adaptation and innovative solutions to keep up with the rapidly evolving technological landscape. In these trying times, it became more important than ever for employees to demonstrate their value through their contributions, creativity, and ability to excel under pressure. From the beginning of the year, Joel had showcased his dedication to the company's success, consistently going the extra mile to achieve his objectives. As the head of the research and development department, he was responsible for identifying and driving forward the creation of new products and services that would set the company apart from its competitors. Under his leadership, the team not only met their deadlines but also exceeded their own internal targets for project completion. One prime example of Joel's extraordinary performance was his instrumental role in the development of the company's latest AI-powered virtual assistant tool. Joel not only led the technical aspects of the project, but also played an active role in guiding the integration of the tool across various business units, both internally and externally. His ability to bridge the gap between technical details and practical applications of the technology made him an invaluable asset to the company. He also worked closely with the marketing department to develop a launch strategy that ultimately resulted in a highly successful product release. Moreover, Joel proactively sought to expand his knowledge base by attending industry conferences, networking events, and online courses, which had a direct impact on his ability to contribute innovative ideas to the company's product roadmap. This relentless pursuit of growth and improvement cascaded throughout his team, leading to a high-performing unit that lived up to the company's standard of excellence. On the other hand, Nelson, who held the position of sales director, struggled to maintain the same level of outstanding performance as Joel. Although his department met most of their quarterly targets, they ultimately fell short of the expectations set for them in several areas. Nelson's inability to motivate and inspire his team to push beyond their limits became evident in their somewhat lackluster results. Despite his efforts in attending motivational seminars and adopting various coaching techniques, the sales team's performance remained stagnant throughout the year. Furthermore, Nelson failed to recognize and adjust to the shifting trends within the technology market. Instead of proactively seeking new sales avenues and identifying potential opportunities, he relied heavily on the company's established client base. This lack of adaptability resulted in missed opportunities that could have significantly boosted the overall revenue and opened up new markets for the company's products and services. In light of these factors, the CEO made the decision to reward the stellar performance of Joel, hoping that it would serve as an example to other employees and inspire them to rise to the same level of excellence. Though Nelson did not receive a raise, the CEO recognized the need to work closely with him and provide additional support, resources, and coaching to help improve his department's performance in the upcoming year. The innovative technology company needed strong leaders that could adapt and excel to maintain its competitive edge, and the CEO believed that investing in the development of its workforce was a vital step in achieving that success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The true nature of her physical and mental ailments should be obvious, by the time Mr. Williams returns to New York. Possibly, her blindness could be in question - but a revelation could have be made certain in either the \\"highway\\" or \\"video tape\\" scenes. The film would benefit from a re-editing - how about a \\"director's cut\\"? Williams and Bobby Cannavale (as Jess) don't seem, initially, believable as a couple. A scene or two establishing their relationship might have helped set the stage. Otherwise, the cast is exemplary. Williams offers an exceptionally strong characterization, and not a \\"gay impersonation\\". Sandra Oh (as Anna), Joe Morton (as Ashe), and Rory Culkin (Pete Logand) are all perfect. Best of all, Collette's \\"Donna\\" belongs in the creepy hall of fame. Ms. Oh is correct in saying Collette might be, \\"you know, like that guy from 'Psycho'.\\" There have been several years when organizations giving acting awards seemed to reach for women, due to a slighter dispersion of roles; certainly, they could have noticed Collette with some award consideration.

Article: The 11 billion self-help industry is built on the idea that you should turn negative thoughts like \\"I never do anything right\\" into positive ones like \\"I can succeed.\\" But was positive thinking advocate Norman Vincent Peale right? Is there power in positive thinking? Researchers in Canada just published a study in the journal Psychological Science that says trying to get people to think more positively can actually have the opposite effect: it can simply highlight how unhappy they are. The study's authors, Joanne Wood and John Lee of the University of Waterloo and Elaine Perunovic of the University of New Brunswick, begin by citing older research showing that when people get feedback which they believe is overly positive, they actually feel worse, not better. If you tell your friend who is slow to learn that he has the potential of an Einstein, _ . In one 1990s experiment, a team including psychologist Joel Cooper of Princeton asked participants to write essays opposing funding for the disabled. When the essayists were later praised for their sympathy, they felt even worse about what they had written. In this experiment, Wood, Lee and Perunovic measured 68 students' self-esteem. The participants were then asked to write down their thoughts and feelings for four minutes. Every 15 seconds, one group of students heard a bell. When it rang, they were supposed to tell themselves, \\"I am lovable.\\" Those with low self-esteem didn't feel better after the forced self-affirmation . In fact, their moods turned significantly darker than those of members of the control group, who weren't urged to think positive thoughts. The paper provides support for newer forms of psychotherapy that urge people to accept their negative thoughts and feelings rather than fight them. In the fighting, we not only often fail but can make things worse. Meditation techniques, in contrast, can teach people to put their shortcomings into a larger, more realistic viewpoint.

Answer:","completion":"James M. Cain and Lee Child, both being successful authors within the literary world, each possess their unique styles when it comes to weaving captivating stories for their readers. Despite their shared love for writing, these two novelists do not share the same nationality. James M. Cain, born James Mallahan Cain on July 1, 1892, was an American author and journalist hailing from Annapolis, Maryland, United States. He is often associated with the hard-boiled school of American crime fiction, pushing the boundaries of the noir literary genre. Cain is best known for his crime novels, such as \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" (1934), \\"Double Indemnity\\" (1936), and \\"Mildred Pierce\\" (1941). These, among other works, have established him as a prominent figure in American literature, with several of his books being adapted into successful films. On the other hand, Lee Child, born Jim Grant on October 29, 1954, is a British author who was born in Coventry, England, United Kingdom. Child is widely acclaimed for his Jack Reacher novel series, which features the eponymous character, a former U.S. Army Major turned drifter who finds himself tangled in a myriad of dangerous situations and investigations. Lee Child's writing style is characterized by his use of gripping plots, vivid action sequences, and the creation of a strong and enigmatic protagonist. The success of the Jack Reacher series has led to numerous adaptations in the form of feature films and a television series, further cementing Lee Child's reputation as a prominent author in the crime thriller genre. In conclusion, although James M. Cain and Lee Child share common ground as prolific authors who have made significant contributions to the realm of crime fiction, they hold different nationalities. James M. Cain is an American author, while Lee Child is of British origin. Their distinct backgrounds have shaped their unique voices in writing and storytelling, creating a rich and diverse landscape within the world of noir and crime thriller literature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the sentence \\"A group of people standing together for a picture\\", is the sentence \\"A small group of friends poses for a picture.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"A small group of friends poses for a picture\\" can be considered true based on the information given in the initial sentence \\"A group of people standing together for a picture.\\" Although there are subtle differences between the two sentences, both convey a similar situation. The initial sentence states that there is a \\"group of people standing together\\" for the purpose of taking a picture, which implies that they are likely posing together for a photograph. The second sentence, on the other hand, narrows down the group to \\"a small group of friends\\" and mentions that they are posing for a picture. The second sentence provides additional context by specifying that the people in question are friends and that the group is small in number. However, both sentences describe a group of individuals who are participating in a photograph. Even though the second sentence presents the group as friends, it is a reasonable assumption that a group of people standing together for a photograph may indeed be friends or at least friendly acquaintances. Moreover, the term \\"small\\" in the second sentence is relative, and it could still be a true sentence depending on the size of the group in the original sentence.

Lisa Marie Simpson is a fictional character in the animated television series The Simpsons. She is the middle child and most intelligent of the Simpson family. Voiced by Yeardley Smith, Lisa was born as a character in The Tracey Ullman Show short \\"Good Night\\" on April 19, 1987. Cartoonist Matt Groening created and designed her while waiting to meet James L. Brooks. The Simpsons uses a floating timeline in which the characters do not have physical ages; as such, Lisa is always depicted as 7-8 years old. The show itself is perpetually set in the year of broadcast (except for occasional flashbacks and flashforwards). In several episodes, events have been linked to specific time periods, although this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Lisa's year of birth is given in \\"Lisa's First Word\\" (season 4, 1992) as 1984, during the Summer Olympics. The episode \\"That '90s Show\\" (season 19, 2008), however, contradicts much of the established backstory; for example, it presents Homer and Marge as being childless in the late 1990s. Lisa is a lover of music, with jazz as her favorite genre. She enjoys and excels at playing the saxophone and became friends with jazz musician Bleeding Gums Murphy, whom she regards as an idol. Murphy helps pull Lisa out of her depression in \\"Moaning Lisa\\" (season 1, 1990). She is later deeply saddened by Murphy's death in \\"'Round Springfield\\" (season 6, 1995). Lisa has been friendly with several boys, including Ralph Wiggum in \\"I Love Lisa\\" (season 4, 1993), Nelson Muntz in \\"Lisa's Date with Density\\" (season 8, 1996) and Colin in The Simpsons Movie (2007). Bart's best friend Milhouse Van Houten has a crush on her, but despite dropping unsubtle hints about his feelings, he has been unsuccessful in winning her affection. Lisa is the most intellectual member of the Simpson family (she has an IQ of 159), and many episodes of the series focus on her fighting for various causes. Lisa is often the focus of episodes with \\"a real moral or philosophical point\\", which according to former writer David S. Cohen is because \\"you really buy her as caring about it.\\" Lisa's political convictions are generally liberal and she often contests other's views. She is a vegetarian, feminist, environmentalist and a supporter of gay rights and the Free Tibet movement. In a special Christmas message for the UK in 2004 Lisa showed her support for Cornish nationalism, even speaking the Cornish language to get her message across. While supportive of the general ideals of the Christian church in which she was raised, Lisa became a practicing Buddhist in the episode \\"She of Little Faith\\" (season 13, 2001) after she learned about the Noble Eightfold Path.

The traditions of the local peoples are unanimous in affirming that the oldest inhabitants of Casamance are the Bainuk people and that the left bank of the mouth of the river was first populated by the Jola. Portuguese sailors reached the west African coast in the 15th century, and in the 16th century, Portuguese traders became active in the Casamance region, mostly in search of wax, ivory, and slaves. They did not linger on \\"Mosquito Island\\", instead founding their first trading post at Ziguinchor in 1645.In the late 1820s, a mulatto trader from Gorée, Pierre Baudin, moved to Itou and began planting rice and producing lime by crushing the shells of mangrove oysters and cooking them in lime kilns. The French administration treated Baudin as their representative on the island and did not send others because few of the French wanted to live on the island. Being wet and marshy, Carabane had a reputation for its poor sanitation. The local economy was based mainly on weedy rice, which was sold in Ziguinchor or to the British in The Gambia. The Baudin family used slaves to produce the rice and, despite the declaration of its official abolition in the French colonial empire in 1848, slavery continued on the island until the early 20th century.The colonial administration wanted to expand its influence around the river, particularly because the inhabitants of Gorée were threatened with losing part of their resources with the imminent demise of the slave trade, and also because of their competition with Saint-Louis. On January 9, 1836, Lieutenant Malavois, who was in charge of Gorée, left for Casamance in search of a site for a trading post. The tip of Diogue, on the north shore, was first considered, but at the refusal of the Jola, it was the opposite bank which was eventually accepted.

On the request of her grandfather, Badri helps Alaknanda to gradually believe in God's existence. Eventually Alakananda falls deeply in love with Badri, unbeknownst to him, and is not willing to lose him at any cost. Sarkar and his men follow Alaknanda to Badrinath, and try to kidnap her. Although Badri manages to save her, he is heavily injured and goes under medication. Meanwhile, Bheeshma Narayan is shocked upon seeing Alakananda's affectionate behaviour towards Badri when he lay injured. As it is a strict rule that only an unmarried man must be the next guru who would lead the elite warriors, Bheeshma Narayan becomes highly suspicious that Badri is in love with Alakananda, which is not the real situation. Badri promises Alakananda that he would bring her back to Badrinath Temple for success in her love, unaware that he is the object of her love in the first place. As per the promise, Badri goes to Bellary to free Alakananda from the clutches of Sarkar, who is planning to fix the marriage, and escort Alaknanda back to the holy shrine. He fights with all the goons and escorts her to Badrinath. Sarkar vows revenge on Badri as Sarkar's son is severely hurt in the process by Badri. Subsequently, Sarkar leads his goons to...

The film showcases their journey from amateur musicians to pursuing their individual dreams and goals, which ultimately leads to them struggling to balance their friendship and their newfound paths in life. The story begins with Zachary and Kendall as young children in their quaint, suburban neighborhood. Growing up together, they have always been inseparable, and their mutual love for music cements their unbreakable bond. Their friendship is soon put to the test as they enter a prestigious high school known for its rigorous music program. Nevertheless, their unwavering connection and shared dream of becoming professional musicians keep them grounded. However, as the two friends immersively involve themselves in their respective musical projects, a distance begins to form between them. Zachary, a gifted pianist, starts receiving numerous scholarship opportunities to attend the most distinguished music conservatories around the world. On the other hand, Kendall finds a unique niche as an innovative electronic music producer, quickly gaining recognition within the underground music scene. As the story progresses, Zachary gets accepted into a renowned music conservatory in Paris, while Kendall decides to leave their hometown to chase the dream of becoming a successful DJ and music producer in New York City. Their newfound careers begin to show promising signs, yet they can't help but miss each other's companionship. Zachary struggles to connect with his classmates, who come from privileged backgrounds and display a condescending attitude. Kendall's rapid ascent in the electronic music world leads to feeling overwhelmed by potential collaborators, labels, and the need to navigate a burgeoning, but sometimes shark-infested, music industry. In parallel, the movie showcases the struggles and successes each friend encounters within their respective musical journeys. As Zachary delves deeper into classical music studies and rises as a prodigious pianist, Kendall starts making a name for themselves in the electronic music scene. A sense of nostalgia and longing for their earlier days of endless jam sessions and shared dreams haunts both individuals. Eventually, Zachary and Kendall meet again in their hometown by happenstance during a mutual break between their busy schedules. They realize how their passion for music led to drifting apart, and that their zeal to succeed has nearly overshadowed the true essence of their love for music - which drew them together in the first place. In a emotional reunion, they perform a stunning collaborative piece consisting of both classical and electronic elements. The brought-to-life fusion of their diversified creative selves becomes a cathartic experience that re-establishes their friendship and lifts their spirits. Towards the end, the movie explores how Zachary and Kendall move forward in their careers, fostering both growth and connection. Zachary pursues opportunities to give back as a music tutor for underprivileged children, while Kendall establishes an inclusive music label that nurtures upcoming artists of diverse backgrounds. The movie ends on an uplifting note, with the pair of friends understanding that no matter where life takes them or how little time they spend together, their shared love for music will keep their friendship alive - transcending any distance and reminding them of the roots they share and the dreams they built together. Drifting Melodies is a poignant tale of dreams, friendship, and the unyielding resilience of a bond deepened by a shared passion for music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Happy Gilmore Movie plot: Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) is an aspiring ice hockey player who possesses a powerful and dangerous slapshot that his father (Louis O'Donoghue) taught him as a child (Donnie MacMillan) before he was apparently struck and killed by a wayward hockey puck, though his over aggressive streak (which once resulted in him trying to stab a guy to death with an ice skate) and lack of skating talent consistently preclude him from joining a hockey team. His girlfriend Terry (Nancy McClure), a schoolteacher, leaves him because of his hockey obsession. His grandmother (Frances Bay) has not paid her taxes for many years. As such, she owes the IRS 270,000 in back taxes, and the house is about to be seized. Gilmore has only 90 days to come up with the money or else the house will be auctioned off. Grandma Gilmore is forced to temporarily move into a retirement home, run by a sadistic manager named Hal (Ben Stiller in an uncredited role). While repossessing Grandma's furniture, a pair of movers challenge Happy to hit golf balls. With his unorthodox, hockey slapshot-style swing, Happy hits the ball 400 yards three times, winning 40 as a result and starts hustling golfers with his swing at the driving range, leading former golf star and current club pro Chubbs Peterson (Carl Weathers) to convince Happy to enter a local tournament for a chance to win \\"big bucks\\".

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the band that played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All? Kill 'Em All features intricate riffing reminiscent of the NWOBHM bands played at high velocity. The album is considered crucial in the thrash metal genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and shredding leads to the genre. Hammett played some pentatonic patterns in addition to his breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica's subsequent albums. Hetfield's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on No Life 'til Leather to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All. Music writer Joel McIver said Burton's and Hetfield's performances were nearly virtuosic, because of the smooth-sounding bass of the former and the precise picking skills of the latter. According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a \\"naive charm\\". The musical approach on Kill 'Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica's street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock. \\"Phantom Lord\\" is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song begins with synthesized bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion. \\"No Remorse\\" is a mid-tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo in the fifth minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. \\"Seek & Destroy\\" was inspired by Diamond Head's \\"Dead Reckoning\\" and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill 'Em All sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, one-line chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong. \\"Metal Militia\\", one of the fastest songs on the album, is about heavy metal's way of life and nonconformity....

Grandma saw me turn over and over. \\"If you just watch for the breeze ,\\" she said, \\"you'll cool off and fall asleep.\\" I stare at the filmy white curtain, willing it to move. Lying still, waiting, I suddenly notice the life outside the window. The bug chorus.

Write the answer: Caroline/Gothic, Humanist, Round, and Bastarda, are styles, called 'hands', in medieval?","completion":"Caroline/Gothic, Humanist, Round, and Bastarda are styles, called 'hands', in medieval calligraphy. Step 1: Understanding the question - First, I need to understand the question. It is asking if these four styles are known as 'hands' in the medieval context. Step 2: Research on the styles mentioned - Caroline/Gothic: Carolingian minuscule or Caroline minuscule is a script developed during the reign of Charlemagne in the late 8th and early 9th century and later evolved into the Gothic script. - Humanist: Humanist minuscule is a handwriting style developed during the Italian Renaissance as a reaction to the Gothic script. It is more legible and closely related to Roman-style letters. - Round: Rounded gothic or textualis rotunda, is a Gothic script characterized by its round and wide letters. - Bastarda: Bastarda is a script used in France and Burgundy in the 14th and 15th centuries. It is a combination of Gothic and humanistic elements. Step 3: Analyzing the connection between the styles and 'hands' - Since the mentioned styles are all forms of script used in the medieval era, they can be considered 'hands.' The term 'hands' refers to particular writing styles or scripts used by scribes during that time period.

To test how much dreams can help learning,Robert Stickgold had some students play a shapefitting game called Tetris for a few hours and then go to sleep.Soon they were dreaming of falling Tetris shapes.Interestingly,the worst Tetris players had the most Tetris dreams and improved their game the most.Similar tests have shown the same results for all kinds of skills. As we dream,many important tasks are getting done.The brain decides what to keep and what to forget.It is connecting new experiences to older learning.In fact,the brain is learning all night long. Another important task of dreams may be to help us deal with emotions .At night,emotions are in the driver's seat.People who have had an upsetting experience often dream about it afterward.Often the dream event changes somehow--another way the brain tries to make the memory less upset.So if your best friend moves away,you might dream that you're the one who's moving.In fact,dreams have a proven power to improve mood,and people who dream about what's bothering them usually feel better sooner than those who don't.

I taught the kitten the way Pa taught me: I threw him into water where he could not stand, and I watched, ready to grab him if he went under. Tiger did not thrash desperately like me. He merely paddled urgently for the edge of the plastic pool with his head high and his thin legs churning. Little Bit said, \\"Dog paddle,\\" and we all laughed. \\"Tiger paddle,\\" I said, and we all laughed some more, even Jordy.

When Pa took us, we went to Hawkins Springs behind Mrs. DeLyons' Fountain of Youth Motor Hotel. When Ma took us, we drove to Mermaid Springs State Park, where we would sometimes meet Mr. Drake. I liked Mermaid Springs better because I felt safe there. Ma could not swim, so she never made me jump off a dock into deep water, and she always insisted that I wear an orange styrofoam cylinder on my back like a skindiver or spaceman. Ma usually sat on a towel on the grass near the beach, reading a magazine or a book while tanning her legs. Every now and then she would call to us not to go too far or not to splash each other.

The property was once a regular rehearsal venue for the Beatles, but in recent years it has undergone a complete renovation. This transformation has brought the house up to modern living standards while still maintaining its historic charm and significance. The decision to sell the property at auction made perfect sense, as it allowed fans and collectors the opportunity to own a piece of Beatles history. The renovation process focused on preserving the original architectural features of the home, such as the floor plan and the window placements, which provided glimpses into Harrison's past as a young musician on the brink of skyrocketing fame. At the same time, the home was upgraded with contemporary comforts and conveniences to make it suitable for modern living. The auction, held at Liverpool's famous musical venue, the Cavern Club, attracted attention from Beatles fans across the country and even around the world, with bidding taking place online as well as in person. The ultimate winning bidder, Jackie Holmes, has expressed her excitement at owning such a significant piece of Beatles history, and her admiration for the band and George Harrison, in particular, is clear. Down the line, the renovated property could serve as a unique and historically significant vacation rental or even a small museum dedicated to George Harrison and the Beatles, attracting fans and tourists to the area. Its location in Liverpool, near other Beatles-related sites and attractions, makes it an ideal destination for those interested in learning more about the early days of the band and the place where they first started making music together. In the end, the sale of the childhood home of Beatles guitarist George Harrison not only allowed a dedicated fan to own a piece of music history but also created an opportunity to pass on the story of the band's origins and the importance of their work to future generations. The preservation and modernization of the property ensure that the home will remain a testament to the band's enduring legacy and will continue to contribute to Liverpool's rich musical heritage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Multi-choice problem: Choose from the options at the end, and answer how do you do this: What type of paint should I use to paint my valve cover? +You must use an engine enamel that is rated for high heat as the engine can reach temperatures over 200 degrees. +You must use an engine enamel that is rated for low heat as the engine can reach temperatures over 200 degrees.","completion":"To paint your valve cover, you should choose the option: \\"You must use an engine enamel that is rated for high heat as the engine can reach temperatures over 200 degrees.\\" Here's a detailed process on how to paint your valve cover using high-heat engine enamel: 1. Choose the right paint: Select a high-quality, high-heat engine enamel paint specifically designed to withstand the high temperatures your engine can reach. The paint should be rated to withstand temperatures up to 500°F (260°C) or more. It would be best to select a paint from a reputable brand to ensure its durability and longevity. High-heat engine enamel paints are available in spray cans, which make for easier, smoother application, and they come in various colors, so you can choose your desired look. 2. Prepare the surface: Proper surface preparation is essential for a long-lasting, durable finish. Start by removing the valve cover from the engine. Clean the valve cover thoroughly, removing dirt, grease, and oil. Use a degreaser to break down any remaining grime. Once clean, use a wire brush or sandpaper to remove any loose or flaking paint, rust, or corrosion. If the surface has pits or other imperfections, use a filler to fill those areas and sand them smooth. Wipe the valve cover down with a tack cloth or lint-free rag to remove any dust or debris. 3. Apply primer: Priming the surface before painting will help the paint adhere better and prevent rust from forming. Use a high-temperature primer rated for engine use. Apply a thin coat of primer following the manufacturer's instructions on the can. Allow the primer to dry thoroughly before moving on to the next step. Drying time will vary by product, so check the label for specific information. 4. Paint the valve cover: Shake the can of high-heat engine enamel paint well before use. Hold the can approximately 10-12 inches (25-30 cm) away from the valve cover and apply thin, even coats of paint. It's better to apply multiple light coats rather than one heavy coat, as this will prevent drips and runs. Allow each coat to dry for the time specified on the paint can before applying the next coat. Typically, 2-3 coats of paint will achieve the desired result. 5. Allow the paint to cure: Once you've applied the final coat of paint, let the valve cover cure for at least 24 hours or as recommended by the paint manufacturer. The paint will cure and harden during this period, providing a more durable and long-lasting finish. 6. Reinstall the valve cover: After the paint has fully cured, reinstall the valve cover on the engine. Be careful not to scratch the paint while reinstalling, and make sure the valve cover gasket is in good condition to prevent oil leaks. By following these steps and using high-heat engine enamel paint, you will achieve a durable and long-lasting finish on your valve cover. This will not only improve the appearance of your engine but also protect the valve cover from rust and corrosion."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Article: Wash and dry your face as usual, either over a sink or in the shower, and use warm to hot water to open your pores. It might be a good idea to use a gentle facial cleanser before applying this mask, especially if you have sensitive skin. Lemon juice can be harsh, and stressing your skin with too much abrasive material can do more harm than good. When your face is clean and dry, use your fingers to apply the lemon-honey mask all over the skin. Work carefully to avoid the eye area. This mask can cause stinging and irritation to the eyes. If you accidentally get it into your eyes, flush it out immediately with cool to lukewarm water for a full minute, or until the stinging stops. The mask can also be quite sticky, so it's a good idea to make sure hair is pulled back and out of the way before application. The wait time is important; if you rinse the mask off too quickly, the honey and lemon won't have enough time to do their work. Of course, if your skin starts to burn, itch, or otherwise feel uncomfortable, you should rinse the mask off immediately. It's possible that your skin is having a negative reaction to the mask if you experience these symptoms. When the waiting period ends, rinse the mask off your face using warm water. After finishing the warm water rinse, do a second rinse with cool water to close your pores. You can also wipe away the mask with a warm, slightly damp wash cloth. The wash cloth acts as a physical exfoliator. Use gentle patting motions when using this trick, however, to avoid irritating your skin. The exact frequency with which you apply the mask may vary depending on how sensitive or oily your skin is, but a good average is about once a week, either in the morning or evening. You can try applying the mask two to three times a week if you have notably oily or acne-prone skin, but cut back if you notice any redness, irritation, or increased amounts of acne.

Home hero Lewis Hamilton was dejected and apologetic after a mistake in qualifying but Silverstone rang with fans chanting his name as he fought back to win the British Grand Prix. His victory was won at the expense of his Mercedes teammate and title rival Nico Rosberg, who retired with a broken gearbox. The German had taken pole position and was leading at just over the halfway point before the pendulum of bad luck swung his way on lap 29. It was the first time Rosberg has retired this season while, in contrast, Hamilton had failed to cross the finish line twice. \\"Yesterday was a really difficult day,\\" Hamilton, who was knocked back to sixth on the grid after choosing to pit rather than finish a final timed lap in qualifying, told reporters at the historic Silverstone circuit. \\"You could say it was a real kick in the balls. I really had to pull up my socks and get on it. \\"I went away feeling terrible. I felt I really let the fans, the team and myself down. Determined Hamilton. \\"Coming back today to turn that emptiness around was really my priority. This weekend showed you never give up.\\" Hamilton's second British GP victory -- earned exactly six years after his fantastic 2008 win in the wet -- was not only about personal redemption, it was also about closing the gap in the F1 world championship. Luck has been on Rosberg's side at the previous three races, the 29-year-old winning in Monaco and Austria and finishing second in Canada. Hamilton's home win means he is now just four points behind Rosberg, who was still smiling as he chatted to reporters in the Mercedes motor home after the race. The Mercedes duo will now renew their rivalries at the German Grand Prix on 20 July -- and Mercedes chairman Niki Lauda, a three-time world champion himself, is predicting fireworks now Hamilton is back to his best. \\"Lewis from the beginning of the season was on a very good stable level and Nico after Monaco had everything going for him,\\" Lauda said. \\"But now Lewis is back on track so I tell you the next couple of races are going to be interesting. Highly motivated. \\"He is highly motivated and for me the most important thing is that this victory gives him a real push about his qualities, what he can achieve so there will be no ups-and-downs with him anymore. \\"Everything is reset like before. So they will fight until the end like you do not believe to be world champion. \\"It's interesting to watch now because they are exactly the same level.\\" Rosberg: Mercedes has not peaked yet. There was also a turnaround in fortune for the Williams team, who saw their cars start out of position after failing to choose the right tires in a rain-hit qualifying. Valterri Bottas hustled his way through the field with some impressive overtaking to finish a brilliant second in the car Susie Wolff had driven on Friday for four laps before it ground to halt with an engine problem. \\"We're on the right way,\\" said the Finn, who finished third last time out in Austria. \\"One step more to go. \\"You see how quick the car is. It was a pleasure to drive. I was able to go through the field. I'm really, really happy.\\" Fine third. Daniel Ricciardo finished third for Red Bull Racing, the same position his teammate Sebastian Vettel had started the race from. While the four-time world champion came in for fresh tires twice, Ricciardo switched to a one-stop strategy, which moved him onto the podium. \\"I didn't intend on doing a one-stop but we were able to keep the pace, so we stayed on and just held on at the end,\\" the Australian explained. \\"It was awesome. All three of us had a bit of redemption on our plate today. It was a pretty dismal Saturday for us so we're all pretty happy. This is definitely one of my best podiums this year.\\" A bit further down the road, Vettel found himself engaged in a thrilling duel with Ferrari's Fernando Alonso. Both drivers flexed their egos, complaining about each other's driving style on the pit-to-car radios but in the end Vettel swooped past Alonso for fifth place. Early incident. The dramatic race had been delayed for an hour after a crash involving Kimi Raikkonen's Ferrari on the opening lap. The Finn, who has had a difficult season since returning to the Italian team, lost control as he turned into the Wellington Straight. As he rejoined the track at speed, the car kicked out into repeated spins. The Finn plunged into the barriers on the right and then collided with Felipe Massa's Williams -- the damage enough to end the Brazilian's 200th grand prix in miserable fashion. The Ferrari spokesman told the media: \\"Kimi is OK. He obviously got a big hit. He only seems to be having some bruises to his ankle and a little bit on his knee.\\" The bruising 2014 championship continues at the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim in two week's time. Highlights:","completion":"1. Lewis Hamilton won the British Grand Prix after a mistake in qualifying. 2. His teammate, Nico Rosberg, retired with a broken gearbox. 3. Hamilton's win helped him close the gap in the F1 world championship. 4. Valterri Bottas finished second and Daniel Ricciardo finished third. 5.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. For many Americans, the financial crisis, and the recession it spawned, have been devastating -- jobs, homes, savings lost. Understandably, many people are calling for change. Yet change needs to be about creating a system that works better, not just differently. As a nation, our challenge is to design a system of financial oversight that will embody the lessons of the past two years and provide a robust framework for preventing future crises and the economic damage they cause. These matters are complex, and Congress is still in the midst of considering how best to reform financial regulation. I am concerned, however, that a number of the legislative proposals being circulated would significantly reduce the capacity of the Federal Reserve to perform its core functions. Notably, some leading proposals in the Senate would strip the Fed of all its bank regulatory powers. And a House committee recently voted to repeal a 1978 provision that was intended to protect monetary policy from short-term political influence. These measures are very much out of step with the global consensus on the appropriate role of central banks, and they would seriously impair the prospects for economic and financial stability in the United States. The Fed played a major part in arresting the crisis, and we should be seeking to preserve, not degrade, the institution's ability to foster financial stability and to promote economic recovery without inflation. The proposed measures are at least in part the product of public anger over the financial crisis and the government's response, particularly the rescues of some individual financial firms. The government's actions to avoid financial collapse last fall -- as distasteful and unfair as some undoubtedly were -- were unfortunately necessary to prevent a global economic catastrophe that could have rivaled the Great Depression in length and severity, with profound consequences for our economy and society. (I know something about this, having spent my career prior to public service studying these issues.) My colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I were determined not to allow that to happen. Moreover, looking to the future, we strongly support measures -- including the development of a special bankruptcy regime for financial firms whose disorderly failure would threaten the integrity of the financial system -- to ensure that ad hoc interventions of the type we were forced to use last fall never happen again. Adopting such a resolution regime, together with tougher oversight of large, complex financial firms, would make clear that no institution is \\"too big to fail\\" -- while ensuring that the costs of failure are borne by owners, managers, creditors and the financial services industry, not by taxpayers. The Federal Reserve, like other regulators around the world, did not do all that it could have to constrain excessive risk-taking in the financial sector in the period leading up to the crisis. We have extensively reviewed our performance and moved aggressively to fix the problems. Working with other agencies, we have toughened our rules and oversight. We will be requiring banks to hold more capital and liquidity and to structure compensation packages in ways that limit excessive risk-taking. We are taking more explicit account of risks to the financial system as a whole. We are also supplementing bank examination staffs with teams of economists, financial market specialists and other experts. This combination of expertise, a unique strength of the Fed, helped bring credibility and clarity to the \\"stress tests\\" of the banking system conducted in the spring. These tests were led by the Fed and marked a turning point in public confidence in the banking system. There is a strong case for a continued role for the Federal Reserve in bank supervision. Because of our role in making monetary policy, the Fed brings unparalleled economic and financial expertise to its oversight of banks, as demonstrated by the success of the stress tests. This expertise is essential for supervising highly complex financial firms and for analyzing the interactions among key firms and markets. Our supervision is also informed by the grass-roots perspective derived from the Fed's unique regional structure and our experience in supervising community banks. At the same time, our ability to make effective monetary policy and to promote financial stability depends vitally on the information, expertise and authorities we gain as bank supervisors, as demonstrated in episodes such as the 1987 stock market crash and the financial disruptions of Sept. 11, 2001, as well as by the crisis of the past two years. Of course, the ultimate goal of all our efforts is to restore and sustain economic prosperity. To support economic growth, the Fed has cut interest rates aggressively and provided further stimulus through lending and asset-purchase programs. Our ability to take such actions without engendering sharp increases in inflation depends heavily on our credibility and independence from short-term political pressures. Many studies have shown that countries whose central banks make monetary policy independently of such political influence have better economic performance, including lower inflation and interest rates. Independent does not mean unaccountable. In its making of monetary policy, the Fed is highly transparent, providing detailed minutes of policy meetings and regular testimony before Congress, among other information. Our financial statements are public and audited by an outside accounting firm; we publish our balance sheet weekly; and we provide monthly reports with extensive information on all the temporary lending facilities developed during the crisis. Congress, through the Government Accountability Office, can and does audit all parts of our operations except for the monetary policy deliberations and actions covered by the 1978 exemption. The general repeal of that exemption would serve only to increase the perceived influence of Congress on monetary policy decisions, which would undermine the confidence the public and the markets have in the Fed to act in the long-term economic interest of the nation. We have come a long way in our battle against the financial and economic crisis, but there is a long way to go. Now more than ever, America needs a strong, nonpolitical and independent central bank with the tools to promote financial stability and to help steer our economy to recovery without inflation. The writer is chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. ||||| By Kevin Drawbaugh WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator Bernie Sanders said on Sunday he will not vote to reconfirm Ben Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve, in a preview of the rough treatment Bernanke may get this week on Capitol Hill. The central bank chief will testify on Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee at a hearing on his nomination to a second four-year term. The session could be difficult, with the Fed under fire from across the political spectrum. The open opposition of Sanders, an independent outside the political mainstream, is unlikely alone to derail Bernanke's renomination. But it reflects the Fed's challenges. \\"I absolutely will not vote for Mr. Bernanke. He is part of the problem,\\" Sanders said on ABC's \\"This Week\\" TV program. Bernanke \\"didn't ... do anything to prevent us from sinking into this disaster that Wall Street caused and which he was a part of,\\" Sanders said, referring to last year's severe financial crisis and the deep recession that followed. Under Bernanke's leadership, the Fed has greatly expanded its role in the economy, moving beyond its core monetary policy function to financing emergency bailouts of major financial firms in an attempt to stem the capital markets crisis. Along the way, the Fed has drawn sharp criticism from skeptical lawmakers, some of whom are now moving to check the Fed's power and expose its decisions to greater scrutiny. In a more tempered assessment of Bernanke's record, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told the ABC that the Fed chief has done a good job and has made bold decisions \\"that kept the economy from going into a depression.\\" But, he added, \\"We need more transparency and accountability ... The Fed needs to be looked at closely.\\" In an unusual move, Bernanke on Friday spoke out in a column in The Washington Post against attempts to strip the Fed of some of its regulatory responsibilities and to expose it to audits by a congressional watchdog. Such steps would \\"impair the prospects for economic and financial stability in the United States,\\" he said. A proposal to audit the Fed's monetary policy deliberations won a committee vote earlier this month over the objections of House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd is the author of a proposal to consign the Fed solely to making decisions about setting benchmark interest rates, stripping it of bank supervision and consumer protection duties. Frank has said the audit provision in the House is likely to be revisited as legislation comes up for floor action. Dodd has said his proposal is a starting point for debate.

Los Angeles (CNN) -- A prominent California Democrat campaign fund manager charged with defrauding a state legislator of 677,181 is in settlement negotiations with federal prosecutors, a law enforcement source said Tuesday. Kinde Durkee, whose Durkee & Associates firm is based in Burbank, California, has been charged with two counts of mail fraud regarding the alleged misappropriation of 677,181 in campaign funds belonging to California Assemblyman Jose Solorio, a Democrat whose office is based in Anaheim, authorities said. The law enforcement source asked for anonymity because the source wasn't authorized to speak publicly about the negotiations. Durkee is accused of filing false disclosure reports to hide the misappropriations, according to an affidavit by FBI Agent Reginald Coleman. Durkee, who appears to have signature authority over more than 400 bank accounts, including those for political campaigns, allegedly moved \\"substantial\\" sums of money from client campaign committees to her firm's accounts or other campaign accounts, Coleman said in the affidavit. Durkee also allegedly spent funds from clients' accounts to make her firm's payroll and to pay for her mortgage, her American Express bill, her mother's assisted living facility expenses and other personal expenses, Coleman's affidavit said. In an interview with the FBI on September 1, \\"Ms. Durkee admitted that she had been misappropriating her clients' money for years, and that forms she filed with the state were false,\\" Coleman wrote.

Read this: Charlemagne planned to continue the Frankish tradition of dividing his kingdom between all his heirs, but was unable to do so as only one son, Louis the Pious (r. 814–840), was still alive by 813. Just before Charlemagne died in 814, he crowned Louis as his successor. Louis's reign of 26 years was marked by numerous divisions of the empire among his sons and, after 829, civil wars between various alliances of father and sons over the control of various parts of the empire. Eventually, Louis recognised his eldest son Lothair I (d. 855) as emperor and gave him Italy. Louis divided the rest of the empire between Lothair and Charles the Bald (d. 877), his youngest son. Lothair took East Francia, comprising both banks of the Rhine and eastwards, leaving Charles West Francia with the empire to the west of the Rhineland and the Alps. Louis the German (d. 876), the middle child, who had been rebellious to the last, was allowed to keep Bavaria under the suzerainty of his elder brother. The division was disputed. Pepin II of Aquitaine (d. after 864), the emperor's grandson, rebelled in a contest for Aquitaine, while Louis the German tried to annex all of East Francia.

Question: For many of us, cartoon strips are simply one of our pastimes. The popular Japanese manga provides us with an escape from reality into a world of fantasy, adventure and romance.With much less text and pictures running for pages, it fits perfectly into today's fast, throwing away city lifestyle. But Tsai Chih-chung,a famous Taiwanese illustrator , doesn't agree.He believes cartoons can be a bridge connecting traditional Chinese culture and wisdom with the modern world in a much wittier and more acceptable way. He has interpreted Lao Zi, Confucius, Mencius,Zhuang Zi and Sun Zi and made their works accessible to a global audience. He has also produced two books about Zen , introducing oriental philosophy. His cartoons are humorous yet full of wisdom and are admired as an easy way to learn Chinese classics. After avoiding the public for ten years, Tsai made a comeback in late April with seven new works. But does his age, 61, work as a gap between him and his young readers? Tsai doesn't think so. The topics he has covered range from philosophy in a time of individuality to the learning and memorizing techniques used at school. \\"Every child is a genius and has the potential beyond his own imagination, \\" he said. If popular Japanese manga is purely for entertainment, Tsai's work, to a large extent, is to light the power of thinking in a light-hearted way. Tsai uses differenr forms of water to refer to people. In his eyes some people are like an ocean, some are like vapor, while others may be ice or rain. But in essence they share a similarity-human being's forever chasing for the true and the good. \\"The person who thinks over life issues is not necessarily a scholar or a philosopher,\\" he said. \\"I've dedicated my whole life to thinking and individual freedom, not making a living.\\" Compared to Japanese manga, Tsai's works are _ A) mainly designed for a pure time killer for all B) more popular with young readers in China now C) to inspire people to think in a cheerful way D) much more interesting and instructive Answer:","completion":"C) to inspire people to think in a cheerful way Justifying Step-by-Step: 1.

He does this in a way that is cheerful and engaging, using water in its various forms as metaphors for people. 4.

Uber briefly charged its users in downtown Sydney a minimum 100 to escape an armed hostage crisis, a result of automatic surge pricing meant to get more drivers online. An executive in the city's Central Business District (CBD) sent Mashable screenshots of the Uber app that showed the company was charging up to four-times the normal rate because \\"demand is off the charts.\\" Price surging was implemented in Sydney, Australia on Dec. 15th, 2014, during a hostage siege in the CBD. Image: Mashable \\"I have never, ever seen it at four-times [the normal rate] and I'm a 1% top Uber user,\\" said Matthew Leung, the user in contact with Mashable. \\"I understand the way the business works — higher the demand, higher the charge — but four-times at 100 minimum is ridiculous. Almost price gouging at its worst.\\" Another customer shared a screenshot of their \\"wack\\" fare estimate that showed a trip from an area just blocks from the siege to the airport would cost 145-185. That journey would normally cost less than 100, according to Uber's website. \\"This is price surging,\\" he wrote in a comment to Mashable. After Mashable published a story on the price hikes, the company reversed course and announced that all riders in the area would be free, and that anybody who had been charged the higher amount would be refunded. \\"We are all concerned with the events happening in Sydney,\\" Uber spokesperson Katie Curran told Mashable in a statement. \\"Uber Sydney will be providing free rides out of the CBD to help Sydneysiders get home safely.\\" Image: Uber Any riders who were charged the higher amount may email supportsydney@uber.com to get their refund, she said, adding that surge pricing only remains in place to encourage more drivers to come online and pick up passengers from the area.

Police have evacuated most of the area. Following the police evacuation, many locals have reported difficulty in finding transportation as they attempt to exit the area. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick had previously said the company's pricing algorithms will be \\"capped\\" during situations like what's unfolding in downtown Sydney. \\"For each market, the state of emergency price will be set after excluding the 3 highest-priced, non-emergency days of the preceding 2 months,\\" he said, adding that the policy \\"intends to strike the careful balance between the goal of transportation availability with community expectations of affordability during disasters.\\" Last July, New York's attorney general announced that Uber agreed to put a cap on prices during “abnormal disruptions of the market,” meaning natural disasters and emergencies, to comply with the state's price gouging regulations.

Earlier Mr Abbott said: \\"Australia is a peaceful, open and generous society - nothing should ever change that and that's why I would urge all Australians today to go about their business as usual.\\" Senior police officers say they are on a footing \\"consistent with a terrorist event\\".

Witnesses saw a man with a bag and gun walk into the Lindt chocolate shop and cafe. Lindt said about 10 employees and 30 customers were thought to be inside at the time. Nearby offices were evacuated and police asked people to remain indoors and away from open windows. The BBC's Jon Donnison in Sydney says an enormous police operation is in place, on a scale few Sydney residents will have seen.

Two more people followed about an hour later. It is not clear whether they escaped or were released. New South Wales Police deputy commissioner Catherine Burn said: \\"Those people are now being assessed to make sure their health is okay and then police will talk to them.\\" \\"Our approach is to resolve this peacefully. It might take a bit of time but that is our priority,\\" she added.

News organisations also say the suspect has contacted them to issue demands, which police have urged media not to report. Channel 7, a broadcaster with offices facing the cafe, said lights inside the premises were turned out as night fell. At the scene: Wendy Frew, BBC News, Sydney The atmosphere in Martin Place itself was surreal. Office workers who had been evacuated from their buildings, construction workers from building sites and tourists packed the pedestrian plaza one block away from the Lindt coffee shop. Rosemary D'Urso Healion had just come out of the Martin Place subway station and was walking to her office when she saw that it was blocked by police. Then she saw the police close down the subway station. \\"I work in that building [where the siege is taking place] and I was just about to go in,\\" she told the BBC, adding that she had been in contact with some of her colleagues who were in the building but not being held hostage. She remained at Martin Place anxiously watching a police operation that appeared to be aimed at getting some of her colleagues out via a ladder erected on a window ledge on the first floor. Uneasy crowds in Sydney Eyewitnesses speak to the BBC Image copyright AFP Image caption A man wearing a bandana and a backpack was seen inside the cafe Image copyright AFP Image caption Hundreds of heavily armed police are surrounding the building An armed man wearing a backpack and a bandana could be seeing walking around inside the cafe. TV footage showed at least three people, thought to be employees and who were visibly distressed, holding up to the window a black flag bearing the declaration of Islamic faith, which reads: \\"There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger.\\" The flag is similar to those used by jihadist groups, but is different from the one used by Islamic State militants in the Middle East. Martin Place is home to the state premier's office and the headquarters of major banks. In September Australia - which has sent fighter jets to join the US-led coalition conducting air strikes against Islamic State in Iraq - carried out a big anti-terror raid. One man was charged with plotting to behead a member of the public in Martin Place. In October, new anti-terrorism laws, including a provision designed to stop Australians fighting in overseas conflicts, were approved by the Australian parliament. The black flag Image copyright Reuters A black flag bearing the white Arabic text of the \\"shahada\\", the basic statement of the Islamic faith, is used by jihadist groups worldwide The statement says: \\"There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger\\" A black flag was the battle flag of the Prophet Muhammad and was carried into battle by many of his companions Today, it is used as a symbol of engagement in jihad, in the sense of holy war, by militant groups including al-Qaeda and Islamic State Islamic State's banner - unlike the flag raised in the window of the coffee shop - bears the first part of the shahada and the seal of the Prophet below it. Timeline: Australia's terror threat ||||| Summary:","completion":"The article discusses an incident that took place in Sydney, Australia in December 2014, where Uber was criticized for implementing surge pricing during a hostage crisis situation in the Central Business District (CBD). In a bid to encourage more drivers to enter the area, Uber initially increased its fares by four times the normal rate. The decision sparked controversy, as users complained about high charges, with some accusing the company of price gouging. Following negative backlash, Uber reversed its decision and announced that all rides in the area would be offered for free. The company also promised to refund those who were charged the higher fare. The representative for Uber Sydney, Katie Curran, stated that surge pricing was established to motivate drivers to pick up passengers in the area but acknowledged the challenges brought about by the situation. At the time, there was little information about the perpetrator undertaking the hostage crisis in a downtown Sydney cafe, with speculations suggesting that it could be a terrorist attack, considering the Islamic flag displayed in the cafe window. The situation led to difficulties in finding transportation out of the area, for which Uber sought to provide a solution. Uber CEO, Travis Kalanick, had previously mentioned that the company's pricing would be capped during emergencies. The policy sought to maintain a balance between transportation availability and affordability during crises. A similar cap had been put in place in New York during “abnormal disruptions of the market,” in compliance with state's price gouging regulations, but it remained unclear whether such an agreement was established in Australia. Uber had commenced its operations in Australia in October 2012."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What paras were surprised to find themselves jumping into a chest-deep swamp? ? The third Chinook carried half of the enhanced A Company group from 1 PARA to Magbeni. The helicopter hovered low above the landing zone that had been identified by the second SAS observation team and the paras jumped from the rear ramp. The observation team had warned that the ground was wet but had been unable to determine the depth of the water, so the paras were surprised to find themselves jumping into a chest-deep swamp. The majority of the first group immediately waded through the swamp to get to the nearby tree line and from there to the village, but a small party tasked with securing the landing zone had to wait in the swamp for the Chinook to pick up the remaining members of the company group and return to insert them at the landing zone.The returning Chinook, carrying the remainder of the A Company group including second-in-command (2IC) Captain Danny Matthews, came under fire from a heavy machine gun in Magbeni, which was promptly strafed by one of the 657 Squadron Lynx helicopters until it ceased firing. The soldiers in Matthews' helicopter exited and joined the first half of the company group on the ground. As the company group moved forward, an explosion—possibly a mortar fired by the British fire support group—injured seven men, including company commander Major Matthew Lowe, one of the platoon commanders, a signaller, and two of Lowe's headquarters staff. Another signaller radioed in a casualty report, and one of the Chinooks en route to Gberi Bana to extract the Royal Irish (who had just been freed by the SAS) landed on the track through the village. The casualties were loaded onto the helicopter, which then picked up the Royal Irish and flew to RFA Sir Percivale where all 13 men were assessed by medics.The operation continued under the leadership of Matthews, the company 2IC, who had taken command almost immediately after the company commander was wounded. Under his command, each of the platoons assaulted a different cluster of buildings to which they had been assigned during training on...

Q:I read this background article the other day: The advantage of asexual reproduction is that it can be very quick and does not require the meeting of a male and female organism. The disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that organisms do not receive a mix of traits from both parents. An organism that is born through asexual reproduction only has the DNA from the one parent. In fact, the offspring is genetically an exact copy of the parent. This can cause problems for the individual. For example, if the parent has a gene that causes a particular disease, the offspring will also have the gene that causes that disease. Organisms produced sexually may or may not inherit the disease gene because they receive a mix of their parents' genes. I am facing a new situation today: A species of animal called a markalong was discovered that can reproduce either sexually or asexually. Two markalongs were just born from different families in a zoo. The first markalong, animal A, has only one parent. The second markalong, animal B, has two parents. Although they used different forms of sexual reproduction, both animals are healthy and doing well at the zoo. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which markalong was produced asexually? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article, the markalong that was produced asexually would be animal A. This is because animal A has only one parent, which aligns with the concept of asexual reproduction, where offspring are genetically identical to the single parent and do not receive a mix of traits from both a male and female organism. In contrast, animal B has two parents, which suggests that it was produced through sexual reproduction, involving the combination of genetic material from both parents."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Select from the following. (1). unaffected (2). embarrassed (3). thoughtful The answer is:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it seems that Austin could be best described as (1) unaffected. If he upset the cashier and did not apologize or make amends, this suggests that he might not have been concerned about the impact of his actions on the cashier. An unaffected person is less likely to show signs of being emotionally influenced or disturbed, indicating that they may not be sensitive to the feelings of others in certain situations. While it is not possible to provide a complete assessment of Austin's character based on this single incident, his behavior in this instance would lean towards being unaffected. An embarrassed person (option 2) would typically display signs of discomfort or self-consciousness after upsetting someone, and might be more likely to apologize or seek to make amends. In this case, Austin did not demonstrate such behavior, so it may not be an accurate description. A thoughtful person (option 3) generally takes the feelings of others into consideration and would likely attempt to apologize or make amends after upsetting someone. Since Austin did not exhibit these traits in this particular situation, it may not be an accurate descriptor.

Brad, Texas (CNN) -- Authorities were working on plans Friday for residents who were forced to flee a wildfire in northern Texas to return home, a day after firefighters made progress battling the blaze that destroyed dozens of homes. The blaze in Palo Pinto County scorched 6,200 acres by Thursday, according to the Texas Forest Service. The fire is burning near the resort of Possum Kingdom Lake, near the town of Brad, about 100 miles west of Dallas. \\"We feel much better about this fire today,\\" as the blaze is now 50% contained, said John Nichols, a spokesman for the Forest Service. He said evacuations were lifted for some residents forced to evacuate the fire, which was driven by high temperatures and dry winds. The wildfire has destroyed 40 homes and nine RVs since it began Tuesday, the Forest Service said Thursday. Firefighters were receiving support from aerial tankers and helicopters. Authorities are mapping out plans to allow residents to return to their homes, said Palo Pinto County Sheriff Ira Mercer. Authorities also are trying to open the lake for the Labor Day holiday, he said. On Wednesday, evacuations were ordered in several communities on the north side of the lake after the fire charged over a ridge and approached a dam on the lake, CNN affiliate WFAA reported. The wildfire was moving so fast that the Forest Service pulled out of its command observation post, telling journalists and onlookers to get out of the way of the fire. \\"My house is right through here, though it may be gone,\\" Tom Hardeston told WFAA as he watched the fire.

What type of law defines \\"states\\", and their role in an Exclusive Economic Zone? Answer:","completion":"The type of law that defines \\"states\\" and their role in an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is international maritime law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). UNCLOS is a comprehensive international treaty that governs various aspects of maritime affairs, including the rights and responsibilities of states with respect to their use of the world's oceans. The Convention was adopted in 1982 and has been widely recognized as a key component of the international legal framework governing ocean affairs. In UNCLOS, \\"states\\" are defined as sovereign countries that are recognized by the international community as having the rights and responsibilities associated with statehood. States are the primary subjects of international law, and they possess unique rights and responsibilities for their territories, maritime zones, and the international areas of the oceans. Specifically, under UNCLOS, states have the responsibility to preserve and protect the marine environment, undertake scientific research, conserve living resources, and promote the peaceful use of oceans, among other duties. An Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is a maritime zone prescribed by UNCLOS, extending up to 200 nautical miles from a state's baseline, which is usually the low-water line along its coast. Within its EEZ, a coastal state has special rights regarding the exploration, exploitation, conservation, and management of natural resources, both living and non-living, in the water column and on or under the seabed. It is important to note that the EEZ does not encompass the territorial sea, which extends up to 12 nautical miles from the baseline, where a state exercises full sovereignty. The role of states in an Exclusive Economic Zone is primarily governed by Articles 55 to 75 of UNCLOS. Within their EEZ, states have the sovereign rights to explore, exploit, conserve, and manage the natural resources, both living and non-living. This includes the seabed, subsoil, and superjacent waters, as well as the control of other activities such as marine scientific research and the protection and preservation of the marine environment. Moreover, states have specific responsibilities to cooperate with other states and regional or international organizations to ensure the sustainable management of fish stocks and to protect and preserve the marine environment. They must also promote the objective of the optimum utilization of living resources in the EEZ and prevent over-exploitation. In this context, coastal states are required to establish total allowable catches and implement conservation measures, taking into account the best scientific evidence available. It is important to note that the rights and responsibilities of states in their EEZs are subject to some limitations established by UNCLOS. For example, other states enjoy the right of freedom of navigation and overflight, as well as the right to lay submarine cables and pipelines, subject to certain conditions. Additionally, Article 58 recognizes the rights and duties of other states in the EEZ, provided that they are exercised \\"in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Convention.\\" In conclusion, international maritime law, encapsulated in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, defines \\"states\\" and their role in Exclusive Economic Zones. It provides a comprehensive legal framework that governs the rights, responsibilities, and limitations of states in the management of resources, environmental protection, and other activities in their EEZs, as well as the rights and duties of other states in this maritime zone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Rule of law: Despite wide use by politicians, judges and academics, the rule of law has been described as \\"an exceedingly elusive notion\\". Among modern legal theorists, one finds that at least two principal conceptions of the rule of law can be identified: a formalist or \\"thin\\" definition, and a substantive or \\"thick\\" definition; one occasionally encounters a third \\"functional\\" conception. Formalist definitions of the rule of law do not make a judgment about the \\"justness\\" of law itself, but define specific procedural attributes that a legal framework must have in order to be in compliance with the rule of law.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Sometimes the best advice doesn't come from a book, a microphone, from behind a desk in Washington or even from the people who are the leaders in their fields. Sometimes the best life lessons are found deep in the roots of where we came from. My father passed away years ago, but I always remember the lessons he taught me. Three of them particularly shape my perspective day after day. The first one is that little things make big things happen. To the best of my memory, when I was young, we needed to build a new shed. Those were the days when stores like Home Depot and Lowes didn't exist. Brand-new timber was expensive, so folks often reused the materials that others in the community didn't need. That summer, Dad and I used the boards from an old abandoned barn. We pulled them down one by one, drew the nails out and took off the tin and straightened it in order to reuse it. We got our supplies back to our yard and got to work. I don't know how much of a help I really was, but I chose to stay beside Dad the entire period, working along with him. The sun was hot that day, and sweat formed and ran down our faces. I stood there and handed him the nails one by one, which were hammered into that shed. Dad made me feel proud of my work. Even though I just handed him the nails, he repeatedly emphasized how we built the new shed \\"together\\". He taught me that when you're willing to do hard work, even in little things, big things come together. The second one is that we should honor our promises. As a young man, my father always carried a pocket-sized Bible in his chest pocket.

Alligators are large, semi-aquatic reptiles that inhabit freshwater environments such as marshes, swamps, and rivers. They are native to two regions in the world: the southeastern United States (American alligator) and the Yangtze River basin in China (Chinese alligator). Marshlands provide alligators with ideal living conditions, as these areas typically have slow-moving water and abundant vegetation that offer protection, basking areas, and nesting sites. Alligators are carnivorous and have a varied diet that includes fish, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. In marshlands, where there's an ample supply of fish, alligators benefit from the abundance of this food source. They use their lightning-fast reflexes and powerful jaws to catch and consume fish in their natural habitat, making them excellent predators. To provide more context, here's a brief comparison with the other organisms mentioned: 1. A tree: Trees are autotrophic, which means they produce their own food through the process of photosynthesis and do not consume other organisms as a food source. Consequently, a tree would not be able to eat fish, and most trees cannot survive in marshy environments. 2. A whale: Whales are marine mammals that live exclusively in oceanic environments. They consume various marine organisms such as fish, krill, and squid but would not be found in marshlands. Marshes typically have shallow, brackish water, which is unsuitable for the whale's size, feeding habits, and ecological requirements. 3. A warthog: Warthogs are omnivorous mammals native to Africa. They primarily live in savanna and grassland habitats and feed on grasses, roots, bulbs, tubers, insects, and small vertebrates. Although they may occasionally consume fish if they come across one, warthogs are not known for inhabiting marshland and relying on fish as their primary food source. In conclusion, out of the four organisms listed, an alligator best fits the description of an organism that would eat fish and live in marshland. Their natural diet consists of diverse prey, including fish, and they are well-adapted to live in marshy environments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize: From July, police will be able to issue £100 fines and three points for careless driving offences that would currently have to go to court. The idea is to target offenders without the need for lengthy court procedures. Current fixed penalties for using a phone while driving or not wearing a seatbelt will also rise by £40 to £100. The move brings careless driving offences into line with the penalties for similar non-motoring fixed penalties. Drivers will still be able to appeal against any decision through the courts. People guilty of careless driving will face fixed penalties or the chance to go on a driving course, but the more serious examples will continue to go through the courts, where offenders could face much higher fines and penalties. Many offences currently go unpunished because of the bureaucracy involved in taking a case to court. By Richard WestcottBBC transport correspondent The Department of Transport has not yet released official guidance on which types of driving will attract fines. But police are expected to focus on situations involving slightly aggressive and inconsiderate driving, such as: Not only does a motorist have to be stopped by the police, but a summons has to be issued and evidence presented in court. Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: \\"Careless drivers are a menace and their negligence puts innocent people's lives at risk. \\"That is why we are making it easier for the police to tackle problem drivers by allowing them to immediately issue a fixed penalty notice rather than needing to take every offender to court.\\" The AA said responsible drivers would welcome the changes. \\"We are also pleased to see that at long last new powers and fines will be given to the police to tackle the top three pet hates of drivers - tailgaters, mobile phone abusers and middle lane hogs,\\" said AA president Edmund King. RAC Foundation director Professor Stephen Glaister said: \\"Anti-social behaviour is as big a problem on the roads as it is in wider society. \\"Giving police more discretion to act, and freeing up resources to allow them to do so by cutting procedural delays in court, is good news. \\"Raising the fine level to £100 is justifiable to tackle the plague of handheld mobile phone use which slows drivers' reaction times even more than being at the drink-drive limit or taking cannabis.\\" But the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) said it had concerns about the message sent out by the changes. Its director of policy Neil Grieg said: \\"This is a major change in traffic law enforcement and the IAM is concerned that issuing fixed penalty tickets for careless driving downplays the seriousness of the offence. \\"Careless covers a wide range of poor to reckless driving behaviour that often merits further investigation. \\"This could free up traffic police time and allow them to maintain a higher profile. \\"But without traffic cops out on the road to enforce this new approach it will have little impact on road safety.\\" Motoring journalist Quentin Willson also questioned whether there would be enough traffic police to make the changes work. He said: \\"It's broadly to be welcomed because it marks a shift away from remote policing - that's cameras - to actually using traffic cops. \\"But the problem is the amount of traffic police cars has been cut since 1997 by 50%, so the obvious question is 'how do you enforce this?' It's deeply faulted.\\" Richard Owen from the research group Road Safety Analysis said most motorists would welcome the changes. He told the BBC: \\"We already know that the UK's motorways are some of the safest roads in the country, if not Europe. \\"But of course, that relies on everybody playing their part and sticking to the rules and I think most motorists would welcome any further enforcement to make sure that people aren't lane hogging or maybe tailgating.\\" Summary:","completion":"Starting from July, UK police will have the authority to issue £100 fines and add three points for careless driving offences that previously required court intervention. The objective of this change is to target offenders without involving lengthy court procedures. The fixed penalties for using a phone while driving or not wearing a seatbelt will also increase by £40 to £100. While this move aligns careless driving offences with penalties for similar non-motoring fixed penalties, drivers will still have the option to appeal any decision through the courts. Serious cases will continue to go through the courts, where offenders may face higher fines and penalties. This initiative is expected to address many offences that currently do not result in punishment due to the time-consuming nature of court processes. Although the Department of Transport has not provided official guidance on the types of driving that will be subject to such fines, the focus is likely to be on slightly aggressive and inconsiderate driving situations. The AA and RAC Foundation support these changes, while the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) expressed concerns that the fixed penalty tickets for careless driving might downplay the severity of the offence."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Next question: what key is jeremy by pearl jam in?","completion":"\\"Jeremy\\" is a song by the American rock band Pearl Jam from their debut album \\"Ten\\" released in 1991. The song is primarily written in the key of A Major. The track's introduction features an arpeggiated riff that utilizes notes predominantly from the A Major scale. The verses of the song contain chord progressions that are also typical for a song structured in A Major, involving. The chorus of the song shifts to the relative minor key, F# minor, but still belongs to the key of A Major due to both keys sharing the same key signature. However, it is important to note that while analyzing music, the key of a song can sometimes be subjective depending on different elements of the track. For example, some may interpret a song as being in a different key due to the usage of borrowed chords, modal interchange, or other varying harmonic devices employed within a song. But most music theory based analysis of \\"Jeremy\\" would support the song being in the key of A Major. Another notable aspect is Eddie Vedder's vocal performance in the song. Vedder's range in this song distinctly influences its melodic contour and thereby could affect how one perceives the key. However, it generally stays within the confines of the song's main key. Moreover, the song also carries intense emotional moments that tremendously rise and fall, which further enhances the overall dynamism of the song. Nevertheless, regardless of these shifts in emotional intensity and sometimes the tonality, the song returns to and concludes on the key of A Major consolidating the overall structural foundation of the song. In conclusion, \\"Jeremy\\" by Pearl Jam is in the key of A Major with elements of relative minor F# minor. It shows a skilled use of traditional harmonic composition techniques and some creative approaches to creating a compelling narrative through music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as \\"chicks?\\" is inside the article: Many critics have noted the extraordinary development of Dylan's songwriting immediately after completing his first album. One of Dylan's biographers Clinton Heylin connects the sudden increase in lyrics written along topical and political lines to the fact that Dylan had moved into an apartment on West 4th Street with his girlfriend Suze Rotolo in January 1962. Rotolo's family had strong left-wing political commitments; both of her parents were members of the American Communist Party. Dylan acknowledged her influence when he told an interviewer: \\"Suze was into this equality-freedom thing long before I was. I checked out the songs with her.\\"Dylan's relationship with Rotolo also provided an important emotional dynamic in the composition of the Freewheelin' album. After six months of living with Dylan, Rotolo agreed to her mother's proposal that she travel to Italy to study art. Dylan missed her and wrote long letters to her conveying his hope that she would return soon to New York. She postponed her return several times, finally coming back in January 1963. Critics have connected the intense love songs expressing longing and loss on Freewheelin' to Dylan's fraught relationship with Rotolo. In her autobiography, Rotolo explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as \\"chicks\\", and she resented being regarded as \\"a possession of Bob, who was the center of attention\\".The speed and facility with which Dylan wrote topical songs attracted the attention of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on WBAI in June 1962, Pete Seeger described Dylan as \\"the most prolific songwriter on the scene\\" and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently. Dylan replied, \\"I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot of stuff. In fact, I wrote five songs last night but I gave all the papers away in some place called the Bitter End.\\" Dylan also expressed the impersonal idea that the songs were not his own creation.

Please answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who planned to work with his longtime librettist? Answer the above question based on the context below: The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\" Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's...

Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: 2018 is a congressional election year in the United States, and President Donald Trump is urging his supporters to get motivated to vote as both parties prepare for November. \\"The people who voted for us become complacent a little bit, they are happy,\\" Trump told supporters during a recent speech on tax reform in Cincinnati. \\"They sort of take it for granted, they sit back and then they get clobbered because the other people are desperate and they get out, and they have more energy.\\" Trump predicted that Republicans will do better than expected in November when all 435 seats in the House of Representatives are at stake and 34 of the 100 Senate seats. \\"I think because of what we've done, because of the tremendous success we've had, I have a feeling that we are going to do incredibly well in '18, and I have to say this, history is not on our side,\\" he said. The president is right. History is not on his side. Midterms are typically unkind to the president's party, which on average loses about 30 House seats and a handful of Senate seats. The losses are worse if the president's approval rating is below 50 percent, which could be the case this year. Trump's approval rating has ticked up in recent weeks, but the average has him just above 40 percent, not a strong position with a midterm looming. \\"You know, you have a very unpopular president. And if Democrats take a broad path, they should win lots and lots of seats,\\" said Jim Kessler of Third Way, a center-left advocacy and research organization. Gallup has noted historically that presidents with an approval rating above 50 percent lose an average of 14 House seats in midterms, while those below 40 percent can expect to lose about 36 seats. Democrats need to gain 24 seats in the House and two seats in the Senate to regain the majority in both chambers. Question: Why was the student protesting?

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Another common source for humidity in a basement is external water, which can come from precipitation or groundwater. Gutters are designed to collect precipitation and move the water away from your house, but they have to be free of debris to work properly.Clean your gutters every spring and fall to remove leaves, dirt, pinecones, and other matter that could clog the spouts. When gutters become clogged, water builds up inside and drips over the edges. The water then collects around the base of your house, and may seep in through the foundation. Sump pumps, which are found in the basement or bottom floor of the house, should be inspected annually. Check that the pump is in good working order, that the pump is upright, and that it’s properly pumping water away from the house. A sump pump system collects water from around the foundation of the house, drains it into a sump pit, and then pumps the water away from the house. In order to perform this task, the sump system has to be properly cleaned and maintained. Not all houses have sump pumps. If you're not sure, check your basement for the sump pit, which is a large reservoir dug into the floor to collect water. Some basements just have a dirt floor, and water vapor can easily enter the basement through the soil. To prevent this from happening, cover the floor with sheets of 6-millimeter plastic. Overlap the seams of the plastic to prevent moisture from getting through, and attach the plastic to the walls with tape or staples. Holes, cracks, and other openings in the foundation are easy ways for moisture to enter your basement. Small holes can be repaired with a polyurethane masonry caulk, but you should use hydraulic cement to fix larger holes. Typically, you can address a small crack in the foundation as long as it’s vertical. Call in a professional if the crack is horizontal, diagonal, or growing, or if you want it assessed by an expert. The foundation is the structure on which your house is built, so it’s always best to consult an expert if you're unsure of a problem. Most foundation material is porous, including concrete and stone. This means water can seep into your basement through the foundation. There are several products you can apply to your basement walls to make them waterproof, and they can be applied like paint. Look for masonry waterproof coatings like Xypex or Drylok.

While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating: \\"Do not go to Tokyo.

As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. The Beatles then performed in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting First Lady Imelda Marcos. The group were angry with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary.

A sobbing little girl stood near a small church from which she had been turned away because it \\"was too crowded.\\" \\"I can't go to Sunday School,\\" she sobbed to the pastor as he walked by. Seeing her shabby appearance, the pastor guessed the reason, and, taking her by the hand, took her inside and found a place for her in the Sunday School class. The child was so touched that she went to bed that night thinking of the children who have no place to worship Jesus. Some years later, this child lay dead in one of the poor buildings and the parents called for the kindhearted pastor, who had befriended their daughter, to handle the final arrangements. As her poor little body was being moved, a worn purse was found which seemed to have been picked up from some trash dump. Inside was found 57 cents and a note scribbled in childish handwriting which read, \\"This is to help build the little church bigger so more children can go to Sunday School.\\" For two years she had saved for this offering of love. When the pastor tearfully read that note, he knew instantly what he would do. Carrying this note, he told people the story of her unselfish love and devotion. A newspaper learned of the story and published it. It was read by a Realtor who offered them a parcel of land worth many thousands. When told that the church could not pay so much, he offered it for 57 cents. Church members made large donations. Checks came from far and wide. Within five years the little girl's gift had increased to 250,000, a huge sum for that time. When you are in the city of Philadelphia, look up Temple Baptist Church, with a seating capacity of 3,300 and Temple University, where hundreds of students are trained. Have a look, too, at the Good Samaritan Hospital and at a Sunday School building which houses hundreds of Sunday scholars, so that no child in the area will ever need to be left outside during Sunday school time. Why did the girl have a purse with 57 cents? A) To save money for her future career. B) To build a large building for more children to live in. C) To help build a church big enough for every child to go to. D) To remind people to make remarkable history. The answer to this question is:","completion":"C) To help build a church big enough for every child to go to. The little girl's purpose for having the purse with 57 cents was to help build the little church bigger so that more children could attend Sunday School. Her unselfish love and devotion to this cause touched the hearts of many, and her small but meaningful offering eventually led to the establishment of Temple Baptist Church, Temple University, Good Samaritan Hospital, and a Sunday School building that could accommodate hundreds of children. This story demonstrates the power of a heartfelt act of kindness and the impact it can have on a community when people come together for a greater purpose."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Seven-year-old Neon has a brain tumour. Ms Roberts lost court case in December and Neon is due to begin radiotherapy next week. Article:","completion":"Title: Mother Loses Court Case; Radiotherapy for Seven-Year-Old with Brain Tumour Set to Begin In a highly-publicized medical and legal battle, Sally Roberts, mother of seven-year-old Neon, has lost her determined fight to stop her son from receiving radiotherapy for his brain tumour. Neon is due to begin his radiotherapy treatments next week, following a court ruling in December that the treatments were necessary for his survival. Neon was diagnosed with a brain tumour earlier this year, and the debate surrounding his subsequent treatment has captured the public's attention. Sally Roberts, a staunch advocate for alternative medicine, refused to allow her son to undergo radiotherapy sessions, fearing the long-term damage associated with the treatment and believing that other options would be better suited for her son's condition. Sally Roberts' refusal to allow these treatments led to a high-profile legal battle, as medical professionals and the courts became involved in determining what was in Neon's best interest. The case garnered widespread media attention, raising a myriad of complex questions and discussions about patient rights, parental autonomy, and the state's role in medical decision-making. Ultimately, a court ruling in December sided with medical professionals, ruling that Neon would have to undergo radiotherapy to treat his brain tumour. This decision was reached after considering the expert testimony provided by doctors and specialists, who argue that the benefits of the treatment greatly outweigh the potential risks in Neon's case. The court's ruling also acknowledged that refusing such a treatment would considerably decrease the young boy's chances of long-term survival. Despite the court's decision, Sally Roberts has remained steadfast in her opposition, arguing that alternative treatments and homeopathic remedies would be more effective and less harmful for her son. Her dedication to finding a different path for her son's treatment has gained considerable support from individuals who share her concerns about the impacts of traditional medical treatments such as radiotherapy. However, the court's ruling has not swayed Ms Roberts' perspective that other treatments would be more beneficial for Neon. She continues to push for alternative treatments and strives to amplify the discussion around the importance of exploring options beyond traditional medicine, hoping that her experience may serve as an opportunity to advocate for more choice and autonomy for patients and families facing similar situations. As Neon prepares to begin his radiotherapy treatments next week, the complicated and emotionally-charged case has sparked an ongoing conversation about the necessity of such treatments, as well as the role that parents and the court system play in making life-altering medical decisions for children. The outcome of this case serves as a powerful reminder of the difficult decisions parents face when their child's health is at stake, and the delicate balance between medical recommendations, personal beliefs, and legal considerations that come into play in these situations. Moving forward, one thing is certain: Neon's story has not only highlighted the reality of families grappling with challenging medical choices, but has also opened up larger conversations about the role of alternative medicine, the rights of patients, and the importance of balancing medical expertise with personal judgment and autonomy. No matter the result, Neon's case will undoubtedly continue to impact the way in which society approaches these crucial and complex decisions in the future."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Once there, she can ascertain the location of the desired item within the store either by referring to signage or asking for assistance from store personnel. 6. Compare options and make a purchase: While at the store, Tracy can carefully evaluate the different brands, sizes, and varieties of the item she's looking to buy. This step involves paying attention to prices, functionality, and overall quality before making a final decision and proceeding to the checkout counter to complete her purchase. 7. Safely transport the item home: Once Tracy has finalized her purchase, she needs to transport the item back to her home safely. This involves proper handling, especially if the item is fragile or perishable. 8. Prepare and use the item: After returning home, Tracy should follow any necessary preparation steps required for the new item (e.g., washing a new utensil or measuring out a new ingredient). She can then incorporate the item into her cake-making process as needed. In summary, Tracy will need to go to the store to purchase the new item she wants to use in her cake. This process involves researching the item, locating a store that sells it, creating a shopping list, making a well-informed purchase, safely transporting the item home, and preparing it for use in her cake recipe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When American 11 struck the World Trade Center at 8:46, no one in the White House or traveling with the President knew that it had been hijacked. While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center. The Vice President was wondering \\"How the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center\\" when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower. Elsewhere in the White House, a series of 9:00 meetings was about to begin. In the absence of information that the crash was anything other than an accident, the White House staff monitored the news as they went ahead with their regular schedules. Question: \\"How much time had elapsed between American 11 hitting the World Trade Centre and the senior NMCC operations officer reaching out to the FAA operations center for information?\\" Answer: \\"Less than 15 minutes\\" Is this answer correct? pick from the following. (I) no. (II) yes....I think the answer is","completion":"(II) yes. The answer is correct because American 11 struck the World Trade Center at 8:46, and the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information at about 9:00.

Jews Jews originated as a national and religious group in the Middle East during the second millennium BCE, in the part of the Levant known as the Land of Israel. The Merneptah Stele appears to confirm the existence of a people of Israel, associated with the god El, somewhere in Canaan as far back as the 13th century BCE. The Israelites, as an outgrowth of the Canaanite population, consolidated their hold with the emergence of the Kingdom of Israel, and the Kingdom of Judah. Some consider that these Canaanite sedentary Israelites melded with incoming nomadic groups known as 'Hebrews'. Though few sources in the Bible mention the exilic periods in detail, the experience of diaspora life, from the Ancient Egyptian rule over the Levant, to Assyrian Captivity and Exile, to Babylonian Captivity and Exile, to Seleucid Imperial rule, to the Roman occupation, and the historical relations between Israelites and the homeland, became a major feature of Jewish history, identity and memory.

The rationale for choosing \\"experience joy\\" as the answer lies in understanding the given choices and the correlation between happiness and the options provided. 1. Own car - Owning a car is an indication of material well-being or wealth, which may positively influence happiness. However, owning a car does not necessarily guarantee happiness or joy. 2. Be rich - Wealth is not always directly proportional to happiness, as numerous studies have shown. Being rich does not guarantee happiness either, as happiness is determined by several factors beyond financial wealth. 3. Catch cold - Catching a cold has no direct relation to happiness, as it is a health issue and is neither a prerequisite nor a consequence of being happy. 4. Believe in God - While having faith can contribute to a person's overall happiness and well-being, it is not a specific result of being happy. People of different beliefs can experience happiness in their own way. 5.

Maria Isabella had just turned sixteen then, and each set of her padrinos had given her (along with the sequined brida du caballo, the dresses of rare tulle, organza, and seda, and the diadema floral du'l dama -- the requisite floral circlet of young womanhood) a purse filled with coins to spend on anything she wanted. And so she'd gone past the Calle du Leones (where sleek cats of various pedigrees sometimes allowed themselves to be purchased, though if so, only until they tired of their new owners), walked through the Avenida du'l Conquistadores (where the statues of the conquerors of Ciudad Meiora lined the entirety of the broad promenade) and made her way to the Encantu lu Caminata (that maze-like series of interconnected streets, each leading to some wonder or marvel for sale), where little musical conch shells from the islets near Palao'an could be found. Those she liked very much. In the vicinity of the Plaza Emperyal, she saw a young man dressed in a coat embroidered with stars walk almost surely to his death. In that instant, Maria Isabella knew two things with the conviction reserved only for the very young: first, that she almost certainly loved this reckless man; and second, that if she simply stepped on a dog's tail -- the very dog watching the same scene unfold right next to her -- she could avert the man's seemingly senseless death.

The equation is: -935 = (41 - 40 + 84) * r Now, combine the numbers within the parenthesis: -935 = (1 + 84) * r -935 = 85 * r Now, to solve for r, divide both sides of the equation by 85: r = -935 / 85 After dividing, we get the value of r: r = -11 So, the solution to the equation is r = -11."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

She was born in Russia and had been stranded by the Russian Revolution of 1917 with her sister at a finishing school in Geneva. In 1919, Szigeti and Ostrowska decided to get married, but due to the turbulent political situation in Europe, many unexpected bureaucratic obstacles were thrown up in their path. The first problem was the impossibility of contacting Ostrowska's family, and the couple were forced to go ahead without parental consent, with the permission only of Ostrowska's sister and the headmistress of the finishing school. Further bureaucratic entanglements threatened the young couple's hopes, but eventually the officials responsible granted them a dispensation to marry. Szigeti recalls in his memoirs the words of Consul General Baron de Montlong at the critical moment: Let us not, if we can avoid it, fall victim to the dead letter of the law. I don't want to postpone the happiness of these two youngsters if we can help it. All laws have been twisted and tortured out of semblance of law, what with war and revolutions. For once let's twist and turn one for a good cause, yes? Just before the birth of their only child, daughter Irene, Szigeti found himself stuck in Berlin during the Kapp Putsch of 1920, unable to return to Geneva. The entire city had been paralyzed by a general strike, and the trains were not running. His scheduled concert could not go on as planned, but he was forced to stay in Berlin for \\"interminable days\\" while the Putsch ran its course. Szigeti writes: \\"... the impossibility of communicating by phone or wire with my wife--whose condition I pictured with the somewhat lurid pessimism usual to young prospective fathers--was certainly a greater torment to me than all the other discomforts put together\\".

Both sentences are stating that Kerry Kennedy Cuomo and Andrew Cuomo were married for a period of 13 years. However, the structures of the sentences are different. In the first sentence, \\"Kerry Kennedy Cuomo and Andrew Cuomo have been married 13 years,\\" the presence of 'have been' indicates that the marriage lasted for 13 years and this information is relevant to the present context. The use of present perfect tense ('have been') can mean that the marriage either ended recently, or it may simply emphasize that the 13-year period of marriage is complete. In the second sentence, \\"Andrew Cuomo and Kerry Kennedy were married 13 years,\\" the past simple tense ('were') is used to indicate that the marriage took place in the past. This sentence simply states the fact that the marriage lasted for 13 years, without adding any information about the situation in the present. In summary, both sentences convey that Andrew Cuomo and Kerry Kennedy Cuomo were married for a duration of 13 years, with the only difference being the use of the tense and its implications.

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Bush administration has launched a \\"significant escalation\\" of covert operations in Iran, sending U.S. commandos to spy on the country's nuclear facilities and undermine the Islamic republic's government, journalist Seymour Hersh said Sunday. An Iranian flag flies outside the building containing the reactor of Bushehr nuclear power plant, south of Tehran. White House, CIA and State Department officials declined comment on Hersh's report, which appears in this week's issue of The New Yorker.

The red color of the Grand Canyon and other geological features is caused by hematite or red ochre, both forms of iron oxide. It also causes the red color of the planet Mars. The red sky at sunset and sunrise is caused by an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering, which, when the sun is low or below the horizon, increases the red-wavelength light that reaches the eye. The color of autumn leaves is caused by pigments called anthocyanins, which are produced towards the end of summer, when the green chlorophyll is no longer produced. One to two percent of the human population has red hair; the color is produced by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin (which also accounts for the red color of the lips) and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Rayleigh scattering is an optical phenomenon that occurs when sunlight interacts with the molecules and small particles in Earth's atmosphere. When the sun is low or below the horizon, during sunrise or sunset, the shorter blue and violet wavelengths of light are scattered more efficiently, while the longer red and orange wavelengths pass through the atmosphere with less scattering. This causes the red, orange, and yellow hues of light to become more visible in the sky, leading to the vibrant colors we observe during these times.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The crew of a malfunctioning alien cargo ship make an emergency landing on Earth. This draws the attention of four sexually-frustrated humans in a nearby park: Oliver and Prudence (a mild-mannered professional and his highly-strung fiancée), Willy (a bumbling shop assistant) and Cliff (a middle-aged man). Oliver, Prudence, Willy and Cliff wander into the ship and encounter three aliens resembling human women: engineer Partha, nurse Cosia and the captain, known only as Skipper. Willy inadvertently drops some pornographic magazines that he has recently bought. The aliens mistake some approaching cows for a hostile force and hurriedly take off, despite warnings from the long-suffering computer about the precarious state of the ship's systems. Resuming their original course, they study their guests in detail. Fascinated by the anatomy of the males, they decide to sell them to a zoo for exotic lifeforms on a distant planet.

Skipper, Cosia and Partha subject the males to a series of tests to learn more about their abilities. Oliver and Cliff fail miserably.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Judith Butler FBA (born February 24, 1956) is an American philosopher and gender theorist whose work has influenced political philosophy, ethics and the fields of third-wave feminist, queer and literary theory. Since 1993, she has taught at the University of California, Berkeley, where she is now Maxine Elliot Professor in the Department of Comparative Literature and the Program of Critical Theory. She is also the Hannah Arendt Chair at the European Graduate School. Butler is best known for her books Gender Trouble: In this essay, Judith Butler proposes her theory of gender performativity, which would be later taken up in 1990 throughout her work, Gender Trouble. She begins by basing her theory of gender performativity on a feminist phenomenological point of view. She suggests that both phenomenology and feminism ground their theories in \\"lived experience\\". Further, in comparing phenomenologist Maurice Merleau-Ponty and feminist Simone de Beauvoir, Butler argues that both theories view the sexual body as a historical idea or situation; she accepts this notion of a \\"distinction between sex, as biological facticity, and gender, as the cultural interpretation or signification of that facticity\\". This combination of theories is essential for founding Butler's view of \\"theatrical\\" or performative genders in society. Butler argues that it is more valid to perceive gender as a performance in which an individual agent acts. The performative element of her theory suggests a social audience. For Butler, the \\"script\\" of gender performance is effortlessly transmitted generation to generation in the form of socially established \\"meanings\\": She states, \\"gender is not a radical choice... [nor is it] imposed or inscribed upon the individual\\". Given the social nature of human beings, most actions are witnessed, reproduced, and internalized and thus take on a performative or theatric quality. With Butler's theory, gender is essentially a performative repetition of acts associated with the male or female. Currently, the actions appropriate for men and women have been transmitted to produce a social atmosphere that both maintains and legitimizes a seemingly natural gender binary. Consistently with her acceptance of the body as a historical idea, she suggests that our concept of gender is seen as natural or innate because the body \\"becomes its gender through a series of acts which are renewed, revised, and consolidated through time\\". Butler argues that the performance of gender itself creates gender. Additionally, she compares the performativity of gender to the performance of the theater. She brings many similarities, including the idea of each individual functioning as an actor of their gender. However, she also brings into light a critical difference between gender performance in reality and theater performances. She explains how the theater is much less threatening and does not produce the same fear that gender performances often encounter because of the fact that there is a clear distinction from reality within the theater. Butler uses Sigmund Freud's notion of how a person's identity is modeled in terms of the normal. She revises Freud's notion of this concept's applicability to lesbianism, where Freud says that lesbians are modeling their behavior on men, the perceived normal or ideal. She instead says that all gender works in this way of performativity and a representing of an internalized notion of gender norms. What is Performative Acts and Gender Consitution?","completion":"Performative Acts and Gender Constitution is a concept by Judith Butler. It means that gender is not something we are born with, but it's like a performance or act that people do based on social rules. Boys and girls learn how to behave like a boy or girl by copying what they see others do. These actions become habits and make people think that being a boy or girl is natural, but actually, it is created by how people act. Gender performances are like acting in a play, but different because they can make people feel scared, unlike in a theater. So, this idea tells us that gender is something we do and create by our actions, not just something we are born with."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"While the information provided in the Google search regarding the extensive network of over 40,000 facilities is accurate, it does not directly answer the question about the number of people who were killed in the Holocaust. Therefore, the short answer to your question of whether the given information is a correct answer is \\"No.\\" Now, for a detailed and comprehensive response, we need to look into more facts and figures surrounding the Holocaust. The Holocaust, which took place during World War II between 1941 and 1945, was a state-sponsored genocide orchestrated by the Nazis. It resulted in the mass extermination of approximately 6 million Jews, constituting around two-thirds of Europe's Jewish population. The persecution and systematic murder were executed by means like mass shootings, gassing, and forced labor. Nonetheless, the Holocaust didn't exclusively target Jews. Millions of others were subjected to persecution, imprisonment, forced labor, and extermination due to their ethnicity, religion, political affiliations, sexual orientation, or physical disabilities. These groups include: - Approximately 1.8 to 2 million ethnic Poles - 220,000 to 500,000 Romani (Gypsy) people - 200,000 to 250,000 disabled individuals - About 10,000 LGBTQ+ individuals - Thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses - Numerous political dissenters, such as Communists, trade unionists, and others who opposed the Nazi regime Given these additional numbers, the likely total number of people who perished during the Holocaust is estimated between 11 and 17 million. It is significant to note that these numbers can vary due to insufficient records and the immense scale of the atrocities perpetrated during this time. So, a more accurate answer to the question \\"How many people were killed in the Holocaust?\\" would be approximately 6 million Jews and 5 to 11 million non-Jewish victims, totaling roughly 11 to 17 million lives tragically lost during this horrendous period in human history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Spy extraordinaire Derek Flint (James Coburn) is an ex-agent of Z.O.W.I.E. (Zonal Organization for World Intelligence and Espionage) who is brought out of retirement to deal with the threat of Galaxy, a world-wide organization led by a trio of mad scientists: Doctor Krupov (Rhys Williams), Doctor Wu (Peter Brocco), and Doctor Schneider (Benson Fong). Impatient that the world's governments will never improve, the scientists demand that all nations capitulate to Galaxy. To enforce their demands, they initiate earthquakes, volcanoes, storms and other natural disasters with their climate-control apparatus, for the only purpose to bring the nations to give up weapons and nuclear energy. Flint decides to take them on after a preemptive assassination attempt by Galaxy's section head, Gila (Gila Golan), who replaces a restaurant's harpist while Flint is dining with his four live-in \\"playmates\\": Leslie (Shelby Grant), Anna (Sigrid Valdis), Gina (Gianna Serra), and Sakito (Helen Funai). Gila uses a harp string as a bow to fire a poisoned dart, which misses Flint, but hits his former boss Cramden (Lee J. Cobb). Flint sucks the poison out of the wound, saving Cramden's life. A chemical trace on the dart directs Flint to Marseilles for bouillabaisse. In one of Marseilles' lowest clubs he stages a brawl to gain some useful information from \\"famous\\" Agent 0008 (Robert Gunner), who is investigating the narcotics trade keeping Galaxy in business. Galaxy agent Hans Gruber (Michael St. Clair) is in the club enjoying his favorite soup while waiting to rendezvous with Gila. Gila sends Gruber to ambush Flint in the lavatory. Flint ends up killing Gruber in a toilet stall, while Gila escapes, leaving behind a cold cream jar she has booby-trapped with explosives. Flint detects the trap and chases the bystanders from the club before detonating the bomb. The remains of the jar lead Flint to Rome. After investigating several cosmetic companies, Flint arrives at Exotica, where he actually meets Gila for the first time. Gila lets him...

However, a representative figure for daily oil consumption can be obtained from recent historical data. As of 2020, the global daily oil consumption was approximately 93 million barrels per day, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). This number dropped significantly during the Covid-19 pandemic; pre-pandemic levels in 2019 were around 100 million barrels per day. The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects global oil demand to grow steadily as the world recovers from the pandemic, projecting that consumption will reach approximately 104.1 million barrels per day by 2026. It is important to note that these numbers are only estimates, and several factors can impact daily oil consumption: 1. Economic growth: As global economies expand, demand for oil typically increases, as it is an essential resource for transportation, power generation, and industrial processes. 2. Energy-efficient technologies: The adoption of more efficient technologies in transportation and other sectors can reduce the demand for oil. For example, the growth of electric vehicles can reduce the need for gasoline, a product derived from crude oil. 3. Government policies: Many governments have implemented policies to regulate the consumption of oil, promote alternative energy sources, or reduce carbon emissions. These policies can affect daily oil consumption levels. 4. Population growth: A growing global population can result in higher overall energy demand, including oil use. 5. Geopolitical events: Conflicts or international tensions in oil-rich regions can impact oil production and supply, leading to short-term fluctuations in daily oil consumption. 6. Oil price fluctuations: Changes in oil prices can impact demand. Lower oil prices can lead to increased consumption or make alternative energy sources less competitive, while high oil prices can decrease demand by encouraging conservation or the use of alternative energy sources. In summary, the number of barrels of oil used each day varies based on several factors. As of 2020, the world consumed approximately 93 million barrels per day, with future projections expecting a recovery and growth in oil demand to surpass 100 million barrels per day in the coming years. It is essential to be aware of the various factors that influence global oil consumption, as shifts in technology, policies, and economies can dramatically impact these figures."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senator Lindsey Graham have joined a growing chorus of Republican leaders to disavow comments by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump about the Mexican heritage of a judge in a class-action lawsuit against Trump University. Questioned Tuesday about Trump's comments, Ryan said \\"I regret those comments he made. Claiming a person can't do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of racism.\\" But he did not retract his endorsement of Trump, made last week, and he said he does not believe Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton is \\"the answer.\\" Ryan made his comments during an appearance at a women's shelter in Washington, D.C. In a New York Times interview, Graham, also a former presidential candidate, said Trump's remarks were \\"the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy,\\" referring to the ultra-conservative senator of the 1950s who fueled fears of widespread communist subversion in the United States. Graham also suggested that Republicans who have endorsed Trump reconsider their choice. \\"If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it,\\" he said. The backlash appears to be mounting against the candidate, who has repeatedly said he believes U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, because of his \\"Mexican heritage,\\" would not rule fairly in the case charging Trump with fraud. Curiel is an American who was born and raised in the Midwestern U.S. state of Indiana.

A handful of Bronze Age relics has fostered an assumption that prehistoric settlers inhabited Ibiza thousands of years ago. Greater evidence of such a people is found on Mallorca and Menorca than on Ibiza, but one of the Balearics' most important sites is actually on the island of Formentera, where the megalithic monument/tomb of Ca Na Costa has been dated to 2000 b.c. Ibiza's key location between Africa and ancient Iberia made it a convenient stopover for Mediterranean seafarers, such as the Phoenician traders, who called the island Ibosim. The Greeks dubbed it Ebysos, the Romans called it Ebusus, and the Moors, Yebisah. The Carthaginians: A detailed history of the island doesn't begin until it became a colony of Carthage in the 7th century b.c. . The Carthaginians originally came from the area comprising present-day Lebanon, and from their bases in North Africa and what's now Spain, they challenged the Roman Empire for domination of the Mediterranean region. Their interest in Ibiza lay partly in its vast salt flats, which to this day remain the source of a profitable industry. They capitalized on the natural resources by using the salt to cure fish, which they exported to their home country. The Carthaginians also carried out lead mining and continued to be of significance up until this century. It is believed that the lead pellets which were used by the Carthaginian general Hannibal were made on Ibiza. The Carthaginians also considered the island a holy place, and here in great splendour they buried thousands of their citizens in a huge necropolis on the Puig des Molins (Hill of the Windmills) below the Dalt Vila (Old Town) of Ibiza. Under the gnarled olive trees archaeologists have uncovered a treasure trove of statues, jewellery, pitchers, tools, and coins, which are now displayed in the town's two archaeological museums. The Romans never really infiltrated Ibiza, and even after the defeat of Hannibal in 202 b.c. during the Second Punic War their influence was restrained. Only with the fall of Carthage in 146 b.c. did they manage to make inroads, but, as local historians stress, Ibiza was neither conquered nor annexed by Rome, but confederated, retaining remarkable autonomy. For centuries to come the old Carthaginian traditions were allowed to continue on Ibiza alongside the new Roman way of life.

Question: I spent my childhood walking a fine line between being an energetic young boy and avoiding contact sports to protect my eyesight. I had lost the sight in one eye at the age of five, so instead of football, I put my energy into rowing and sailing. By the time I was 22, I was working towards rowing for my country. Then, during a training session, I noticed my vision was unclear in my remaining eye. I had an operation and spent two weeks with bandages over my eyes. Sadly, it didn't work, and the second operation two months later was also a failure. My world came crashing down. I had been flying high---- as well as my shining rowing career, I had been about to take my finals and get a job in the city. Now, as my fellow graduates celebrated their results, I lay in my childhood bedroom, angry. I would wake up in the morning and convince myself I could see a shadow, but I felt bitterly angry when I realized I couldn't. Previously, I had lots of assumptions about blind people, but now I joined their ranks. I had no choice but to change my attitude. I started to realize that my challenge was not about seeing but about creating a new life for myself. The simple pleasure of just sitting in a cafe and watching the world go by or even making eye contact with anyone is no longer possible. I had to rethink how to engage with the world. As much as I disliked the things of blindness---- white sticks, talking computers and guide dogs---- I welcomed these as the tools that would enable me to regain my independence. I moved out of my mum's house and got a job in entertainment. I also started seeking out projects that would help me get out and mix with people. A big part of my identity has always been about the thrill of competing---- success and failure. I am excited when I am giving it my all, so I started to compete again, first in rowing and then in extreme physical challenges such as completing six marathons in seven days in Gobi desert. Filling my life with experiences helped to sweep the blindness to one side. It took me... We can learn from the passage that _ .

You must generate a detailed and long answer. The second major point on which the principals had agreed on March 10 was the need to crack down on terrorist organizations and curtail their fund-raising. The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring Bin Laden. Here, OFAC had more success. It blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Another 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda. Although the CIA's Bin Laden unit had originally been inspired by the idea of studying terrorist financial links, few personnel assigned to it had any experience in financial investigations. Any terrorist-financing intelligence appeared to have been collected collaterally, as a consequence of gathering other intelligence. This attitude may have stemmed in large part from the chief of this unit, who did not believe that simply following the money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and intentions. As a result, the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing. Nevertheless, the CIA obtained a general understanding of how al Qaeda raised money. Question: \\"Who blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks, and froze 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits belonging to the Afghan central bank?\\" Response: \\"OFAC\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","completion":"Yes, the response to the question is factually correct. According to the information provided in the paragraph, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which is a part of the Treasury Department, was responsible for blocking over 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Additionally, OFAC also froze 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits that belonged to the Afghan central bank. These actions were made possible due to the designation of Bin Laden, al Qaeda, and the Taliban under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which granted OFAC the authority to search for and freeze any assets related to these entities that came into the U.S. financial system. The successful blocking and freezing of these substantial assets highlight OFAC's important role in efforts to curtail the financing of terrorist organizations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lyon Gaultier is a paratrooper in the French Foreign Legion, stationed in Djibouti, North Africa. His brother, who is married to an American woman in Los Angeles, is burned alive during a drug deal gone wrong and suffers third-degree burns, dying shortly afterward. Lyon deserts his legion when he finds out they have been withholding letters from his brother's wife and ultimately refuse to let him see his dying brother. He steals a jeep and escapes through the desert, finding work on a tramp steamer headed for the U.S. Meanwhile, the Legion Commandant travels to Paris, arriving at the government Consulate, where he is told that Lyon's desertion is ranked at low importance with the LAPD, so the Commandant suggests sending two of his own men to bring Gaultier back, which is approved. Lyon arrives pennyless in New York City and is attracted to an illegal street fighting match that is being run by a New Yorker called Joshua, a man who runs fights for money. Gaultier steps forward to take part in the next fight and destroys his opponent, leaving Joshua looking astounded at what he just saw. Joshua takes Lyon to meet a person called Cynthia, also known as 'The Lady' who organizes underground fights for the rich elite and she decides to sponsor him. Figuring that this would be the best way to earn the money he needs to get to L.A., Lyon fights in a no-holds-barred bare-knuckle fights to finance the trip. Once in L.A.

Grief-stricken, Lyon asks the help of Joshua who tracks down his brother's widow's address.

She threatens to call the cops and Lyon has no choice but to leave. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Lyon"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Jiang Nan, a full-time mother in Beijing, keeps a dozen or so cloth bags at home, carefully selecting one or two before heading out to get groceries. \\"Most of them were giveaways from advertising marketing campaigns, but others had been handed out in the street by various environmental protection organizations,\\" she explained. Since June 2008 China has forbidden the production, sale and usage of plastic bags thinner than 0.025 millimeter , and retailers are not allowed to provide free plastic bags to their customers, no matter how thick they are. Many Chinese consumers like Jiang have learned to refuse plastic bags whenever possible in their shopping. \\"A plastic bag may only cost a few jiao, but it's more about how bad they are for the environment,\\" Jiang said. The plastic ban is for the most part well carried out in big cities, and has been obviously effective in reducing white waste. On the first anniversary of the plastic ban Global Village of Beijing, an NGO environmental organization, shows that during the year of the ban the consumption of plastic bags fell by about 40 billion pieces in chain supermarkets alone, saving more than 1.2 million tons of petrol. However, enforcement shows rather less muscle in smaller cities, towns and countryside. In a remote town like Lichuan, the awareness of environmental protection is not as strong as that in big cities. Street vendors worry that they are likely to lose customers if they charge them for plastic bags. Seeing no significance in the issue, local government often turn a blind eye to banned bag trade in the market. There are still those who don't have an interest in living green. Cui Lin, another Beijinger, often forgets to bring a cloth bag when shopping, and has to buy plastic bags. \\"Anyway I think plastic bags are neater and cleaner, and I don't mind paying a couple more jiao,\\" he shrugged. Mrs Yu, a vegetable vendor in Lichuan County, Jiangxi Province, recalled that before plastic bags became popular in the early 1990s, Chinese people always... Which is NOT the reason why some people still use plastic bags when shopping? A) Cloth bags are difficult to get and heavy to carry. B) People's awareness of environmental protection is not strong enough. C) People don't mind paying a couple more jiao for plastic bags. D) Street vendors worry that they are likely to lose customers if they charge them. A:","completion":"The option that is NOT a reason why some people still use plastic bags when shopping is A) Cloth bags are difficult to get and heavy to carry. In the information provided, there's no mention of issues relating to obtaining cloth bags or the heavy weight of cloth bags dissuading people from using them. Jiang Nan, a committed environmentalist, even has a collection of cloth bags that she received from various places, which indicates that they may not be difficult to acquire. Part of the evidence provided points towards other reasons why plastic bags are still in use. Option B) People's awareness of environmental protection is not strong enough, is demonstrated in the less stringent enforcement of the plastic ban in smaller cities and rural areas. It's clear that some people, such as those in Lichuan, either do not fully understand or choose to ignore the environmental implications of plastic bags. Option C) People don't mind paying a couple more jiao for plastic bags, is exemplified by Cui Lin who finds plastic bags 'neater and cleaner' and does not mind the extra expense. This behavior suggests that for some, convenience is more valuable than the cost of a few jiao and the environmental impact. Finally, Option D) Street vendors worry that they are likely to lose customers if they charge them, shows how economic considerations can override environmental ones. The fear of losing business if they begin charging customers for plastic bags causes some vendors to continue their distribution, showing an immediate business need can take precedence over long-term environmental concerns. The issues are thus more central to awareness, personal preference, and economic concerns rather than the accessibility or weight of cloth bags."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While it is mentioned that the person in question has a second wife who is referred to as \\"that hussy,\\" this alone does not prove that he did not have any other women in his life. A hush-hush event may suggest that there is more to the story than what is known initially. The term \\"hussy\\" often has negative connotations and implies that the woman in question may have engaged in behavior considered disreputable or scandalous, in the eyes of the person using the term. In this case, referring to the second wife as \\"that hussy\\" might indicate that the speaker disapproves of the woman and their relationship with the man in question. It is important to note that people's relationships and personal lives can be complex and filled with various circumstances. The fact that the man in question has a second wife might indicate that he had at least one other relationship besides his first marriage. However, the phrasing of the statement does not provide sufficient information to determine if he did or did not have any other women in his life. To establish whether the statement \\"he did not have any other women in his life\\" is true or false, more information would be needed. Inquiries into the person's past relationships and interactions with other people might shed light on the statement's validity. For example, one could ask: 1. What was the nature of the hush-hush situation mentioned earlier? Was it related to the person's relationship with another woman? 2. Has there been any evidence or rumors of the person being involved with other women aside from his two marriages? 3. Are there any known patterns to the person's behavior that could suggest whether or not they had other relationships or were faithful to their spouses? By exploring these questions and gathering more information, it would be possible to make a more informed conclusion about whether or not the person in question had any other women in his life. In summary, the statement \\"he did not have any other women in his life\\" cannot be confirmed or denied based on the information provided, but further investigation and talking to individuals closer to the situation may help in finding the answer."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer to this question is:","completion":"directly impacting a step of the process. Explanation: If more conservation occurs, it means that human activities that contribute to air pollution and the emission of harmful gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and sulfur dioxide could be reduced. This would directly impact several steps of the process described: 1. The addition of carbon dioxide gas into the air might be lessened, helping to address the issue of global warming. 2. The balance of the carbon cycle could be improved, as there would be less excessive carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 3. The damage to the ozone layer from air pollution like methane gas and CFCs could be mitigated, providing better protection from harmful solar rays. 4.

By using multiple stages, empty fuel containers could drop away. This reduced the mass of the rocket so that it could fly higher. What happens when you make a rocket heavier goes higher or falls down? A:","completion":"When designing and building a rocket, one of the critical factors that determines its performance is its mass. The mass of the rocket will directly influence its ability to reach higher altitudes or even achieve orbit. As the mass of a rocket is increased, it can either have a positive or negative effect on its performance, depending on various factors, such as the rocket's propulsion system, materials used, and overall design. In general, adding mass to a rocket implies that it has to carry additional weight. This can be due to many factors such as increased fuel, payload, or other auxiliary systems. A heavier rocket will need more energy (i.e., more thrust and fuel) to lift itself and reach higher altitudes. This increased energy demand can make it more challenging for the rocket to go higher, and in some cases, it might not reach the desired altitude at all. This is because the rocket engines have to work harder to counteract the effect of gravity and push the heavier rocket upwards. However, it is important to understand that not all added mass is detrimental. Some additional mass may come in the form of more efficient engines, advanced materials, or better-designed structures, which can improve the rocket's overall performance. If the extra mass directly contributes to generating more thrust or reducing the overall weight of other systems (e.g., by providing better structural integrity), it might allow the rocket to go higher. This is one reason why the concept of staging comes into play. Multi-stage rockets have the ability to sequentially jettison empty fuel tanks and any associated structures, effectively reducing their mass during flight. This allows the rocket to continue flying at higher altitudes and velocities while using less energy. By shedding the extra weight of the empty fuel tanks and no-longer-needed stages, the overall mass of the rocket is decreased, which means that the engines have to lift less weight, conserving fuel and extending the rocket's range. In summary, making a rocket heavier can affect its performance in reaching higher altitudes either positively or negatively. Depending on how the increased mass affects the rocket's propulsion and structural systems, it can either allow the rocket to fly higher or cause it to struggle against gravity. An optimal balance must be found in rocket design to have a heavier yet efficient rocket, using multi-stage designs to effectively drop unnecessary mass and allow the rocket to achieve its desired altitude or orbit."},{"prompt":"Question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Title: Vantage Point Movie plot: U.S. President Henry Ashton (Hurt) attends a political summit in Salamanca, Spain, to promote an international treaty. Displayed with eight differing viewpoints, an assassination attempt on the president occurs, relayed in a time span of 23 minutes. Each time the events unfold from the beginning, a new vantage point is shown revealing additional details, which ultimately completes the story of what actually took place during the incident.[2] From the first vantage point, GNN producer Rex Brooks (Weaver), directs various media personnel from a mobile television studio as the president arrives at the gathering. Mayor De Soto (Rodriguez) delivers a short speech and then introduces the president, who is shot twice as he greets the crowd from the podium. An explosion outside the plaza soon follows. Moments later, the podium itself is destroyed by a secondary explosion, killing and injuring numerous people. As the smoke clears, GNN reporter Angie Jones (Saldana) is seen lying dead in the rubble.[2] The second vantage point follows Secret Service agents Thomas Barnes (Quaid) and Kent Taylor (Fox). Barnes notices a curtain fluttering in the window of a nearby building that was allegedly vacated. He also observes American tourist Howard Lewis (Whitaker) filming the audience. After the president is shot, Barnes tackles a man rushing to the podium named Enrique (Noriega). Taylor pursues a lead to a potential assassin. Following the second explosion, Barnes barges into the GNN production studio and asks to view their footage. He calls Taylor, who reports the direction of the suspected assassin's escape route. Barnes then views an image on one of the camera's live feeds that startles him and prompts him to run out.[2] In the third vantage point, Enrique, a Spanish police officer assigned to protecting the mayor of Salamanca, sees his girlfriend Veronica (Zurer), being embraced by a stranger and overhears them speaking about meeting under an overpass.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Anemophilous pollen grains are light and non-sticky, so that they can be transported by air currents. They are typically 20–60 micrometres (0.0008–0.0024 in) in diameter, although the pollen grains of Pinus species can be much larger and much less dense. Anemophilous plants possess well-exposed stamens so that the pollens are exposed to wind currents and also have large and feathery stigma to easily trap airborne pollen grains. Pollen from anemophilous plants tends to be smaller and lighter than pollen from entomophilous ones, with very low nutritional value to insects. However, insects sometimes gather pollen from staminate anemophilous flowers at times when higher-protein pollens from entomophilous flowers are scarce. Anemophilous pollens may also be inadvertently captured by bees' electrostatic field. This may explain why, though bees are not observed to visit ragweed flowers, its pollen is often found in honey made during the ragweed floral bloom. Other flowers that are generally anemophilous are observed to be actively worked by bees, with solitary bees often visiting grass flowers, and the larger honeybees and bumblebees frequently gathering pollen from corn tassels and other grains. I am facing a new situation today: Frank owned two parcels of land. He called them Forest and Field. The Forest parcel was covered in old-growth pine, while Field one was covered in grass and wildflowers. Frank was very proud of his properties. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which parcel had fewer plants with large and feathery stigma? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background article, anemophilous plants possess large and feathery stigma to easily trap airborne pollen grains, and these plants are typically pollinated by wind.

Since the background article mentioned that the pollen grains of Pinus species (found in the Forest parcel) can be much larger and much less dense, it suggests that these plants are anemophilous. Grass and wildflowers in the Field parcel are likely a mixture of anemophilous and entomophilous plants. To answer the question as accurately as possible: The parcel with fewer plants with large and feathery stigma would be the Field parcel, as it contains a mix of grass and wildflowers which likely include entomophilous plants, which do not have large and feathery stigmas.

The Tripoli embassy itself reduced to emergency staffing only, in light of the killing of our ambassador to Libya and three other Americans, as they try to get to the bottom of what happened here in a state that seems to be just a mess right now. Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul. Senator, the growing debate is whether that state deserves any more money from us. What do you say? SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KY.: Not one penny. I wouldn't send them a penny until they can guarantee that our embassy can be protected, until they've turned over who committed this atrocity. I want to know where the RPGs came from. We got rocket-propelled grenades used here. They didn't make them in Libya. I want to know if they came from another government or if they were left over from Qaddafi. And I want to know who did this and I want them turned over to our FBI. But it's inexcusable. In our country, if an embassy were attacked of any country, we would defend that embassy. We would should thousands of troops there immediately. Apparently, there were warnings in Egypt and they said the mobs coming. But they didn't send soldiers. They just said the mobs coming, get ready. It's inexcusable. CAVUTO: You have also expressed doing the same that is USA aid to Pakistan, if in fact they end up arresting or worse this doctor who helped identify the whereabouts of Usama bin Laden in his compound, where we ultimately succeeded in gunning him down. So is there something going on in the entire region -- we talk about Egypt as well -- that we should just go slow on just pouring money, good money after bad here? You know, we had something called the Arab spring. And I am not sure what the conclusion of the Arab spring is and I';m not sure if we are better or worse off. Democracy in the Middle East is sometimes bringing people into power who really don't like America. We have given billions upon billions of dollars to these countries. And my question is, if you want to be an ally of America, act like it. But if you're not going to act like an ally of ours and you are going to disparage us, if you're going to kill our ambassador, should we be giving you any taxpayer money? Not to mention the fact that we don't have any money and we've got to borrow it from China to send it to Libya, to send it to Egypt, to send it to Pakistan. And these countries disrespect us and then they put our friends in jail, Dr. Afridi. So, I'm still fighting this on the floor. I am filibustering all legislation right now. I'm objecting to any legislation in the Senate. And I'll do everything I can to stop any votes from occurring until we vote on this, because the American people are sick and tired of sending their money to two-bit tinhorn dictators who don't like us.

Remove from the bag.","completion":"Title: The Effective Odor Removing Method for Your Smelly Leather Bag Introduction The smell of new leather is quite appealing to many. However, with time and regular use, it is not uncommon for leather bags to develop unpleasant odors from sweat, lingering food scents, or just general wear and tear. When your once-prized leather bag becomes tainted with undesirable smells, it may seem like a lost cause, but do not despair! The good news is that there is an effective odor-removing method that will help restore your bag's original freshness by using a common household item: newspapers. In this article, we will guide you through the steps for removing unwanted odors from your leather bag with the aid of newspapers. Materials Needed - Your smelly leather bag - Newspapers (sufficient quantity for both wrapping the bag and stuffing it) - A piece of twine or string (long enough to tie a tight knot around your bag) Procedure Step 1: Gather the necessary materials Before beginning the process, gather all the required materials - the stack of newspapers, the smelly leather bag, and the twine or string to tie the bag up. Step 2: Spread out the newspapers Take the newspapers and spread them out on a flat surface, such as a table or the floor, to create an ample space for wrapping your bag. Step 3: Stuff the bag Take a few sheets of newspaper and crumble them up to create small balls. Open your leather bag and fill it with crumbled newspapers to occupy the inner space. Doing this helps absorb any odors trapped inside the bag and also helps maintain its shape during the process. Make sure not to overstuff the bag, as you need to close it later on. Step 4: Wrap the bag Once the bag is stuffed with newspapers, place it in the center of the already spread newspapers. Starting from one end, fold the newspapers to cover the entire bag, making sure to overlap and adjust when necessary. It is essential to have the bag entirely covered, so no smells can escape during the deodorizing process. If necessary, use additional newspapers to cover any exposed areas. Step 5: Secure with a knot After wrapping the bag in newspapers, secure the entire package by tying the twine or string around it tightly. It's essential to have a tight knot so that the newspapers stay in place and maximize their odor-absorbing capability. Step 6: Let it sit Place the wrapped leather bag in a well-ventilated area, away from direct sunlight to prevent potential damage to the leather. Allow the bag to sit undisturbed for at least 48 hours. During this time, the newspapers will absorb the unwanted odors from the bag. Step 7: Unwrap and assess After the allotted time has passed, carefully untie the knot and unwrap the newspapers from your leather bag. Empty the bag of crumbled newspapers and assess the smell. If the odor has been sufficiently absorbed, you can now go ahead and enjoy using your revitalized leather bag. If the smell persists, repeat the process – sometimes stubborn odors may require more than one round of treatment. Conclusion A smelly leather bag can be frustrating and off-putting, but with this effective method utilizing newspapers, you can restore its pleasant aroma, maintain its aesthetic appeal, and extend its lifespan. Simple, affordable, and environmentally conscious, this technique is an excellent option the next time you find yourself dealing with an odor-affected leather bag."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

To do this, we can add 143 to both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant -143. 96*p - 143 + 143 = 49 + 143 Step 3: Simplify the equation Now, we simplify both sides of the equation: 96*p = 192 Step 4: Solve for p To find the value of p, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 96: (96*p) / 96 = 192 / 96 Step 5: Simplify the result Simplify the expression to get the value of p: p = 2 So the solution to the equation 96*p - 143 = 49 is p = 2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Inspector Gadget Context: John Brown is a security guard working at the Bradford robotics laboratory in Riverton, Ohio, run by Artemus Bradford and his daughter Brenda, whom Brown is attracted to. Brown wishes to become a police officer, with support from his niece Penny. Brenda and Artemus create a lifelike robotic foot as part of the Gadget Program, to create cybernetically augmented police officers. Tycoon Sanford Scolex attacks the lab, steals the foot, and has Artemus murdered before escaping in his limo. Brown chases him down in his car, which leads to it being destroyed by Scolex's explosive cigar, leaving Brown for dead, but a bowling ball coming from the fiery blast of Brown's destroyed car crushes Scolex's hand, forcing him to replace it with a mechanical claw. Brown survives the explosion, but is seriously injured. He becomes the first test subject for the Gadget Program, as a cyborg with countless gadgets he can activate by saying \\"Go, Go, Gadget\\". Under Brenda's guidance, Brown becomes Inspector Gadget. Scolex creates the alias \\"Claw\\" and uses the stolen technology to create his own robot for global domination, aided by his minions Kramer and Sykes, but the attempts fail. Much to the irritation of Chief Quimby, Gadget joins the police department, aided by his talking advanced car, the Gadgetmobile. However, Quimby refuses to give Gadget the Bradford case and instead assigns him to mediocre jobs, prompting Gadget to secretly investigate the case himself. Examining the evidence, he finds a connection to Scolexâs company, which Brenda has now gone to work for. Breaking into Scolex's lab, he locates the foot but is taken captive by Scolex, who discovers Gadget is powered by a processor chip, which Scolex removes, and has Sykes dump Gadget in a junkyard.

Police at New Orleans international airport shoot man brandishing machete A police officer shot a machete-wielding man at the New Orleans international airport on Friday night, after the man sprayed several airport security agents with wasp spray. Police officials said Richard White, 63, was carrying six molotov cocktails in a bag when he walked into an airport security checkpoint, where he was confronted by a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) official who wanted to see his boarding pass. White then used the wasp spray on the official before pulling a machete from his waistband and wielding it toward officers in Concourse B of the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport. An agent blocked the machete with a piece of luggage, then White ran through the metal detector, according to the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office. The on-duty police officer stationed at the checkpoint, sheriff’s office lieutenant Heather Slyve, drew her weapon at White, who continued to come toward her with the machete. She shot him three times, hitting his left chest area, left facial area and left thigh. One TSA official was struck by a bullet and a bystander was grazed by a bullet. Others acquired minor injuries like bruises and scratches in the melee, which occurred just before 8pm. Travelers said some people ran and screamed in the airport after hearing the gunshots. Some people also tried to run back into a recently de-boarded plane. Nicole Danjean, who was flying to Washington DC for a wedding, told the Times-Picayune she heard three or four gunshots. “Mostly everybody was getting down to the ground and trying to hide under chairs,” Danjean said. White was transported to University Hospital and was “unresponsive” on Friday night, but is now said to be hospitalized with gunshot wounds. Police have not determined White’s motivation for carrying out the attack, but White’s family has been cooperating with the investigation and Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand suggested that White has had “mental health issues”. White was also found with material that comes from smoke bombs, said Normand at a Saturday news conference. “I know there have been a lot of questions as to whether or not we believe there’s any national security threat or anything along those lines,” Normand said at a press conference on Friday night. “At this point in time, we don’t have any information that leads us to believe that’s the case.” Normand said White’s last known residence was about two miles from the airport and that he worked as a taxi driver.

This suggests that, at least during that specific time period, the EPA did not explicitly permit or encourage sending comments via facsimile.

This statement contradicts the premise, as the premise does not show any evidence of the EPA desiring facsimile comments at all, let alone \\"all the time.\\" The hypothesis contradicts the evidence provided in the premise.

Given the question: You are presented with the question \\"Leaves that keep the plant from what are used for storing water by some plants?\\" and the following answer choices: - drying out - absorbing liquid - bacteria - cold air - staying damp - dormant state - toxins - keeping moist Now knowing that waxy leaves are used for storing water by some plants and waxy leaves keep the plant from drying out, choose the best answer. The answer is:","completion":"\\"drying out\\" To understand the rationale behind this answer, let's first explore the purpose and usage of the waxy leaves in plants. The term \\"waxy leaves\\" refers to leaves that have a shiny, waxy finish, which is actually a protective layer on the leaf's surface. This layer of wax is known as the cuticle and it plays a significant role in the plant's water management and serves as a barrier against environmental factors like air and water. It mainly helps in preventing water loss from the leaves. During the process of photosynthesis, plants absorb carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil to convert it into glucose and oxygen. This process must occur in a moist environment but if the weather is too dry or hot, a plant can lose water faster than it absorbs water. This can lead to the leaves drying out which can inhibit photosynthesis and, therefore, the plant's survival. So, some plants, especially those in arid or semi-arid areas, are able to conserve water and survive in these harsh conditions by having waxy leaves. By slowing the rate of water loss, these leaves enable the plant to store water and survive periods of drought. On the other hand, options such as \\"absorbing liquid\\", \\"bacteria\\", \\"cold air\\", \\"staying damp\\", \\"dormant state\\", \\"toxins\\", \\"keeping moist\\" do not align with the purpose of waxy leaves or their function of storing water. They may relate to other plant processes or responses to different environmental factors, but not specifically to storing water to prevent drying out. Hence, given that waxy leaves keep the plant from drying out, the best answer is \\"drying out\\". In conclusion, among the provided options, \\"drying out\\" is the best answer that properly identifies the function of the waxy leaves in helping the plant to store water and thereby, prevent drying out."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer?","completion":"Germany is the European Union (EU) country with the greatest population. Located in central Europe, Germany comprises 16 federal states, known as Bundesländer. As one of the founding members of the European Union, it plays a significant role in various aspects of the EU's political, economic, and social spheres. Based on the most recent data from Eurostat as of January 2021, Germany's population is estimated at around 83.2 million people, making it not only the most populous EU country but also the most populous nation in Europe after Russia, which is not an EU member state. The high population of Germany can be attributed to various factors such as the nation's rich history, economic strength, and social systems. Germany has a long tradition of immigration, with a significant proportion of its population consisting of migrants or descendants of migrants from different parts of the world. This has led to a diverse and multicultural society, which has contributed to the overall growth of the nation. Furthermore, Germany's strong economy, which is the largest in Europe and the fourth largest globally, has attracted skilled workers, as well as entrepreneurs and students from across the globe. The country is known for its high living standards, strong education systems, and a vibrant cultural scene, which all contribute to its attractiveness to international talent and migration. Moreover, Germany's social security system and healthcare services are considered to be among the best in the world, providing a robust support structure for its inhabitants. This social infrastructure encourages people to move to and stay in Germany, further contributing to its population growth. To sum up, Germany is the country with the greatest population in the European Union, predominantly due to its rich history, economic strength, diverse population, and well-developed social systems. With approximately 83.2 million residents, it is an influential member state of the EU and a key player in the global arena."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Donald Trump's proposed Muslim immigrant ban disqualifies him from the presidency: White House The White House on Tuesday said Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump's call for the United States to ban Muslims from entering the country disqualified him from becoming president and called on Republicans to reject him immediately. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Trump's campaign had a \\"dustbin of history\\" quality to it and said his comments were offensive and toxic. Earnest said other Republican presidential candidates, who have pledged to support the person who eventually wins their party's nomination, should disavow Trump \\"right now.\\" Trump, meanwhile, spent Tuesday defending his plan, which he likened to Second World War policies implemented by then U.S. president Franklin Roosevelt against people of Japanese, German and Italian descent. \\"What I'm doing is no different than FDR,\\" Trump said on ABC's Good Morning America in one of a round of heated television interviews where he defended his plan in the wake of last week's California shooting spree by two Muslims who authorities said were radicalized. \\"We have no choice but to do this,\\" the candidate seeking the Republican nomination in the 2016 presidential race told ABC. \\"We have people that want to blow up our buildings, our cities. We have to figure out what's going on.\\" Still, Trump said that Roosevelt's policies were worse. During the Second World War, more than 110,000 people were forcibly detained in U.S. government detention camps. Roosevelt issued the policies immediately after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, authorizing law enforcement to target \\"alien enemies.\\" In an unusually lengthy interview on MSNBC, Trump said he did not know how long the ban on Muslims would last. \\"Until we can get our hands around the situation, we have to do something and we have to do it now,\\" he said. Critics have said Trump's plan rejects American values by singling out people based on their religion and would also likely be illegal and unconstitutional. The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees freedom of religion. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson on Tuesday said Trump's plan is not only offensive, but would undermine U.S. security by thwarting efforts to connect with the Muslim community. \\"It is irresponsible to do this and contrary to our national security efforts,\\" Johnson, who earlier had declined to comment on the Republican presidential candidate's proposal, told MSNBC in an interview. Trump's was the most dramatic response by a presidential candidate following the San Bernardino, Calif., rampage, even as other Republicans have called for a suspension to U.S. President Barack Obama's plan to allow 10,000 refugees from Syria. The proposal drew a fresh wave of criticism on Tuesday from fellow Republicans, U.S. lawmakers and others. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, told reporters the plan is \\"not conservatism\\" and was not in the nation's interest. The proposal was criticized in France, which had its worst attacks since the Second World War on Nov. 13 when shootings and suicide bombings in Paris killed 130 people. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, in a post on Twitter, said \\"Mr Trump, like others, is feeding hatred and misinformation. Our only enemy is radical Islam.\\" Monsieur Trump, comme d'autres, entretient la haine et les amalgames : notre SEUL ennemi, c'est l'islamisme radical. Two international refugee organizations also rejected Trump's comments, saying U.S. presidential campaign rhetoric threatens resettlement efforts. Muslims in Pakistan and Indonesia also denounced the plan. On Tuesday, Trump reiterated that a ban would last until Congress acts. He also said Muslim Americans would be allowed back into the country after an overseas trip. Asked about its implementation, Trump told MSNBC that people would be asked about their religion at U.S. borders and that the ban would extend to Muslim leaders of other nations. In a confrontational exchange with CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, Trump, his voice hoarse, defended such measures as necessary: \\"We're at war. Get it through your head, Chris.\\" Trump said he did not support internment camps, which Roosevelt had set up during Second World War. \\"I don't want to bring ... them back at all,\\" Trump said on ABC. He added his plan had \\"tremendous support\\" from thousands of people who \\"just want to see something happen.\\" Polls have shown a stark divide between Republicans and Democrats in how they view Muslims. During past disputes with Republicans, Trump, a former Democrat, has pledged not to launch an independent bid outside of the party. On Tuesday, Trump dismissed the prospect of the party rebuking him for his comments. \\"There's no problem. I'm just doing the right thing,\\" he told CNN. One of his rivals, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, on Tuesday urged fellow Republicans to swiftly reject Trump. \\"This is not a policy debate,\\" he told MSNBC. \\"You need to stand up for our party and our country.\\"","completion":"The White House has announced that Donald Trump's call for the US to ban all Muslims from entering the country disqualifies him from becoming President, and urged Republicans to reject him immediately. While Trump has spent time defending his plan, saying that it is no different to WWII policies enacted by then US President Franklin Roosevelt, critics argue that the plan rejects American values and singles people out based on their religion. They also claim that it would probably be illegal and unconstitutional, since the First Amendment of the US Constitution guarantees freedom of religion."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What are the last names of the two people hired to join Opeth after De Farfalla and Nordin left? Opeth recorded its debut album, Orchid, with producer Dan Swanö in April 1994. Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records, the album was not released until May 15, 1995, and only in Europe. Orchid tested the boundaries of traditional death metal, featuring acoustic guitars, piano, and clean vocals.After a few live shows in the United Kingdom, Opeth returned to the studio in March 1996 to begin work on a second album, again produced by Dan Swanö. The album was named Morningrise, and was released in Europe on June 24, 1996. With only five songs, but lasting 66 minutes, it features Opeth's longest song, the twenty-minute \\"Black Rose Immortal\\". Opeth toured the UK in support of Morningrise, followed by a 26-date Scandinavian tour with Cradle of Filth. While on tour, Opeth attracted the attention of Century Media Records, who signed the band and released the first two albums in the United States in 1997.In 1997, after the tour, Åkerfeldt and Lindgren dismissed De Farfalla for personal reasons, without the consent of Nordin. When Åkerfeldt informed Nordin, who was on a vacation in Brazil, Nordin left the band and remained in Brazil for personal reasons. Former Eternal members, drummer Martín López (formerly of Amon Amarth) and bassist Martín Méndez, responded to an ad at a music shop placed by Åkerfeldt. López and Méndez were fans of the band and took the ads down themselves so no other musicians could apply for the job. Åkerfeldt and Lindgren did not want the Martíns to join at first, due to them already knowing each other; they felt that they wanted two strangers so that there wouldn't be two camps in the band, but eventually hired both. López made his debut with Opeth playing on a cover version of Iron Maiden's \\"Remember Tomorrow\\", which was included on the album A Call to Irons: A Tribute to Iron Maiden.With a larger recording budget from Century Media, Opeth began work on its third album, with noted Swedish producer Fredrik Nordström, at Studio Fredman in August 1997.

Given the question: Process: - Add water to a pot - Put the pot over a source of heat - Turn the heat on - Wait for a few minutes - Begin to observe small bubbles in the water - Wait until the water starts to bubble a lot - Wait until you can see steam rising from the water - Turn the heat source off - Take the pot off of the heat source. Question: suppose a smaller vessel is used happens, how will it affect FASTER boiling. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","completion":"Using a smaller vessel will generally result in FASTER boiling of the water. This is because a smaller vessel has a smaller surface area, which allows the heat to be more concentrated and directly transferred to the water. As a result, the energy required to raise the temperature of the water within the smaller vessel is reached more quickly, leading to faster boiling. Regarding the second effect mentioned, which is the formation of small bubbles in the water as it starts to heat up, using a smaller vessel may have a MORE significant effect on this process. This is because, in a smaller vessel, the water is more restricted and has less space to move around and expand. Consequently, when the heat is applied and the water temperature rises, the formation of bubbles will likely occur at a faster rate due to the increased pressure and close proximity of water molecules within the smaller vessel. Moreover, these bubbles may be more concentrated and accumulate rapidly, indicating that the water is approaching its boiling point. In summary, using a smaller vessel can have a more significant impact on both the rate of boiling and the formation of bubbles during the heating process. The water in the smaller vessel will boil faster, and the bubbling effect corresponding to the temperature increase will also be more pronounced, with the bubbles forming more quickly and with more intensity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Due to economic sanctions and trade embargoes, Cuban citizens primarily use cars designed in the late 1940s and early 1950s. These cars contain engines that were designed before the introduction of the catalytic converter. Meanwhile trade relations between nearby Panama and Japan have enabled the citizens of Panama to drive cars with the most up to date catalytic converter technology possible. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which country's cars, Cuba's or Panama's, will emit less carbon monoxide? Answer:","completion":"Panama's cars will emit less carbon monoxide. Step 1: Understand the impact of catalytic converter on carbon monoxide emissions. Catalytic converters are designed to reduce harmful emissions from vehicles, including carbon monoxide. They do this by converting harmful pollutants like carbon monoxide into less harmful substances. Step 2: Assess the presence of catalytic converters in Cuban and Panamanian cars. Cuban cars are primarily from the late 1940s and early 1950s and have engines designed before the introduction of catalytic converters. This means that they likely do not have catalytic converters. On the other hand, Panamanian cars have the most up-to-date catalytic converter technology due to trade relations with Japan. Step 3: Compare emission levels between Cuban and Panamanian cars. Considering that Panamanian cars have up-to-date catalytic converter technology and Cuban cars most likely do not, it can be concluded that Panama's cars will emit less carbon monoxide than Cuba's cars. This is because the catalytic converters in Panamanian cars are designed specifically to lower emissions like carbon monoxide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This woman had not been very supportive of me in my role ever since I began working there. I couldn’t figure out if she was arrogant or lacking in self esteem. During this meeting / confrontation, she told me, in no uncertain terms, just what she didn’t like about some recent decisions I had made. I listened to her speak for about 30 minutes. She, quite methodically, tore me apart. Initially, I had planned to hear her out, make a few vague remarks, and send her on her way, thinking that maybe she just needed to be heard. But about 20 minutes into her harangue, I had a change of heart. I decided that, if she asked for a response for me, if she asked my advice, I was going to tell her exactly what I thought. She did, in fact, ask me for a response. I asked her if she was a happy person, and said that I suspected that she was not, as she came across as a bully and was acting like a horrible person. She sat and looked at me, then burst into tears. I waited. Looking up, she said, “Yes, you are correct. I am a horrible person. And I am miserable. What can I do?” We spent some time discussing what she could do, and (even though I didn’t want to take the time to do it) I asked her if she would like a mentor — me? She said that she would like such a thing. This woman and I ended up becoming fairly, no, very good friends and she has been one of my strongest supporters. I didn’t expect that.

It is similar to other supposed lake monsters in Scotland and elsewhere, and is often described as being large in size, with a long neck and one or more humps protruding from the water. Popular interest and belief in the creature has varied since it was brought to worldwide attention in 1933.

American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (\\"\\") propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia. - An American comic book is a thin (typically 32-page) periodical containing primarily comics content. - Michael Butterworth (born 1947) is a British author and publisher who has written novels and short stories in the science fiction genre.

Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \\"Famous Funnies\\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \\"comic book\\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone. - The First Men in the Moon is a scientific romance published in 1901 by the English author H. G. Wells, who called it one of his \\"fantastic stories\\". The novel tells the story of a journey to the moon undertaken by the two protagonists, a businessman narrator, Mr. Bedford, and an eccentric scientist, Mr. Cavor. Bedford and Cavor discover that the moon is inhabited by a sophisticated extraterrestrial civilization of insect-like creatures they call \\"Selenites\\". - A comic strip is a sequence of drawings arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative, often serialized, with text in balloons and captions. Traditionally, throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, these have been published in newspapers and magazines, with horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers, while Sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections. With the development of the internet, they began to appear online as web comics. There were more than 200 different comic strips and daily cartoon panels in American newspapers alone each day for most of the 20th century, for a total of at least 7,300,000 episodes. - Fleetway Publications was a magazine publishing company based in London.

During the Paleocene, the continents continued to drift toward their present positions. Supercontinent Laurasia had not yet separated into three continents. Europe and Greenland were still connected.

The Laramide orogeny of the late Cretaceous continued to uplift the Rocky Mountains in the American west, which ended in the succeeding epoch. South and North America remained separated by equatorial seas (they joined during the Neogene); the components of the former southern supercontinent Gondwana continued to split apart, with Africa, South America, Antarctica and Australia pulling away from each other.

At that time, South and North America were still separated by equatorial seas, and they only joined during the Neogene Period, which started about 23 million years ago. In the Paleocene Epoch, the supercontinent Laurasia, comprising Europe, Greenland, and North America, had not yet separated into three distinct landmasses.

Along with the new Will Ferrell/Zach Galifianakis flick “The Campaign,” moviegoers this weekend will also be able to choose from “The Bourne Legacy,” Meryl Streep’s “Hope Springs” and Rashida Jones and Andy Samberg in “Celeste and Jesse Forever.” Here’s what the Post critics had to say about all these new releases and more: “The Bourne Legacy” (PG-13) “Gilroy has fulfilled the movie’s second requirement with similar success, casting Jeremy Renner in a leading role that asks him to carry ‘The Bourne Legacy’ while easily co-existing with the titular ghost that haunts the franchise.” — Ann Hornaday “The Campaign” (R) “If only because of the actors involved, “The Campaign” has its share of laughs, which in a script penned by Chris Henchy and Shawn Harwell tends toward the broadest possible takes on slapstick, sophomoric sexuality and post-“Hangover” raunch.” — Ann Hornaday “Celeste and Jesse Forever” (R) “‘Celeste and Jesse Forever’ — which Rashida Jones co-wrote and stars in — turns into yet one more of a series of summer films in which attractive, ambitious young women are punished for not accepting the man-children in their lives despite their torn-teddy-bear flaws.” — Ann Hornaday “Hope Springs” (PG-13) “Within a Hollywood tradition accustomed to treating sex as something titillating, taboo, gauzily idealized or downright pornographic, finally someone has made a movie that treats it in the riskiest way possible: as the physical expression of intimacy between two flawed but recognizable adults.” — Ann Hornaday “Easy Money” (R) “Crime thriller meets cautionary tale in the riveting Swedish film ‘Easy Money,’ which warns moviegoers about greed, one of the seven deadly sins. Most viewers don’t necessarily need the reminder, but rarely are the avalanche-like effects of avarice so vividly and terrifyingly brought to life.” — Stephanie Merry “The Imposter” (R) “‘The Imposter’ follows the rules of documentary. The film doesn’t pretend to answer all of the questions about the still-unsolved case of Nicholas Barclay. But what’s most fascinating are the movie’s larger questions about why some people tell impossible lies — and why others believe them.” — Mark Jenkins “360” (PG-13) “...Though the cinematography looks sleek, with shots through windows and in mirrors, split screens and city lights that blur and sharpen, the stories equate to a tangled mess.” — Stephanie Merry What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article discusses new movie releases, including \\"The Campaign\\" starring Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis, \\"The Bourne Legacy\\" with Jeremy Renner, Meryl Streep's \\"Hope Springs\\", and \\"Celeste and Jesse Forever\\" featuring Rashida Jones and Andy Samberg.

Hypothesis: The governor of Texas did not like what he was doing but he did it anyway.","completion":"The provided context doesn't necessarily support the hypothesis that the Texas governor did not like what he was doing, but did it anyway. The context suggests that the governor made certain decisions regarding the allocation of budgetary spending, but no information is provided as to whether he did or did not appreciate the decisions he made. In the context cited, there's a comparison made between the two paths the governor could have taken in terms of a state budget decision - a proposed measure to expand children's healthcare coverage or cutting taxes, with a notable portion of the latter believed to be beneficial to the wealthy. The referenced context indicates that the Texas governor chose the path of tax cuts over the expansion of health coverage for children. This choice could have been rooted in a multitude of reasons such as aligning with his party values, certain fiscal ideologies, political strategies, or catering to a specific constituent base. However, the context does not indicate in any way whether the governor was unhappy or reluctant with this decision, nor does it suggest that he acted against his will or preferences. The narrative only provides us with the action he took, but does not delve into the emotions, sentiments, or personal opinion that the governor might have had about this decision. In conclusion, the drawn hypothesis, \\"The governor of Texas did not like what he was doing but he did it anyway,\\" cannot be reliably or conclusively substantiated solely from the given context as it does not offer insights into the governor's emotional state or personal point of view regarding the taken action. It's critical to not over-interpret or misinterpret available textual information in forming our hypotheses. Any conclusion about the governor's sentiment would be pure conjecture in the absence of explicit or inferable evidence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The navy bombed the ship.","completion":"The sentence \\"The navy bombed the ship\\" is a simple declarative sentence which conveys the action of a navy attacking a ship using explosive weapons, such as bombs or missiles. To analyze the effect of this statement, a few aspects need to be considered: the grammatical structure, denotation, connotation, and possible implications. 1. Grammatical Structure: The sentence structure consists of a subject (The navy), a verb (bombed), and an object (the ship). This arrangement indicates an action undertaken by an agent (The navy) and a target (the ship) that was affected by the action. The use of the past tense verb (bombed) shows that the event has already occurred. 2. Denotation: The direct meaning of the sentence informs the reader or listener that a naval force carried out an attack which involved bombs or other explosive weaponry, targeting a ship. At face value, the statement unequivocally describes an aggressive act by a military entity. 3. Connotation: The sentence carries various connotations, depending on the reader or listener's perspective. It could be interpreted as an act of aggression or retaliation, a defensive strategy, or an unfortunate occurrence during a conflict or war. The specific navy involved is not mentioned, nor is the type of ship, which leaves room for interpretation and personal opinions. 4. Possible Implications: The sentence \\"The navy bombed the ship\\" can lead to several potential implications and questions, such as: a. Context: Without further context, the reasons behind the bombing are unclear. This could prompt the reader or listener to seek more information regarding the conflict, the parties involved, and the motivations behind the bombing. b. Political Implications: Depending on the identity of the involved navy and the ship's affiliation, the event described in the sentence could lead to geopolitical tensions, international conflicts, or diplomatic responses. Again, this might prompt further inquiry about the broader context. c. Military Significance: The sentence shows an intentional and organized military action, which could indicate increased tensions in a region, an ongoing war, or a recent escalation of hostilities. d. Humanitarian Impact: Bombing a ship can lead to significant loss of life, environmental damage, or the destruction of resources. The sentence may evoke questions and concerns about casualties and displaced people, as well as the environmental impact of the bombing. e. Emotional Response: Depending on one's values, political allegiance, or empathy toward the involved parties, this sentence could evoke various emotions, such as anger, sorrow, approval, or disapproval. In conclusion, the effect of the sentence \\"The navy bombed the ship\\" is a direct representation of a military action involving a naval force and a ship as the target. The statement generates numerous further questions and can lead to different interpretations and emotional responses due to its connotations and potential implications.

Step 1: Understand the context The context is that Sid explains his theory to Mark. Step 2: Analyze the statement The statement given is: \\"Sid explained his theory to Mark, but he couldn't convince him.\\" Here, the pronoun \\"he\\" can refer to either Sid or Mark, and the \\"him\\" can refer to Sid or Mark as well. So, there are two possible interpretations: A) \\"Sid explained his theory to Mark, but (Sid) couldn't convince (Mark).\\" B) \\"Sid explained his theory to Mark, but (Mark) couldn't convince (Sid).\\" Step 3: Determine which interpretation is correct Using context clues, we know that Sid is the one explaining his theory to Mark, so it's more likely that the sentence is discussing whether or not Sid can convince Mark rather than the other way around. This leads us to believe that interpretation A is more accurate. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, it is possible to draw the conclusion that \\"Mark couldn't convince him\\" if we consider interpretation B as the intended meaning of the statement.

Q: The skeleton of lampreys is made of what? Choices: - ligament - collagen - chitin - cartilage A: A:","completion":"The skeleton of lampreys is made of cartilage. Lampreys are a unique group of ancient jawless fish called Agnatha, existing for over 360 million years. As one of the oldest vertebrates, they possess several distinctive features that set them apart from their modern counterparts. The lamprey's internal skeleton is composed of cartilaginous materials instead of bone. Cartilage is a flexible, semi-rigid connective tissue found in various structures in the body, such as the nose, ears, and joints. In lampreys, the cartilaginous skeleton provides structural integrity and support to the body while allowing it to retain its flexibility and movement. Cartilage is a light and porous material composed of specialized cells called chondrocytes. These cells secrete the extracellular matrix, which mainly consists of collagen and water. Collagen is a fibrous protein that forms a strong and flexible meshwork, accounting for about 30% of the cartilage's dry weight. Since cartilage lacks the dense calcium deposits found in bone, the lamprey's skeleton remains comparatively lightweight. Ligament, another option, is also composed primarily of collagen fibers; however, its function is primarily to connect bones together within the body, providing stability to joints. Both cartilage and ligaments contain collagen, but they differ in their roles concerning skeletal support and maintaining joint integrity. Lampreys do not have a fully ossified skeleton, making ligament a less appropriate choice for their primary skeletal component. Chitin is another common structural component found in nature, but it is not present in lampreys. Chitin is a complex carbohydrate that forms the exoskeleton of arthropods like insects, crustaceans, and arachnids. Since it composes the external structures of these invertebrate animals, chitin is not used in the internal skeletal system of lampreys. In summary, the lamprey's skeleton is primarily composed of cartilage. This unique feature helps them maintain a flexible and lightweight physique while navigating their aquatic environments. In comparison, ligaments, collagen, and chitin serve different functional roles in vertebrates and invertebrates, but none are the primary structural component of a lamprey's internal skeleton."},{"prompt":"Q:Which Renaissance dramatist co-wrote Anything for a Quiet Life with John Webster?

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Fish species are expected to shrink in size by up to 24% because of global warming, say scientists. The scientists argue that failure to control greenhouse gas emissions will have a greater effect on marine ecosystems than previously thought. Previous research has suggested that changing ocean temperatures would affect both the distribution and the reproductive abilities of many species of fish. This new work suggests that fish size would also be heavily affected. The researchers built a model to see how fish would react to lower levels of oxygen in the water. As ocean temperatures increase, so do the body temperatures of fish. But, according to lead author, Dr William Cheung, from the University of British Columbia, the lower level of oxygen in the water is key. Warmer waters could decrease ocean oxygen levels and greatly reduce fish body weight. On the other hand, rising temperatures directly increase the metabolic rate of the fish's body function. This leads to an increase in oxygen demand for normal body activities. So the fish will run out of oxygen for growth at a smaller body size. The research team also used its model to predict fish movements as a result of warming waters. The group believes that most fish populations will move towards the Earth's poles at a rate of up to 35km per decade. \\"So in, say, the North Sea,\\" says Dr Cheung,\\" one would expect to see more smaller-body fish from tropical waters in the future.\\" Taking these factors into consideration, the research team concludes that fish body size will shrink between 14% and 24%, with the largest decreases in the Indian and Atlantic oceans. When compared with actual observations of fish sizes, the model seems to _ what's actually happening in the seas. The researchers looked at two case studies involving North Atlantic cod and haddock. They found that recorded data on these fish showed greater decreases in body size than the models had predicted.

Answer the following question: Background: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators. Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] Paragraph: Two coastal communities on two neighboring gulfs took different approaches to bringing more money into the local economy. Davin village continued with commercial fishing and agriculture, while the village of Forx decided to mine sand from the nearby dunes, because it was very profitable. They did not think about the effect it would have on the environment.

Context: Greg Tenorly drove the familiar route from the church to his music studio, studying the homes along the way. He wondered about the families who lived in each one. Like that two-story brick on the corner. What secrets were they hiding? Was the husband abusive? Did a teenager use drugs? Was the family nearly bankrupt? How could anyone know? It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived. Greg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost. Greg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance. Greg gladly paid 4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back. He said it was like losing a member of the family. Greg felt bad, but not bad enough to give up the car. How could a 40-year-old car have only 93,000 miles on it? It was dazzling. His little studio was near the town square, nestled between Coreyville Hardware and Susie's Sewing Box. Occasionally he and a student could hear a pipe wrench or hammer hitting the floor on the hardware side. But things were always quiet from Susie's side. At least the soundproofing he had installed kept his neighbors from hearing his students. You can't teach music without hearing both beautiful sounds and sour notes.

Over half of the children surveyed said they had been bullied by a sibling, and one in three said they had been hit,kicked or pushed by a sibling, others complained of name-calling and having their belongings stolen. Other reasons for only children being much happier include not having to compete for parents' attention or share bedrooms with a sibling, said Gundi Knies, a researcher on the project.

He pulled them out of their car, stuck on light-rail tracks in Folsom, California, about 90 seconds before a train smashed into it. McHugh, 17, was northbound on his way to meet friends when the silver car in front of him turned off the road, went into a ditch and jolted to a stop on the tracks. McHugh jumped out of his vehicle and went to help. The driver, a woman who police say had fallen asleep, was behind the wheel and dazed. Her two daughters aged 7 and 10, were in the back seat, buckled in. McHugh took the woman's hand and helped her from the car. She unbuckled the kids. Another driver who had pulled over to help shouted that a train was coming, McHugh recalled. Police said the other man ran along the tracks and tried to wave down the train. It was dark and there was a bend in the tracks. The train operator probably never saw him. McHugh said the driver applied the brakes, but the train was still going fast when it came up on them. The woman, her daughters and McHugh took shelter behind his truck as the train smashed into their car, dragging it down the tracks, the teenager said. The woman's car was destroyed. Officials said the train was damaged. But none of the crew and four passengers were injured. Police said the outcome could have been far worse: \\"Had she sat there for another minute or two, she and her daughters could have been in that vehicle when the train struck it, and they could have been severely injured or killed.\\" McHugh said he \\"didn't do anything anyone else wouldn't have done.\\" Options: A It was risky for the woman to drive with two babies.

Mechanically scanned, 30-line television broadcasts by John Logie Baird began in 1929, using the BBC transmitter in London, and by 1930 a regular schedule of programmes was transmitted from the BBC antenna in Brookmans Park. Television production was switched from Baird's company to what is now known as BBC One on 2 August 1932, and continued until September 1935. Regularly scheduled electronically scanned television began from Alexandra Palace in London on 2 November 1936, to just a few hundred viewers in the immediate area. The first programme broadcast – and thus the first ever, on a dedicated TV channel – was \\"Opening of the BBC Television Service\\" at 15:00. The first major outside broadcast was the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in May 1937. The service was reaching an estimated 25,000–40,000 homes before the outbreak of World War II which caused the service to be suspended in September 1939. The VHF broadcasts would have provided an ideal radio beacon for German bombers homing in on London, and the engineers and technicians of the service would be needed for the war effort, in particular the radar programme.

The film will be on in the UK on 26 October 2012 and in the United States on 9 November 2012. It has been 50 years since Sean Connery was announced as the first man to play Bond in the film named Dr No. Do you expect Skyfall which is the 23rdfilm in the 007 series? At London's Corinthi a Hotel, the official gave a little information about the storyline: Bond's loyal attitude toward his boss Miss M will be tested when one of her past staff comes back to hurt her. As MI6 is in danger, 007 needs to solve problems and protect MI6 whatever it costs. Mendes, who won a best director Oscar for 1999's American Beauty, told fans that Skyfall would have all the features of a classic Bond movie, such as a lot of action. \\"Daniel Craig is back for a third time as 007 along with Dame Judi Dench as his boss Miss M.\\" said Mendes. Many famous actors and actresses who have Oscar wins and nominations are included, but the filmmakers remain keeping their roles in the film secret. Producers are showing no signs of cutting off the cost of Skyfall. \\"It is at the same level as the 2008's Quantum of Solace, which cost about 200m. The film will be made in the Whitehall, Scotland, China and Turkey, as well as Pinewood Studios.\\" Said a producer. Why has 007 been popular for so long? Professor James Chapman of Leicester University, the author of the book A Cultural History of the James Bond Films, said, \\"They manage to let each new film meet the changes not just in society but in the popular taste of film culture. That lets each generation get their own Bond.\\" Question: The task of James Bond in the new James Bond film is to _ .

Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways. My husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him. I was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable. My husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex — not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy. I often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me. And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer. At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he’d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would “cure” him. Feeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken. I felt betrayed, confused, angry, sad, and yet, miraculously relieved. There was nothing wrong with me — I was just not his type. The emotions flew through me leaving my head and heart confused.

Step 1: Simplify both sides of the equation. On the left side, combine the 'l' terms: -11*l - 23*l = (-11 - 23) * l = -34 * l So, the left side becomes -34*l. On the right side, we have: l - 0*l = l - 0 (because 0 times anything is 0) The right side remains as l. Now, our simplified equation looks like this: -34*l = l Step 2: Solve for 'l' To isolate 'l', we'll add 34*l to both sides of the equation to get rid of the -34*l term on the left side: -34*l + 34*l = l + 34*l Now, this simplifies to: 0 = 35*l Next, to find the value of 'l', we'll divide both sides of the equation by 35: 0 ÷ 35 = 35*l ÷ 35 This gives us: 0 = l So, the solution to the equation -11*l - 23*l = l - 0*l for l is: l = 0"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's a detailed comparison of each option and the reasons why a drinking glass is the best answer. A. Jar: Jars are more often used to store food items like jams, pickles, and sauces or for canning. Though they may occasionally be employed to hold drinks, this is less frequent and not as common as other available options. B. Cup: While cups are also used to hold liquids for drinking, they tend to be less specific in their purpose. Cups can be used to hold both hot and cold liquids, and might not always be the most convenient or practical choice. Additionally, the term cup is more ambiguous and can refer to a wide variety of items, such as a measuring cup, a teacup, or paper cup. C. Drinking Glass: Drinking glasses are specifically designed for holding and consuming liquid beverages. They come in a variety of types and sizes, and are made from materials like glass or plastic, making them suitable for most types of liquid. Drinking glasses are ubiquitous and often the most common go-to option when having a drink, whether it's water, juice, or any other beverage. D. Container: The term \\"container\\" is quite broad and encompasses any receptacle that can hold a substance. In the context of holding a liquid for drinking purposes, container would not be the most likely choice unless the other more specific options were not available. E. Tankard: Tankards are typically large, cylindrical drinking vessels with a handle and sometimes a hinged lid. While historically they have been used to hold and consume beer or other alcoholic beverages, they are not as commonly used in modern times - especially for non-alcoholic beverages. In conclusion, based on the evidence presented, C. drinking glass is the best answer, as it is specifically designed for holding and consuming liquids and is the most commonly used option for this purpose out of the given choices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield. Two farms used AM fungi for the plants. Brown farm also decided to grow cover crops on those parcels of land to help mycorrhizal growth. Orange farm didn't grow cover crops. Which farm didn't provide extended time for AM fungi growth into the autumn? Answer:","completion":"Orange farm didn't provide extended time for AM fungi growth into the autumn.

Amanda Knox's retrial over the murder of Meredith Kercher opened in Florence today - but neither the American student nor her Italian ex-boyfriend was there to see the start of proceedings. Instead, the 26-year-old was photographed taking a walk in her home town of Seattle, more than 5,000 miles from the the trial. Miss Knox has said she will not return to Italy where she is accused of murdering her British roommate in 2007. Scroll down for video. Amanda Knox was all smiles in the rain in Seattle, Washington, as she chatted on the phone while picking up supplies at a pet store ahead of the re-trial in Italy. Knox and her one-time lover Rafaelle Sollecito served four years in jail for the murder of Meredith Kercher, who was found semi-naked with her throat slit in the flat she shared with Knox in Perugia, Italy. Both were freed on appeal in 2011 but in March this year Italy’s highest court sensationally ordered them to face retrial. In June judges published the reasons for that decision, saying the ruling by the appeal court that freed them was full of ‘deficiencies contradictions and illogical conclusions’. Knox has said that her decision not to attend the re-trial was ‘common sense’. Amanda Knox, pictured in Seattle at the weekend, left, has said her decision not to attend the re-trial for murdering fellow student Meredith Kercher, right, was 'common sense' ‘I was imprisoned as an innocent person and I just can’t re-live that,’ said told NBC television. In a memoir released earlier this year, Knox sought to portray herself as a naive young woman railroaded by a foreign justice system and not a callous sexual deviant as she was painted in many reports after her initial conviction.

Neither Knox nor Sollecito were present at the start of the retrial. Knox was spotted in her home town of Seattle, 5,000 miles away from the trial. She has stated that she will not return to Italy, where she is accused of murdering her British roommate in 2007. Both Knox and Sollecito served four years in jail for the murder of Kercher, who was found with her throat slit in the flat she shared with Knox in Perugia, Italy. The two were freed on appeal in 2011 but later faced a retrial ordered by Italy's highest court in March the same year. The court stated that the ruling by the appeal court that freed them was full of \\"deficiencies, contradictions and illogical conclusions.\\" Knox has justified her decision not to attend the retrial, calling it \\"common sense,\\" as she does not want to relive her experience of being imprisoned as an innocent person. In a memoir released earlier that year, she depicted herself as a naive young woman who was wrongfully convicted by a foreign justice system.

Yet, it is the funniest and most idiotic movie by Disney, and will guarantee laughs at the sappy stories and lame plots from start to finish. It's a group of short stories that seem like bad fanfictions. *SPOILER ALERT* The first one's all about Beast and Belle being petty over a pathetic argument. Then, three loser new characters decide to patch things up by forging a letter of forgiveness to give to Belle. Part way through this little episode, Belle has wall eyes, which made my siblings and I laugh so hard. Then, she and the Beast fight more over the letter... and later learn the meaning of forgiveness. How old are they??? Certainly old enough to know the meaning of forgiveness. Then, the next one's all about Lumiere being the world's biggest dope when it comes to romance. This coming from the man who could woo anything female. And they make FiFi a psychotic villainess who tries to kill Belle, and winds up getting off scotch-free by the end of it. What a message to send the kids! Then, the next one's all about Mrs. Potts being angsty. And the next one after that's all about Beast becoming overly possessive of a bird, to the point where he just seems downright silly. The animation's so ugly, it kills. There are at least 100 mistakes you can plainly see... and the coloring is awful. Belle's a simpering sap who blubbers whenever something goes wrong. Plus, she's petty and very different from the usual Belle. And the side characters are annoying... (I mean, Cogsworth and Lumiere fight almost all the time. I know they did that in the movie, but it was overdone in this.) But the worst character is Mrs. Potts. She's ruined in this. I can't even describe it. Just buy it and see for yourself.

Write an article using the following points: Sport claim Barcelona have received three offers for Gerard Pique. Jose Mourinho aiming to lure defender like he did Cesc Fabregas. City believe Spanish star could answer central defensive problems. Article:","completion":"Title: Gerard Pique Draws Interest from Premier League Clubs as Barcelona Receives Multiple Offers for the Spanish Star With the transfer window in full swing, rumors are circulating, and the latest development involves Barcelona's renowned central defender, Gerard Pique. According to Sport, the Spanish giants have received three offers for the 34-year-old, further fueling speculations about Pique's potential departure from Camp Nou. This news comes as a surprise given how much the versatile defender has contributed to the Catalan club in recent years. Jose Mourinho, now at AS Roma, is reportedly aiming to lure the experienced defender to Italy to strengthen the Giallorossi, as he previously did with former Barcelona star Cesc Fabregas, when he was in charge of Chelsea. Mourinho is known for his astute eye for identifying talented and experienced players who could bolster his squad and fulfill specific tactical roles. The possible acquisition of Pique would provide stability and experience to the AS Roma defense and overwhelmingly improve their chances of contending for major accolades. At the same time, Premier League giants Manchester City are reported to be interested in Pique as well. City believes that the former Spanish international could be the answer to their central defensive problems and could form a formidable partnership with Ruben Dias. The departure of Eric Garcia to Barcelona has left an open spot in Pep Guardiola's backline, and Pique's ability to read the game and provide a calming presence at the back would be invaluable to the Citizens as they aim to retain the Premier League title and challenge for European glory. Despite nearing the twilight of his career, Pique's wealth of experience and success on the biggest stages makes him a sought-after commodity in European football. Pique has had an exceptional career at Barcelona, where he has won numerous domestic and international titles, including eight LaLiga titles, six Copa del Rey titles, and three UEFA Champions League titles. It remains to be seen as to whether Barcelona will entertain these offers for their long-serving defender. Having lost Lionel Messi to Paris Saint-Germain, the Blaugrana may be wary of letting go of another club legend and potentially further destabilizing the team. With new president Joan Laporta at the helm and Ronald Koeman eager to put his imprints on the squad, this would be a difficult decision to make, especially considering the ongoing financial crisis the club is experiencing. However, if Barcelona does decide to part ways with Pique, one thing is for certain - the Catalan-born defender will leave a lasting legacy at Camp Nou. Whether it's Mourinho's AS Roma or Guardiola's Manchester City that manages to seal the deal for the Spanish star, they'll be acquiring a player who can not only bring a wealth of experience and class to their team but also improve the defensive capabilities of the squad as a whole. Whichever club Pique ends up at, he will undoubtedly continue to impress and contribute to their success in the coming years."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Protest: Activists had planned to picket the evening performance at the Wilbur Theater, angry that Cosby continues to make appearances despite the sexual assault allegations against him. Cosby, best known for the lovable father figure he played on 'The Cosby Show,' denies the allegations of sexual assault, many of which are decades old and fall outside the statute of limitations for criminal or civil cases. His lawyer has called the claims 'discredited' and 'defamatory.' Cosby has never been charged over any of the allegations. He settled a 2005 civil suit alleging sexual misconduct. About a foot (30 cm) of fresh snow could accumulate in Boston on Sunday, according to the National Weather Service, blanketing a region that is still grappling with the aftermath of two major snowstorms since the end of January. 'Mr. Cosby just wanted all people coming to his shows to be safe,' said spokesman Andrew Miles. 'It had nothing to do with any protests.' Despite the Boston cancellation, protesters said they still planned to demonstrate. 'We are holding a solidarity action instead of a protest, same time and place,' Brandie Skorker, 28, one of the protest organizers, said in an email.

In the world of “Fallout,” created by game developer Bethesda, the world has been mostly destroyed following something called “The Great War,” which resulted in full-out nuclear apocalypse. Walking through the nuclear-wrecked wasteland in “Fallout 4” is a familiar experience for people who grew up in the area, and not just because game developer Bethesda utilized many of the city’s most iconic locations. The game’s setting was rumored for years before the official announcement. When a trailer confirmed it back in June, people spent their days dissecting the locations and landmarks shown – which included the State House, the Bunker Hill Monument, and the USS Constitution – and coming up with more theories about how the game would incorporate not only Boston’s physical setting but also its culture and history. So it’s more than just the familiar iconography, although there are the historic landmarks. We knew the Old North Church would in the game thanks to the trailer, along with the State House, but the rest of the Freedom Trail is too. One part of the game has you taking a tour along the trail, and not only does the red brick still exist, but most of the monuments do too. The stops along the way are stocked with obstacles, as you run into ghouls (Fallout’s version of zombies) in the Granary Burying Ground and in the church. You also can visit the Boston Public Library, which is also overrun with monsters, walk along the Charles River, and go into some of the MBTA stations. Park Street, for example, is an important stop in the story where players visit a vault that was constructed to protect people from nuclear radiation. “Fallout 4’s” includes not just Boston landmarks, but also its characters. The Minutemen, based on the militia companies that fought the British during the Revolutionary War, are a faction patrolling the Commonwealth that you can align with during the game. You run into them at the start in the fictional Museum of Freedom in Concord, which is a decaying dedication to that same colonial history. If you want, you can knock over mannequins and listen in on some audio recordings that give you a brief history lesson. However, the marker in “Fallout 4” that’s truly indicative of contemporary Boston is how the characters are at war with technology. There’s the secret organization called The Institute, which seems to be kidnapping children and creating robots called “synths” that can be mistaken for human. It existed long before the war that destroyed the planet, and is housed inside the Commonwealth Institute of Technology, or this world’s version of MIT. While it originally began as a prestigious university, it has since become the shadowy and technologically-advanced organization that acts as a boogeyman for the characters. Everyone that lives inside the Institute is dedicated to scientific progress. While there are robots in every “Fallout” game, the ones in Boston are a natural outgrowth of the area’s technology companies, so it feels more at home in “Fallout 4” than in any other title in the franchise. “We felt that Boston has the right mix of American history and high-tech,” said game director Todd Howard during the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles in June. “It’s very good for Fallout.” Looking back at other entries into the Fallout franchise gives one a sense that the developer takes these kinds of things into account. “Fallout 3” took place in Washington, D.C., and was praised by residents of the area for its accuracy. “Fallout: New Vegas” is not only a reconstruction of Las Vegas and surrounding suburbs, but also relies on a story that plays with the gambling culture. The spread of the Boston area is greatly reduced in the game. A walk that would normally take hours takes only a few minutes; for example, you can walk from Lexington to Cambridge to Fenway Park in less than an hour. “Fallout 4” isn’t a complete replication, but it couldn’t be. What’s striking is not just the research game developers put in to get locations correct, but also how they incorporated themes of Boston’s history and culture into the story, its characters, and its fictionalized landmarks. Some names have been changed, and statues aren’t quite where they should be, but it’s familiar territory, which makes the game more inviting for those from New England. Plus, there are the little touches. The leaves on the ground, the baseball memorabilia scattered around. There’s even a mutant you can fight named “Swan” who uses a swan boat for armor. Nice. “Fallout 4” was released on Nov. 9 for Playstation 4, Xbox One, and PC for a list price of 59.99.

The badgers must go before the farmers do Earlier this year DEFRA decided against a mass cull of badgers Photo: JANE MINGAY The spread of bovine tuberculosis [bTB] has long been the countryside's open sore. But the abject failure of the government agency that should have got to grips with the problem is now clear for all to see. Last year, some 40,000 cattle had to be destroyed because they showed signs of infection. The Government says it spends £80 million a year of taxpayers' money on testing for the disease and compensating farmers who have to slaughter their animals, though farmers' groups estimate that the figure is more than £100 million. Moreover, the spread of bTB means our farmers struggle to compete with foreign providers, leading to a flood of imports. Our current trade deficit in beef and dairy products runs into hundreds of millions of pounds. As dire as the current situation is, things could get much worse. In 2008, eight different species were infected with bTB in Britain, including cats, dogs, deer, goats, pigs and badgers. The total number of cases represents a four-fold increase in one year. Extrapolate that trend and you are facing an explosion. Unfortunately for our stripey friends, badgers are world champions at incubating and spreading bTB. As they roam the countryside they pass on the disease to other species; trying to keep cows and badgers apart is pretty well impossible. Since it became illegal to kill badgers in 1992, their population has expanded rapidly: they have over-run the countryside. One farmer in Warwickshire, who has recently had an outbreak of bTB among his cattle, had never seen a badger in his area 10 years ago. His neighbour found 12 scuttling around among the feed stocks recently. The problem is that their only predator now is the front bumpers of cars and lorries. Badger carcasses, often riddled with bTB, are an increasingly common sight along country roads. The whole situation is utterly depressing for farmers who want to produce food when they get out of bed in the morning, not fill in compensation forms for destroying their livestock. I came across one passionate farmer recently whose family had been in the business for five generations. He is thinking of giving up, because he can't bear the thought of breeding quality pedigree dairy cows simply to feed them into the maw of the Government's bTB killing machine. The future for him and many others is bleak. Official figures show that 4,443 cattle had to be slaughtered in January this year, a rise of almost a third from the same time in 2008. Who knows where we will be next year? Hilary Benn, Secretary of State for the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which is responsible for handling the crisis, has failed to grasp the nettle. He appears to have put his faith in a vaccination programme, but the vaccine will not be available for years, and even then will only be one tool in the box. What is needed is immediate action, not fiddling while the countryside burns. Nicky Paull, President of the British Veterinary Association [BVA], concedes that a managed cull of badgers is necessary, observing that \\"in some areas the situation is totally out of control\\". Why is the Secretary of State not listening? After all, the BVA has the welfare of all animals at heart, including badgers. Even the Anglican church, that fluffiest of organisations, is, in Somerset, calling for a cull. Perhaps Mr Benn is worried about how such a move would play in marginal suburban seats at the next election. However, Nick Herbert, the shadow secretary of state, has promised that a Conservative government would take the tough decision to support a measured cull of badgers. He is worried that bTB is on the increase in domestic pets as well as cattle. \\"The public and farmers alike who keep animals in areas of the country where the disease is rife will be concerned and have a right to expect action. The Government's policy of waiting for a vaccine which is years away from practical application while thousands of cattle and increasing numbers of other animals become infected is simply irresponsible,\\" he says. His concern for the public is shared by the National Farmers Union, which has given a warning that people should think twice about going for a walk in fields or parks where badgers may have wandered, following a case in Cornwall in which a woman, her daughter and a family dog were all infected with the disease. Though it appears to panic the public far less than swine flu, bTB is not a disease to be taken lightly. Badgers that succumb to it suffer horrific symptoms, including internal lesions, before dying in an emaciated state. Farmers who are desperately trying to cope with the situation could be forgiven for hoping that badgers will migrate into urban areas and infect a few more cuddly dogs and cats. Only then will any politician really attack this problem with gusto. In the mean time, the numbers of infected animals will carry on increasing rapidly, and farmers – as well as taxpayers – will pay the price. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text reveal the serious concerns surrounding the spread of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in the countryside, primarily due to badgers being carriers and spreaders of the disease. Key issues highlighted in the text include: 1. The significant impact on cattle and farmers: Approximately 40,000 cattle had to be destroyed last year due to bTB infection, costing the government £80 million annually for testing and compensating affected farmers. This widespread disease also affects the competitiveness of domestic farmers against foreign counterparts and contributes to a trade deficit in beef and dairy products. 2. The threat to other species and potential explosion: In 2008, eight different species in Britain were infected with bTB, representing a four-fold increase in one year. If this trend continues, it could lead to a catastrophic situation. 3. The role of badgers as carriers: Since it became illegal to kill badgers in 1992, their population has grown rapidly, overrunning the countryside and increasing the spread of bTB to other animals, including domestic pets. 4. The increasing pressure on farmers: The rising number of cattle slaughtered due to bTB is causing some farmers to consider leaving the industry, jeopardizing the future of food production and farming. 5. The need for immediate action: Hilary Benn, Secretary of State for the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, has failed to adequately address the crisis, relying on a vaccination program that is still years away from being available. However, the shadow secretary of state, Nick Herbert, promises that a Conservative government would support a measured cull of badgers. 6. The potential risk to the public: The National Farmers Union warns people to be cautious when walking in fields or parks where badgers may have wandered, as there have been instances of people and pets being infected with bTB. 7. The severity of bTB: Badgers infected with bTB suffer terrible symptoms, including internal lesions, and ultimately die in an emaciated state.

ANALYSIS: In this emotionally charged sentence, the protagonist's desperate situation is vividly depicted, as they are surrounded by elusive figures who effortlessly dodge their futile attempts at retaliation. The use of the word \\"feeble\\" to describe the protagonist's attempts highlights their recognition of their own weakness and vulnerability in this perilous situation. This feeling of powerlessness creates a strong empathy within the reader, as the ineffectiveness of the protagonist's actions evokes a sense of frustration and pity. The introduction of the gas, a sinister and insidious force, serves to further emphasize the protagonist's dire circumstances. The gas physically weakens them, sapping their strength until they are no longer able to stand, effectively symbolizing the suffocating grip of their enemies as they struggle but ultimately fail to resist their menacing advances. This description invokes a sense of fear and despair, as the prospect of defeat looms ever closer. As their body succumbs to the effects of the gas, the protagonist experiences a poignant moment of introspection, contemplating the inevitability of their demise. The phrase \\"so this is how it ends\\" suggests their resignation to fate, a poignant acceptance of the hopelessness of their situation. The visceral image of their face slamming against the floor serves not only as a graphic illustration of their physical collapse but also as a metaphor for the shattering of their spirit and resolve. Despite their rapidly fading consciousness, the protagonist is haunted by an unresolved concern, something that gnawed at the edges of their awareness but remained just out of reach. The phrase \\"something troubled me\\" points to an underlying mystery or unanswered question that continues to torment them even on the brink of oblivion.

Use a roller to apply the primer to the whole project. Sand the primer once it’s dry to remove any imperfections. Add a second coat of primer. Apply the first coat of melamine paint over the primed surfaces. Add the second coat of melamine paint once the first is dry. Spray paint your project if you prefer a smoother finished surface.","completion":"Title: Painting a Project with Melamine Paint: A Fun Guide for Little Ones Hi, little friends! Today, we're going to learn about painting a project with special paint called melamine paint. It's a fun and colorful way to make things look beautiful. Are you excited? Let's get started! Step 1: Start with a Primer Before we paint, we need to use something called a primer. The primer is like a base coat or the clothes that our project wears under the colorful paint. It helps the paint to stick better. So, grab a paintbrush and start painting all of the edges and corners with the primer. Remember to paint everything, even if it's hard to reach! Step 2: Roll, Roll, Roll Now that we've painted the edges and corners, we can use a roller for the fun part. The roller looks like a little round brush that helps us to paint faster. Dip the roller in the primer and start rolling it on the project. Roll it all over until the whole project is covered with primer. Step 3: Wait and Sand Once the primer is dry, our project needs a little brushing to make it smooth. We'll use sandpaper, which feels like a special paper that helps to make things soft. Gently rub the sandpaper all over the project to make it nice and smooth. Step 4: Add More Primer Let's give our project an extra layer of primer, just like wearing a second layer of clothes to stay extra warm! Use the roller to put on another coat of primer and then let it dry. Step 5: Time for Color Now, it's time to make our project look beautiful. Grab the melamine paint, which is our colorful paint, and start painting. Use the paintbrush or roller to cover the primed surfaces with the pretty paint. Don't forget to cover every inch! Step 6: More Color, Please Once the first coat of melamine paint is dry, we can add a second coat. It's like giving our project a big, colorful hug! This will make it look shinier and more vibrant. Step 7: Spray Paint (Optional) If you want your project to have an even smoother finish, you can ask an adult to help you spray paint it. Spray painting is another way to paint, but instead of a paintbrush or roller, the paint comes out of a can, making it smoother. And that's it! You've now learned how to paint a project with melamine paint. Great job, little artists! Don't forget to enjoy your beautiful, colorful project and be proud of what you've created."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \\"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others. We had a good match with Solti and he with us.\\" Peck's colleague, the violinist Victor Aitay said, \\"Usually conductors are relaxed at rehearsals and tense at the concerts. Solti is the reverse.

Hoverboards have become an obsession for amateur designers ever since Marty McFly jumped on one in Back to the Future II. Now, one Texan claims he has finally been able to create his own version for just £160 (250) using garden leaf blowers that float on a pocket of air. Ryan Craven, 27, built the device using four leaf blowers, a 4ft by 4ft (1.2 by 1.2 metre) piece of plywood, a skateboard deck, shower liner, coffee can lids and gaffer tape. Scroll down for video. He claims that anyone can build their own in eight steps using simple tools that include a tape measure, sand paper, staple gun and a hole saw. The waiter said he came up with the idea after seeing another hoverboard project on Kickstarter, which inspired him to design one which anyone can build. 'I'm a huge Back to the Future fan and always wanted to build one,' he said. 'I saw the HUVR Kickstarter campaign with Tony Hawk and thought it was the perfect time to try building one.' Back to the future: Ryan Craven, 27, built the device using four leaf blowers, a 4ft by 4ft (1.2 by 1.2 metre) piece of plywood, a skateboard deck, shower liner, coffee can lids and gaffer tape. Floating on air: 'I'm a huge Back to the Future fan and always wanted to build one,' said Mr Craven (pictured) 'I saw the HUVR Kickstarter campaign with Tony Hawk and thought it was the perfect time to try building one' 'It can move quite a bit once it's going, and despite the steering issue, which really isn't quite there, you can go quite far and move a little bit. Mr Craven explained that the device is essentially a miniature version of a hovercraft. He has also released instructions for anyone who would like to make their own. A skirt fills with air that is released below from strategically placed holes that create a small pocket between the device, dubbed 'Mr Hoverboard', and the ground. The Hendo hoverboard uses four 'hover engines' which emit magnetic fields that push against each other. In October, Californian architect Greg Henderson made a similar hoverboard that floats in mid-air. Dubbed the Hendo Hoverboard, the technology uses four 'hover engines' which emit magnetic fields that push against each other as long as metal conductor is used in the surface underneath. The idea came to Mr Henderson while he was trying to find ways of building structures that can better withstand earthquakes. As part of his research, he came up with a method that uses electromagnetic fields to separate the building from the ground in the event of a disaster. That same technology, he realised, could also be put to work in a hoverboard that would allow people to glide on air. In a video released by Mr Henderson, a man is seen moving smoothly along a custom-built skate ramp on his board, which is held an inch of the ground. Unlike the Back to the Future board, the technology requires the board to be on top of conductive materials - such as copper or aluminum - to serve as a secondary magnetic field. 'The Back to the Future hoverboard has always been the impossible dream, but I wanted to make a real hoverboard that was accessible and workable and fun to use, and not too expensive,' added Mr Craven. 'There are so many variations of skateboard and this one could easily end up being just another variation. 'But I would love for people to take my idea and develop it to the point where it becomes universal.' The design becomes even more staggering as Mr Craven is not a designer or inventor – and he says his first prototypes were far from perfect. Blown away: 'The Back to the Future hoverboard (right) has always been the impossible dream, but I wanted to make a real hoverboard that was accessible and workable and fun to use, and not too expensive,' added Mr Craven. Left is an early prototype created using a hairdryer. 'I'm not an engineer,' he said. 'I work in a restaurant, so it's pretty naive of me to buy four leaf blowers. 'I'm pretty much broke all the time usually and if people want to donate then that would be wonderful. Mr Craven has been working on the design since March and the early prototypes had wheels and were much smaller at first. 'One was even powered by a disassembled hairdryer, until I finally hit on the idea of the leaf blowers,' he said. 'They were crude. Frankensteinish. 'The process is very chaotic and it's so much easier to fail than to succeed.' Mr Craven is now working on the next version which he hopes will be quieter, with improved air flow and less vibration.

I grew up in North Central Indiana, about 50 miles south of South Bend. It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70’s and 80’s. My family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses. My dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between. It was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed. As I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway. Some people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools. I remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether. I don’t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn’t do a good job. Later in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing. I still remember hating shoveling snow. But I’m forever grateful that I did it. Question: Why did the author's mother make him shovel the snow from the homes of the elderly?

Translate to English","completion":"It takes courage and honesty to implement a joint policy that denies support to warmongering regimes and follows up on the accusations raised by the UN against multinational and European companies exploiting the riches of Congo. The need for courage and honesty in pursuing a collaborative political approach cannot be overstated when addressing problems such as warmongering regimes and the exploitation of resources in countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo. These issues are not only detrimental to the countries directly involved, but they also have far-reaching consequences on a global scale. Warmongering regimes pose a threat to global peace and security by instigating conflicts and contributing to the proliferation of weapons. To implement a successful joint policy, governments must stand firm and refuse to support such regimes, even in the face of possible economic or political benefits. This can involve ceasing arms sales, imposing sanctions, and taking diplomatic measures to pressure these regimes to change their behavior. In addition to addressing the issues with warmongering regimes, the exploitation of resources, particularly in countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, must also be addressed. The United Nations has raised concerns about multinational and European companies taking advantage of these resource-rich countries, exacerbating poverty, and contributing to environmental degradation. A common political effort is necessary to investigate these practices and hold the responsible parties accountable. This effort includes the enforcement of regulations to ensure that companies adhere to ethical and sustainable practices. Governments can work together to develop regulations that require companies to disclose information about their supply chains and be transparent about the resources they are extracting. Moreover, sanctions can be imposed on companies that do not comply, deterring further exploitation. Furthermore, governments can collaborate with local communities, NGOs, and civil society to monitor and ensure sustainable development in these regions. It is also essential to support initiatives that promote responsible mining and environmentally safe practices to protect both the environment and the long-term interests of the countries involved. In summary, a joint political effort requires courage and honesty to tackle the issues surrounding warmongering regimes and the exploitation of resources in countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo. This can be accomplished by working together to strengthen regulations, impose sanctions, and support local communities in their efforts to achieve sustainable development. By doing so, governments can send a clear message that irresponsible practices and the support of warmongering regimes are not tolerated in the global community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does your pet lick his feet, under his tail or along his belly? The most common areas of irritation for allergic dogs are around the back and tail, the abdomen, and the legs and paws. It can be common that your dog’s itching is so severe that he chews his skin to the point of creating a “hot spot”. This skin lesion can develop overnight and can get very large very quickly. The skin is pink, moist, hot and painful. You may even see sticky material oozing from the wound created. These are infected open wounds and need veterinary intervention to give your pet relief. Chronic cases of itching might result in the thickening and roughening of the skin so that it looks like elephant hide. Hot spots are often the symptom of allergies to fleas, foods, grass, mold or other environmental substances. There may be more complicated underlying conditions such as low thyroid (hypothyroidism) levels or Cushing’s disease (hyperadrenocorticism). Secondary bacterial and yeast (malassezia) infections are not uncommon and will require specially tailored treatment. There might be a particular time of year that your dog is itchier. Perhaps he is itchy after being on the lawn or after eating a certain food. By noticing patterns, you will help to narrow the focus of your pet’s treatment to help with the itching. If your dog has a really strong body odor, seems excessively thirsty or does not seem as lively as usual, you should take your pet to the veterinarian. Your veterinarian will need to do blood tests and evaluate swabs from the skin surface to get more information to help define appropriate treatment. Whenever you notice your dog itching, write down the circumstances, including where your dog has been, what he’s been eating and what part of his body is itchy. This will be extremely useful for your veterinarian, who will rely on this information to narrow down the possible causes for your pet’s itching and skin lesions.

Next question: what is the average height of a basketball player in the nba?","completion":"The average height of a basketball player in the National Basketball Association (NBA) has varied slightly over the years, but generally, it has consistently hovered around 6 feet 7 inches (200 cm) tall. However, it is important to note that this average height can fluctuate depending on the player's position on the court. Point guards, who are responsible for leading the team's offense and managing ball distribution, generally have a lower average height than the other positions. The typical height range for point guards is around 6 feet to 6 feet 4 inches (183-193 cm). This enables them to be agile, quick, and have great ball-handling skills. Shooting guards, who primarily focus on scoring and shooting from the perimeter, have an average height between 6 feet 3 inches and 6 feet 6 inches (190-198 cm). These players need a combination of height and agility to be effective on the court. Small forwards, who play a more versatile role on the court and often switch between offensive and defensive duties, tend to have an average height between 6 feet 6 inches and 6 feet 9 inches (198-206 cm). This allows them to match up well against their opponents in terms of size and athleticism. Power forwards, who play a more physical role in terms of rebounding and inside scoring, usually have an average height between 6 feet 8 inches and 6 feet 11 inches (203-211 cm). These players need to have a larger frame to compete against other big players around the basket. Finally, centers, who are often the tallest players on the court and focus on dominating the paint, have an average height between 6 feet 10 inches and 7 feet 2 inches (208-218 cm). Their height and wingspan play a crucial role in altering opponents' shots, grabbing rebounds, and scoring close to the basket. It is worth mentioning that basketball has seen some evolution in recent years, with players becoming more versatile and positionless. This has led to some deviation from traditional height averages, as many teams are utilizing smaller, more agile lineups (nicknamed \\"small-ball\\") or taller, \\"unicorn\\" players who possess a unique combination of size, skill, and outside shooting. However, the overall average height of an NBA player remains around 6 feet 7 inches (200 cm) tall."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question given this paragraph: Q: Arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart, what carries un-oxygenated blood back to the heart?

The East India Company drove the expansion of the British Empire in Asia. The Company's army had first joined forces with the Royal Navy during the Seven Years' War, and the two continued to co-operate in arenas outside India: the eviction of the French from Egypt (1799), the capture of Java from the Netherlands (1811), the acquisition of Penang Island (1786), Singapore (1819) and Malacca (1824), and the defeat of Burma (1826).From its base in India, the Company had also been engaged in an increasingly profitable opium export trade to China since the 1730s. This trade, illegal since it was outlawed by the Qing dynasty in 1729, helped reverse the trade imbalances resulting from the British imports of tea, which saw large outflows of silver from Britain to China. In 1839, the confiscation by the Chinese authorities at Canton of 20,000 chests of opium led Britain to attack China in the First Opium War, and resulted in the seizure by Britain of Hong Kong Island, at that time a minor settlement.During the late 18th and early 19th centuries the British Crown began to assume an increasingly large role in the affairs of the Company. A series of Acts of Parliament were passed, including the Regulating Act of 1773, Pitt's India Act of 1784 and the Charter Act of 1813 which regulated the Company's affairs and established the sovereignty of the Crown over the territories that it had acquired. The Company's eventual end was precipitated by the Indian Rebellion in 1857, a conflict that had begun with the mutiny of sepoys, Indian troops under British officers and discipline. The rebellion took six months to suppress, with heavy loss of life on both sides. The following year the British government dissolved the Company and assumed direct control over India through the Government of India Act 1858, establishing the British Raj, where an appointed governor-general administered India and Queen Victoria was crowned the Empress of India. India became the empire's most valuable possession, \\"the Jewel in the Crown\\", and was the...

Write the answer: Which car manufacturer makes the 'Lucida' model?","completion":"The 'Lucida' model is a vehicle manufactured by Toyota, a renowned Japanese multinational automotive manufacturer. Established in 1937 by Kiichiro Toyoda, Toyota has grown into one of the world's largest and most reputable automobile companies, known for its reliability, craftsmanship, and innovation in the automotive market. The Toyota Lucida is a multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) belonging to the series of the popular Toyota Estima, which is also marketed under the names Previa and Tarago in different countries. The Lucida was introduced in the early 1990s as a variation of the Toyota Estima and was mainly aimed at the Japanese domestic market. It was also imported to other countries, notably the United Kingdom, through grey market importers. The Toyota Lucida came with several engine options, including gasoline and diesel variants, and provided both rear-wheel and all-wheel drive configurations. With a sleeker and narrower design in comparison to the Estima, the Lucida aimed to offer more urban-friendly dimensions for better maneuverability. The vehicle provided comfortable seating for up to eight passengers and featured sliding doors with ample space for luggage and cargo. Noteworthy features of the Toyota Lucida included its unique mid-engine layout, which positioned the engine between the front and rear axles, providing better weight distribution and stability. The vehicle also offered a flexible and modular interior, allowing passengers to reconfigure seating and cargo space to suit varying needs. Some Lucida models came equipped with advanced features for its time, like GPS navigation, air-conditioning systems with climate control, and ABS braking systems. Although the Toyota Lucida is no longer in production, it has left a lasting impact on the MPV segment and remains popular as a used vehicle in several markets. Its reliability and versatility make it a sought-after option for people looking for a spacious and comfortable family vehicle or a capable transport solution for various purposes. Toyota's commitment to quality, durability, and safety has made the Lucida a reputable and popular choice among automobile enthusiasts worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who was placed as \\"a seminal figure in the visual arts from the 1930s until her death in Majorca in 1991? from the following article ? Prior to her death, Bellette bequeathed the Hill End cottage to the National Parks and Wildlife Service (which manages the Hill End historic site), on condition that it be used as an artists' retreat. It continues to operate for that purpose. As of 2016, Bellette is the only woman to have won the Sulman Prize on more than one occasion. A large number of her works are held by the Art Gallery of New South Wales; other galleries that hold examples include the Art Gallery of South Australia, Art Gallery of Western Australia, Bendigo Art Gallery, Geelong Art Gallery, the National Gallery of Australia, and the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. In 2004–05, a major retrospective exhibition was held at Bathurst Regional Art Gallery, the S. H. Ervin Gallery in Sydney, the University of Queensland Art Museum, Mornington Peninsula Regional Gallery and the Drill Hall Gallery in Canberra.Described by Amanda Beresford as Australia's \\"only true modern classicist\\", Bellette is generally regarded as an influential figure in the modern art movement in Sydney in the mid-twentieth century. Art historian Janine Burke described Bellette as \\"a leader of the post-war art world\\", and the University of Queensland Art Museum's curator placed her as \\"a seminal figure in the visual arts from the 1930s until her death in Majorca in 1991\\". Of her paintings, opinions vary. Burke described her as \\"arguably the best painter\\" of the Sydney circle. Historian Geoffrey Dutton was unconvinced about her choice of subject but praised Bellette's \\"assured if muted\\" style, while dismissing the lesser efforts of her husband. Art historian and writer Sasha Grishin had a different view. Commenting on Bellette's paintings of Greek mythological subjects created in the 1940s, he wrote, \\"they were neither very convincing as paintings, nor works that had a particular resonance in Sydney or Australian art at the time\\". John Passmore and Bellette studied together both in Australia and England, travelled in Europe, and exhibited side by side in group shows.

Here is an article: “The legal issues that are being raised by the administration are going to take longer than the remaining time of the administration” to resolve, said Vijay Padmanabhan, an assistant professor at Cardozo Law School who was until July a State Department lawyer with responsibility for detainee issues. “It is part of a broader strategy,” Mr. Padmanabhan added, “which is not to make difficult decisions about Guantánamo and leave it to the next president.” Detainees’ advocates say that the administration is using the legal battle to delay judicial review of its evidence, while government lawyers argue that the cases are moving rapidly considering that they are unprecedented. A Justice Department spokesman, Erik Ablin, said the government was working toward quick hearings for detainees, but was determined to take every precaution to avoid having dangerous people released. He added that “it is certainly the government’s goal to detain enemy combatants who are deemed a threat to the United States.” Habeas corpus suits, which have their root in centuries-old English law, are generally streamlined proceedings for prisoners to force officials to explain why they are being held. The Guantánamo cases permitted by the Supreme Court’s ruling, Boumediene v. Bush, are to review the government’s reasons for holding the men as enemy combatants. The military’s enemy combatant hearings, which the administration says permit indefinite detention, are separate from the Pentagon’s effort to prosecute some detainees in military commission trials. A first test of a judge’s power in a federal habeas case may come on Tuesday during arguments in a case involving 17 detainees who claim a right to immediate release. The path to court has been slow for the habeas cases, and most seem unlikely to reach resolution until well into the next president’s administration, lawyers say. In some cases, government lawyers are adding new grounds for holding the men, supplementing or replacing the accusations made during Guantánamo hearings four years ago. Lawyers say some of the government’s arguments could create grounds for years of new appeals by the Justice Department. Many of the hurdles to moving the cases to court have been practical ones, including an initial shortage of Justice Department lawyers and the need to develop procedures for intelligence agencies to review classified evidence. In August, Justice Department lawyers told the United States District Court in Washington that they could not meet their own deadline for providing initial responses to the cases. “The task has proven even more difficult than originally envisioned,” said a Justice Department filing. The new schedule called for initial responses to 50 cases a month beginning in September. As a result, challenges by some detainees would not begin to move in the courts until January, the Bush administration’s last month in office. Mr. Ablin, the Justice Department spokesman, said accusations against detainees might need to be updated because of the “changed legal landscape” and because intelligence collection might have changed what is known about detainees. “It would be irresponsible,” he said, “not to update the courts with additional information gained over the past several years” that proved links to terrorism. The government is relying extensively on classified information. That is quite likely to raise defense questions about how detainees can defend themselves since they are not permitted to see much of the evidence against them — long a contentious issue in the military’s hearings at Guantánamo Bay. “Time is on their side,” Matthew J. MacLean, a Washington lawyer for four Kuwaiti detainees, said of the government. “Every day of delay is one more day our clients are in prison without a hearing.” The habeas case scheduled for a federal court hearing on Tuesday involves 17 Guantánamo detainees who are ethnic Uighurs, a restive Muslim minority in western China. In a separate case that was under way before the Supreme Court ruling in June, federal appeals judges issued a decision this summer that ridiculed as inadequate the Pentagon’s secret evidence for holding one of the Uighurs, Huzaifa Parhat, a former fruit peddler who said he had gone to Afghanistan to escape China. Since then, the Pentagon has conceded that it would “serve no useful purpose” to continue to try to prove that any of the 17 Uighurs were ever enemy combatants. The Uighurs say they have never been enemies of the United States, though they were in Afghanistan in 2002, where they were detained. They say they would be persecuted or killed if they were returned to China. The Bush administration says it has failed to find another country willing to accept them. On Tuesday, a federal district judge, Ricardo M. Urbina, is to hear an urgent claim by lawyers for the Uighurs, that they should be released immediately into the United States since they are no longer considered enemy combatants. The government argues that they should be held at Guantánamo until another country can be found to accept them. In filings, the Justice Department lawyers make expansive arguments that, while Judge Urbina can hear the Uighurs’ case, he cannot order their release. The judiciary “simply has no authority” to release the Uighurs into the United States, one filing said. The Justice Department said the government’s executive branch, not the judicial branch, has the authority to conclude military detentions, as it has in prior wars. It noted that in World War II “no court ever questioned that it was solely for the political branches — not the courts” to decide how Italian prisoners of war were handled. P. Sabin Willett, one of the Uighurs’ lawyers, said such claims appeared to be laying the groundwork for government appeals in the event that a judge orders a detainee freed. The first full court hearing examining the evidence in a habeas case — this one involving six detainees at the center of the Supreme Court’s June decision — is scheduled for Oct. 27. Still, hearings for the vast majority of the detainees are unscheduled. The Supreme Court justices said in their June decision that the detainees were “entitled to a prompt” hearing, but did not specify how prompt. Mr. Willett said that while “prompt” might be open to interpretation, “I think they meant more quickly than this.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Despite Ruling, Detainee Cases Facing Delays.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: It started with a tip: that a rusty North Korean freighter, which had not plied the Caribbean in years, was carrying drugs or arms amid more than 200,000 sacks of Cuban brown sugar. It ended with a five-day, eventually violent standoff between Panamanian marines and 35 North Korean crew members, armed largely with sticks, who were subdued and arrested while their captain, claiming he was having a heart attack, tried to commit suicide. Underneath all that sugar, it turned out, were parts for what appeared to be elements of an antiquated Soviet-era missile radar system that was headed, evidently, to North Korea — a country that usually exports missile technology around the world, rather than bringing it in. Late Tuesday night, Cuba’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement saying the cargo stashed in the vessel, the Chong Chon Gang, consisted of “240 metric tons of obsolete defensive weapons” bound for North Korea, where it was to be repaired and then sent back to Cuba. But American and Panamanian officials were still trying to understand why the ship’s crew had fought so hard to repel a boarding party as the ship tried to traverse the Panama Canal. After all, the equipment they were protecting would make a nice exhibit in a museum of cold war military artifacts. “We’re talking old,” one official briefed on the episode said. “When this stuff was new, Castro was plotting revolutions.” The Cuban Ministry did not seem to be offended, describing the equipment to be repaired as “two antiaircraft missile complexes, Volga and Pechora; nine missiles in parts and spares, two MiG-21bis and 15 motors for this type of airplane, all of it manufactured in the mid-20th century.” The episode also offered a window on the desperate measures North Korea is taking to keep hard currency and goods flowing at a time when its ships are tracked everywhere, old customers like Syria and Iran are facing sanctions and scrutiny of their own, and its partners have dwindled to a few outliers. Still, Cuba’s role was puzzling — at a time when Washington has talked of relaxing restrictions and Cuba’s leadership has seemed more eager to improve its ties with the West than to strengthen relations with cold war-era partners. Even by the measure of bizarre stories about North Korea’s black-market dealings, the events of the past five days in Panama set some records. In recent times North Korean shipments to Myanmar and the Middle East have been tracked and in some cases intercepted, a testament to how closely American spy satellites follow the country’s aging cargo fleet. “What I can say for sure is that looking at illicit North Korea trade, their ships in particular, these guys are stumped for money, they are incredibly poor,” said Hugh Griffiths, an arms trafficking specialist at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. “Business deals that might look silly to us don’t look ridiculous to them.” Panama’s president, Ricardo Martinelli, announced the discovery in a radio broadcast on Monday night, making it clear that the North Korean ship was in blatant violation of numerous United Nations sanctions. He even posted a photograph of the contraband on his Twitter account. Based on that picture, IHS Jane’s Intelligence, a defense consultancy, identified it as an SNR-75 “Fan Song” fire control radar for the SA-2 family of surface-to-air missiles. The component is important for guiding a missile to its target; the Soviets began building similar systems in the mid-1950s, well ahead of the Cuban missile crisis. In a statement, IHS Jane’s speculated that the system was headed to North Korea for an upgrade, and that “the cargo of sugar could be a payment for the services.” But it also said the radar equipment could have been en route to North Korea to augment that country’s air defense network, which it said was based on obsolete weapons, missiles and radars. That raised the possibility that other elements of the shipment were aboard, or on other ships. “We’re going to keep unloading the ship and figure out exactly what was inside,” Mr. Martinelli said. “You cannot go around shipping undeclared weapons of war through the Panama Canal.” There was no comment on Tuesday from North Korea on the vessel’s seizure. The Chong Chon Gang, a 36-year-old freighter, has its own peculiar history, and this was not the first time the vessel had encountered run-ins with maritime authorities. It was stopped in 2010 for carrying narcotics and ammunition, Mr. Griffiths said. He also said it had been attacked by Somali pirates. According to IHS Fairplay, a London-based vessel-monitoring service, the freighter had not traveled the Western Hemisphere in at least four years. The monitoring data shows that it visited Panama in 2008 and Brazil in 2009. Mr. Griffiths noted that its reappearance, even with the cover of a Cuban cargo of sugar, was bound to attract attention. He said interest in the vessel’s itinerary in recent weeks, which included a stopover in Havana, might have been heightened because of the July 3 visit to Cuba of North Korea’s top military commander, who conferred with President Raúl Castro. Cuban and North Korean news media publicized the trip. “There are very few states where the North Korean chief of staff is welcomed for a high-level meeting,” Mr. Griffiths said. American spy satellites regularly track North Korean vessels — but usually to stop weapons proliferation, not drugs. And as the intelligence agencies discovered several years ago, failure to monitor can lead to other lapses: the United States missed the construction of a North Korean nuclear reactor in Syria until Israeli officials brought evidence of it to Washington in 2007. Israel destroyed the reactor later that year. Matthew Godsey, editor of the Risk Report, a publication of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, a proliferation research group in Washington that follows North Korean behavior, said the Chong Chon Gang might have also been able to travel in the region undetected in the past by turning off its satellite transponder, used by tracking services to monitor vessels for their own safety. “I think North Korean vessels have been known to do that,” he said. “It’s dangerous, but when you’re carrying dangerous stuff it can happen. When you have a captain willing to kill himself, it wouldn’t surprise me.” Mr. Martinelli and other Panamanian officials said the vessel’s 35 crew members were taken into custody on Sunday after they violently resisted efforts to redirect the vessel to the Panamanian port of Manzanillo, at the Atlantic end of the canal. He did not explain how the captain sought to commit suicide, and the captain’s condition was unknown. José Raúl Mulino, Panama’s minister of security, said in a telephone interview that the entire crew had been detained at a naval base after committing what he called an act of “rebellion and sabotage” in trying to resist the boarding of the vessel. It was unclear whether they would face criminal prosecution or be sent back to North Korea. Mr. Mulino said that the suspect cargo was hidden in two containers behind the sugar, and that all 220,000 to 230,000 sugar sacks aboard would be removed before the ship could be completely investigated. The process can take a while, he said, because the crew had disabled the unloading cranes, forcing the Panamanians to remove the bags by hand. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The ship was seized by authorities in Panama after military cargo was found hidden in a shipment of sugar Cuba has admitted being behind a stash of weapons found on board a North Korean ship seized in the Panama Canal. The Cuban foreign ministry said the ship was carrying obsolete Soviet-era arms from Cuba for repair in North Korea. The ship was seized by Panama last week after \\"undeclared military cargo\\" was found hidden in a shipment of sugar. United Nations sanctions prohibit the supply of arms to North Korea in the dispute over its nuclear programme. A Cuban foreign ministry statement said Cuba reaffirmed its commitment to \\"peace, disarmament, including nuclear disarmament, and respect for international law\\". It said the vessel was carrying 240 tonnes of obsolete defensive weapons - two anti-aircraft missile complexes, nine missiles in parts and spares, two MiG-21bis fighter planes and 15 MiG engines. Analysis Cuba's admission that it was sending weapons to North Korea for repair, in contravention of UN arms sanctions, explains part of the mystery surrounding this ship. But other questions remain. Why not simply fly North Korean technicians and parts to Cuba to fix them instead of risking getting caught? Avoiding detection was obviously the plan when the ship had its AIS automatic transponder switched off when it left the Panama Canal to collect the Cuban weapons in June. The ship itself, the Chong Chon Gang, has been caught in the past carrying narcotics and has had encounters with Somali pirates. But this latest episode gives us just a small glimpse of some of the illegal maritime traffic going on all year round, unseen, across the world. The Cuban statement said they were all made in the mid-20th Century and were to be repaired and returned to Cuba. \\"The agreements subscribed by Cuba in this field are supported by the need to maintain our defensive capacity in order to preserve national sovereignty,\\" the statement went on. Cuba said the ship's main cargo was 10,000 tonnes of sugar. The vessel, called Chong Chon Gang, left Russia's far east on 12 April and travelled across the Pacific Ocean before entering the canal at the start of June, with Cuba as its stated destination. Panamanian officials said the ship was carrying a cargo of sheet metal on its journey through the canal. However, the vessel disappeared from satellite tracking systems after it left the Caribbean side of the canal, resurfacing on 11 July. Experts say this may indicate that the crew switched off the system which automatically communicates details of their location.

The crew did not respond, so the ship was boarded and the weaponry was uncovered. Chong Chon Gang's route Departs from Nakhodka in Russian far east (200km east of North Korean border) Arrives at Pacific side of Panama Canal Leaves the Panama Canal on the Caribbean side heading for Havana, but disappears from satellite tracking Arrives back at Panamanian port of Manzanillo; later searched for contraband. Weapons uncovered 'Historical ties' North Korea and Cuba are both nominally communist, and a high-level military delegation from North Korea visited at the end of June and was received by President Raul Castro. Cuban media said they discussed \\"the historical ties that unite the two nations and the common will to continue strengthening them\\". Arms trafficking expert Hugh Griffiths told the BBC the ship's voyage could be seen in the wider context of renewed military co-operation between the two nations. Announcing the seizure of the vessel on Tuesday, Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli said it contained suspected \\"sophisticated missile equipment\\". He posted on his Twitter account an image of a large green object inside a cargo container. Analysts from Jane's defence think-tank identified the object as part of an SNR-75 Fan Song radar, used to guide missiles fired by the SA-2 air-defence system. The Soviets developed the SA-2 in the late 1950s but began to phase it out in the 1980s. However, the system is still widely used in countries that were Soviet allies during the Cold War. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption US ambassador to UN Rosemary DiCarlo: \\"Shipments would violate Security Council resolutions\\" Mr Martinelli said the 35-strong crew had resisted the search and the captain had tried to kill himself. The crew face possible charges of illegal weapons smuggling in Panama. Panamanian Security Minister Jose Raul Mulino said that even if the military cargo was found to be \\"obsolete\\", it was still \\"illicit\\" to carry it through Panamanian territory without prior notification. Mr Mulino said that Panama was awaiting the arrival of a commission from the United Nations Security Council to help inspect the arms found aboard the boat. He said two of the ship's five container sections had been searched so far. A regional intelligence expert with experience of checking vessels for illicit cargo told the BBC it could take two to three days to complete the search. He said the Panamanian authorities would be using dog teams to try and find the illicit cargo while divers searched the outside of the vessel. According to the expert, the ship has been suspected of carrying narcotics in the past, which would have made it a prime target for a search. The failure of the crew to respond to a request by the security forces to board the ship would have rung further alarm bells. He said the estimate of one week given by the Panamanians for the search to be finalised was probably \\"exaggerated\\" but that they would want to thoroughly inspect the crew's quarters as well as the containers before giving their final report. The US \\"commended\\" Panama for its actions, and said it strongly supported a full inspection of the ship. The vessel was stopped near Manzanillo on the Atlantic side of the canal last week. Panama released details of the find on Tuesday. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A long time ago, a North Korean ship was secretly carrying some really old weapons and machines from Cuba to North Korea.

If I tell you that Ozone depletion increases the risks for all types of skin cancer, and ask you the question \\"the risks of all types of skin cancer increases with increasing\\", is the correct answer \\"oxygen debt\\"? Answer:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"oxygen debt.\\" Instead, you can respond that the risks of all types of skin cancer increase with the depletion of the ozone layer. Ozone depletion refers to the reduction of stratospheric ozone concentration due to the release of certain chemicals, primarily chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other ozone-depleting substances (ODS), into the atmosphere. These chemicals result in the breakdown of ozone molecules, which leads to the thinning of the ozone layer. The ozone layer is crucial as it filters a significant portion of the sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation, specifically the harmful UVB radiation. When the ozone layer depletes, more UVB radiation penetrates through Earth's atmosphere and reaches the Earth's surface. Overexposure to these harmful UVB rays can lead to a higher risk of developing various types of skin cancer, such as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and most dangerously, malignant melanoma. UVB radiation is also a significant cause of other health issues like sunburn, snow blindness, cataracts, and immune system suppression. Oxygen debt, on the other hand, refers to the temporary shortage of oxygen in the body that occurs after strenuous or prolonged exercise. During such activities, the body's oxygen supply cannot keep up with the increased demand, resulting in anaerobic respiration, which produces lactic acid. The term \\"oxygen debt\\" is used to describe the amount of additional oxygen required by the body post-exercise to break down this accumulated lactic acid and restore the body's energy levels. Oxygen debt itself is not directly linked to the risks of skin cancer. Therefore, the correct answer to the question, \\"The risks of all types of skin cancer increases with increasing,\\" would be \\"ozone depletion,\\" rather than \\"oxygen debt.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Plot title: The Quick and the Dead Movie plot: Duncan McKaskel (Tom Conti) and his wife, Susanna (Kate Capshaw), a married couple who, along with their 12-year-old son, Tom (Kenny Morrison), are travelling West hoping to start a new life. They have left a cholera-stricken wagon train and, alone, arrive in a small dilapidated town. Here, they meet no-good Doc Shabbitt (Matt Clark) and ask for directions. He suggests they stay in a deserted local building, but McKaskel senses danger and they leave. Shabbit decides to steal two of their horses. Con Vallian (Sam Elliott) is chasing a half-breed Indian, the latest recruit to Shabbit's gang who, it transpires, Vallian has tracked for hundreds of miles for personal reasons. Vallian witnesses the homesteader's encounter with Shabbit and turns up at the McKaskel's wagon during supper. He advises them their horses have been stolen. Against Susanna's advice, Duncan rides into town and tries to reclaim the horses. An intense gunfight ensues when Vallian, who has secretly followed him, shoots some of the Shabbit gang. When Doc Shabbitt finds that his son, who was about to shoot McKaskel in the back, has been killed, he vows to pursue the family and seek revenge. Susanna, Duncan, and Tom flee in their covered wagon, trying to keep ahead of their pursuers. Vallian keeps arriving to help protect them from Shabbitt and his gang. As time passes, Vallian manages to kill the bandits one by one. The remaining four keep up their pursuit. Vallian is obviously attracted to Susanna, and she to him. Following a moment of high drama, she succumbs to his advances and they share a passionate kiss.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose works are on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario? ? Since his death, Thomson's work has grown in value and popularity. Group of Seven member Arthur Lismer wrote that he \\"is the manifestation of the Canadian character\\". Another contemporaneous Canadian painter, David Milne, wrote to National Gallery of Canada Director H. O. McCurry in 1930, \\"Your Canadian art apparently, for now at least, went down in Canoe Lake. Tom Thomson still stands as the Canadian painter, harsh, brilliant, brittle, uncouth, not only most Canadian but most creative. How the few things of his stick in one's mind.\\" For Canadian artists Roy Kiyooka and Dennis Lee, he is a \\"haunting presence\\" and \\"embodies the Canadian artistic identity\\".As of 2015, the highest price achieved by a Thomson sketch was Early Spring, Canoe Lake, which sold in 2009 for CAD2,749,500. Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park. Discovered in an Edmonton basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries on the market.In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound. In 1968, Thomson's shack from behind the Studio Building was moved to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg. Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. His influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including Joyce Wieland. In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location near the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried. The grave site has become popular spot for visitors to the area with many fans of his work leaving pennies or art supplies behind as tribute.","completion":"The last name of the person whose works are on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario is Thomson."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own. I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations. Question: What did the author probably do with the colomba she made from the Field's recipe? Options: A. not enough information B. she probably ate them all C. she probably didn't eat any D. she probably ate some and shared it with others A:","completion":"D. she probably ate some and shared it with others"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Select the correct sentiment of the following review: This is a very memorable spaghetti western. It has a great storyline, interesting characters, and some very good acting, especially from Rosalba Neri. Her role as the evil villainess in this film is truly classic. She steals every scene she is in, and expresses so much with her face and eyes, even when she's not speaking. Her performance is very believable. She manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over the top (not that there's anything wrong with being over the top). Mark Damon is surprisingly good in this movie too. The music score is excellent, and the theme song is the kind that will be playing in your head constantly for days after seeing the movie, whether you want it to or not. There are a couple of parts that are very amusing. I especially like the part where Rosalba Neri undresses in front of the parrot. There's also lots of slick gun-play that's very well done. I would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it wasn't for two things. The first being a silly bar room brawl that occurs about 25 minutes into the film. This is one of the most ridiculous looking fights I have ever seen in a movie. It is very poorly choreographed, and looks more like a dance number from a bad musical than any kind of a real fight. One might be able to overlook this if it were a Terence Hill/Bud Spencer comedy, but this is a more serious western, and the brawl really needed to be more realistic. The other thing that annoyed me about this movie was Yuma's cowardly Mexican sidekick. I guess he was supposed to be comic relief or something, but the character was just plain stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this, and he wasn't at all funny. All I can say is where is Tuco when you need him? All that having been said, let me assure everyone reading this that Johnny Yuma is a classic spaghetti western despite the faults I have mentioned, and all fans of the genre need to see this movie. Choose from: [i] negative; [ii] positive;","completion":"The sentiment of this review is [ii] positive. While there are elements of criticism, the review largely conveys appreciation and enjoyment of the film. The critic expresses admiration for the acting and storyline. They praise the memorable character interpretations, particularly that of Rosalba Neri, who they note is \\"truly classic\\" and \\"very believable\\" in her role. The critic also appreciates other aspects of film-making displayed in the movie, such as the \\"excellent\\" music score and the theme song. They also make mention of specific scenes and elements that were \\"very amusing\\" and \\"very well done.\\" Despite pointing out a couple of flaws in the film such as the \\"ridiculous looking fight\\" and a character they consider \\"stupid and unnecessary,\\" their overall tone remains positive, concluding that the film is \\"a classic spaghetti western despite the faults.\\" Ultimately, the review ends on a strong recommendation to all fans of the genre to watch the movie, which is undeniably positive.

First, let's look at the numbers that are not attached to \\"r\\" (that's 7 and 55). We have -7 + 55. Let's add them: 55 - 7 = 48. So now our problem looks like this: 24*r + 48 = 0. 2.

Then, we get 24*r = -48. 3. Last step, our \\"r\\" is still being multiplied by 24. To find the value of \\"r\\", we need to do the opposite: we need to divide by 24. So, let's do -48 ÷ 24: -48 ÷ 24 = -2. And our answer is... r = -2! Good job solving the problem together!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I read this background article the other day: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] I am facing a new situation today: Mary and Ann got some fruit as a gift from a friend. Mary decided to candy the fruit, while Ann decided to eat them fresh, Mary received plums, peaches, apples and oranges. Ann got pears, quince, cherries and blackberries. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which fruit retained their quality longer peaches or cherries?","completion":"Based on the background article, candied fruit can retain its quality for a year due to the process of drenching the fruit in syrup, which causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar. This prevents the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavorable osmotic pressure it creates. In the new situation, Mary decided to candy the fruit she received, which included peaches, while Ann decided to eat her fruits, including cherries, fresh. When comparing the long-term quality retention of peaches and cherries, we need to consider the preservation methods. Since Mary decided to candy her peaches, they would undergo the preservation method outlined in the background article. This method allows the peaches to retain their quality for a year, as the sugar syrup they are placed in absorbs moisture and prevents microbial growth. On the other hand, Ann chose to eat her cherries fresh, without any form of preservation. Fresh cherries, like most fruits, have a limited shelf life depending on factors such as temperature, humidity, and exposure to air. Cherries are a delicate fruit with a high water content, and when not preserved or refrigerated, they can spoil quickly. The shelf life of fresh cherries can range from a few days to a couple of weeks depending on storage conditions. Considering the preservation methods used for each fruit, candied peaches would retain their quality longer compared to fresh cherries. The process of candying the peaches allows them to stay preserved for a year, while fresh cherries have a much shorter shelf life due to their delicate nature and absence of any preservation techniques."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Blue Buffalo Foundation: This foundation is a non-profit organization established in 2003 by Blue Buffalo. Its primary aim is to support pet cancer research and raise awareness about pet cancer. The foundation achieves this through financial support, sponsoring national pet cancer awareness walks, and collaborating with pet cancer study initiatives. 2.

Regarding the second question, a psychopath is an individual with a personality disorder that is characterized by traits such as a lack of empathy, remorse, and guilt. They often exhibit manipulative and antisocial behavior patterns. Now, addressing whether a psychopath would donate to a charity: it is possible for a psychopath to donate to charity, but their motivation might be different than that of a typical person. A psychopath may donate to a charity for various reasons, such as wanting to maintain a positive image, manipulate others, or gain social connections. Their primary motivation behind donating would often be self-centered, unlike the altruistic motives typically associated with charity donations. In conclusion, the questions are not the same. The first question is specific to whether Blue Buffalo, a pet food company, donates to charities. The answer is yes, as they have a history of engaging in various charitable activities, primarily focused on helping animals, through the Blue Buffalo Foundation and other partnerships. On the other hand, the second question deals with the possibility of a psychopath donating to charity.

So I have 2 buckets, one is to collect the concrete and the other is for water for certain tests and to clean my equipment.

This is frustrating because I need that bucket to collect my sample, this 2 bucket is crucial. So I decide to go look for my bucket, one of the workers informed me that he saw some of the guys take it to the 3rd floor. So I walk up there and see some guys working but I don't see my bucket. I see a bucket sitting on some plywood, it wasn't mine but I was frustrated and tired so I decided if they were going to take my bucket I'll just take theirs, no big deal right? Bucket for bucket.

Barack Obama's two daughters had another reason to high-five their dad's election to the presidency Tuesday night: they're getting a puppy. President Bush's dog Barney walks in the White House Rose Garden in 2007. \\"Sasha and Malia,\\" Obama said in his victory speech at Chicago's Grant Park, \\"I love you both so much, and you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the White House.\\" The new White House pet will follow in the paw-steps of a menagerie of animals that have had the run of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue over the years. The Bush family shared their eight years at the White House with a cat, a feisty English springer spaniel and two Scottish terriers -- all of whom have their own pages on the president's Web site. The Clintons' Washington stay included a cat, Socks, who did not get along with their chocolate Labrador retriever, Buddy. And Millie the springer spaniel's canine view of life in the White House -- as \\"told to\\" then-first lady Barbara Bush -- became a best-seller that outsold the memoirs of President George H.W. Bush. While many presidents took to heart President Harry Truman's admonishment -- \\"If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog\\" -- first pets have come in all shapes, sizes and species. Thomas Jefferson kept two grizzly bears in a cage on the White House lawn, while John Quincy Adams is said to have let his alligator use a bathtub inside. Calvin Coolidge walked his raccoons on a leash. Theodore Roosevelt's sons escorted their pet pony onto the White House elevator to cheer up a sick sibling. And perhaps the strangest of all: Martin Van Buren briefly owned two tiger cubs, a gift from the Sultan of Oman. Pets have sometimes been a boon to a president's image. But some have also taken a bite out of their popularity. Animal lovers howled in protest when Lyndon B. Johnson picked up his beagles, Him and Her, by the ears to provide photographers a better view. On the other hand, Richard Nixon -- running for vice president and accused of accepting illegal campaign contributions -- successfully defended himself in his famous \\"Checkers Speech.\\" The only gift he ever accepted was \\"a little cocker spaniel dog\\" that his daughter named Checkers, Nixon said. \\"And I just want to say this, right now, that regardless of what they say about it, we are going to keep it,\\" he added. Come January, the Obamas will make history by becoming the first African-American family to move into the White House. But if Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7, get what they've been promised, the new tenants will keep one long-standing tradition alive ... and wagging.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is a news article: Now open for just under three months, Walter and Margarita Manzke's hallmark restaurant, Republique, is coming under fire for its 3% healthcare surcharge added to every bill. KPCC reports that a few vocal Yelpers have complained of the surcharge that was instituted as a response to the requirement for companies with more than 50 full-time employees to provide healthcare. Everyone at Republique is entitled to sign up for an H.M.O., even down to the dishwashers, who are offered full-time status. One Yelper writes regarding the surcharge: \\"Needless to say... I didn't really feel that great about the mandatory 3% healthcare charge tacked on to the bill. I'd rather have used that money to go get a massage after sitting on those stools for so long.\\" Another complains: \\"One interesting side note is the 3% surcharge on the check that apparently serves to provide healthcare for the employees. Something about this strikes me as tacky. Sure, I could take this 3% out of my 20% tip, but why put me in that position to begin with? A bit silly for such an otherwise upscale experience.\\" And finally, a more reasonable response: \\"Lastly, they add a 3% surcharge to the bill for employee health insurance. I'm cool with that, but they should make it easy to not tip on the 3%. They warn you to do the math, but give me a break. Subtract 3% and then add 20%? Just feels like they expect you to say 'screw it' and tip on the entire total.\\" The practice has been common in the City of San Francisco, where restaurants collect an additional fee to apply to their employees' healthcare costs. However, a study by the Office of Labor Standards found that only a third of the fees collected, which amounted to 14 Million in 2011, actually went toward healthcare. It's that major discrepancy that's caused problems for the reputation of the healthcare surcharge. But that's in San Francisco. Republique is hoping to make a statement not only offering the benefit, but guaranteeing that the 3% charge will allay medical costs, just like the 28-day aged cote de boeuf is indeed, aged for 28 days. Staff at the restaurant have said that only a handful of customers have openly griped about the charge, but hefty percentage of Yelp reviews have mentioned the fee. Should restaurants charge an extra nominal fee to help provide healthcare for their employees, or should they simply implement those costs across the rest of the bill? ·Health care surcharge riles customers at top LA eatery [KPCC] ·All Republique Coverage [~ELA~] ||||| Today’s exciting new development in the anti-Obamacare resistance is that Gator’s Dockside, a Florida restaurant chain, is warning its customers of the terrible things that are happening to it, and them, as a result of the new health-care law. “The costs associated with ACA compliance could ultimately close our doors,” instructs the sign, “Instead of raising prices on our products to generate the additional revenue needed to cover the costs of ACA compliance, certain Gator’s Dockside locations have implemented a 1% surcharge on all food and beverage purchases only.” A one-percent surcharge! It’s like an Ayn Rand novel come to life! Conservatives find this development very exciting. Obviously, the restaurateur is thinking about this from the perspective of an angry talk-radio-listening Republican rather than that of a hard-headed capitalist. There are costs associated with all kinds of government regulations and spending, but he’s not creating a line item on his tab to highlight his share of, say, financing the Department of Defense. The main problem here is that, as an act of propaganda, this is completely self-defeating. Customers are told that the dreaded Obummercare may “ultimately” put the restaurant out of business – maybe one day, when the Sharia FEMA camp portion is phased in. But in the meantime, they’re covering it by making the two people buying lunch fork over an additional 20 cents to cover health insurance for the restaurant’s employees. That really doesn’t sound like the worst deal in the world. ||||| A Florida group that that manages several restaurants is already banking money for when the Obamacare employer mandate takes effect in 2015, and is charging customers a 1 percent surcharge on food and drinks. Currently only management employees of the eight Gator’s Dockside restaurants receive health insurance, but starting in December, in order to comply with the employer mandate, about 250 full-time employees will also receive health insurance, according to CNN Money. Sandra Clark, director of operations for the Gator Group that manages the restaurants, “is not sure how much the company is spending on compliance, but estimates that it will cost 500,000 a year to extend insurance to its full-time hourly restaurant workers,” CNN Money reported. “The surcharge may bring in about 160,000 a year, she hopes.” Gator’s Dockside isn’t the first restaurant to start charging an Obamacare fee. A Los Angeles restaurant has also implemented a surcharge. Gator’s Dockside could choose to not give full-time employees coverage even once the mandate kicks in, and pay a fine. Or the chain could reduce its current full-time employees’ hours, so that they only work part-time – and thus don’t qualify for health coverage under the employee mandate. But as the surcharge shows, Obamacare is no free lunch. Most businesses probably won’t opt to add a specific surcharge in order to cover their new health care costs, but some will certainly raise prices – or reduce quality of their products. Obamacare hasn’t driven down the costs of health insurance, or found a magical new source to cover those costs. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"A restaurant called Republique has added a 3% surcharge on every bill to help provide healthcare for their employees. Some customers don't like this additional charge. Another restaurant, Gator's Dockside, is charging a 1% surcharge for the same reason. People are discussing if it's a good idea for restaurants to add this extra fee for employee healthcare, or if they should find another way to pay for it."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Context: Sydney was having problems sleeping and they tossed and turned.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem. According to the above context, answer the following question. Why did the author say he wasn't a big fan of Vegas?

They questioned the long-term happiness of people prioritizing gambling over financial stability. Lastly, the author pointed out the juxtaposition between the extreme wealth displayed in Vegas and the homelessness they observed on the Strip, which made them feel uncomfortable.

Q:What is the full name of the person whose team locates a living heir? Answer the above question based on the context below: When the entire British royal family is killed in a freak accident outside Buckingham Palace, Sir Cedric Willingham leads a search for any surviving heirs to whom to pass the crown. After days of researching, his team finally locates a living heir in the form of an American named Ralph Jones. Shortly after being fired from his job as a lounge singer in Las Vegas, Ralph is informed by Cedric's assistant private secretary Duncan Phipps that his grandmother Constance had an affair with the first Duke of Warren while working as a hotel waitress when the Duke was visiting the United States, resulting in Ralph having royal blood. Phipps provides further proof by showing Ralph a duplicate of the ring his grandmother used to wear that the Duke had given her. Ralph is flown to London, where Cedric gives him a crash course on royal etiquette. In only his second day as King, he goes to a strip club and meets Miranda Greene, an out-of-luck exotic dancer and aspiring fashion designer, and dares her to go out on a date with him if the British press proves his claim to the monarchy. Meanwhile, Lord Percival Graves is opposed to having an American on the throne and proposes to declare the reigning House of Wyndham at an end and replace it with the House of Stuart, of which he is patriarch. Prime Minister Geoffrey Hale states that Ralph's succession is legitimate unless he commits a grievous error. With this in mind, Graves bribes a cash-strapped Miranda to stir up controversy by having a public relationship with Ralph. Despite warnings by Cedric not to commit a mistake similar to that of King Edward VIII, Ralph sneaks out of the Palace to have a romantic date with Miranda at Hyde Park. The next day, Miranda returns the money to Graves, but he already has photographs of her with Ralph. In order to preserve Ralph's reputation, Miranda breaks up with him.

Evernote is a versatile note-taking app that can be customized to fit your project management needs. By taking advantage of its features, you can turn Evernote into a useful tool for keeping track of and organizing your projects. Here are some steps to get you started using Evernote for project management: 1. Create a dedicated notebook for your project: Start by creating a new notebook in Evernote for your specific project. You can name it after the project to keep things organized. This will be the central location for all notes, resources, and files related to your project. 2. Use tags for categorization: To organize and categorize your project-related notes, you can use Evernote's tagging feature. You can create tags such as \\"To-do,\\" \\"In Progress,\\" \\"Completed,\\" and \\"On Hold\\" to track the status of tasks. You can also use tags to categorize the type of information, such as \\"Meeting Notes,\\" \\"Research,\\" \\"Ideas,\\" and \\"Files.\\" 3.

By using these integrations, you can easily move information between Evernote and your other project management tools. As for the basic example of calculating Net Realizable Value (NRV), it refers to the estimated selling price of inventory, minus the costs associated with its completion and disposal. It is an essential concept in accounting, particularly for valuing inventory. Here's a simple example: Suppose you have 100 units of a product. The estimated selling price per unit is 10. The costs to complete each unit are 2, and the costs of selling each unit are 1. To calculate the NRV, follow these steps: 1. Identify the estimated selling price: 100 units * 10 = 1,000. 2. Identify the costs to complete each unit: 100 units * 2 = 200. 3. Identify the costs of selling each unit: 100 units * 1 = 100. 4. Calculate the Net Realizable Value: NRV = (Selling Price) - (Costs to Complete) - (Costs of Selling) NRV = (1,000) - (200) - (100) NRV = 700. In this example, the net realizable value of the inventory is 700. Regarding your last question, the two given options can be interpreted as answers to a yes/no question: I. no II. yes The question asks whether the two original questions—\\"Can I use Evernote as a project management tool?\\" and \\"What is a basic example of calculating Net Realizable Value?\\"—have the same meaning. The answer to this question is option I. no, as these two questions address different topics and purposes. The first question refers to using Evernote for project management, while the second question focuses on an accounting concept related to calculating inventory value."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Steuart family of Maryland was a prominent political family in the early History of Maryland which dates back to when Europeans began exploring the area, starting with the Italian/Venetian named what?","completion":"The Steuart family of Maryland was indeed a prominent political family in the early history of Maryland, playing significant roles in social, economic, and political affairs during the colonial era and beyond. Their history in Maryland dates back to the time when Europeans first began exploring and establishing settlements in the area. While many explorers contributed to the early exploration of the region, the person you are specifically referring to as starting the exploration of the area is John Cabot. John Cabot, born as Giovanni Caboto in Italy, was a Venetian explorer and navigator. He is known for his 1497 voyage to North America, during which he claimed the region that would later become Canada for the Kingdom of England. While Cabot was not the first European to set foot in the Americas, nor was he the first to explore what would become Maryland, his voyages marked the beginning of the Age of Exploration and laid the groundwork for future exploration and colonization of North America by Europeans. The Steuart family's ancestry can be traced back to George H. Steuart (1700-1784), a Scottish physician who settled in Maryland in the early 18th century. The family gained prominence through their involvement in various aspects of the early Maryland society, including politics, land ownership, and military service. Key members of the Steuart family include: 1. George H. Steuart (1700-1784), the family patriarch in the Maryland colony, who served as a physician and landowner. 2. George H. Steuart (1738-1800), a delegate to the Maryland Constitutional Convention, a member of the Maryland State Senate, and a lieutenant colonel during the American Revolutionary War. 3. Richard Sprigg Steuart (1797-1876), a prominent physician and one of the founders of the Maryland Medical College. 4. George H. Steuart (1828-1903), a Confederate general during the American Civil War, known for his role in the battles of Gettysburg and Cross Keys. 5. Richard Sprigg Steuart (1885-1972), a politician and lawyer, who served as a Maryland State Senator and a state's attorney.

James Morton, 24, enjoyed dominating women, having watched the behaviour in pornographic films and experimented with at least one ex-girlfriend. He started to strangle Hannah Pearson - his friend's girlfriend - without any warning or permission, the judge said. Her naked body was found in his bedroom in Newark, Nottinghamshire, last July. A jury cleared him of murder but convicted him of her manslaughter. In mitigation, his defence barrister Shaun Smith said Morton had been \\"pursuing his sexual thrill without having regard for the consequences of it\\". Hannah's mother, Dawn Pearson, stood up at Nottingham Crown Court to read a statement describing the impact of the \\"horrifying act\\" on her family. \\"A parent should not have to bury their own child, a child who has not even had a chance to live a life on her own,\\" she said. Mrs Pearson explained how Hannah had been given a \\"second chance at life\\", after recovering from anorexia. \\"Hannah made many friends and lived her life to the full after being in hospital for so many years,\\" she said. \\"She had been given a whole new lease of life, a second chance at life, and she was making the most of it.\\" Hannah, from Marston in Lincolnshire, met Morton for the first time on 23 July 2016, the day of her death. The trial heard that she went back to his parents' home in Pierson Street in Newark without her boyfriend, Jed Hope, because Mr Hope did not have enough money for the train. Morton gave Hannah wine, port and beer, then put her in his bed at the end of the evening, the court heard. Morton claimed that Hannah started kissing him, and Mrs Justice Carr said she could not be sure on the evidence that Hannah \\"did not instigate some sexual activity\\". However, the judge said Hannah did not consent to being strangled. \\"You enjoyed the domination, something which you had seen on a porn DVD previously, and also tried with at least one previous girlfriend,\\" the judge said. \\"I am sure, as the jury was, that Hannah did not give valid and informed consent to this escalated activity in the knowledge that it carried the risk of some bodily injury. \\"She had never been involved in such activity before, was very intoxicated and, if not totally unconscious, then certainly confused and not thinking straight. \\"She was in no position to object, trapped underneath you whilst you strangled her.\\" Morton phoned 999 after realising Hannah was not breathing, but it took him 20 minutes to do so. The judge said he was \\"preoccupied\\" with his own \\"wellbeing and position\\" for at least some of this time, which was \\"a chilling aspect of the case\\".

Horatio Walter Lonsdale was Burges's chief artist, contributing extensive murals for both Castell Coch and Cardiff Castle. His main sculptor was Thomas Nicholls who started with Burges at Cork, completing hundreds of figures for Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral, worked with him on his two major churches in Yorkshire, and undertook all of the original carving for the Animal Wall at Cardiff.William Gualbert Saunders joined the Buckingham Street team in 1865 and worked with Burges on the development of the design and techniques of stained-glass manufacture, producing much of the best glass for Saint Fin Barre's.

Looking back: Sir Michael Caine talks about his early memories of Bambi as part of the Million Disney Memories campaign. Several stars say Bambi left them in floods of tears when they were children. Sir Michael Caine said: 'My memories were Snow White and Bambi in those days, I remember crying my eyes out when Bambi’s mother died in the forest and laughing my head off at the Seven Dwarfs. 'I grew up with cartoons. My favourite Disney villain would have to be the wicked witch from Snow White, I think she is great and my favourite Disney hero is Mickey Mouse, he was my first hero and my favourite.' Cold Feet star Fay Ripley also said one of her first Disney memories was of Bambi.

'I was quite traumatised and I cried a lot,' she said. 'I. remember thinking it was so awful for poor Snow White and I felt so. terrible about all the dwarfs and it really, really upset me. 'Then. my parents got me a Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs book and put my. name in it as if I was their friend and I remember being very frightened. by that, thinking that I was involved in the story – although I think. I’d quite like that now.' Dear deer: Cold Feet star Fay Ripley said her first Disney memory was of Bambi.

Eat carrots 3 or 4 times a week to reduce pain from gastritis. Choose low-fat dairy products to decrease pain from gastritis. Stay away from caffeinated beverages to avoid agitating your stomach.","completion":"Title: The Ultimate Guide to Eating Habits That Help Manage Gastritis Pain Introduction Gastritis, a common medical condition that affects millions of people worldwide, is characterized by inflammation or irritation of the stomach lining. Symptoms typically include stomach pain, bloating, indigestion, and heartburn. While medication and lifestyle changes can help manage the condition, diet plays a crucial role in alleviating gastritis pain. In this article, we will discuss eating habits that are beneficial for individuals suffering from gastritis, including the benefits of eating smaller meals throughout the day, avoiding specific irritants, and incorporating certain foods like carrots and low-fat dairy products into the diet. Eating Several Small Meals Spaced Throughout the Day One of the most effective ways to manage gastritis pain is by adjusting the frequency and size of meals. Eating several small meals spaced throughout the day helps ease the digestive process for the stomach lining, reducing the risk of irritation and inflammation. Consuming smaller portions allows the stomach to digest food more efficiently, subsequently minimizing the production of stomach acid and decreasing the likelihood of gastritis flare-ups. Avoiding Spicy, Greasy, or Acidic Foods Foods that are spicy, greasy, or acidic can exacerbate gastritis pain and should be minimized or avoided. These types of foods can irritate the stomach lining, increasing inflammation and worsening symptoms. Some examples of such foods include: - Spicy dishes, such as curries, hot sauces, and chili peppers - Greasy or fried foods like French fries, onion rings, and fried chicken - Acidic foods like tomatoes, citrus fruits, vinegar, and some salad dressings Consuming Carrots to Reduce Gastritis Pain Carrots, a popular and easily accessible vegetable, have been shown to help reduce gastritis pain when consumed regularly. Rich in antioxidants and other essential nutrients, carrots promote healthy digestion and protect the stomach lining from damage. Eating carrots three or four times a week can support gut health and provide relief from gastritis symptoms. Choosing Low-Fat Dairy Products Dairy products can be a double-edged sword for individuals with gastritis. While they can provide essential nutrients like calcium, high-fat dairy products like whole milk, butter, and cream can exacerbate stomach lining irritation and increase gastritis pain. Opting for low-fat dairy products such as skim milk, low-fat yogurt, and cottage cheese can help minimize pain from gastritis while still providing necessary nutrients. Avoiding Caffeinated Beverages Caffeinated drinks, like coffee, tea, and some sodas, can worsen gastritis symptoms by stimulating the production of stomach acid and irritating the stomach lining. It is essential for individuals coping with gastritis to avoid or greatly reduce consumption of caffeinated beverages to prevent further aggravation of the condition. Conclusion Managing gastritis pain through dietary adjustments is crucial for individuals suffering from this common condition. By eating several small meals throughout the day, avoiding spicy, greasy, and acidic foods, and incorporating specific foods like carrots and low-fat dairy products into the diet, gastritis sufferers can experience significant relief from their symptoms. Additionally, cutting back on caffeinated beverages can further protect the stomach lining and promote overall gut health. Developing these healthy eating habits can help reduce pain from gastritis, improve digestion, and promote a better quality of life for those living with this chronic condition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He would get up in the morning, and then put them in what state again? Choices: - upside down - in motion - active - wakefulness - resthold The rationale to choose \\"in motion\\" as the answer is that: The answer is:","completion":"\\"In motion\\" is the most appropriate choice because it relates directly to James's bouncing rubber balls and their original state. Here's a detailed rationale for each of the choices: 1. Upside down - This choice doesn't apply to the situation because it refers to a change in position that is irrelevant to the context of bouncing rubber balls. Flipping an object upside down would not typically have any impact on whether or not the object is in motion. 2. In motion - The inferences from the question suggest that the bouncing rubber balls were not in motion during the night, allowing James to sleep. In the morning, to engage with the rubber balls again, he would most likely put them back into their original state, which would be \\"in motion.\\" This choice effectively conveys the idea that James sets the balls into motion when he's awake and ready to begin his day. 3. Active - While \\"active\\" might seem like a plausible choice at first, it's still vague and less specific than \\"in motion.\\" \\"Active\\" can refer to any state where something is functioning or in use, while \\"in motion\\" provides a clearer image of the rubber balls bouncing and moving, which aligns better with the given context. 4. Wakefulness - Choosing \\"wakefulness\\" would indicate that the rubber balls have a consciousness, which is improbable given their nature as inanimate objects. Although James may indeed be in a state of wakefulness when he interacts with the balls in the morning, this choice does not directly address their change in state. 5. Resthold - This term is unclear and not commonly used, which makes it difficult to understand how it directly relates to the situation. Moreover, it may give the impression of resting or holding back, which contradicts the idea of the rubber balls being set back into motion. In conclusion, the best choice is \\"in motion\\" as it accurately reflects the change in state of James's bouncing rubber balls when he wakes up in the morning and restarts his daily activities. This choice is the most straightforward and specific option, compared to the others, which might be vague, unrelated, or simply not applicable to the given context."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The incident began when California Highway Patrol officers attempted to pull over Rodney King for speeding on a Los Angeles freeway. King, who had been drinking and was on parole at the time, did not comply and led the police on an eight-mile high-speed chase. The pursuit concluded in Lake View Terrace, a residential neighborhood in Los Angeles, when King's car came to a stop. LAPD officers arrived at the scene to assist in the arrest. What transpired next was captured on George Holliday's videotape—an approximately 12-minute footage, portraying a portion of the violent encounter between the LAPD officers and King. The tape showed King being repeatedly struck with metal batons, kicked, and tasered by the police officers, while he appeared to be offering little to no resistance. King suffered severe injuries, including multiple skull fractures, broken bones, bruises, and permanent brain damage. The widespread dissemination of Holliday's videotape led to public outrage and debates on police brutality, racism, and the excessive use of force by law enforcement agencies. The four LAPD officers involved in the beating—Stacey Koon, Theodore Briseno, Timothy Wind, and Laurence Powell—were eventually charged with assault with a deadly weapon, excessive use of force under color of authority, and other offenses. On April 29, 1992, a predominantly white jury acquitted the four officers of the majority of the charges. The verdict ignited strong reactions from the Los Angeles community, particularly within the African-American population, who saw the acquittal as a clear example of racial injustice. Within hours of the verdict, the city erupted into chaos, with mobs taking to the streets, setting fires, looting stores, and committing acts of violence. The Los Angeles Riots lasted for six days, from April 29 to May 4, 1992. The National Guard, the U.S. military, and federal law enforcement agencies were deployed to quell the violence. As a result, 53 people were killed, thousands were injured, and thousands of businesses were destroyed or severely damaged. The riots also exposed the underlying racial and social tensions that persisted in the United States, leading to widespread calls for police reform, equal justice, and a reexamination of the nation's social and economic policies. The Rodney King incident and the subsequent riots had significant and lasting impacts on American society, as the issues of police brutality and racial inequality were brought to the forefront of public discourse. In the years that followed, there would be efforts to reform policing, demand accountability for law enforcement officers guilty of excessive force, and initiate national conversations on race relations and social justice. Ultimately, George Holliday's videotape of the Rodney King beating served as a critical catalyst for change and remains an indelible reminder of the consequences of unchecked power and systemic racism within the criminal justice system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write some highlights for the following article: Only one percentage points separates Democrat Bruce Braley and Republican Joni Ernst in the race to represent Iowa in the U.S. Senate. If the election were held today, 49% of likely Iowa voters say they would vote for Braley and 48% say they would support Ernst, according to a new CNN/ORC poll. That means the contentious race is within the survey's overall sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The electorate is far from solidified. Twenty percent of likely voters polled in Iowa said they could change their mind before Election Day in November. The Braley-Ernst race has been one of the most closely watched of the election year. With longtime Sen. Tom Harkin retiring, Democrats are fighting to keep the seat in blue hands and hope that a win in Iowa will keep the Senate in Democratic control. Republicans have other ideas, however, and hope that Ernst -- currently a state senator and lieutenant colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard -- will be able to flip the seat. With a little less than two months until Election Day, the race has already seen millions of dollars spent. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the two candidates had spent almost 6 million as of July. That figure doesn't include the millions that outside Republican and Democratic groups have spent on the race, either. Even with all the money spent, some likely voters are still unaware of each candidate. Six percent of likely Iowa voters are unfamiliar with Ernst, while 9% of voters say they are unfamiliar with Braley. Partisanship appears to trump identity politics in the race, too. Most women are supporting Braley, the Democratic man, while most men are supporting Ernst, the Republican woman. The two candidates are basically flipped with likely male and female voters: Braley is winning 41% of men and 57% of women, while Ernst is winning 56% of men and 41% of women. The CNN/ORC poll was conducted September 8-10, with 1,013 Iowa adults -- 608 likely voters -- questioned by telephone.","completion":"1.

Article:","completion":"Title: A Flavorsome Journey: Enhancing Chocolate with Nutty, Tangy, and Salty Delights Introduction Chocolate has been a beloved treat for generations, satisfying cravings and bringing smiles to young and old alike. It has journeyed a long way from its origins as a Mesoamerican beverage to the sweet treat we enjoy today. While universally loved by many, chocolate can at times feel a bit one-dimensional. Those seeking a more adventurous chocolate experience might wonder how to elevate its taste to new heights. In this article, we will explore how to infuse chocolate with unique and captivating flavors, such as peanut butter, sea salt, nuts, and dried fruit, creating a treat that excites the palate and delights the senses. Peanut Butter: The Nutty Sidekick The beloved staple of peanut butter is not simply for spreading on a sandwich; it can also be a delicious partner to chocolate. Mixing peanut butter into melted chocolate creates a delightful fusion of nutty and sweet, reminiscent of childhood favorites such as Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups. To create this delectable combination, gently melt your chosen chocolate in a double boiler or microwave, ensuring to stir frequently to avoid burning. Once melted, gradually mix in smooth or crunchy peanut butter to your desired taste and consistency. Whisk until smooth and set aside to cool. Sea Salt: A Tantalizing Contrast Sea salt is not an unfamiliar companion to sweet treats. Salted caramel and chocolate-covered pretzels have long been popular for their enticing mix of sweet and salty. Adding a pinch of sea salt to your peanut butter-infused chocolate creates that irresistible sweet and salty taste. Allow the sea salt to be your gourmet touch by selecting a high-quality variety, such as Maldon or Himalayan pink salt. Once the peanut butter-chocolate mixture has slightly cooled, sprinkle in a small amount of salt and mix thoroughly. Remember, a little goes a long way, so adding too much salt could overpower the other flavors – taste as you go to perfect the balance. Toasted Nuts: A Crunchy Delight Nuts and chocolate are a time-honored pairing, dating as far back as Aztec times, when chocolate was a beverage often adorned with ground almonds. Adding nuts not only brings a delightful crunch but also introduces a new layer of flavor and texture to the chocolate. Start by selecting your nuts of choice – almonds, hazelnuts, or pecans would all be excellent options. Lightly toast the nuts in a dry pan or oven, ensuring they don't burn. Once cooled, chop or crush the nuts, then gently fold them into the chocolate-peanut butter mixture. Dried Fruit: A Burst of Tangy Chewiness Dried fruit provides a bright and tangy counterpoint to the rich, smooth flavors of the chocolate-peanut butter mixture. Think of popular fruit and chocolate combinations, such as orange and dark chocolate, and experiment with various dried fruits to achieve a similar effect. Choose your desired fruit – dried apricots, cherries, cranberries, or blueberries all offer a pleasant tanginess. Chop larger fruit pieces into small, manageable sizes, and fold them into the chocolate-peanut butter mix. Conclusion By incorporating peanut butter, sea salt, toasted nuts, and dried fruit into your chocolate, you create a truly unique and delightful confection. No longer a simple bar of chocolate, this treat boasts a symphony of flavors, textures, and memories that transcend the ordinary. Serve these chocolate treats at your next gathering or simply enjoy them yourself – either way, your taste buds are in for a tantalizing experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context: Theodore Honey, an eccentric \\"boffin\\" with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, is working on solving a difficult aviation crash problem. A widower with a 12-year-old daughter, Elspeth, Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada. He theorizes the accident happened because of the tailplane's structural failure, caused by sudden metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. To test the theory in his laboratory, a rear airframe is being vibrated at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles. It is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure. Despite the fact that his theory is not yet proven, he decides to warn the aircrew and Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale, a fellow passenger. After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly and seriously damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory and save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press. Teasdale and an airline stewardess Marjorie Corder both take a liking to Mr. Honey and Elspeth, who they discover is lonely and isolated from her schoolmates. Teasdale speaks to Honey's superiors on his behalf, claiming she believes in him. Corder, meanwhile, has stayed on with Honey and his daughter as a nurse.

Article: A team of British surgeons has carried out Gaza's first organ transplants for a long-term plan to train local medical staff to perform the operations. Two patients underwent kidney transplants at the Shifa, Gaza's biggest public hospital. The operations were conducted a fortnight ago by a volunteer medical team from the Royal Liverpool hospital. Ziad Matouk, 42, was born with one kidney and was diagnosed with renal failure several years ago. Matouk, whose wife donated one of her kidneys, hopes to return to his job within six months. The couple had sought a transplant in Cairo, but were rejected as unsuitable at a state hospital and could not afford the fee at a private hospital. \\"We were desperate,\\" said Matouk. The UK-Gaza link-up began about a year ago after Abdelkader Hammad, a doctor at the Royal Liverpool hospital, was contacted by an anaesthetist at the Shifa, who outlined the difficulties the Gaza hospital was facing with dialysis . The Shifa is forced to rely on generators because of power cuts; spare parts for its ageing dialysis machines have been difficult to import; and supplies of consumables are often scarce. After an exploratory trip last April, Hammad---whose family is Palestinian---and three colleagues from Liverpool arrived in Gaza via Egypt last month, bringing specialist equipment. Two patients were selected for surgery. The first, Mohammed Duhair, 42, received a kidney donated by his younger brother in a six-hour operation. Two days later, Matouk received a transplant after his wife, Nadia, 36, was found to be a good match. The surgeon was carried out by the British team, assisted by doctors and nurses from the Shifa. \\"We are very satisfied with the results,\\" said Sobbi Skaik, head of surgery at the Gaza hospital. Skaik hopes that Gaza medical teams will eventually carry out kidney transplants independently, and that other organ transplants may follow.

I just want to thank you for giving your time to read our story and to understand what our family and my twins have been going through so that maybe this can have an impact on somebody else and maybe help them with their future illnesses they may have. This is a journey of their health and wellness, spiritual needs and everything else that will come along the way. I will be posting quite frequently, giving updates on the boys and what's going on in their daily lives as they endure their battle with what's called \\"cirrhosis of the liver\\" from a genetic mutation that they found. The cirrhosis is not from the commonly known factors that would typically cause cirrhosis of the liver. This is strictly from a mutated gene found in the boy's DNA during its splitting, and somehow this gene is believed to have caused several symptoms and issues, and we are still trying to figure it out with the help of a genetics doctor.Nicholas and Devin were born October 20th, 1999 as healthy identical twin boys, who were beautiful baby boys. They were a blessing to me when I found out during the ultrasound that I was going to have twins, as my mother has also had twins, so don't necessarily believe in the myth that it skips a generation because it doesn't! Haha.Through the years they have been healthy for the most part besides getting head colds, strep throat and common childhood illnesses that kids get. The diagnosis of liver disease began when Nicholas called me from school complaining of his hamstring burning so bad that he could hardly sit in his school desk. He complained about it throughout that night, and I told him it may be just growing pains as my boys were growing inches like crazy. Now they're 5'10\\"! As we brushed it off as maybe being just growing pains, the following day he called me again in tears and that it was so severe he couldn't stand it any longer. I left work and brought him to the emergency room . The ER Doctor ran blood work and saw that he had platelets that were really low, but he didn't understand if that was a correlation with the hamstring burning. We were then referred to see a Hema-Oncologist at Children's Hospital for a follow-up. You can imagine the scare that I had when I had a doctor tell me to see a Hema-Oncologist. I instantly thought blood cancer. I had no idea that that would eventually become a reality much later down the line. I told the doctor that I had identical boys and he said I should have his brother checked too. We went to their pediatrician and Devin's CBC showed a low platelet count in the 40,000 range. Normally platelets range 150,000 to 450,000. We knew there was something wrong.After numerous trips to Children's hospital seeing different specialist, we were referred to a liver doctor at Ochsner in Jefferson, LA. Both Nicholas and Devin were scheduled for an ultrasound of the abdomen and that is when they saw some problems with the liver being abnormal with nodular growths throughout. The liver had been compensating, for the lack of, over a long period of time and grew extra vessels and nodules to help the blood flow. Their spleen grew twice it's size to compensate for the lack of the liver function. Following the ultrasound they did a cat-scan and saw more extensive issues and decided to set them up for a liver biopsy. Both boys went in to have this liver biopsy in March 2017, and were found to have severe scar tissue on the liver, followed by the diagnosis of cirrhosis of the liver.It has been brought to mind that this has been occurring for a long period of time because it takes a long time for the liver to get scarred, but this was something that we didn't even know was happening. All of this was brought about just by Nick having blood work done due to the burning in his hamstrings. Something that could have been totally unrelated. So from there they were scheduled every two months for blood work, (CBC), keeping an eye on their liver enzymes, platelets, etc. Everything was going \\"good\\" until one night Nick came in from work, where he was working a part-time job at Sonic after school, and he came in bent over in excruciating pain. I knew something was wrong and rushed him to the ER. They did a cat-scan and blood work, eased his pain, and felt it was best that he get transferred by ambulance to Oschner in Jefferson where his liver doctors were so that they can follow up his care. From there, he was admitted for one week to observe, run test after test, and try to find what was causing his abdomen to be in excruciating pain. After another ultrasound and an MRI, they found suspicious lesions, one measuring 10cm, on his liver that had grown over a period from March to August and needed to do another liver biopsy. This was such a fast growth and not seen in previous scans. I will never forget August 31st, 2017, when I was told that Nick was diagnosed with Angiosarcoma, cancer of the inner lining of the blood vessels. A very rare, incurable, aggressive cancer that formed in his liver. I felt like my whole world had changed in that moment. So many questions were rushing through my mind and I didn't know the severity of what he had but all I knew is that my son, a healthy young twin boy, is now battling cancer on top of cirrhosis of the liver. What do I do now? How do I accept this? Why God, why? All of these questions and so many others flew through my mind. From feeling angry. To bitterness. Why him? I cried and cried and it was all I could do to not collapse to my knees completely overtaken with emotion. But I knew I had to hold strong for my son, even as hard as that was. To have all of your emotions bottled up but to hold back sharing it with your son, hoping to show strength and reassurance. Hoping to show him this isn't the end, everything will be okay, but deep in my heart, I knew it was bad. Nick is now sitting there in the hospital bed, after being hospitalized for a full week, having a biopsy, undergoing test after test, probe after probe, doctor after doctor. Observations, conversations, and now results that sent his world crashing in on him. A high school spenior with a multitude of possibilities ahead. I remember the doctor walking in and explaining to our family the type of cancer that he has and told Nick, \\"Nick, what is it that you want to do right now in the near future?\\" And Nick said, \\"I want to walk across that stage and graduate.\\" The doctor then said, \\"I will see to it that that happens as best as possible.\\" It's sometimes little things like that that mean the most to someone that was just given a terminal disease and a death sentence. I cannot even imagine what was running through my 17 year old's mind at that time. But I do know that as a mother, I have to give these boys strength, give them hope and give them courage to overcome. I have always been the strength in the family and the boys continue to expect me to be that way. I am their solid rock and as Nick told me the other day, I am his best friend. Words spoken through his pain that meant a lot a mother. Thank you all for following along on our journey of trials, truth and triumph. We are going to stand and fight, and we know God is with us every step of the way.

The Louisiana teen underwent a life-saving liver transplant in January — but his brother was not so fortunate. “Devin is holding strong. Outwardly he’s showing strength, but I don’t how his emotions are internally,” the twins’ mother, Margi Coats, tells PEOPLE. “He knows that it’s an unfortunate situation that he had to lose his brother. But he knows Nick’s name and legacy will hopefully change the way our country is.” The inseparable twin brothers were diagnosed with stage four cirrhosis of the liver, and both needed to be placed on the waiting list for a transplant. Although Devin underwent the Jan. 11 procedure, Margi says Nick wasn’t “sick enough” to be eligible for the waiting list. By the time he had secured a liver and was taken into the operating room, Nick had developed rare hepatic angiosarcoma, which spread beyond the liver. Devin (left) and Nick Coats Courtesy Coats Family “[Doctors] couldn’t go any further because it was an inoperable condition at that point,” Margi tells PEOPLE. “I was devastated. I was overcome with the overwhelming feeling of sadness knowing I was going to lose my son. Had he not had to wait to be eligible to be listed on the donor registry, he would not have had the chance to develop angiosarcoma.” She adds: “He did have a liver available, but because he had to wait in the beginning to be eligible to be listed, that’s what caused all of these problems … you have to get sick enough in order to get better and it shouldn’t be that way.” Margi first revealed the news of Nick’s death in a post on a Facebook page dedicated to chronicling the twins’ journey. She said Nick “fought hard to have a new chance at life,” and described him in a post as “strong” and “courageous.” Nick (left) and Devin Coats Courtesy Coats Family “Nick was my protector and he loved his family,” Margi continued. “Nick showed others his genuine heart and was a good friend to many.” On a GoFundMe page set up for the family, Margi explained that Nick first exhibited symptoms of illness with pain in his legs. She said she first chalked it up to “growing pains.” Nick Coats Courtesy Coats Family On their GoFundMe page, Margi explained that it was Nick who first exhibited symptoms with pain in his legs that she at first thought were “growing pains.” Now, Margi says she’s dedicated to encouraging the public to become organ donors so “people who are dying on a daily basis won’t have to wait anymore.” “You cannot take your organs to heaven, heaven knows we need them here,” she tells PEOPLE. “Nick has now had to pay his price in life. Nick’s in a better place. He’s singing. He’s rejoicing. He’s encouraging me to move on with this. He knows he’s got a strong mother.” ||||| Identical twin teenagers Devin and Nick Coats, described by their mother as \\"best friends,\\" have now been separated forever. Both were diagnosed last year with the same severe liver disease and both needed transplants. Devin received a liver transplant in January, and he has “a new lease on life,” Margi Coats, his mother, told ABC News. He will graduate from high school in two months. For Nick, a new liver came too late. On Tuesday, Margi posted the news of her son’s death on a Facebook page devoted to the brothers. “As Nick now has a new life in heaven, he left behind his twin. Devin feels a deep loss... He will wake this morning and feel empty. He will look for Nick and the realization will hit him hard,” she wrote. Margi Coats Margi blames this heart-rending outcome on the shortage of organ donors and available organs in the United States. Early last year, Nick began suffering a severe burning sensation in his legs. Margi said she brushed it off as \\"growing pains.\\" But the pain did not go away. Blood tests indicated deeper trouble and doctors recommended that Devin also get an evaluation, which resulted in an identical diagnosis for the identical twins: Stage 4 cirrhosis of the liver. The chronic liver disease usually results in liver failure and scarring where treatment can help but there's no cure and in some cases, as with the Coats twins, a liver transplant is necessary. Both boys would become eligible for the transplant registry but not until their condition deteriorated enough to qualify for it. While they waited, according to their mom, Nick developed cancer that would eventually keep him from being able to receive a new liver. In an interview with ABC News just before Nick died, Margi said, “When he got diagnosed with liver cirrhosis, at that time, if we had enough organs available across this country, none of this would have been an issue. Nicholas would not have developed cancer on his diseased liver.” Margi Coats Indeed, organ donation does lag far behind the demand. Over 116,000 people in the U.S. are waiting for a life-saving organ transplant while an average of 20 people die each day waiting for a transplant, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing. Devin managed to withstand the ravages of the disease long enough for an organ to become available. But, according to his mother, guilt and concern for his brother were also taking a toll. “When they called Devin in to have his liver transplant (in January), he didn’t want to have it done. He wanted his brother to go in for him,” she said. But Nick was still undergoing cancer chemotherapy and could not endure a transplant. By late February, doctors believed the cancer was at bay and a liver became available. As surgeons prepared Nick for the transplant in late February, they discovered that the cancer had metastasized and a transplant would do no good. Nick wanted to spend his last days at home, in his own room, according to Margi. “I stayed awake holding his hand all night with my heart pounding waiting for him to take his last breath,\\" she said of one of his last nights. \\"And I can tell you, it’s the most frightening thing in the world for a mother to lay in bed with her son, holding his hand, waiting for him to pass.\\" Margi Coats Devin, she said, faces a \\"big, big adjustment. Having a new lease on life and feeling good about that... but also fighting the guilt he has because he’s going to survive and he’s watch[ed] his brother here in the same house slowly fade away.” She has channeled her own pain into a call for organ donation. “This is ridiculous,” she said. “There [are] way too many people in this country for us to have a shortage of organs. When you go in the ground, you’re in the ground. Extend your loved one's life in somebody else.” That was her last wish for Nick, as well. “I would love for Nick to be able to give up a part of himself to someone else,\\" Margi said, \\"and know that he can continue living through someone else.” |||||","completion":"Identical twin brothers Devin and Nick Coats were both diagnosed with stage four cirrhosis of the liver and urgently needed transplants due to their severe liver disease.

I know that the answer to the question \\"What where people drinking that normally makes them smell good\\" is in \\"In May 1985, Gorbachev delivered a speech in Leningrad advocating reforms and an anti-alcohol campaign to tackle widespread alcoholism. Prices on vodka, wine, and beer were raised in order to make these drinks more expensive and a disincentive to consumers, and the introduction of rationing. Unlike most forms of rationing intended to conserve scarce goods, this was done to restrict sales with the overt goal of curtailing drunkenness. Gorbachev's plan also included billboards promoting sobriety, increased penalties for public drunkenness, and to censor drinking scenes from old movies. Although this program was not a direct copycat of Tsar Nicholas II's outright prohibition during World War I, Gorbachev faced the same adverse economic reaction as did the last Tsar. The disincentivization of alcohol consumption was a serious blow to the state budget according to Alexander Yakovlev, who noted annual collections of alcohol taxes decreased by 100 billion rubles. Alcohol production migrated to the black market, or through moonshining as some made \\"bathtub vodka\\" with homegrown potatoes. Poorer, less educated Russians resorted to drinking unhealthy substitutes such as nail polish, rubbing alcohol or men's cologne, which only served to be an additional burden on Russia's healthcare sector due to the subsequent poisoning cases.

To provide a detailed and long answer, the invention of the toothbrush can be traced back to various forms and materials that have been used throughout history. However, the modern toothbrush that we know today made from nylon bristles and plastic handles originated in the 20th century. In earlier times, people in various cultures used natural resources such as chew sticks, tree twigs, bird feathers, or animal bones to clean their teeth. The innovation of toothbrushes can be divided into two critical milestones: 1. The early form of toothbrushes: The first recorded use of a toothbrush dates back to China during the Tang Dynasty (619-907 AD). These toothbrushes were made from coarse hog hairs attached to a handle made of bamboo or bone. The bristle toothbrush later spread its usage to Europe, brought by travelers in the 17th century. European adaptation of the toothbrush modified the design by using softer materials for bristles, such as horsehair or feathers. 2. The modern toothbrush: The first patent for a toothbrush was filed by H. N. Wadsworth on November 7, 1857, in the United States (US Patent No. 18,653). However, the mass production of toothbrushes did not begin until the late 19th century. The first toothbrush made with nylon bristles was introduced by DuPont de Nemours, an American company, in 1938. The use of nylon made toothbrushes more effective and hygienic than their natural bristle counterparts. Furthermore, the design of toothbrushes continued to evolve with the development of electric toothbrushes, which were first invented in Switzerland in 1954. In summary, the answer to \\"Who invented the toothbrush?\\" would refer to a human being who created the early form of toothbrushes, which can be traced back to China during the Tang Dynasty, where a toothbrush made from hog hairs and bamboo or bone handles was used. Over time, the design of toothbrushes evolved, leading to the modern toothbrush introduced by DuPont de Nemours in 1938 with nylon bristles."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: \\"In Cold Blood\\", adapted by director Richard Brooks from Truman Capote's famous novel, deals with the brutal and senseless murder of a family of four by a pair of hapless criminals. The film excels as a character study of the killers, particularly trigger-man Perry Smith (Robert Blake). The cast includes few recognizable names but they nevertheless bring the story to life with ease. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are excellent together as two criminals with disparate personalities. They play off of each other effortlessly while Blake also gets plenty of opportunities to explore his character's idiosyncrasies. The rest of the cast is merely average and isn't worth remarking on. Richard Brooks received Oscar nominations for both his script and his direction. In my opinion, both were excellent, though the script does miscalculate with some ill-advised narration in the late stages. The Oscar-nominated cinematography by Conrad Hall is also top-notch, as is the editing. Also worthy of note is the jazzy score by Quincy Jones which secured the last of the film's four Oscar nominations. Unlike so many other crime films, this one doesn't glamorize violence. Brooks turns the killers into pitiable characters rather than flatly condemning them. Whether or not you agree with that sentiment the film does present an interesting alternative to the usual Hollywood approach. I recommend the film for this reason and also for the expertise with which the technical aspects are handled. Options are: a). negative. b). positive.","completion":"b). positive. The sentiment of the review is positive because the reviewer praises various aspects of the film \\"In Cold Blood,\\" including the character development, the performances of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, Richard Brooks' direction and script, the cinematography, and the score by Quincy Jones. Although the reviewer mentions some shortcomings, such as the rest of the cast being average and a minor issue with the script, these do not outweigh the overall positive tone of the review.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the church that is of red brick and Pevsner considered it \\"astonishingly restrained.\\" , can you please find it? In 1859 Burges began work with Ambrose Poynter on the Maison Dieu, Dover, which was completed in 1861. Emulation of the original medieval style can be seen in his renovation of the grotesque animals and in the coats of arms incorporated into his new designs. Burges later designed the Council Chamber, added in 1867, and in 1881 began work on Connaught Hall in Dover, a town meeting and concert hall. The new building contained meeting rooms and mayoral and official offices. Although Burges designed the project, most of it was completed after his death by his partners, Pullan and Chapple. The listed status of the Maison Dieu was reclassified as Grade I in 2017 and Dover District Council, the building's owner, is seeking grant funding to enable a restoration, focussing on Burges's work.In 1859–60, Burges took over the restoration of Waltham Abbey from Poynter, working with Poynter's son Edward Poynter and with furniture makers Harland and Fisher. He commissioned Edward Burne-Jones of James Powell & Sons to make three stained-glass windows for the east end, representing the Tree of Jesse. The Abbey is a demonstration of Burges's skills as a restorer, with \\"a profound sensitivity towards medieval architecture.\\" Mordaunt Crook wrote of Burges's interior that, \\"it meets the Middle Ages as an equal.\\" In 1861–2, Burges was commissioned by Charles Edward Lefroy, secretary to the Speaker of the House of Commons, to build All Saints Church, Fleet, as a memorial to Lefroy's wife. She was the daughter of James Walker, who established the marine engineering company of Walker and Burges with Burges's father Alfred, and this family connection brought Burges the commission. Pevsner says of Fleet that \\"it has no shape, nor character nor notable buildings, except one,\\" that one being All Saints.

Problem:Context: Foxhead box M1 (FOXM1) expression has been shown to be linked with human papillomavirus (HPV) 16/18-infected cervical cancer. However, the mechanism underlying the induction of FOXM1 in HPV 16/18-infected cancers remains elusive.', 'The mechanistic actions of FOXM1 induced by the E6/NKX2-1 axis in tumor aggressiveness were elucidated in cellular and animal models. The prognostic value of FOXM1 for overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) in HPV-positive oral and lung cancers was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models.', 'Herein, FOXM1 expression is upregulated by E6-mediated NKX2-1 in HPV-positive cervical, oral, and lung cancer cells. Induction of FOXM1 by E6 through the MZF1/NKX2-1 axis is responsible for HPV-mediated soft agar growth, invasiveness, and stemness through activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In a nude mice model, metastatic lung tumor nodules in HPV 18 E6-positive GNM or HPV 16 E6-positive TL-1-injected nude mice were markedly decreased in both cell types with E6 knockdown, FOXM1 knockdown, or treatment with FOXM1 inhibitor (thiostrepton). Among the four subgroup patients, the worst FOXM1 prognostic value for OS and RFS was observed in HPV 16/18-positive patients with tumors with high-expressing FOXM1.Question: Does up-regulation of FOXM1 by E6 oncoprotein through the MZF1/NKX2-1 axis is require for human papillomavirus-associated tumorigenesis?

He was taught the art of burglary and robbery by his late father, who was once a well-known thief in the underworld. For years, Harry has managed to survive on the streets while taking care of his younger sister, Emily, who suffers from a rare medical condition that requires expensive treatments to keep her alive. The film opens with an intense robbery scene where Harry and his crew of misfits successfully pull off a high-stakes heist. They steal a large sum of money, expensive artifacts, and valuable information from a corrupt organization, led by the venomous crime lord, Victor Cross (played by Gary Oldman). This bold act angers Victor, but also intrigues him. He becomes obsessed with finding out who dared to challenge his empire. At the same time, Detective Sophie Collins (played by Kate Winslet) is assigned to solve the high-profile armed robbery. She is a brilliant investigator known for her determination and unorthodox methods. As she dives into the details of the robbery, she uncovers the connection between the crime and the mysterious and evasive Harry Katish. Both Victor and Detective Collins end up on a collision course in their pursuit of Harry. Meanwhile, Harry's sister’s condition worsens, forcing him into a desperate race against time to secure her treatment. With the stakes higher than ever, Harry accepts one final heist commission – a risky plan involving a prestigious auction house. He hopes this last job will allow him to escape his life of crime and secure the financial means for Emily's treatment. On the night of the high-risk heist, Harry's crew finds themselves in dangerous territory as Victor's gang appears at the scene, determined to settle the score. A tense three-way standoff unfolds between Harry's crew, Victor's gang, and the police led by Detective Collins. As chaos ensues and bullets fly, several members of Harry's crew are captured or killed, leaving Harry cornered and desperate. In a shocking twist, Harry discovers that Victor's true intention was never revenge, but rather to exploit Harry's unique skills for his own gain. Victor reveals that he orchestrated the death of Harry's father years ago, igniting a raging fire within Harry. A high-octane fight ensues, ultimately ending with Harry confronting and killing Victor. In the aftermath of the deadly battle, Harry is apprehended by Detective Collins, who sympathizes with his plight but cannot ignore the severity of his crimes. With incredible reluctance, she brings him to justice and closes the case on the armed robbery. The film concludes with Harry in jail, reflecting on the choices that have led him down this path. Despite his current predicament, he's comforted by the news that his sister's health has improved, thanks in part to the money obtained from the heist. Ordered to stand trial, Harry remains hopeful that his sentence will one day end, allowing him to embrace a brighter future with Emily. \\"The Reckoning of Harry Katish\\" ultimately teaches us that even when faced with insurmountable odds and impossible choices, there's always a chance for redemption and change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
