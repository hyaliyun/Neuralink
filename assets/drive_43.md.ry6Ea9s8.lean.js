Should I validate this answer? A:","completion":"To determine whether the suggested answer is valid, perform the following steps: 1. Analyze the initial question: The initial question asks who owned Kansas before it became a state. This question is asking about ownership and historical context. 2. Examine the suggested answer: The suggested answer discusses the population growth and farming development of Kansas after the Civil War, which is not directly related to the ownership or history of Kansas before it became a state. 3. Perform research: Research the history of Kansas to find accurate information related to the question. According to historical information, Kansas was initially inhabited by Native American tribes, and later became a part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, making it a territory owned by the United States. 4. Compare the research to the suggested answer: The research findings discuss the ownership and historical context of Kansas, while the suggested answer focuses on its development after the Civil War. 5.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative (see options at the end)? mesmerizing Available options: a). negative. b). positive.","completion":"The sentiment of the provided sentence, \\"mesmerizing,\\" can be considered positive. Here is an analysis of the term and the reasoning for this conclusion: Mesmerizing is an adjective derived from the verb \\"mesmerize,\\" which means to hold the attention or fascinate someone in an impressive, alluring manner. When something or someone is described as mesmerizing, it suggests that the object or person has a captivating, compelling, or enchanting quality that makes it difficult for others to look away or ignore. In the context of sentiment analysis, words and phrases can generally be categorized as positive, negative, or neutral based on the emotions and feelings they evoke. Positive words are associated with joy, happiness, praise, and appreciation, while negative words typically denote sadness, anger, criticism, or disappointment. Neutral words, on the other hand, may not convey a strong emotion but might still be necessary to understand the overall context. Given the meaning of mesmerizing, it is apparent that this term is more likely to generate positive emotions. People often use the word to appreciate or compliment a particular aspect of something, such as an amazing performance, a striking view, or an enthralling story. It bears connotations of admiration and wonder, which align more closely with positive emotions. Therefore, based on this analysis, the sentiment of the sentence \\"mesmerizing\\" can be classified as: b). positive."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: Following up from my recent blog post explaining why dietary supplements offer few benefits for most people, new research has found that people who take a mineral supplement actually consume more minerals from their normal diet than non-supplement users. The notion of the ‘worried well’ is certainly alive and kicking. Vitamin and mineral supplements are big business. Reported figures in Australia suggest that 27% of women and 15% of men take some form of supplement with vitamin C, B complex, multivitamins, vitamin E and calcium all being popular choices. Contrary to the rationale for needing supplements in the first place, people who take supplements are more likely to be healthier than people who don’t take supplements. Supplement users also tend to be leaner, smoke less, exercise more, and eat more fruit and vegetables. While it may seem obvious that people who take supplements likely consume more nutrients from their regular diet to start with, this hasn’t been well studied in large population groups. Using data from a nationally representative government health survey, researchers from the United States looked at the mineral intake from food and supplements of over 8000 men and women between 2003 and 2006. The results were clear cut: people taking mineral supplements were consuming more minerals from their normal diet than those who didn’t take supplements. The observation was even stronger in women than in men. The eight most popular mineral supplements taken were calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, copper, potassium and selenium. Proving that it is possible to have too much of a good thing, supplement users were more likely to be exceeding the recommended upper level of intake for magnesium, zinc, iron and calcium. For someone who believes that they are reasonably healthy and are conscious of what they eat most of the time, taking a mineral supplement ‘just in case’ offers little to no benefit. According to the above context, answer the following question. What are the minerals that supplement users are likely to be exceeding the upper limit? A:","completion":"The minerals that supplement users are likely to be exceeding the upper limit include magnesium, zinc, iron, and calcium. These findings indicate that people who take these supplements may be consuming more of these minerals than the recommended levels, which is important to consider when making decisions about supplement use."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"That may be true, but the connection between the gay awakening and the student rebellion of 1968 is an oblique one.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The fact might be true however the connection is an oblique one. \\"?","completion":"If the premise \\"That may be true, but the connection between the gay awakening and the student rebellion of 1968 is an oblique one\\" holds, it indicates that despite some potential truth in the relationship between the two events, the connection is not straightforward or easily discernible. This acknowledgment suggests that while the events might be related to a certain extent, their link may not be as direct or transparent as one might initially assume. There may be alternative driving forces and factors that contribute to both events, making the connection more complex than what it appears. Now, considering the hypothesis \\"The fact might be true, however, the connection is an oblique one,\\" it can be inferred that this hypothesis aligns with the idea that there may be a true connection between the two events, but that connection is vague, unclear, or not easily understood. Given the premise, we can say that the hypothesis follows logically from the premise, as both propose the concept of an oblique connection between the gay awakening and the student rebellion of 1968. However, it's crucial to analyze the intricacies of both events to discern how the oblique connection may manifest. The gay awakening refers to the increased awareness, visibility, and activism surrounding the LGBTQ+ community and its fight for equal rights and social acceptance. The student rebellion of 1968, on the other hand, is a series of social and political uprisings that occurred worldwide, driven by young people who demanded various reforms and changes, such as democratization, civil rights, and anti-war movements. While both events shared some underlying themes of social and political change during the 1960s, their goals, actors, and methods of activism were not always explicitly related to one another. The oblique connection between them can be observed through the broader context of cultural shifts, a broad desire for change, and the fight against oppressive societal structures. These commonalities may serve as bridges that link the two events, albeit in an indirect and obscure manner. Furthermore, it's important to recognize that the hypothesis doesn't outright deny a connection between the gay awakening and the student rebellion of 1968. Instead, it suggests that understanding the correlation between the two requires more profound insight and contextual knowledge to uncover the shared motives, influences, and goals. This complexity in understanding their relationship is consistent with the primary premise. In conclusion, if the premise \\"That may be true, but the connection between the gay awakening and the student rebellion of 1968 is an oblique one\\" is accepted as true, it supports the hypothesis \\"The fact might be true, however, the connection is an oblique one.\\" Both the premise and the hypothesis acknowledge the possibility of an existing relationship between these two historical events, albeit seeing their connection as oblique and not easily understood. This nuanced approach accounts for the complexities and diverse factors that contribute to each event and their correlation, reflecting the intricate nature of historical and cultural analysis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Dick, Kerr Ladies were founded at Preston's Dick, Kerr & Co. munitions factory in 1917 to raise money for wounded soldiers. Three years later, 53,000 fans watched them play at Everton's Goodison Park, which remains one of the largest crowds for the women's game in the UK. The plaque on the factory was unveiled by relatives of the side's founders. Dick, Kerr Ladies entertained about 10,000 spectators in the first game on Christmas Day 1917, which took place at Preston North End's Deepdale ground and raised Â£600 for wounded soldiers. They went on to record a whole series of firsts for the women's game, including having the first female manager and taking part in the first women's international game - a match against a French XI which they won 2-0 in front of 25,000 fans. However, in 1921, the Football Association (FA) banned the women's game, on the grounds that football was \\"unsuitable for females and ought not to be encouraged\\". Despite the ban, the side continued to play across the world and chalked more than 200 games without defeat. They disbanded in 1965, four years before the Women's Football Association was formed, due to a lack of players. Families of some of the side's original stars, along with representatives from the FA and England's first captain Sheila Parker, who started her career with the team, came together for the unveiling of the plaque. Gail Newsham, who wrote a book about the team, said they were \\"the most successful women's team there has ever been and they have been forgotten for too long especially in their home town\\". \\"Whatever has happened in women's football, Dick, Kerr Ladies did it first,\\" she said.","completion":"The Dick, Kerr Ladies football team was founded in 1917 at Preston's Dick, Kerr & Co. munitions factory with the primary aim of raising money for wounded soldiers.

This equation has two terms with the variable x: -51*x and +56*x. Combine these two terms. -51*x + 56*x = (-51 + 56)*x = 5*x Now, the equation becomes 5*x + 5 = 0. Step 2: Isolate the variable x. To do this, first move the constant term (+5) to the opposite side of the equation by subtracting 5 from both sides. 5*x + 5 - 5 = 0 - 5 This simplifies to: 5*x = -5 Step 3: Solve for x. To get the value of x, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of x, which is 5. 5*x / 5 = -5 / 5 This simplifies to: x = -1 Therefore, the solution for the equation -51*x + 56*x + 5 = 0 is x = -1."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We have the equation: -199*q + q = 292*q - 15680 First, let's see how many q's we have together on the left side. We have -199*q and 1*q so that's: (-199 + 1) * q = -198*q So now our equation looks like this: -198*q = 292*q - 15680 Now, we want to move all the q's to one side of the equation. We'll do that by adding 198*q to both sides: -198*q + 198*q = 292*q - 15680 + 198*q 0 = 490*q - 15680 (Since -198*q + 198*q is 0) Now we need to find out how many times 490 fits into 15680. To do that, we'll divide both sides by 490: 0/490 = (490*q - 15680) / 490 0 = q - 32 (Since 15680/490 = 32) Finally, we want to know what q is.

Write a text based on \\"asian markets mixed after china us data\\" Text:","completion":"Title: Asian Markets Exhibit Mixed Results Amid China-US Data Revelations Introduction: The Asian financial markets have recently exhibited mixed sentiments, primarily due to the uneven data revelations from China and the United States. The fluctuating economic performances of these two major global players have deeply influenced the investors' decisions across the Asia-Pacific region. Chinese Economic Data: In China, official data revealed that the country's economy grew by 18.3% in the first quarter of 2021. This unprecedented increase can be attributed to the surge in industrial production, accelerated by a rapid recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic compared to a majority of nations. However, retail sales figures in China reflected a gradual, rather than sharp, rise. This tempered growth indicates that, while the overall economic revival is proceeding steadily, consumer sentiment and domestic demand are yet to reach pre-pandemic levels. US Economic Data: In the United States, data reveals an overall favorable climate for investors. March's non-farm payrolls report demonstrated the addition of 916,000 jobs, while the unemployment rate declined from 6.2% to 6.0%. Furthermore, strong productivity growth and a high demand for goods and services have contributed to boosting business sentiments and increasing profits. However, inflationary concerns linger as the Federal Reserve commits to a more accommodative policy approach, which might impact Asian markets with close connections to the US economy. Mixed Market Performances: The Chinese and US data have contributed to a diverse reaction across the Asian financial markets. For instance, China's Shanghai Composite Index (SCI) experienced varied responses to the economic data, with the SCI finishing marginally higher. The Hong Kong Hang Seng Index, on the other hand, dropped due to concerns surrounding the cooling property market and a potential increase in interest rates. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 edged up, while the broader Topix Index remained relatively flat. South Korea's benchmark Kospi index showcased a small improvement, but it was accompanied by investors' cautiousness due to the country’s household debt levels and potential regulatory actions on property prices. Meanwhile, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index showed a marginal decline, mainly driven by concerns over the strained relations between Beijing and Canberra. Impact on Investment Strategies: The mixed trends in the Asian markets underscore the importance of strategic portfolio diversification and risk management in the current uncertain economic climate. Investors are advised to keep a close eye on economic developments in both China and the United States, as their performance affects a plethora of sectors and regions in the Asian markets. Additionally, investors should remain vigilant about global economic trends, such as the pandemic resurgence in some parts of the world, inflationary concerns, and geopolitical tensions, all of which can pose potentially adverse effects on their investments. Conclusion: In summary, the Asian markets exhibit a distinctly mixed landscape, primarily fueled by contrasting data from China and the United States. Investors confronting this unprecedented scenario should refine their strategies to accommodate the fluctuations in the global economy while focusing on sound risk management and portfolio diversification practices. As the world grapples with the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and other economic challenges, a vigilant and flexible approach to investing will be key to navigating these uncertain times successfully."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: How would you like to teach yourself, rather than have teachers? According to the UK's Department of Education and Skills, students will teach themselves in the schools of the future. This means that there will be no more problems such as finding enough teachers. Estelle Morris, the UK Education Secretary, opened the 2002 Education Technology Conference in London recently. To start the conference, she presented a video showing a computer--generated model of the school of tomorrow. Greater use of computer technology and classroom assistants will help students develop their own way of learning, Morris said. She added that this is a more exciting as well as a more interesting way of learning. At the same time, teachers will be \\"freed from their traditional role as the source of all knowledge\\". Children of all abilities will \\"form the curriculum around their individual needs.\\" They will \\"learn in their own time, at their own speed and in their own environment\\". At home or at school, they will follow their learning programmes by looking at online libraries and watching lessons by world-class teachers and subject experts. Instead of going on field trips, students will use virtual reality. If they don't understand something, they can ask other students--\\"take part in virtual communities with learners with similar needs\\"--or e-mail their teachers. They will hand in their work electronically to be \\"auto-marked\\". The classroom of the future is fast becoming a reality. And the Department of Education will soon produce a guide to help schools adapt buildings for new technology, Morris said. These ideas are based on the UK government's plan to create an education system that provides students with a strong grounding of knowledge and skills at primary school level. And provides the chance for students to develop their individual skills at secondary school level. Question: If the students do not understand something, they can _ .

Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. The statement said that disinviting China from the 2018 RIMPAC is an “initial” response to Beijing’s South China Sea activities. It did not specify what other steps may be taken. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s activity in the South China Sea was for self-defense and that it was a “much smaller scale” than what the United States had done in Hawaii and Guam. “We hope that the U.S. will change such a negative mindset,” he said at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Since 2014, China has taken part in RIMPAC, the world’s largest international maritime drill, which is held every two years in Hawaii. It’s a reflection of expanding U.S.-China military ties, despite tensions over Beijing’s construction of man-made islands in the South China Sea, some of which have been militarized. \\"We have strong evidence that China has deployed anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, and electronic jammers to contested features in the Spratly Islands region of the South China Sea.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What had its power decline after a major military defeat in 1565? The Vijayanagara Empire (also called Karnata Empire, and the Kingdom of Bisnegar by the Portuguese) was based in the Deccan Plateau region in South India. It was established in 1336 by Harihara I and his brother Bukka Raya I of Sangama Dynasty. The empire rose to prominence as a culmination of attempts by the southern powers to ward off Islamic invasions by the end of the 13th century. It lasted until 1646, although its power declined after a major military defeat in the Battle of Talikota in 1565 by the combined armies of the Deccan sultanates. The empire is named after its capital city of Vijayanagara, whose ruins surround present day Hampi, now a World Heritage Site in Karnataka, India. The writings of medieval European travelers such as Domingo Paes, Fernão Nunes, and Niccolò Da Conti, and the literature in local languages provide crucial information about its history. Archaeological excavations at Vijayanagara have revealed the empire's power and wealth. The empire's legacy includes many monuments spread over South India, the best known of which is the group at Hampi. Different temple building traditions in South and Central India came together in the Vijayanagara Architecture style. This synthesis inspired architectural innovation in Hindu temples' construction. Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies such as water management systems for irrigation. The empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, and Sanskrit, while Carnatic music evolved into its current form. The Vijayanagara Empire created an epoch in South Indian history that transcended regionalism by promoting Hinduism as a unifying factor.

Information: - A fixed-wing aircraft is an aircraft, such as an aeroplane, which is capable of flight using wings that generate lift caused by the vehicle's forward airspeed and the shape of the wings. Fixed-wing aircraft are distinct from rotary-wing aircraft, in which the wings form a rotor mounted on a spinning shaft, and ornithopters, in which the wings flap in similar manner to a bird. - General Dynamics Corporation is an American aerospace and defense multinational corporation. Formed by mergers and divestitures, it is the world's fifth-largest defense contractor based on 2012 revenues. General Dynamics is headquartered in West Falls Church, Fairfax County, Virginia. - In military tactics, close air support (CAS) is defined as air action by fixed or rotary-winged aircraft against hostile targets, that are in close proximity to friendly forces, and which requires detailed integration of each air mission with fire and movement of these forces. - In the broadest definition, a sensor is an object whose purpose is to detect events or changes in its environment and sends the information to the computer which then tells the actuator (output devices) to provide the corresponding output. A sensor is a device that converts real world data (Analog) into data that a computer can understand using ADC (Analog to Digital converter) - A fire-control system is a number of components working together, usually a gun data computer, a director, and radar, which is designed to assist a weapon system in hitting its target. It performs the same task as a human gunner firing a weapon, but attempts to do so faster and more accurately. - The Lockheed AC-130 gunship is a heavily armed, long-endurance ground-attack variant of the C-130 Hercules transport fixed-wing aircraft. It carries a wide array of anti-ground oriented weapons that are integrated with sophisticated sensors, navigation, and fire-control systems. Unlike other military fixed-wing aircraft, the AC-130 relies on visual targeting. Because its large profile and low operating altitudes (around 7,000 ft) make it an easy target, it usually flies close air support missions at night. - Navigation is a field of study that focuses on the process of monitoring and controlling the movement of a craft or vehicle from one place to another.

The loading, firing, and unloading functions are performed simultaneously in different barrels as they rotate, and the rotation also permits the barrels some time to cool. The rotating barrel cluster on most Gatling-type guns is powered by an external force such as an electric motor, although gas-operated versions have also been developed. - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - A cannon (plural: \\"cannon\\" or \\"cannons\\") is any piece of artillery that uses gunpowder or other usually explosive-based propellants to launch a projectile, which may or may not be explosive. Cannon vary in calibre, range, mobility, rate of fire, angle of fire, and firepower; different forms of cannon combine and balance these attributes in varying degrees, depending on their intended use on the battlefield. The word \\"cannon\\" is derived from several languages, in which the original definition can usually be translated as \\"tube\\", \\"cane\\", or \\"reed\\". In the modern era, the term \\"cannon\\" has fallen into decline, replaced by \\"guns\\" or \\"artillery\\" if not a more specific term such as \\"gun\\", \\"mortar\\" or \\"howitzer\\", except for in the field of aerial warfare, where it is often used as shorthand for autocannon.

Solve this problem.","completion":"To solve the equation 14*o + 98 - 224 = 0 for o, you can follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation. The equation given is 14*o + 98 - 224 = 0. First, we need to simplify it by combining the constant terms (98 and -224). 98 - 224 = -126 Now, the simplified equation is: 14*o - 126 = 0 Step 2: Solve for o. Now, we need to solve the equation for o. To do this, we will isolate the variable o on one side of the equation by adding 126 to both sides. This will cancel out the constant term on the left side of the equation: 14*o - 126 + 126 = 0 + 126 14*o = 126 Next, we need to get o by itself. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 14: 14*o / 14 = 126 / 14 o = 9 So, the solution for o in the equation 14*o + 98 - 224 = 0 is o = 9."},{"prompt":"Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: As an English teacher, one of the most common problems I've found with my students is their lack of confidence with speaking, and difficulty in understanding native speakers. Another problem could be that a foreign language taught in schools can sound quite different to what native speakers actually use. There are a few English words and expressions that I'd never heard until I came to China. The most common one in my experience is \\"How are you? I'm fine, thank you, and you?\\" I appreciate that although this greeting is much too formal for everyday use - it's easy to learn and helps build confidence. However, it can be a hard habit to break. I've seen many parents correct their kids if they don't use that exact phrase, as if simply replying \\"I'm fine\\" would somehow be rude. In fact I'm banning my students from saying that in the classroom, insisting a simple \\"I'm fine, thanks\\" is good enough. \\"Seldom\\" is another one that I find interesting. The first time a student told me \\"I seldom watch TV\\", my initial reaction was a stupefied look, followed by \\"Huh?\\" I then realized the student used \\"seldom\\" when it's more common for us to use \\"rarely.\\" I was just as confused when I first heard a toilet referred to as a WC (water closet), another English term I'd never heard of back in Australia. Of course, my students know the other names for it like bathroom, toilet, washroom etc. so to prefer that name is an interesting choice. I don't mind that my students have substituted familiar English words with their own, far from it. It reminds me how creative they can be with not only their language, but with mine as well. It's healthy for English to evolve and change and I'm happy to add these new words to my vocabulary. One important lesson I've learnt is that textbooks can only help you so much.

What is a very short summary of the above text?","completion":"The day after the Israeli government endorsed a UN resolution for troop withdrawal from Lebanon, Israeli warplanes attacked suspected guerrilla positions in southern Lebanon. Now, let's dive into a more detailed analysis. The context provided revolves around notable geopolitical events between Israel and Lebanon. Israeli warplanes carried out attacks on supposed guerrilla positions in Southern Lebanon, which happened a day after the Israeli government had given its support to a United Nations resolution. This resolution was specifically calling for Israel to withdraw its troops from Lebanon. To fully understand this situation, it's beneficial to comprehend the political and military conflict between Israel and Lebanon. This struggle, characterized by periods of border disputes, offensives, and ceasefires, has persisted for several decades. Israel has, historically, aimed at neutralizing what it views as threats to its national security, primarily deriving from Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militia in Lebanon. The United Nations (UN) plays a significant role in international disputes and has numerous resolutions to maintain peace between countries. In this case, the UN resolution endorsed by the Israeli government was about pulling its troops out of Lebanon. Now, the fact that Israeli warplanes attacked alleged guerrilla positions in southern Lebanon after endorsing the UN resolution adds a layer of complexity to the situation. Such actions might have happened due to a sudden perceived threat, a preemptive strike, or as part of a broader military strategy. However, based on this brief description alone, it's challenging to deduce the precise reasons behind this subsequent action. Such situations can lead to international criticism or debate, given that they might be seen as a conflict between national security interests and adherence to peace-promoting international laws. The timing (a day after Israel's government endorsed the UN resolution) might raise questions regarding Israel's commitment to the resolution and the motives behind the airstrikes. In conclusion, this event is part of the broader political and military tension that exists between Israel and Lebanon. It underscores the ongoing struggle for balance between national security concerns, regional power dynamics, and adherence to international law."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, a Chanel nail polish was definitely attainable. Whilst they are ridiculously expensive compared with most other nail polishes (AU39), they are still much more affordable than the AU1,000,000,000 a handbag costs (or so I estimate as I have never actually priced one). After seeing swatches of Peridot online, I knew that baby would one day be mine. The other two polishes in the collection - Quartz and Graphite - did not excite me the way Peridot did. That was until I read this review of Graphite on the Polish Police. Suddenly, Graphite was on my radar. It was stuck in my head like an ear worm; another baby, soon to be adopted. I argued with myself for about a month on whether to get these polishes or not. Could I really spend nearly 80 on nail polish. It did seem rather excessive to me. Then, Myers sent me a 10 voucher for my birthday and I got a 30 voucher for doing a survey so the decision was made. For 38 of my own money (less than the cost of two OPI's!) I became the proud owner of Peridot and Graphite. Here is my review of Graphite. Graphite is the most stunningly intriguing nail polish I have ever owned. In the bottle it looks a little bit dull and boring - grey and bland. But on the nail it is completely different. In some lights it is silvery, others a more gun metal grey, and in others it has almost a goldish tone to it. It is super sparkly, yet is not a glitter polish - though in saying that it appears more glitter than shimmer. It is quite opaque. Two coats and you can't see the nail line.

This dessert, also known as Ginataang Halo-Halo in some regions, is a delicious and popular treat in the Philippines that is often enjoyed during the Holy Week and other special occasions. The data underlines two main ingredients that are essential to the preparation of Binignit: Sweet potato and Taro. Sweet potato, scientifically known as Ipomoea batatas, is a root vegetable rich in carbohydrates, dietary fibers, and a host of vitamins and minerals like Vitamin A, Vitamin C, manganese, and potassium. Sweet potatoes are starchy, sweet in taste, and have a vibrant orange color that adds to the visual appeal of the dessert. Moreover, these tubers are recognized for their numerous health benefits, including their ability to regulate blood sugar levels and improve immunity. In Binignit, the sweet potato serves as a primary source of flavor, color, and texture. Taro, on the other hand, is a tropical plant known scientifically as Colocasia esculenta. It is another essential ingredient in Binignit and is highly valued for its large, starchy corms with multidimensional applications in both sweet and savory dishes. Taro is rich in carbohydrates, fiber, and several vitamins and minerals like Vitamin E, magnesium, and phosphorus. It has a mildly sweet taste and a creamy, slightly nutty flavor when cooked. In Binignit, the taro complements the sweet potato and creates a delightful combination of flavors and textures. In the traditional preparation of Binignit, both sweet potatoes and taro are peeled, cut into bite-sized cubes, and cooked in a mixture of water and coconut milk, which is another vital component. The coconut milk imparts a rich, creamy consistency to the dish and acts as a binder for other ingredients like sago (tapioca pearls), banana, and assorted tropical fruits like jackfruit or langka. Furthermore, the dessert may be sweetened using sugar, palm sugar, or condensed milk, depending on regional preferences. In summary, the data provided highlights the key ingredients – sweet potato and taro – used in the preparation of the Filipino dessert Binignit. Both sweet potato and taro play crucial roles in the dish, lending their flavors, textures, and nutritional benefits to create a well-balanced and delightful treat. The addition of coconut milk, other fruits, and sweeteners enhances the overall taste and makes Binignit a much-loved Filipino dessert."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While the NSA's involvement with the drone program had been previously reported, the Intercept's coverage highlights the flaws of utilizing technology-driven methods as opposed to traditional human intelligence. According to the drone pilot, who was a Joint Special Operations Command member, terrorists have caught on to the NSA's geolocation abilities and changed their tactics to undermine the system. Militants now carry extra SIM cards or, in more dangerous circumstances, pass cell phones to civilians, leading to errors in targeting and the consequent loss of innocent lives. The drone pilot confesses to having participated in strikes where the target's phone was identified, but another individual was killed, and explains how the operation's focus shifted from targeting specific terrorists to their cellphones. \\"People get hung up that there's a targeted list of people,\\" he says. \\"It's really like we're targeting a cellphone.\\" Despite his concerns, the former pilot remains \\"adamant\\" that the controversial tactic has resulted in the elimination of actual terrorists.

Here is a news article: The Obama administration indicated Monday that it would end its legal battle to block the “morning-after” pill from being available over the counter without age restrictions. Just weeks after vowing to fight District Judge Edward Korman’s April ruling to eliminate previous age restrictions, the Justice Department told a court of plans to drop its appeal if the court approves its plan for compliance. Text Size - + reset When finalized, the move would end a long-running dispute over emergency contraception dating back to the early years of George W. Bush’s presidency — a legal fight that forced the Obama administration to take a position on the availability of the controversial product in late 2011, just as the 2012 election fight was heating up — and make “Plan B” pills readily available on the shelves of drug stores nationwide. (Also on POLITICO: Courts to hear birth control mandate suits) It would also reverse the Obama administration’s longstanding insistence that access be limited to those age 17 or older — a controversial decision initially made by Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, and supported by the president. The position, which bucked the FDA’s recommendation that the pills be available to people of all ages, drew public outcry from Democrats, abortion rights advocates and medical groups such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The administration’s new plan for compliance includes asking both Plan B manufacturer Teva Pharmaceuticals and the maker of a generic version of the pills to submit new drug-label applications to allow the products to be sold without age restrictions. (Last month: DOJ appeals for stay of Plan B order) Once those applications are received, the Justice Department said, it’s expected that the Food and Drug Administration will approve them “without delay.” The administration had previously signaled that it would challenge Korman’s April ruling ordering the elimination of all age restrictions for purchase of the morning-after pill within 30 days. The FDA responded by easing its restrictions to age 15 and up — but that did not satisfy Korman, of the Eastern District of New York, who said last week that he would order the immediate unrestricted sale of a two-pill version of emergency contraception. In rejecting the administration’s requests, Korman said the government’s push to maintain age restrictions was ‘‘politically motivated, scientifically unjustified and contrary to agency precedent.’’ ||||| Advocates for women's rights say the federal government's decision to comply with a New York judge's ruling giving all girls easy access to emergency contraception could be \\"a move forward for reproductive justice.\\" Annie Tummino is coordinator of the National Women's Liberation and the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit seeking unrestricted access to the morning-after pill. She says the government \\"needs to stop playing politics with women's reproductive health.\\" The Department of Justice said Monday it will submit a plan for compliance with the judge's April ruling. If he approves it, the department will drop its appeal. Social conservatives and other opponents argue the drug's availability takes away the rights of parents of girls who could get it without their permission. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below. The federal government on Monday told a judge it will reverse course and take steps to comply with his order to allow girls of any age to buy emergency contraception without prescriptions. The Department of Justice, in the latest development in a complex back-and-forth over access to the morning-after pill, notified U.S. District Judge Edward Korman it will submit a plan for compliance. If he approves it, the department will drop its appeal of his April ruling. \\"Once the court confirms that the government's understanding is correct, the government intends to file with the Circuit Court notice that it is voluntarily withdrawing its appeal in this matter,\\" the department said in a letter to the judge. Last week, the appeals court dealt the government a setback by saying it would immediately permit unrestricted sales of the two-pill version of the emergency contraception until the appeal was decided. That order was met with praise from advocates for girls' and women's rights and with scorn from social conservatives and other opponents, who argue the drug's availability takes away the rights of parents of girls who could get it without their permission. The government had appealed the judge's underlying April 5 ruling, which ordered emergency contraceptives based on the hormone levonorgestrel be made available without a prescription, over the counter and without point-of-sale or age restrictions. It asked the judge to suspend the effect of that ruling until the appeals court could decide the case. But the judge declined, saying the government's decision to restrict sales of the morning-after pill was \\"politically motivated, scientifically unjustified and contrary to agency precedent.\\" He also said there was no basis to deny the request to make the drugs widely available. The government had argued that \\"substantial market confusion\\" could result if the judge's ruling were enforced while appeals were pending, only to be later overturned. The morning-after pill contains a higher dose of the female hormone progestin than is in regular birth control pills. Taking it within 72 hours of rape, condom failure or just forgetting regular contraception can cut the chances of pregnancy by up to 89 percent, but it works best within the first 24 hours. If a girl or woman already is pregnant, the pill, which prevents ovulation or fertilization of an egg, has no effect. The Food and Drug Administration was preparing in 2011 to allow over-the-counter sales of the morning-after pill with no limits when Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius overruled her own scientists in an unprecedented move. The FDA announced in early May that Plan B One-Step, the newer version of emergency contraception, the same drug but combined into one pill instead of two, could be sold without a prescription to those age 15 or older. Its maker, Teva Women's Health, plans to begin those sales soon. Sales had previously been limited to those who were at least 17. The judge later ridiculed the FDA changes, saying they established \\"nonsensical rules\\" that favored sales of the Plan B One-Step morning-after pill and were made \\"to sugarcoat\\" the government's appeal. He also said they placed a disproportionate burden on blacks and the poor by requiring a prescription for less expensive generic versions of the drug bought by those under age 17 and by requiring those age 17 or over to show proof-of-age identification at pharmacies. He cited studies showing that blacks with low incomes are less likely than other people to have government-issued IDs. ||||| Mr. Obama had expressed personal concern about making the drug more broadly available last year and offered support to Kathleen Sebelius, his secretary of health and human services, when she blocked a decision by the F.D.A. that would have cleared the way for nonprescription distribution to all girls and women regardless of age. He said that as the father of two young girls, the idea of making the drug available to them without a prescription made him uncomfortable. But a federal judge angrily accused the administration of blocking the drug because of politics, not science, and ordered Ms. Sebelius to reverse her decision. Last week the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York City partially refused the Justice Department’s request for a delay in the judge’s order while the government appealed. In its letter to the court, the Justice Department outlined the procedural steps that the F.D.A. plans to take. It said the maker of Plan B One-Step, Teva Pharmaceuticals, has been asked to “promptly” file an application asking for no age or sales restrictions, and that the “F.D.A. will approve it without delay.” Once that is done, the F.D.A. expects makers of generic versions of Plan B One-Step — the most popular of those is Next Choice One Dose — to ask for a similar arrangement. The F.D.A. will evaluate those requests, based on whether it decides to give Plan B One-Step any type of market exclusivity, but most likely generic pills will also eventually be available without restrictions. The Justice Department said it would not remove restrictions from two-pill emergency contraceptives because it is concerned that young girls might not be able to adequately understand how to take two separate doses. But two-pill versions are a diminishing fraction of the market. The fight to make emergency contraceptives universally available without a prescription is more than a decade old. Plan B, the trade name for the morning-after pill, was approved in 1999 as a prescription-only product. In 2001 the Center for Reproductive Rights filed a citizens petition for it to be made available over the counter or without a prescription. By December 2011, after years of pressure from women’s reproductive rights groups and the companies selling the drug, the F.D.A. was poised to lift all age restrictions. By then the F.D.A. also said it had determined that the drug was safe. But in an unprecedented move Ms. Sebelius overruled the agency. She said at the time that she had based her decision on science because she said the manufacturer had failed to study whether the drug was safe for girls as young as 11, about 10 percent of whom are physically able to bear children. ||||| Policy-ish Feds Cave On Emergency Contraception Age Restrictions Enlarge image i AP AP The Obama administration has gone to Plan C on Plan B. Backed into a legal corner, the Justice Department said Monday it would drop its appeal of Judge Edward Korman's ruling last April that it make the morning-after birth control pill available over the counter with no age restrictions. As Heard On Morning Edition Linda Wertheimer talks with Julie Rovner about the adminstration's capitulation on Plan B. Feds Buckle On Emergency Contraception Age Restrictions 3 min 23 sec The action came five days after an appeals court refused to delay part of the judge's order while the appeal was being heard, effectively ordering some products, but not others, to be made available immediately. With few other avenues of appeal, the Justice Department said it would instead obey the original order, sort of. What the administration is now proposing is to have the makers of the most popular emergency contraceptive product – Plan B One Step – submit a new label allowing it to be sold over the counter without age restrictions. According to the letter the Justice Department sent to Judge Korman, when that application is received, \\"FDA will approve it without delay.\\" The letter warns, however, that the makers of Plan B One Step could be granted \\"marketing exclusivity,\\" which presumably means a waiting period before generic copies could join the product on pharmacy and retail shelves. And in a reversal of the situation that would have been created last week by the appeals court, the FDA says it \\"will not at this time take steps to change the approval status of the two-pill Plan B or its generic equivalents.\\" According to the government, \\"there are fewer data available regarding the actual use of Plan B\\" meaning the use of the two-pill product \\"as a nonprescription product by younger adolescents,\\" compared to the one-pill product. That means the two-pill products will remain prescription-only and behind the pharmacy counter for those younger than 17. Still, advocates of easier access to the drugs were pleased by the administration's action. \\"This decision by the Administration affirms what feminists have been fighting for all along – the Morning-After Pill should be available to females of all ages, on the shelf at any convenience store, just like aspirin or condoms,\\" said Annie Tummino, the lead plaintiff in the long-running lawsuit. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who had been pressuring the FDA to approve the pill for non-prescription sale for most of the last decade, said: \\"After far too long of a delay, science has prevailed.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The Obama administration announced that it would end its legal battle to block the \\"morning-after\\" pill from being available over the counter without age restrictions. This move would make \\"Plan B\\" pills readily available on the shelves of drug stores nationwide. The administration's new plan for compliance involves asking Plan B manufacturer Teva Pharmaceuticals and the maker of a generic version of the pills to submit new drug-label applications to allow the products to be sold without age restrictions. Once those applications are received, the Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve them without delay. This decision has been praised by advocates for girls' and women's reproductive rights, while being met with criticism from social conservatives and other opponents who argue that the pill's availability infringes upon the rights of parents."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information: - In linguistics, a morpheme is the smallest grammatical unit in a language. In other words, it is the smallest meaningful unit of a language. The field of study dedicated to morphemes is called morphology. A morpheme is not identical to a word, and the principal difference between the two is that a morpheme may or may not stand alone, whereas a word, by definition, is freestanding. When it stands by itself, it is considered as a root because it has a meaning of its own (e.g. the morpheme \\"cat\\") and when it depends on another morpheme to express an idea, it is an affix because it has a grammatical function (e.g. the \\"s\\" in \\"cats\\" to indicate that it is plural). Every word comprises one or more morphemes. - A syllable is a unit of organization for a sequence of speech sounds. For example, the word \\"water\\" is composed of two syllables: \\"wa\\" and \\"ter\\". A syllable is typically made up of a syllable nucleus (most often a vowel) with optional initial and final margins (typically, consonants). - The Berber Latin alphabet is the version of the Latin alphabet used to write the Berber languages. It was adopted in the 19th century, using varieties of letters. Today, the Latin alphabet is preferred by most Berber writers and linguists in North Africa and abroad for practical reasons. - In articulatory phonetics, a consonant is a speech sound that is articulated with complete or partial closure of the vocal tract. Examples are , pronounced with the lips pronounced with the front of the tongue pronounced with the back of the tongue pronounced in the throat; and , pronounced by forcing air through a narrow channel (fricatives); and and , which have air flowing through the nose (nasals). Contrasting with consonants are vowels. - An alphabet is a standard set of letters (basic written symbols or graphemes) that is used to write one or more languages based upon the general principle that the letters represent phonemes (basic significant sounds) of the spoken language. This is in contrast to other types of writing systems, such as syllabaries (in which each character represents a syllable) and logographies (in which each character represents a word, morpheme, or semantic unit). - In phonetics, a vowel is a sound in spoken language, with two competing definitions. In the more common phonetic definition, a vowel is a sound pronounced with an open vocal tract, so that the tongue does not touch the lips, teeth, or roof of the mouth, such as the English \\"ah\\" or \\"oh\\" . There is no build-up of air pressure at any point above the glottis. This contrasts with consonants, such as the English \\"sh\\" , which have a constriction or closure at some point along the vocal tract. In the other, phonological definition, a vowel is defined as syllabic, the sound that forms the peak of a syllable. A phonetically equivalent but non-syllabic sound is a semivowel. - North Africa or Northern Africa is the northernmost region of Africa. The United Nations definition of \\"North Africa\\" includes seven countries and territories; Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, and Western Sahara. The countries of Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya are often collectively referred to as the Maghreb, which is the Arabic word for \\"sunset\\". Egypt lies to the northeast and encompasses part of West Asia, while Sudan is situated on the edge of the Sahel, to the south of Egypt. - In linguistics, a grapheme is the smallest unit of a writing system of any given language. An individual grapheme may or may not carry meaning by itself, and may or may not correspond to a single phoneme of the spoken language. Graphemes include alphabetic letters, typographic ligatures, Chinese characters, numerical digits, punctuation marks, and other individual symbols. - A spoken language is a language produced by articulate sounds, as opposed to a written language. Many languages have no written form and so are only spoken. An oral language or vocal language is a language produced with the vocal tract, as opposed to a sign language, which is produced with the hands and face. The term \\"spoken language\\" is sometimes used to mean only vocal languages, especially by linguists, making all three terms synonyms by excluding sign languages. Others refer to sign language as \\"spoken\\", especially in contrast to written transcriptions of signs. - A phoneme is one of the units of sound (or gesture in the case of sign languages, see chereme) that distinguish one word from another in a particular language. The difference in meaning between the English words \\"kill\\" and \\"kiss\\" is a result of the exchange of the phoneme for the phoneme . Two words that differ in meaning through a contrast of a single phoneme form a minimal pair. - A noun (from Latin \\"nmen\\", literally meaning \\"name\\") is a word that functions as the name of some specific thing or set of things, such as living creatures, objects, places, actions, qualities, states of existence, or ideas. Linguistically, a noun is a member of a large, open part of speech whose members can occur as the main word in the subject of a clause, the object of a verb, or the object of a preposition. - Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky. - A syllabary is a set of written symbols that represent the syllables or (more frequently) moras which make up words. A symbol in a syllabary, called a syllabogram, typically represents an (optional) consonant sound (simple onset) followed by a vowel sound (nucleus)that is, a CV or V syllablebut other phonographic mappings such as CVC, CV- tone, and C (normally nasals at the end of syllables) are also found in syllabaries. - The Berber language or Amazigh languages (Berber name: , Tamazit, Tamazight, pronounced ) are a family of similar and closely related languages and dialects indigenous to North Africa. - An abjad (pronounced or ) is a type of writing system where each symbol stands for a consonant, leaving the reader to supply the appropriate vowel. The name \\"abjad\\" is based on the old Arabic alphabet's first four letters - a, b, j, d, to replace the common terms \\"consonantary\\", \\"consonantal alphabet\\" or \\"syllabary\\" to refer to the family of scripts called West Semitic. - The classical Latin alphabet, also known as the Roman alphabet, is a writing system originally used by the ancient Romans to write the Latin language. The Latin alphabet evolved from the visually similar Cumaean Greek version of the Greek alphabet, which was itself descended from the Phoenician abjad, which in turn was derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics. The Etruscans who ruled early Rome adopted the Cumaean Greek alphabet which was modified over time to become the Etruscan alphabet, which was in turn adopted and further modified by the Romans to produce the Latin alphabet. - Arabic (' or ' ) is a Central Semitic language that was first spoken in Iron Age northwestern Arabia and is now the \\"lingua franca\\" of the Arab world. Arabic also is a liturgical language of 1.7 billion Muslims. It is one of six official languages of the United Nations. It is named after the Arabs, a term initially used to describe peoples living from Mesopotamia in the east to the Anti-Lebanon mountains in the west, and from northwestern Arabia to the Sinai in the south. - Tifinagh ( Berber pronunciation : ( tifina ) ; also written Tifina in the Berber Latin alphabet , in Neo-Tifinagh , and in the Berber Arabic alphabet ) is a series of abjad and alphabetic scripts used to write Berber languages . A modern derivate of the traditional script , known as Neo-Tifinagh , was introduced in the 20th century . A slightly modified version of the traditional script , called Tifinagh Ircam , is used in a number of Moroccan elementary schools in teaching the Berber language to children as well as a number of publications . The word tifinagh is thought to be a Berberized feminine plural cognate of Punic , through the Berber feminine prefix ti - and Latin Punicus ; thus tifinagh could possibly mean \`\` the Phoenician ( letters ) '' or \`\` the Punic letters '' . - A writing system is any conventional method of visually representing verbal communication. While both writing and speech are useful in conveying messages, writing differs in also being a reliable form of information storage and transfer. The processes of encoding and decoding writing systems involve shared understanding between writers and readers of the meaning behind the sets of characters that make up a script. Writing is usually recorded onto a durable medium, such as paper or electronic storage, although non-durable methods may also be used, such as writing on a computer display, in sand, or by skywriting.

Jason is described as an average guy who goes to work each day, exercises sometimes, and generally enjoys life. These regular activities suggest that he has some structure and routine in his life. Typically, people who have daily responsibilities like work and socializing follow a schedule to manage their time effectively. This would likely include eating meals at consistent times each day. On the other hand, Brad lives in a cave with no windows and almost no light, which would make it challenging for him to keep track of time or maintain a regular routine. Even though he could potentially use candles or other methods to measure time, it might still be difficult for him to maintain a consistent meal schedule, given his unconventional living situation. Additionally, as he relies on someone else to bring him food and supplies, his meals might be subject to the availability and timing of that person. In conclusion, considering the lifestyle and routines of both individuals, Jason is more likely to eat meals at the same time each day compared to Brad."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Joe Maddon Leaves Job as Manager of Tampa Bay Rays SAN FRANCISCO — Joe Maddon was driving west in his R.V. early Friday evening, almost ready to camp down near Pensacola, Fla., for a cookout while watching the World Series. Maddon is bound for his home in California, he said, with a planned stop to see family in Arizona along the way. “We’re not skipping town,” he said, kiddingly, over the phone. But Maddon has left his job as manager of the Tampa Bay Rays, the team he guided from underfunded doormat to overachieving contender. He opted out of his contract Friday, exercising a clause that triggered Oct. 14 with the departure of General Manager Andrew Friedman to the Los Angeles Dodgers. The opt-out clause, Maddon said, was something of a fine-print treasure revealed to him in a call from Matt Silverman, the Rays’ president of baseball operations, just after Friedman left. “I had totally forgotten about it,” Maddon said. “Andrew leaves, and I get a phone call that I have an opt-out clause. Otherwise I would not have known, I swear to you.” Maddon joined the Rays before the 2006 season, when the team went 61-101. Two years later the Rays were in the World Series, sparking a run of six winning seasons, five with at least 90 victories. Maddon was the ideal fit, open to ideas from the analytics-minded front office and popular with players for cultivating a loose clubhouse atmosphere while thriving on competing with the payroll behemoths in the American League East. He instantly becomes a highly coveted commodity. Maddon said his agent, Alan Nero, would look for opportunities on his behalf. There should be plenty, likely for more than the Rays could have paid him, despite what the team termed a diligent and aggressive effort to extend his contract. “I’m surprised by it and disappointed,” Silverman said, adding later, “I can only tell you what I know and what Joe and I spoke about, which was his desire to be a long-term Ray. I shared that desire and worked hard to make it a reality, and it didn’t happen.” Maddon, to his credit, acknowledged that money was a factor in his decision to leave. He pointed out that he turns 61 in February and had family and grandchildren and charities to consider. A chance at free agency, essentially, was too enticing to resist for a baseball lifer who took his first minor league managing job in 1981. “I’ve never had that moment, and I’ve been doing it for a while,” Maddon said. “I’ve had moments where I’ve asked for a couple of extra thousand bucks and been told no, and what did I do? I signed. But this is different. It’s interesting and exhilarating and scary, all at the same time.” Maddon praised the Rays’ ownership and front office and said it had been wonderful to work for them, noting that he had always been happy to go along with the company line. Silverman called the Rays’ contract offer “very generous,” but Maddon had a different perspective. “Fair is always in the eye of the beholder,” he said. “A subject with the Rays has always been limitations, and I’ve always settled for those limitations. I told my wife I really didn’t think I could settle the next time. “I have a very unique opportunity to exercise my right to opt out, and I think if you take anybody with the same choices, the same everything, I think about a hundred percent would do exactly the same thing.” The losses of Maddon, Friedman and the ace left-hander David Price, who was traded to Detroit on July 31, pose a challenge to a team that slumped to 77 victories this season while continuing to draw sparse crowds. The Rays have pledged to cut a payroll that was already less than 80 million this season and ranked 28th among the 30 teams. The Dodgers have the highest payroll, and Maddon, of course, worked closely with Friedman. But Friedman took the unusual step Friday of issuing a statement in support of Manager Don Mattingly, who is signed through 2016. “I wish him nothing but the best wherever his next stop will be,” Friedman said of Maddon. “However, nothing has changed on our end, and Don Mattingly will be our manager next season and hopefully for a long time to come.” After such a strong statement, it would undercut Friedman’s credibility if he reversed course and hired Maddon this off-season. The Minnesota Twins are the only team besides the Rays without a manager, but a more likely spot for Maddon could be the Chicago Cubs. Maddon interviewed with Theo Epstein, the Cubs’ president of baseball operations, when Epstein was Boston’s general manager in 2003. The Red Sox hired Terry Francona instead, but Maddon was said to have made a strong impression, and his years in Tampa Bay have only added to his appeal. The Cubs finished 73-89 last season, their first under Rick Renteria, who had never managed before in the majors and is signed through 2016. With several top prospects on the verge of making a major impact, room for the payroll to grow and a ballpark under renovation, the Cubs appear poised for a breakthrough. Maddon seems to shares Epstein’s sensibilities as an engaging personality with an appreciation for both scouts and statistics. If they hired Maddon, the Cubs, with their losing history, would be happy if he could forge the same kind of legacy in Chicago that he described for himself from his time in Tampa Bay. “That I did my job and was successful,” Maddon said, “and that we created a culture that didn’t exist before.” A version of this article appears in print on October 25, 2014, on page D3 of the New York edition with the headline: This Time, a Manager Opts Out to Test Free Agency.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that Jerome Bosch drew inspiration from? The charting and conquest of this new world made real regions previously only idealised in the imagination of artists and poets. At the same time, the certainty of the old biblical paradise began to slip from the grasp of thinkers into the realms of mythology. In response, treatment of the Paradise in literature, poetry and art shifted towards a self-consciously fictional Utopian representation, as exemplified by the writings of Thomas More (1478–1535).Albrecht Dürer was an avid student of exotic animals, and drew many sketches based on his visits to European zoos. Dürer visited 's-Hertogenbosch during Bosch's lifetime, and it is likely the two artists met, and that Bosch drew inspiration from the German's work.Attempts to find sources for the work in literature from the period have not been successful. Art historian Erwin Panofsky wrote in 1953 that, \\"In spite of all the ingenious, erudite and in part extremely useful research devoted to the task of \\"decoding Jerome Bosch\\", I cannot help feeling that the real secret of his magnificent nightmares and daydreams has still to be disclosed. We have bored a few holes through the door of the locked room; but somehow we do not seem to have discovered the key.\\" The humanist Desiderius Erasmus has been suggested as a possible influence; the writer lived in 's-Hertogenbosch in the 1480s, and it is likely he knew Bosch. Glum remarked on the triptych's similarity of tone with Erasmus's view that theologians \\"explain (to suit themselves) the most difficult mysteries ... is it a possible proposition: God the Father hates the Son? Could God have assumed the form of a woman, a devil, an ass, a gourd, a stone?\\" Answer:","completion":"The full name of the person that Jerome Bosch drew inspiration from is Albrecht Dürer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I read this background article the other day: If a solution has a higher concentration of hydronium ions than pure water, it has a pH lower than 7. A solution with a pH lower than 7 is called an acid . As the hydronium ion concentration increases, the pH value decreases. Therefore, the more acidic a solution is, the lower its pH value is. Did you ever taste vinegar? Like other acids, it tastes sour. Stronger acids can be harmful to organisms. For example, stomach acid would eat through the stomach if it were not lined with a layer of mucus. Strong acids can also damage materials, even hard materials such as glass. I am facing a new situation today: Alexiev and Sabrina were enthusiastic chemistry students completing the first experiment of their new course. They both started the experiment with pure water, and had to perform different experimental protocols to make changes to the water. At the end of the experiment, both of them measured the concentration of hydronium ions present in their reaction mixtures. Alexiev had a high concentration of hydronium ions present, while Sabrina had a low concentration present in her mixture. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which person's mixture, Alexiev's or Sabrina's, has a higher pH value at the end? A:","completion":"To answer the question, we need to consider the relationship between hydronium ion concentration and pH value. Step 1: Recall the information from the background article. - A higher concentration of hydronium ions corresponds to a pH lower than 7. - As the hydronium ion concentration increases, the pH value decreases. - The more acidic a solution is, the lower its pH value is. Step 2: Analyze the situation with Alexiev and Sabrina. - Alexiev has a high concentration of hydronium ions in his mixture. - Sabrina has a low concentration of hydronium ions in her mixture. Step 3: Apply the relationship between hydronium ion concentration and pH value to the given situation. - Since Alexiev has a higher concentration of hydronium ions, his mixture would have a lower pH value (more acidic). - Since Sabrina has a lower concentration of hydronium ions, her mixture would have a higher pH value (less acidic).

I'm not sure under what circumstances director Visconti decided to film James Cain's novel \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" (I'm not even sure if Viscounti acquired the book's rights), but the resulting movie is definitely interesting. It is not the best version of Cain's story (I like the 1981 version best), but thanks to Visconti's excellent direction and the casting of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very sensual couple), it is a must for noir fans. Visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to great effect. The film is not perfect, though. My main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good; the story moves at a very slow pace (I don't think Visconti was very good at editing his films).

Answer the following question: Given the fact that: For a given medium, sound has a slower speed at lower temperatures. Answer the question: When animals are moving in the cold they are faster or slower? Answer:","completion":"The speed of sound in a given medium and the speed at which animals move are not directly related. The fact that sound has a slower speed at lower temperatures in a given medium does not affect the speed of animals directly. However, when animals are moving in the cold, their speed may be affected by several factors: 1. Metabolism: Many animals have a slower metabolism in lower temperatures, which may result in slower overall movement. As their body works to conserve heat and energy, their physical performance might be compromised. 2. Muscular function: Cold temperatures can cause muscles to tighten up and become less efficient, which may decrease an animal's speed and mobility. 3. Adaptation to cold environments: Animals that have evolved in cold environments, like Arctic foxes or snow leopards, have specialized adaptations that allow them to move and survive in these conditions. They may not be specifically faster or slower solely due to the cold, but they have evolved in ways that help them thrive in their environment. 4. Terrain and conditions: Snow and ice can make it difficult for animals to move at their usual speed, affecting their overall mobility. Some animals may struggle to move across slippery or icy surfaces, whereas others, like wolves, may be well-adapted for travel in these conditions. In summary, whether animals are faster or slower when moving in the cold depends on a combination of factors, including species, adaptation to cold environments, metabolism, and muscular function. The speed of sound in a given medium at lower temperatures does not have a direct effect on an animal's speed."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Roberto Mangabeira Unger (; born 24 March 1947) is a philosopher and politician. He has developed his views and positions across many fields, including social, political, and economic theory. In legal theory, he is best known by his work in the 1970s and 80s while at Harvard Law School as part of the Critical Legal Studies movement, which is held to have helped disrupt the methodological consensus in American law schools. His political activity helped the transition to democracy in Brazil in the aftermath of the military regime, and culminated with his appointment as Brazil's Minister of Strategic Affairs in 2007 and again in 2015. Context: The beginning of Unger's academic career began with the books Knowledge and Politics and Law in Modern Society, published in 1975 and 1976 respectively. These works led to the co-founding of Critical Legal Studies (CLS) with Duncan Kennedy and Morton Horwitz. The movement stirred up controversy in legal schools across America as it challenged standard legal scholarship and made radical proposals for legal education. By the early 1980s, the CLS movement touched off a heated internal debate at Harvard, pitting the CLS scholars against the older, more traditional scholars. Throughout much of the 1980s, Unger worked on his magnum opus, Politics: A Work In Constructive Social Theory, a three volume work that assessed classical social theory and developed a political, social, and economic alternative. The series is based on the premise of society as an artifact, and rejects the necessity of certain institutional arrangements. Published in 1987, Politics was foremost a critique of contemporary social theory and politics; it developed a theory of structural and ideological change, and gave an alternative account of world history. By first attacking the idea that there is a necessary progression from one set of institutional arrangements to another, e.g. feudalism to capitalism, it then built an anti-necessitarian theory of social change, theorizing the transition from one set of institutional arrangements to another. Unger devoted much of the following decades to further elaborating on the insights developed in Politics by working out the political and social alternatives. What Should Legal Analysis Become? (Verso, 1996) developed tools to reimagine the organization of social life. Democracy Realized: The Progressive Alternative (Verso, 1998) and What Should the Left Propose? (Verso, 2005) put forth alternative institutional proposals. Question: Anything else in the article? Answer:","completion":"Roberto Mangabeira Unger is a smart thinker and a leader who has done many important things in his life. He started out by writing books about knowledge and laws, and he helped create a new way to think about the law, called Critical Legal Studies. This way of thinking changed how people studied law in schools in America and led to some big arguments at Harvard, a famous school where he worked. In the 1980s, Unger spent a lot of time working on a big project called Politics: A Work in Constructive Social Theory. This project was made of three big books that talked about society, or how people work together. Unger didn't think that the way society was organized had to stay the same, and he wanted people to think differently about how we could change the world for the better. After writing those books, he spent lots of time thinking about how we could make our society and laws better. He wrote more books with ideas for how to improve the world, especially focusing on how to make sure everyone has power and can be involved in making decisions (that's called democracy). Overall, Roberto Mangabeira Unger is an important person who has tried to help people think in new ways about how we can make the world a better place."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine, professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music. Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war. During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871. With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals. Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society. The Société Nationale de Musique, with its motto, \\"Ars Gallica\\", had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc, Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members. As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems, Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first \\"poème symphonique\\" was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872. In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged. La princesse jaune (\\"The Yellow Princess\\"), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique, Paris in June. It ran for five performances.Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother. In 1875, he surprised many by marrying. The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils. The marriage was not a success. In the words of the... Answer:","completion":"The name of the person who supported himself in England during temporary exile is Saint-Saëns.

Term limits, Sanders said, are something Trump \\"supports here in the United States, but that's a decision that would be up to China.\\" The Chinese Communist Party proposed removing the presidential two-term limit from China's constitution, state media reported Sunday. The move would be a further consolidation of power for Xi, who is already seen as one of China's most powerful leaders in decades. On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Xi, saying he has a \\"very good relationship\\" and \\"great respect\\" for the Chinese leader. \\"I think that President Xi is unique. He's helping us with North Korea,\\" Trump said during a White House meeting with U.S. governors. Trump has not specifically addressed the issue of China removing term limits. To some, Sanders' comments are the latest evidence of a break in the long-standing U.S. tradition of encouraging democracy in China, and reflect an unwillingness to criticize undemocratic regimes. \\"In effect, she is saying that the U.S. is OK with Xi Jinping simply asserting that he will remain in power indefinitely,\\" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. \\"Does she realize China isn't a democracy?\\" During the presidential campaign, Trump regularly slammed China and its trade policies. But since becoming president, Trump has toned down the criticism. Instead, Trump has prioritized working with China to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. However, several reports suggest the White House could soon announce trade decisions, such as tariffs on Chinese imports, that could strain the U.S.-China relationship.

Question: What is Tommy's relationship to Grace? Title: Brothers Movie plot: Sam Cahill (Tobey Maguire) and Tommy Cahill (Jake Gyllenhaal) are brothers. A Marine captain about to embark on his fourth tour of duty, Sam is a steadfast family man married to his high school sweetheart, Grace (Natalie Portman), with whom he has two young daughters, Isabelle and Maggie (Bailee Madison, Taylor Grace Geare). The film opens with Tommy being released from jail for armed robbery, not long before Sam departs for Afghanistan in October, 2007. Soon news comes that Sam's helicopter has crashed over the water, killing all of the Marines aboard. In reality, he and a hometown friend, Private Joe Willis (Patrick Flueger), have been taken prisoner in a mountain village. With Sam \\"gone\\", Tommy attempts to redeem himself in the eyes of his family by wrangling old friends to help with kitchen repairs for Grace and the kids. Grace slowly sheds her previous resentment towards her brother-in-law. As months pass, Grace and Tommy bond over their mutual mourning, culminating in a passionate fireside kiss. They regret it afterward, and do not take this attraction any further, though Tommy continues to win the favor of his nieces. Meanwhile, Sam and Joe are abused and tortured by terrorists, forced to make videotaped dismissals of the military and their mission, though only Joe cracks. The captors eventually deem him useless and force Sam, at gunpoint, to beat Joe to death with a lead pipe. He does so and reacts angrily. Sometime later, Sam is rescued. Sam returns home, clearly traumatized by his experience. He drifts through encounters in a cold, paranoid daze, refuses to explain to his family what happened while he was in Afghanistan, and lies to Joe's widow that he does not know how Joe died. He also believes Tommy and Grace had a sexual relationship in his absence.

The review \\"It was cool\\" can be perceived as a positive comment. The word \\"cool\\" is a colloquial term often used to express approval or admiration. However, the review itself is quite brief and lacks specific details which would help us to understand the reviewer's experience fully. Keeping in mind that ★★★★★ indicates the highest possible rating with complete satisfaction, and ★ being the lowest rating which reflects dissatisfaction, it can be challenging to assign a definitive star-rating to such a short and ambiguous review. However, by considering the overall positivity of the review, we can infer that it would probably fall on the higher end of the scale. As \\"cool\\" could represent an approval but might not denote an extreme level of satisfaction, a possible rating for this review could be ★★★★ (4 stars). This rating is based on the assumption that the reviewer had a positive experience, but perhaps not outstanding or exceptional.

Over the past few weeks, we’ve witnessed a concerted effort by Fox News and conservative media figures to discredit and smear Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. Much of that energy has been focused on painting Mueller’s team as biased and anti-Trump, specifically pointing to texts sent by FBI agent Peter Strzok that led to his removal from the probe. During today’s broadcast of Fox News’ Outnumbered, #OneLuckyGuy Kevin Jackson was asked about reports that Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley wants Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe fired. Grassley added that the committee needed to get to the bottom of whether McCabe was referenced in a text sent by Strzok, which led Jackson down a rabbit hole: “I think they will say, what was his intent, right? That is exactly what former FBI Director James Comey said when he was letting Hillary Clinton off the hook. And his intent, whether it was an assassination attempt or whether, definitely something — I am just saying, we do not know what it was. When you say, ‘we gotta make sure this guy doesn’t get in at all costs’ — what does that mean? I am saying, there is a spectrum of what does it mean, but one thing we know for sure, is that he was plotting in an election against a candidate, and there is FBI fingerprints all over this.” Outnumbered host Harris Faulkner immediately jumped in to run interference on Jackson’s behalf, considering that he had casually tossed out that one of the top guys at the FBI had plotted an assassination attempt against Donald Trump. “All right, because I know how things get clipped on social media,” she stated. “I just want to make sure that we press in on the fact that no one has floated any sort of an idea that it was –” “Oh, it’s been floated,” Jackson countered, before doubling down. “When I talk about this, I’m talking about social media stuff and, y’know, that’s out there. I’m not talking about media sources.” After co-host Marie Harf chimed in to point out that there was “nothing credible” pointing to the allegation, Jackson just shrugged and said “yeah.” That presented an opening for the other hosts to try to move on from Jackson’s conspiracy theories. But he wasn’t done. Later on in the discussion, the panel switched over to talking about an upcoming meeting between Mueller and Trump’s lawyers. When asked to weigh in by Faulkner, Jackson said that he believed that “Mueller is going to ask for a pardon.” After all of the Outnumbered hosts gasped “what?” in unison, Jackson backed up his claim by saying that it would be an “olive branch to the Trump administration.” Watch the clip above, via Fox News.

Jessica despises camping in the rain and also prefers a more moderate temperature. Luckily, her trip isn't for several months so she has plenty of time to make up her mind. Hint: Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers.

Background: Robert Dale Owen (November 7, 1801 - June 24, 1877) was a Scottish-born social reformer who immigrated to the United States in 1825, became a U.S. citizen, and was active in Indiana politics as member of the Democratic Party in the Indiana House of Representatives (1835-39 and 1851-53) and represented Indiana in the U.S. House of Representatives (1843-47). As a member of Congress, Owen successfully pushed through the bill that established Smithsonian Institution and served on the Institution's first Board of Regents. Owen also served as a delegate to the Indiana Constitutional Convention in 1850 and was appointed as U.S. charge d'affaires (1853-58) to Naples. Owen was a knowledgeable exponent of the socialist doctrines of his father, Robert Owen, and managed the day-to-day operation of New Harmony, Indiana, the socialistic utopian community he helped establish with his father in 1825. Context: During the American Civil War, Owen served in the Ordnance Commission to supply the Union army; on March 16, 1863, he was appointed to the Freedman's Inquiry Commission. The commission was a predecessor to the Freedmen's Bureau. In 1862 Owen wrote a series of open letters to U.S. government officials, including President Abraham Lincoln and U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase, to encourage them to support general emancipation. Owen's letter of July 23, 1862, was published in the New York Evening Post on August 8, 1862, and his letter of September 12, 1862, was published in the same newspaper on September 22, 1862. In another open letter that Owen wrote to President Lincoln on September 17, 1862, he urged the president to abolish slavery on moral grounds. Owen also believed that emancipation would weaken the Confederate forces and help the Union army win the war. On September 23, 1862, Lincoln issued a preliminary version of the Emancipation Proclamation (as he had first resolved to do in mid-July). In Emancipation is Peace, a pamphlet that Owen wrote in 1863, he confirmed his view that general emancipation was a means to end the war. In The Wrong of Slavery, the Right of Emancipation, and the Future of the African Race, a report that Owen wrote in 1864, he also suggested that the Union should provide assistance to freedmen. Toward the end of his political career, Owen continued his effort to obtain federal voting rights for women. In 1865 he submitted an initial draft for a proposed Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would not restrict voting rights to males. However, Article XIV, Section 2, in the final version of the Amendment, which became part of the U.S. Constitution in 1868, was modified to limit suffrage to males who were U.S. citizens over the age of twenty-one. Question: What was some political activities that he partook in? Answer:","completion":"Robert Dale Owen was involved in numerous political activities throughout his career. As a member of the Democratic Party, he served in the Indiana House of Representatives between 1835-1839 and then again between 1851-1853.

During his time in Congress, Owen played a crucial role in the establishment of the Smithsonian Institution by pushing through the bill for its creation and serving on its first Board of Regents.

Context: The Genoese held the colony of Galata on the Golden Horn across from the city of Constantinople since 1261 as part of the Treaty of Nymphaeum, a trade agreement between the Byzantines and Genoese. However, the dilapidated state of the Byzantine Empire following the civil war of 1341-1347 was easily shown in the control of custom duties through the strategic straights of the Bosphorus. Even though Constantinople was the Imperial seat of power with its cultural and military center on the shores of the Bosphorus, only thirteen percent of custom dues passing through the strait were going to the Empire. The remaining 87 percent was collected by the Genoese from their colony of Galata. Genoa collected 200,000 hyperpyra from annual custom revenues from Galata, while Constantinople collected a mere 30,000. The Byzantine navy, a notable force in the Aegean during the reign of Andronikos III Palaiologos, was completely destroyed during the civil war. Thrace, the main imperial possession besides the Despotate of the Morea, was still recovering following the destruction of marauding Turkish mercenaries during the civil war.

The latter field goal occurred after wide receiver Demaryius Thomas dropped a crucial pass in the end zone from quarterback Brock Osweiler with only four seconds before halftime. The Raiders got on the scoreboard on the initial possession of the second half, with quarterback Derek Carr connecting with wide receiver Seth Roberts on an 11-yard touchdown pass. Later in the third quarter, the Broncos were backed up to their own 2-yard line following a Raiders' punt, and three plays later, the Raiders pulled to within 12-9, when defensive end Khalil Mack forced a fumble off Osweiler in the end zone for a safety. The Broncos' forced another Raiders' punt, however, at the beginning of the fourth quarter, Emmanuel Sanders muffed a punt deep in Broncos' territory, and the Raiders capitalized three plays later, with Carr throwing a 16-yard touchdown pass to tight end Mychal Rivera (with an unsuccessful two-point conversion attempt). The Broncos drove down the field on their next offensive possession, but McManus missed on a 49-yard field goal attempt that hit the left upright. After each team traded punts, the Raiders were attempting to add to their lead, but placekicker Sebastian Janikowski missed wide left on a 43-yard field goal attempt with 5:27 remaining in the game. The Broncos were facing a 4th-and-5 at their own 38-yard line with 3:50 remaining in the game, but tight end Vernon Davis dropped a pass from Osweiler that would have been a first down. The Broncos' defense forced the Raiders to go three-and-out, while being forced to use two of their remaining three team timeouts. With 2:35 remaining, the Broncos had one last possession, but on the sixth play, another dropped 4th-down pass &#8212; this one by Thomas &#8212; sealed the Raiders' win.

Article: If you want to master a new skill, you need a guide. Oftentimes, the best way to learn a skill is by simply watching. Look up videos of lip syncing online or attend a lip syncing battle in your area. Pay attention all aspects of performance. Writers who want to be better writers read and pay attention to things like sentence structure, story, and dialogue. If you want to learn to lip sync, watch for performance persona, timing, and accuracy. If at all possible, ask questions. Questions about the nuances of performance can be a great way to learn more. If you're able to attend a lip sync contest, consider stopping a performer afterwards and asking him or her any questions you may have. There are no quick ways to master a new skill. You simply have to make time every day to practice and, with time, you will improve. Keep a consistent schedule. Practicing lip syncing should become as natural to you as brushing your teeth at night. Set aside a half or so to go over your chosen song a few times. There are different kinds of learners. Some people learn best by watching, reading, and studying. Others learn best by seeing and doing. In order to master lip syncing, understand and practice your personal learning style. There are many tests online you can use to gauge how you learn best. You progress is unlikely to be steady the entire time.

However, budget cuts caused her to be laid off and forced her to get a job as tour guide. She believes she has hit rock bottom when she loses her passion in everything. Informed by her boss, Maria (Bernice Stegers), that she ranks poorly as a guide because the tourists think she's boring, Georgia finds herself leading a tour around Greece with an assorted group of misfit tourists whom she believes is a failure since they seem to care more about buying T-shirts than learning about history and culture. Instead, she wishes to have a good group of Canadian tourists whom seems to be more engaged in history and culture than wanting to go shopping for souvenirs and hang out at the beach. Maria disagrees with Georgia's assessment, informing her that they are more interested in Nico (Alistair McGowan), a rival male tour guide also working for Maria because he's engaging in tours. As Georgia's tour departs, her driver is injured in an accident and is replaced by another driver, Poupi (Alexis Georgoulis). In a clash of personalities and cultures, everything seems to go wrong and Georgia is on the verge of quitting as she can't connect with the group to get them to appreciate Greece and its culture. This is made worse when she voices her disgust with Maria for favoring Nico over her in letting his group stay in better hotels than her group. After being ignored again, Georgia decides to send a letter to inform her that she's quitting at the end of her tour. One day, an older traveller named Irv Gideon (Richard Dreyfuss), helps Georgia see why she can't connect with the group: she finds them annoying and is bored with her current job.

Answer the following question: The sighting of a killer whale (or orca) can be rare, but they do love to hunt and play in the waters between Vancouver and Seattle, so one of the activities we absolutely wanted to do (in addition to the harbour seaplane flight) was to go whale watching. Just South of Vancouver, in the quaint Historic fishing village of Steveston we hopped aboard our boat, and spent the day on the water cruising the coast looking for whales, other marine mammals and seabirds. The regular chug-chug-chug of the boat motor for a couple of hours lulled me into a meditate state as we sped our way over the State line from Vancouver, back down to the waters of Washington State. The shimmer of the water all dappled in the sunlight, the slow, measured tones of our guide and snuggling into my warm jacket against the sharp breeze off the coast was just enough to make me forget my worries, and zone out from all of my modern day dilemmas. Honestly, it needs to be prescribed on the NHS. Forget hauling yoga mats and sitting in sweaty concrete rooms with patterns trying to hide the utilitarian backdrop, just hop on a boat out from Vancouver. Not having much success closer to the British Columbia shores, our captain decided to head south past the Canadian/American border. Incredibly, the resident killer whales of the San Juan Islands are the most studied whales in the world; they, in turn, have observed humans for at least six thousand years. Stable family groups, called pods, represent several generations and include grandmothers (the pod leaders), adolescents, infants, and huge bulls. Each family member is recognized by its distinctive markings and can live as long as a human. Much of what is known about the orca whale’s highly-organized social life has been learned from the resident pods in the San Juan Islands of Washington.

It has 13,470 properties, which has fallen from 23,000 since 1985, largely due to the Right to Buy legislation. The Welsh Government has already said it wants to abolish it in Wales.

Q: how many american soldiers died in the world war 1? A:","completion":"According to the United States Department of Defense, the U.S officially recorded 116,516 deaths as a direct result of World War 1. These deaths included both direct combat casualties and those resulting from injuries or disease. However, the breakdown is as follows: 53,402 soldiers died in battle, while 63,114 deaths were attributed to disease or other non-combat related incidents. The significant number of non-combat related deaths can be attributed to the fact that World War 1 was fought in an era where medical technology and understanding was considerably less advanced than it is today. Of those non-combat related deaths, a substantial number were due to the 1918 influenza pandemic, often referred to as the Spanish Flu, which swept through crowded military camps and transport ships. It is also important to note that according to official military records, there were also 204,002 non-fatality casualties who returned home with physical injuries or psychological trauma resulting from their experiences in World War 1. These soldiers often carried these scars for the rest of their lives. In the broader context, it's worth noting that American losses were relatively light, considering that the total number of casualties in World War 1 was estimated to be around 41 million (including 18.6 million deaths and 23 million wounded) on all sides. This is because the United States joined the conflict relatively late, entering the war in April 1917, and so was spared the high casualty rates of the earlier years. Despite the lighter casualty list compared to other nations, for America, the loss of over 116,000 lives in the span of just over a year was a substantial and traumatic loss. Today, memorial sites across the nation stand as poignant reminders of the brave men and women who lost their lives during this devastating global conflict. The soldiers who died in World War 1, and indeed in any war, paid the ultimate sacrifice in service to their nation and its ideals.

Answer the following question: - Magma cools inside the crust - Magma crystalizes - Lava cools on the surface - Lava crystalizes What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The last step of the process, following the cooling and crystallization of both magma and lava, is the formation of igneous rocks within the Earth's crust and on its surface. When magma cools and crystallizes inside the Earth's crust, intrusive (or plutonic) igneous rocks are formed. These rocks are characterized by their coarse-grained texture and slow cooling rate, which allows mineral crystals to grow relatively large. Some common examples of intrusive igneous rocks include granite, gabbro, and diorite. As these rocks form deep within the Earth's crust, they remain buried and are eventually exposed at the surface through processes such as erosion and tectonic activity. On the other hand, when lava cools and crystallizes on the Earth's surface, extrusive (or volcanic) igneous rocks are produced. These rocks are generally characterized by their fine-grained texture and rapid cooling rate, leading to the formation of small mineral crystals. In some cases, when lava cools extremely quickly, the resulting rock may contain mostly glassy material with few or no visible crystals, such as obsidian. Common examples of extrusive igneous rocks include basalt, rhyolite, and andesite. Once the igneous rocks have been formed, they can undergo various geologic processes and transformations that further alter their characteristics. For example, they may be subjected to heat and pressure deep within the Earth's crust, leading to the formation of metamorphic rocks such as gneiss and schist. Alternatively, these rocks can be exposed to the Earth's surface, where they may undergo weathering and erosion. The resulting sediment can then be transported and deposited in different environments, eventually forming sedimentary rocks such as sandstone, shale, or limestone. In summary, the last step in the process of magma and lava cooling and crystallization is the formation of igneous rocks, either intrusive (inside the Earth's crust) or extrusive (on the Earth's surface). These rocks then become part of the Earth's crust and can participate in the various geologic processes that continually reshape the planet's surface over long periods of time."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

MIPS CPUs are able to run at both endiannesses, but since that's normally not changeable in software, we need to have both architectures. Please remove spaces between words.","completion":"MIPSCPUsareabletorunatbothendiannesses,butsincethat'snormallynotchangeableinsoftware,weneedtohavebotharchitectures. The details: 1. MIPS, or Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages, is a type of CPU architecture that is based on Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) principles. MIPS CPUs are known for their simplicity and efficiency, enabling faster processing and lower power consumption than many other types of processors. 2. MIPS processors can run in either big-endian or little-endian modes. The term \\"endian\\" refers to the order in which bytes of data are arranged within a binary representation of a larger data type, such as a word or a long word. 3. In big-endian mode, the most significant byte is placed at the byte with the lowest address, while in little-endian mode, the least significant byte is placed at the lowest address. 4. The ability to switch between big and little endian modes can offer versatility in terms of compatibility with different types of hardware, operating systems, and software applications. However, this feature is typically locked in the hardware, which means that it cannot be changed using software once the processor has been manufactured. 5. For this reason, to support different applications that may require big or little endian modes, we need to have both types of architectures available. This means designing, manufacturing, and maintaining two different versions of the same MIPS processor – one that operates in big-endian mode and one that operates in little-endian mode. 6. Despite the increase in complexity and cost associated with supporting dual architectures, the benefits of interoperability and flexibility often make it worthwhile. In an increasingly diverse and evolving digital environment, processors that can adapt to different endianness requirements are likely to be more successful in the long run."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who showed artistic promise from an early age? is inside the article: William Etty was born in 1787 in York, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century.

Several theme parks even have accommodation so you can stay for a day or two if you want to make a trip into a short holiday. Prices for UK theme parks vary considerably; some have an entrance price which allows you to go on all the rides, while in others you have to pay for every ride individually. It can also make a difference whether you go during peak time or not. For example, tickets always cost more during school holidays and weekends than they do during the weekdays. Theme parks always get very busy during the summer months, so if you don't like crowds, it's usually a good idea to go earlier or later in the year! If you're thinking of visiting a UK theme park, it's worth having a look for special offers on tickets. Products such as chocolate bars and cereals sometimes have \\"buy one get one free\\" offers on theme park tickets, so keep a look out in shops and supermarkets. Question: According to the passage, what should you do if you are tired of crowds in the theme park?

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who was persuaded to be a British delegate to a conference in Buenos Aires?, using the article: In 1947, Walton was presented with the Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal. In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year. While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.Troilus and Cressida was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954. Its preparation was dogged by misfortunes. Olivier, originally scheduled to direct it, backed out, as did Henry..., what would be the answer ?

The title \\"Bugs Galore\\" implies an overwhelming presence of bugs or errors in the software, which is not a positive assessment.

The reviewer also suggests that potential users should save their sanity and their computer by avoiding this product, further discouraging others from using it. The review details the struggles that the user experienced when trying to rip DVDs using the software, highlighting the need for multiple uninstalls and reinstalls of updates. This reflects the poor performance of the software and is consistent with the notion that it is riddled with bugs.

Background: Shen Kuo (Chinese: Chen Gua ; 1031-1095), courtesy name Cunzhong (Cun Zhong ) and pseudonym Mengqi (now usually given as Mengxi) Weng (Meng Xi Weng ), was a Han Chinese polymathic scientist and statesman of the Song dynasty (960-1279). Excelling in many fields of study and statecraft, he was a mathematician, astronomer, meteorologist, geologist, zoologist, botanist, pharmacologist, agronomist, archaeologist, ethnographer, cartographer, encyclopedist, general, diplomat, hydraulic engineer, inventor, academy chancellor, finance minister, governmental state inspector, poet, and musician. Context: Shen Kuo was born in Qiantang (modern-day Hangzhou) in the year 1031. His father Shen Zhou (Chen Zhou ; 978-1052) was a somewhat lower-class gentry figure serving in official posts on the provincial level; his mother was from a family of equal status in Suzhou, with her maiden name being Xu (Xu ). Shen Kuo received his initial childhood education from his mother, which was a common practice in China during this period. She was very educated herself, teaching Kuo and his brother Pi (Pi ) the military doctrines of her own elder brother Xu Tang (Xu Dong ; 975-1016). Since Shen was unable to boast of a prominent familial clan history like many of his elite peers born in the north, he was forced to rely on his wit and stern determination to achieve in his studies, subsequently passing the imperial examinations and enter the challenging and sophisticated life of an exam-drafted state bureaucrat. From about 1040 AD, Shen's family moved around Sichuan province and finally to the international seaport at Xiamen, where Shen's father accepted minor provincial posts in each new location. Shen Zhou also served several years in the prestigious capital judiciary, the equivalent of a federal supreme court. Shen Kuo took notice of the various towns and rural features of China as his family traveled, while he became interested during his youth in the diverse topography of the land. He also observed the intriguing aspects of his father's engagement in administrative governance and the managerial problems involved; these experiences had a deep impact on him as he later became a government official. Since he often became ill as a child, Shen Kuo also developed a natural curiosity about medicine and pharmaceutics. Shen Zhou died in the late winter of 1051 (or early 1052), when his son Shen Kuo was 21 years old. Shen Kuo grieved for his father, and following Confucian ethics, remained inactive in a state of mourning for three years until 1054 (or early 1055). As of 1054, Shen began serving in minor local governmental posts. However, his natural abilities to plan, organize, and design were proven early in life; one example is his design and supervision of the hydraulic drainage of an embankment system, which converted some one hundred thousand acres (400 km2) of swampland into prime farmland. Shen Kuo noted that the success of the silt fertilization method relied upon the effective operation of sluice gates of irrigation canals. Question: Where was he born?

Expansion quickly peaked however, and the European powers who had carved up the New World set about testing each other in dynastic conflicts and colonial rivalry. The English were the main rivals of the Dutch on the high seas, and there were several wars between the two in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1665–1667 the Dutch sailed up the River Medway and sank the British fleet moored there. The 18th century saw Amsterdam grow into the foremost financial center in the world, but the seeds of decline had already been planted. When the English colonies in New England rose up in revolt against the British, they found ready Ailies in the Dutch. From their colonies in the Caribbean they sent caches of arms and ammunition. The British were furious and went to war in 1780, destroying the Dutch navy and signaling a sudden decline in power and influence from which the Netherlands never recovered. Trade suffered to such an extent that in 1791 the VOC went into liquidation. In the latter part of the century there were anti-Orange demonstrations by pro-French factions in the country, and in 1795 Napoleon Bonaparte took the Netherlands in his epic march across Europe. Under the yoke of another foreign power, and with trade at an all time low, the Golden Age was truly dead. The Return of the House of Orange Napoleon installed his brother Louis as King of Holland and he chose to take the fine Town Hall on Dam Square as his palace — now the Koninklijk Palace. But only four years later he fled the city after civil disturbances broke out when he raised taxes. When Napoleon's bubble burst and French power began to wane, William of Orange emerged from exile and was proclaimed king in 1813. Amsterdam had to work its way out of economic decline, but throughout the 19th century the city grew steadily. Industrialization changed the city. With the building of the Central Station at the end of the century, Amsterdam turned its back on its seafaring past and looked towards the mechanical age for its future. The station was built over the old harbor wall and some of the oldest canals in the city center were filled in to allow better access to motorized vehicles. Dam Square was landlocked for the first time in its history. Question: \\"The building of the Central Station occurred at the end of which century?\\" Response: \\"18th\\" Options are: + no. + yes.

According to the passage, the building of Central Station occurred at the end of the 19th century, not the 18th. The 18th century saw Amsterdam grow into a financial center, but the Central Station which represented a shift towards industrialization and the mechanical age, was constructed in the 19th century.

It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it. Ian is looking to buy a new pair of glasses.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Q: I heard that cameron was a police officer so he asked the man a question. And I was wondering How would Others feel as a result? The answer is:","completion":"To determine how others would feel as a result of Cameron, a police officer, asking the man a question, I will break down the factors that may influence their feelings: 1. Context of the question: Analyze the context in which the question was asked. Was it during an investigation, a casual interaction, or an emergency situation? 2. Tone and body language: Consider the tone and body language used by Cameron while asking the question. Was he respectful, intimidating, or friendly? 3. Relationship between the man and Cameron: Take into account the relationship of the man with Cameron. Do they know each other or are they strangers? Is their relationship friendly or hostile? 4. Community perception of the police: Consider the general perception of the police in that particular community. Do they trust the police or are they skeptical? 5. Observers' personal experiences: Assess the personal experiences of people who might be witnessing the interaction. Their past experiences with the police may shape their feelings. Now, I can provide an analysis based on these factors: If the context of Cameron's question was of a casual or friendly nature, and his tone and body language were respectful and friendly, people witnessing the interaction would likely feel positive about it. They might appreciate Cameron as a police officer who is approachable and supportive. If Cameron was intimidating or aggressive, on the other hand, people might feel uncomfortable or even fearful. This might lead to negative feelings about the police in general, especially if the community has a history of mistrusting law enforcement. People's personal experiences with the police will also greatly influence their response. Anyone who has experienced police misconduct or observed it will likely be wary or apprehensive of even friendly interactions with officers. In conclusion, the feelings of others witnessing Cameron asking the man a question will vary greatly depending on several factors like the context of the interaction, the manner in which the question was asked, and the observers' personal experiences with law enforcement. It is important for officers like Cameron to be aware of these factors to foster a better relationship with the community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You are given a new situation: John is learning more about different cultures and people around the world. He noticed that people have different skin colors. To learn more about the science behind skin colors he categorized the skin colors into two broad groups, case D and case L. Case D is represented by darker skin and case L is represented by lighter skin. and a hint : The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. Please answer this question : Would case D population be at smaller or larger risk of vitamin D deficiency than case L population?","completion":"Based on the given information, the case D population, with darker skin, would be at a larger risk of vitamin D deficiency compared to the case L population with lighter skin.

It achieved popularity during the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. Its initial audiences in the U.S. were club-goers from the gay, African American, Italian American, Latino, and psychedelic communities in Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period. It was popular with both men and women, from many different backgrounds. - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex. - \\"Maybellene\\" is one of the first rock-and-roll songs. It was written and recorded in 1955 by Chuck Berry, and inspired/adapted from the Western Swing fiddle tune \\"Ida Red,\\" which was recorded in 1938 by Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys. Berry's song tells the story of a hot rod race and a broken romance. It was released in July 1955 as a single by Chess Records, of Chicago, Illinois. It was Berry's first single and his first hit. \\"Maybellene\\" is considered one of the pioneering rock-and-roll songs: \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine wrote, \\"Rock & roll guitar starts here.\\" The record is an early instance of the complete rock-and-roll package: youthful subject matter; a small, guitar-driven combo; clear diction; and an atmosphere of unrelenting excitement. The lyrics describe a man driving a V8 Ford chasing his unfaithful girlfriend in her Cadillac Coupe DeVille. - Charles Edward Anderson \\"Chuck\\" Berry (born October 18, 1926) is an American guitarist, singer and songwriter and is one of the pioneers of rock and roll music. With songs such as \\"Maybellene\\" (1955), \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" (1956), \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" (1957) and \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" (1958), Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, with lyrics focusing on teen life and consumerism and music featuring guitar solos and showmanship that were a major influence on subsequent rock music. - The Beastie Boys were an American hip hop group from New York City, formed in 1980. For the majority of their career, the group consisted of Michael \\"Mike D\\" Diamond (vocals, drums), Adam \\"MCA\\" Yauch (vocals, bass) and Adam \\"Ad-Rock\\" Horovitz (vocals, guitar). - A record producer or music producer oversees and manages the sound recording and production of a band or performer's music, which may range from recording one song to recording a lengthy concept album. A producer has many roles during the recording process. The roles of a producer vary. He or she may gather musical ideas for the project, collaborate with the artists to select cover tunes or original songs by the artist/group, work with artists and help them to improve their songs, lyrics or arrangements. - A novelty song is a comical or nonsensical song, performed principally for its comical effect. Humorous songs, or those containing humorous elements, are not necessarily novelty songs. The term arose in Tin Pan Alley to describe one of the major divisions of popular music. The other two divisions were ballads and dance music. Novelty songs achieved great popularity during the 1920s and 1930s. They had a resurgence of interest in the 1950s and 1960s. - \\"My Ding-a-Ling\\", from the live side of the album, was edited to approximately 4 minutes for release as a single. It was Berry's first and only single to reach number 1 in both the US and the UK. - Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths. - Swing music, or simply swing, is a form of American music that dominated in the 1930s and 1940s. Swing uses a strong rhythm section of double bass and drums as the anchor for a lead section of brass instruments such as trumpets and trombones, woodwinds including saxophone and clarinets, and sometimes stringed instruments such as violin and guitar, medium to fast tempos, and a \\"lilting\\" swing time rhythm. The name swing came from the 'swing feel' where the emphasis is on the offbeat or weaker pulse in the music. Swing bands usually featured soloists who would improvise on the melody over the arrangement. The danceable swing style of big bands and bandleaders such as Benny Goodman was the dominant form of American popular music from 1935 to 1946, a period known as the swing era. The verb \\"to swing\\" is also used as a term of praise for playing that has a strong groove or drive. Notable musicians of the swing era include Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway, Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller, Count Basie, Woody Herman, and Artie Shaw. - Tin Pan Alley is the name given to the collection of New York City music publishers and songwriters who dominated the popular music of the United States in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The name originally referred to a specific place: West 28th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenue in Manhattan, and a plaque exists (see below) on the sidewalk on 28th Street between Broadway and Sixth commemorates it.

Information: - Alvan Fisher ( August 9 , 1792 -- February 13 , 1863 ) was one of the United States 's pioneers in landscape painting and genre works . - Landscape painting, also known as landscape art, is the depiction in art of landscapes natural scenery such as mountains, valleys, trees, rivers, and forests, especially where the main subject is a wide view with its elements arranged into a coherent composition. In other works, landscape backgrounds for figures can still form an important part of the work. Sky is almost always included in the view, and weather is often an element of the composition. Detailed landscapes as a distinct subject are not found in all artistic traditions, and develop when there is already a sophisticated tradition of representing other subjects. - Weather is the state of the atmosphere, to the degree that it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy. Most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere.

The differences lie in the structure, emphasis, and some subtle details. 1. The first sentence: \\"The exam contains four sections and tests a students knowledge of algebra and geometry as well as probability and statistics.\\" This sentence is a statement that provides an overview of the exam and informs that it assesses the student's knowledge in four subjects: algebra, geometry, probability, and statistics. The use of \\"and\\" before \\"tests\\" indicates that the sentence lays equal emphasis on the fact that there are four sections in the exam, and on the subjects being tested. The sentence implies that the exam aims to comprehensively evaluate the student's understanding of all four subjects, but it does not provide specific details about how questions on each topic are distributed across the sections. 2. The second sentence: \\"The test, in four sections, includes algebra and geometry, along with some questions on probability and statistics.\\" This sentence emphasizes the structure of the test, mentioning that it is divided into four sections. Using commas to set off \\"in four sections\\" offers a parenthetical-like interruption that draws attention to this detail.

Generate a question that has the following answer: day zero for the following movie plot: In a hypothesized imminent future three close friends receive simultaneous induction notices during a reintroduced U.S. draft to fight in the Mid-east. This is the story of their anguish and soul searching about whether to avoid or accept their luck of the draw. Initially, New York City cab driver Dixon (Jon Bernthal) is pretty gung-ho when the hapless trio meet at their hang-out bar to discuss what has happened. One-time book author Aaron Feller (Elijah Wood) seems kind of apprehensive about entering the military, but he appears prepared to follow Dixon's lead. On the other hand, George (Chris Klein)--the only one of the three who is married (the other two do not even have steady girlfriends)--tells his buddies he absolutely is NOT joining the service. He has just become a junior partner in his corporate law firm, and he has promised his wife Molly (Ginnifer Goodwin)--a cancer survivor--that he will be around to look after her. During the course of the story, Dixon finds a new social worker eacher lover Patricia (Elizabeth Moss), and bails each of his two buddies out of fights (as he has done since their school days) while decking host George himself during a going-away party at the culmination of an argument about U.S. military policy. Meanwhile, an increasingly despondent Aaron (feeling totally inadequate) tries to bolster his courage by creating a 10-item to-do list and engaging in ever-more-risky behavior. George gets drunk one night and almost chops off his fingers with a kitchen meat cleaver to avoid the draft, choosing to pick a brawl in a gay bar instead--but by the time his wealthy father says his U.S. senator friend can keep George out of the military, George seems reconciled to leaving wife Molly and his law firm for a while.

Which language is this?","completion":"The text you provided is in Russian. It translates to \\"However, it can greatly shock unprepared souls.\\" in English. Here's a detailed explanation about the Russian language: Russian is an East Slavic language, one of the largest and most populous branches of the Slavic language family, which also includes Ukrainian and Belarusian. Russian is spoken as a native language by approximately 258 million people worldwide, primarily in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and other former republics of the Soviet Union. It is the eighth most spoken language in the world and holds official status in the Russian Federation, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. The modern Russian language uses the Cyrillic script, which has its origins in the 9th century, when Saints Cyril and Methodius developed it to help spread Christianity throughout Eastern Europe. Over time, the Cyrillic script adopted additional symbols, and today it consists of 33 letters. Russian grammar is known for its complexity, with a rich system of inflections for nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and verbs. The language has six cases – nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, and prepositional – which express the syntactic and semantic roles of words in a sentence. There are also three gender categories (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and two numbers (singular and plural). Compared to English, Russian sentence structure is more flexible, allowing for a wider range of word order variations. The default word order, however, is subject-verb-object (SVO), similar to English. Vocabulary-wise, Russian has borrowed words from many different languages, such as Turkic, Iranian, Old Norse, and French. However, the majority of its lexical roots can be traced back to the Proto-Slavic and Proto-Indo-European languages. In addition to being widely used in everyday communication, Russian has a rich literary tradition, featuring works by renowned authors like Alexander Pushkin, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Leo Tolstoy, and Anton Chekhov. As the former lingua franca of the Soviet Union, Russian is also a key language in the fields of science, space exploration, and technology."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. When several health setbacks sapped my 77-year-old dad's zest for life, I had to do something. My friend Diane came to my rescue when she showed off her Fitbit, a small wearable digital device that logs every step you make and nudges you to keep moving. It also tracks your calories to help watch how much you eat. I was intrigued. My dad, Vesselin Vassilev, loves gadgets, so I thought a Fitbit could get him off the couch. Six months later, he's still moving. He's lost weight and feels more energized, but what happens when the novelty wears off? Can digital monitors really help people like my dad kick unhealthy habits blamed for growing global obesity rates? A health study published in January by a UK-based think tank says over-eating and sedentary lifestyles are causing an \\"explosion\\" of obesity around the world. The Overseas Development Institute's \\"Future Diets\\" study found that in 2008, one in three adults was overweight or obese, a 23% rise from 1980. In the same time, obesity had spread faster in the developing world than richer countries. People are gaining weight because they're eating more meat, sugar and fat -- and in bigger portions. And doctors say obesity puts us more at risk of some of the leading causes of preventable death -- like heart disease, stroke, type-2 diabetes and certain types of cancer. Doctors say we need to eat less and move more to maintain a healthy weight. But getting us moving has been an uphill battle. Few people are able to stick with a fitness routine for long. Gold's Gym in the U.S. says 50% of their members eventually return to their sedentary lifestyle. You've probably noticed how gyms get crowded by the \\"New Year Resolution\\" people in January, only to get back to normal by spring. Many people just can't stay motivated for long. So does technology stand a better chance? Digital activity monitors seem to offer a technological solution to solving both problems, eating too much and moving too little. They all work in a similar way, using a sensor to track movement, heart rate and body temperature. They nudge you to move when you sit too long and give you feedback on whether you're meeting your goal. You can wear them as a bracelet or pin them to your belt or clothing. They can connect to websites where you can check your daily activity, log your calories and compete with other users. Some of the monitors can tell you how well you've slept, by tracking your moves at night. Among the most popular brands are Fitbit, Jawbone UP and Nike FuelBand. They cost between 60 and 200, depending on the features. According to NPD, a consumer market research group which tracks sales, Fitbit had 67% share of the U.S. retail market, Jawbone UP accounted for 19% and Nike FuelBand, 10%. Fitbits are now sold in 30,000 stores across 28 countries around the world. And Jawbone has announced plans to expand in Europe, Asia, Australia and the Middle East. Last year Fitbit made inroads at CNN. Several staff gave it a try, including my colleague Courtney Perkins. \\"Little did I know, that would be the one thing, after countless diets and resolutions and short-lived exercise programs, that finally works,\\" she said. So I surprised my dad with a Fitbit when I went to see him in my native Bulgaria. Associate Professor Katie Siek, who studies wearable digital devices at Indiana University's Informatics Department, says monitors have taken off because they are easy to use and actively track progress towards goals. But is this another passing fitness fad? Health economist Jane Sarasohn-Kahn believes they have lasting power because they meet the needs of our modern lives. She says do-it-yourself monitoring will become more important in healthcare, both as a way for people to manage their health and get feedback from their doctors. Courtney is still using her Fitbit more than a year later, while dad has been wearing his for six months. Dad says: \\"I move two to three times more than before and I'm more energized and feel stronger. \\"I walk three to five miles a day and want to do even more.\\" But Courtney is our newsroom Fitbit star. She lost 30 pounds (13kg) in eight months. She went from being overweight to being in the normal range and has kept the weight off since last November. But they have their struggles. Dad is still used to putting his feet up. Courtney's biggest challenge is life's special occasions, \\"the perfect excuse to slack off.\\" She says: \\"I have to work hard to maintain my no-excuses policy while still cutting myself some slack every once in a while. It's a tough balance to strike. \\"Also, vacations -- when I take a week off from work, the routine is broken. I really have to make sure I'm wearing the Fitbit and logging calories every day or I'll fall off the wagon.\\" For now Courtney and dad are determined to stick with their Fitbits. But even if they lose interest, they all say they've gained one lasting benefit, more awareness of how much to move and eat to stay healthy. Sarasohn-Kahn says awareness helps us adopt good habits. \\"Over time, your daily life flow changes and these movements become more automatic. \\"These actions can be mutually-reinforcing, in particular the more you move, the more you burn calories, so that informs the food choices you make on a daily basis.\\" The Endeavor Partners research firm found that 50% of consumers stopped using their digital tracking devices within six months. But device use could go up as more employers provide them to cut healthcare costs. And scientists are testing ways to tweak digital activity trackers to help people stay with them longer. The biggest benefit to me is how it helped my dad regain his zest for life. But I'm a little apprehensive about getting a monitor. I worry about becoming too controlled by a gadget always keeping a wary eye on me. Besides, my \\"low-tech\\" routine has worked well for more than six years now. But seeing how much fun people are having with their monitors, it might just be enough to nudge me to join in the fun. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

The Local Group comprises more than 54 galaxies, most of them dwarf galaxies. Its gravitational center is located somewhere between the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy. The Local Group covers a diameter of (about 10 meters) and has a binary (dumbbell) distribution. The group itself is a part of the larger Virgo Supercluster, which in turn may be a part of the Laniakea Supercluster. - The Andromeda Galaxy, also known as Messier 31, M31, or NGC 224, is a spiral galaxy approximately 780 kiloparsecs (2.5 million light-years) from Earth. It is the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way and was often referred to as the Great Andromeda Nebula in older texts. It received its name from the area of the sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda, which was named after the mythological princess Andromeda. - In astronomy and navigation, the celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere of arbitrarily large radius, concentric with Earth. All objects in the observer's sky can be thought of as projected upon the inside surface of the celestial sphere, as if it were the underside of a dome or a hemispherical screen. The celestial sphere is a practical tool for spherical astronomy, allowing observers to plot positions of objects in the sky when their distances are unknown or unimportant. - A constellation is formally defined as a region of the celestial sphere, with boundaries laid down by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The constellation areas mostly had their origins in Western-traditional patterns of stars from which the constellations take their names. - Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole. - A dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) is a term in astronomy applied to low luminosity galaxies that are companions to the Milky Way and to the similar systems that are companions to the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). While similar to dwarf elliptical galaxies in appearance and properties such as little to no gas or dust or recent star formation, they are approximately spheroidal in shape, generally lower luminosity, and are recognized only as satellite galaxies in the Local Group. - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. - Andromeda V is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy about 2.52 Mly away in the constellation Andromeda . Andromeda V was discovered by Armandroff et al . and published in 1998 after their analysis of the digitized version of the second Palomar Sky Survey . The metallicity of Andromeda V is above the average metallicity to luminosity ratio of the Local Group 's dwarf galaxies . - The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System. The descriptive \\"milky\\" is derived from the appearance from Earth of the galaxy a band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term \\"Milky Way\\" is a translation of the Latin ', from the Greek (', \\"milky circle\\"). From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe. Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.

Empiricism: Hume maintained that all knowledge, even the most basic beliefs about the natural world, cannot be conclusively established by reason. Rather, he maintained, our beliefs are more a result of accumulated habits, developed in response to accumulated sense experiences. Among his many arguments Hume also added another important slant to the debate about scientific method — that of the problem of induction. Hume argued that it requires inductive reasoning to arrive at the premises for the principle of inductive reasoning, and therefore the justification for inductive reasoning is a circular argument. Among Hume's conclusions regarding the problem of induction is that there is no certainty that the future will resemble the past.

Her lack of style or fashion knowledge and fumbling with her job make her an object of scorn around the office. Senior assistant Emily Charlton (Emily Blunt), Miranda's senior personal assistant, is condescending to her. Gradually, though, with the help of art director Nigel (Stanley Tucci), Andrea adjusts to the position and its many perks, including free designer clothing and other choice accessories. She begins to dress more stylishly and do her job competently, fulfilling a seemingly impossible request of Miranda's to get two copies of an unpublished Harry Potter manuscript to her daughters.She also comes to prize chance encounters with attractive young writer Christian Thompson (Simon Baker), who helped her obtain the Potter manuscript and suggests he could help her with her career.

Emily is the senior personal assistant to Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), the editor-in-chief of Runway magazine. In the film, Emily's role is essential to the plot as her character provides a challenging counterpart to the protagonist, Andrea \\"Andy\\" Sachs (Anne Hathaway). Emily is portrayed as a dedicated and ambitious assistant, fully immersed in the world of fashion. She is devoted to her job, willing to do anything it takes to please her boss, Miranda, and keep things running smoothly. She is very knowledgeable in fashion and understands the inner workings of the high-stakes world of Runway magazine. When Andy arrives on the scene and takes on the role of junior assistant, there is an immediate tension between her and Emily. Emily initially looks down on Andy due to her lack of fashion knowledge, style, and experience in the industry. However, as the movie progresses, Andy begins to adapt to her new environment, learning the ropes of her job and acquiring a newfound appreciation for fashion, slowly gaining Emily's begrudging respect. Emily is an important character in the film, as she represents the harsh reality and expectations faced by those working in the highly competitive fashion industry. Her demanding nature and willingness to put her career above all else serve as an eye-opening experience for Andy and highlight the sacrifices one must make to succeed in this field.

Ivor Smith was sacked for gross misconduct after helping a customer with change at the firm's Parkhead branch in Glasgow on 15 August 2014. An employment judge has now ruled that he was unfairly dismissed and awarded Mr Smith, from East Kilbride, £4,877. His son Alan said the whole process had left his father \\"shattered\\". The employment tribunal in Glasgow heard that Mr Smith had worked at the store for 12 years. He was working on a checkout when a customer asked him for change of £200 in £1 coins. War veteran Mr Smith, who fought in the Malayan conflict of the 1950s and 60s, was said to have kept his till open while money was counted at it.

This was after he claimed the cameras showed the customer putting his hand into the till on two occasions. Mr Wilson told the hearing: \\"My view was that this was a serious breach of security. A tender transaction should not take that long. \\"He gave customers access to the till.\\" Mr Smith, who had received commendations for his commitment to the company, insisted the customer never touched any money.

Movie title: Drop Zone Context: Aboard a commercial airliner, U.S. Marshals Terry (Malcolm-Jamal Warner) and Pete Nessip (Wesley Snipes), are escorting computer expert Earl Leedy (Michael Jeter) to a high security prison. When an apparent terrorist hijack attempt blows a hole in the (Boeing 747) airliner, Terry is sucked out to his death, and the terrorists parachute out of the same hole, taking Leedy with them. Ex-DEA agent and renegade skydiver Ty Moncrief (Gary Busey) is the mastermind behind the attack, which culminated in the first ever parachute jump from a commercial jet at 30,000 feet. Ty plans to use Leedy to hack into the DEA mainframe computer in Washington DC so Ty can auction off the names of undercover agents to drug cartels worldwide. Ty has scheduled this to be accomplished during an Independence Day parachute exhibition and fireworks display, which is the one day every year when security is loosened around the airspace above Washington DC. Pete believes that the assault may have been an elaborate prison break meant to free Leedy. However, the FBI declares that sneaking a parachute through airport security is impossible, and that parachuting at the jet's altitude and speed is not survivable. A devastated Pete is blamed for overreacting to the incident, and forced to turn in his badge. Undeterred, Pete consults a U.S. Navy High-altitude military parachuting instructor who confirms that he and his team have parachuted from that height and speed, but also states that the high-density metal rings in the parachutes would not pass airport metal detectors and that the operation required either rare skills or suicidal recklessness. The instructor believes the world class skydiver Dominic Jagger (Luca Bercovici) could perform the jump, but does not know his current whereabouts. Pete is instead referred to Jagger's reckless ex-wife, ex-con Jessie Crossman (Yancy Butler) - who is unaware that Jagger is part of Ty's crew. Jessie agrees to train Pete how to skydive, if he will sponsor her team for the parachute exhibition. When Jessie's...

Many people believe that they deserve success simply because they believe that they deserve success. But there is a widespread belief that people who get on in life may be successful not because they deserve it, but because of influential friends or the right background. Sometimes it may just be a comforting and harmless belief, while at the other extreme it can be very destructive. I once met a brilliant young engineer who worked in a chemical plant. Because of her knowledge and experience, she should have been promoted to Production Manager. Instead, the job went to a man who was totally unsuited for the post. Everyone knew that he only got it because he was politically acceptable to his superiors . This injustice discouraged the young engineer and many of her colleagues. It also meant that the factory was much less efficient than it could have been. At the same time, we should not be pessimistic . More and more the modern world depends on having people who are in the job because they are good enough, not just because their faces fit. There is a story of a factory owner who sent for an engineer to see to a machine which would not go. He examined it, then took out a hammer and tapped, once. The machine started up immediately. When he presented his bill, the owner protested, \\"This can't be right! 100 just for tapping a machine with a hammer?\\" The engineer wrote out a new bill: \\"For tapping a machine, 1; for knowing where to tap. 99.\\" Question: What can we learn about the author's attitude toward the widespread belief that \\"people get on in life may be successful not because they deserve it\\"?

Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered. - Moses Kiptanui ( born October 1 , 1970 in Marakwet District , Kenya ) is a middle and long distance athlete mostly famous for 3,000 m steeplechase in which he was the number one ranked athlete from 1991 to 1995 and three time IAAF World Champion .

COMPASS is any of a family of macro assembly languages on Control Data Corporation's 3000 series, and on the 60-bit CDC 6000 series, 7600 and Cyber 70 and 170 series mainframe computers. While the architectures are very different, the macro and conditional assembly facilities are similar. - West is one of the four cardinal directions or points of the compass. It is the opposite direction from east. - Geography (from Greek , \\"geographia\\", literally \\"earth description\\") is a field of science devoted to the study of the lands, the features, the inhabitants, and the phenomena of Earth. The first person to use the word \\"\\" was Eratosthenes (276194 BC). Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of the Earth and its human and natural complexitiesnot merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. It is often defined in terms of the two branches of human geography and physical geography. The four historical traditions in geographical research are: spatial analyses of natural and the human phenomena, area studies of places and regions, studies of human-land relationships, and the Earth sciences. Geography has been called \\"the world discipline\\" and \\"the bridge between the human and the physical sciences\\". - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - Vulgar Latin or Sermo Vulgaris (\\"common speech\\") is a generic term for the \\"nonstandard\\" (as opposed to \\"classical\\") sociolects of Latin from which the Romance languages developed. Works written in Latin during classical times used Classical Latin rather than Vulgar Latin, with very few exceptions (most notably sections of Gaius Petronius' \\"Satyricon\\"). Because of its nonstandard nature, Vulgar Latin had no official orthography. Vulgar Latin is sometimes also called colloquial Latin, or Common Romance (particularly in the late stage). In Renaissance Latin, Vulgar Latin was called \\"vulgare Latinum\\" or \\"Latinum vulgare.\\" - North is a noun, adjective, or adverb indicating direction or geography. North is one of the four cardinal directions or compass points. It is the opposite of south and is perpendicular to east and west. - In elementary geometry, the property of being perpendicular (perpendicularity) is the relationship between two lines which meet at a right angle (90 degrees). The property extends to other related geometric objects. - The Romance languages (sometimes called the Romanic languages, Latin languages, or Neo-Latin languages) are the modern languages that evolved from Vulgar Latin between the sixth and ninth centuries and that thus form a branch of the Italic languages within the Indo-European language family. - A noun (from Latin \\"nmen\\", literally meaning \\"name\\") is a word that functions as the name of some specific thing or set of things, such as living creatures, objects, places, actions, qualities, states of existence, or ideas. Linguistically, a noun is a member of a large, open part of speech whose members can occur as the main word in the subject of a clause, the object of a verb, or the object of a preposition. - The four cardinal directions or cardinal points are the directions of north, east, south, and west, commonly denoted by their initials: N, E, S, W. East and west are at right angles to north and south, with east being in the clockwise direction of rotation from north and west being directly opposite east. Intermediate points between the four cardinal directions form the points of the compass. The intermediate (intercardinal, or ordinal) directions are northeast (NE), southeast (SE), southwest (SW), and northwest (NW). Further, the intermediate direction of every set of intercardinal and cardinal direction is called a secondary-intercardinal direction, the eight shortest points in the compass rose to the right, i.e. NNE, ENE, ESE, and so on. - In linguistics, an adjective (abbreviated ) is a describing word, the main syntactic role of which is to qualify a noun or noun phrase, giving more information about the object signified. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.

Early maps of North America often refer to the northern - and northwestern-most unexplored areas of the continent as at the \`\` Septentrional '' and as \`\` America Septentrionalis '' , sometimes with slightly varying spellings . Moreover , the term septentrional , is the adjectival form of the Latin noun septentrion , which refers to the seven stars of the Big Dipper asterism , the Septentrion . - An adverb is a word that modifies a verb, adjective, another adverb, determiner, noun phrase, clause, or sentence. Adverbs typically express manner, place, time, frequency, degree, level of certainty, etc., answering questions such as \\"how?\\", \\"in what way?\\", \\"when?\\", \\"where?\\", and \\"to what extent?\\".

Doménikos Theotokópoulos (Greek: Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος [ðoˈminikos θeotoˈkopulos]; October 1541 – 7 April 1614), most widely known as El Greco (\\"The Greek\\"), was a Greek painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. \\"El Greco\\" was a nickname, a reference to his Greek origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters, Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος, Doménikos Theotokópoulos, often adding the word Κρής Krēs, Cretan. El Greco was born in the Kingdom of Candia, which was at that time part of the Republic of Venice, and the center of Post-Byzantine art. He trained and became a master within that tradition before traveling at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings. El Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical pigmentation, marrying Byzantine traditions with those of Western painting.

While docking and bobbing are more commonly used to refer to removal of the tail, the term cropping is used in reference to the ears. Tail docking occurs in one of two ways. The first involves constricting the blood supply to the tail with a rubber ligature for a few days until the tail falls off.

Walking through my neighborhood on a fall afternoon reminds me of a time not too long ago when sounds of children filled the air, children playing games on a hill, and throwing leaves around in the street below. I was one of those children, carefree and happy. I live on a street that is only one block long. I have lived on the same street for sixteen years. I love my street. One side has six houses on it, and the other has only two houses, with a small hill in the middle and a huge cottonwood tree on one end. When I think of home, I think of my street. Only I see it as it was before. Unfortunately things change. One day, not long ago, I looked around and saw how different everything has become. Life on my street will never be the same because neighbors are quickly grown old, friends are growing up and leaving, and the city is planning to destroy my precious hill and sell the property to contractors. It is hard for me to accept that many of my wonderful neighbors are growing old and won't be around much longer. I have fond memories of the couple across the street, who sat together on their porch swing almost every evening, the widow next door who yelled at my brother and me for being too loud, and the crazy old man in a black suit who drove an old car. In contrast to those people, the people I see today are very old neighbors who have seen better days. The man in the black suit says he wants to die, and another neighbor just sold his house and moved into a nursing home.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Italy and Greece attended the World Ecological Conference. they were looking for solutions to improve their environment. Italy's air was very polluted, while Greece had problems with drought. But I can use this background: One result of air pollution is acid rain. Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust. What is an answer for this question: Which country had less acid precipitation fall in forests? A:","completion":"Based on the provided information, the country that had less acid precipitation fall in forests would likely be Greece. Here's the reasoning: 1. The premise states that Italy's air was very polluted, implying a potentially high concentration of sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides – substances known to cause acid rain. These chemical compounds are released from coal-fired power plants and motor vehicle exhaust, which are common sources of air pollution. 2. On the other hand, Greece's main environmental problem was the drought, not air pollution. Drought conditions often result in less precipitation in general. Moreover, there was no mention of significant air pollution that might lead to acid rain. 3. The connection between air pollution and acid rain means it's likely that Italy would have more acid rain falling on its forests than Greece, given Greece's drier conditions and presumable lower levels of air pollution. So, based on this reasoning, Greece likely had less acid precipitation falling in forests than Italy. Nonetheless, it's important to note that real-world measurements would be needed to confirm this assumption."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The Biba boutiques were at the heart of swinging London and at one time had the highest turnover of any British retail company. Who founded and ran Biba????","completion":"Biba was founded and run by Barbara Hulanicki and her husband, Stephen Fitz-Simon. Barbara Hulanicki, a Polish-born British fashion designer, was the creative force behind the brand, while Stephen Fitz-Simon, an English entrepreneur, managed the business side of the company. Together, they revolutionized fashion retail in London and beyond during the 1960s and 1970s, turning Biba into a destination store and a symbol of the era's fashion, style, and culture. Barbara Hulanicki was born in Warsaw, Poland, in 1936 and later moved to the United Kingdom, where she studied fashion at Brighton College of Art. Before starting Biba, Hulanicki worked as a freelance fashion illustrator for various publications, including Vogue, Women's Wear Daily, and The Times. Her unique artistic talent and innate ability for fashion trends laid the groundwork for her future success with Biba. In 1964, Barbara and Stephen launched Biba as a mail-order business, aiming to make high fashion accessible to the masses at affordable prices. Their initial offering was a simple, yet fashionable, pink gingham dress, which became a hit overnight when it was featured in the Daily Mirror. This success prompted the duo to open their first boutique in Abingdon Road, Kensington, London, in September 1964. Biba's flagship store quickly became a popular destination for fashion-conscious Londoners, offering unique and stylish clothing that attracted celebrities, socialites, and the general public alike. With its affordable prices, eclectic and diverse designs that were heavily influenced by Art Nouveau, Art Deco, and Victorian styles, Biba made a name for itself and became a symbol of the Swinging Sixties fashion scene. As its popularity grew, Biba expanded its product range to include not only clothing but also accessories, cosmetics, homeware, and even food. The boutique moved several times to accommodate the ever-growing clientele, eventually landing at the iconic seven-story Big Biba store on High Street Kensington in 1973. This store boasted an array of amenities, such as a beauty salon, a bookshop, a food market, and the legendary Rainbow Room, a live music venue and restaurant designed to emulate an ocean liner's dining hall. Over time, Biba was not just a fashion pioneer but also became a crucial hub for countercultural expression in the 1960s and 1970s. It served as a meeting place for the era's most influential artists, musicians, and trendsetters, including David Bowie, Twiggy, Mary Quant, Mick Jagger, and Marianne Faithfull. These connections to the world of fashion, music, and art reinforced the brand's prominence in the British cultural landscape. Unfortunately, in the mid-1970s, financial difficulties and disagreements among the company's shareholders led to the closure of the iconic Big Biba store in 1975, effectively signaling the end of the Biba era. Despite this, Barbara Hulanicki and Biba remain key figures in the history of British fashion, having left an enduring impact on the design and retail landscape that continues to be felt today."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

She also told Bristol Crown Court Mr Matthews was \\"a bit controlling\\" of Ms Hoare and \\"jealous of her speaking to other men\\". Nathan Matthews, 28, and his girlfriend Shauna Hoare, 21, deny murder. The dismembered body of 16-year-old Becky was found in a shed in March. The woman, who was visibly upset as she gave evidence, told the court she had known Ms Hoare since 2010 and had met Mr Matthews through her. She said she thought Mr Matthews could be \\"paranoid\\" and added: \\"I think he was jealous of her speaking to other men.\\" The woman told jurors she became involved with the liaisons with the defendants after splitting with her boyfriend. \\"At the beginning of 2014. A threesome, two occasions I think, over a month or two,\\" she said. \\"It started as a joke when I was with my partner because I was spending a lot of time with them. He would joke I was having a threesome, but I would laugh it off because it was ridiculous. \\"By 2014, it came up in general conversation.\\" She told the court she had been on holiday to Butlins in Minehead in August 2014 with Ms Hoare, Mr Matthews, Becky, Becky's father Darren Galsworthy and stepmother Anjie - Mr Matthews' mother. She said they appeared to be \\"just a normal family\\". 'False start cuts' The court has also heard from Professor Sarah Hainsworth, an expert in materials and forensic engineering. She demonstrated a duplicate version of the circular power saw recovered from the shed where Becky's body parts were found, to show how loud it was. Jurors were also handed the saw to see how heavy it was. Mr Matthews has admitted using the saw to dismember Becky's body. Prof Hainsworth said it \\"would be easier to conduct a dismemberment such as the one I have seen if more than one person were involved\\". However, she said the lack of \\"false start cuts\\" could mean \\"the person sawing was very careful and methodical\\". 'Nooks and crannies' The court then heard from forensics expert Claire Morse who said it was \\"extremely surprising\\" none of Becky Watts' DNA was found in the bathroom where her body was allegedly dismembered. The bathroom at 14 Cotton Mill Lane, home to Mr Matthews and Ms Hoare, was searched several times for blood. Ms Morse said that did not mean the body could not have been cut up there, if sheeting was used. But she said it is \\"a difficult thing to clean up and get out of all the nooks and crannies\\". Mr Matthews, 28, of Hazelbury Drive, south Gloucestershire, admits killing his stepsister but denies murder and conspiring to kidnap her. He also admits perverting the course of justice, preventing Becky's burial and possessing a prohibited weapon. Miss Hoare, 21, of Cotton Mill Lane, Bristol, denies murder and conspiracy to kidnap, the weapons charge, perverting the course of justice and preventing a burial. Two other men, Donovan Demetrius, 29, and James Ireland, 23, deny assisting an offender. The trial continues. Summary:","completion":"A woman testified in Bristol Crown Court that she had consensual threesomes with Nathan Matthews and Shauna Hoare, who are on trial for the murder of 16-year-old Becky Watts. The woman described Matthews as controlling and jealous of Hoare speaking to other men.

On the other hand, the question asked about the origin of the name for the \\"Volcker Rule.\\" Let me provide a detailed answer to this question. The \\"Volcker Rule\\" is named after Paul Volcker, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve, who served from 1979 to 1987. This regulation was proposed as a response to the financial crisis of 2007-2008. The suggestion for the rule came from Paul Volcker himself, and it gained prominence due to his support and advocacy. The Volcker Rule is part of the larger Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, legislated and signed into law by President Barack Obama in July 2010. The Volcker Rule, in particular, aims to prevent banks from engaging in speculative investments that could pose significant risks to both the banks and the overall financial system. The primary goal of the rule is to separate proprietary trading and investment activities from banks' commercial operations - which include customer deposits and loans. In essence, the Volcker Rule seeks to prevent commercial banks from using their customers' deposits for risky investments. By enforcing this separation, the regulation reduces the likelihood of future financial crises by mitigating systemic risk and promoting financial stability. In summary, the given sentence does not answer the question about the origin of the name for the \\"Volcker Rule,\\" but instead, it describes several aspects of financial reforms aimed at addressing critical issues in the banking and financial sectors. The Volcker Rule is named after Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, who advocated for and supported the implementation of this regulatory measure."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Spanish:","completion":"Para mejorar la calidad de recepción de fax, limite la tasa máxima de recepción a 4800 bps en la pestaña Fax - Límites de tasa. Step-by-step explanation and justification of the translation: 1. \\"To improve fax reception quality\\" was translated to \\"Para mejorar la calidad de recepción de fax\\". This was done by beginning with \\"Para\\" to imply intent, and then using the infinitive form of \\"mejorar\\" for \\"to improve\\". The term \\"fax reception quality\\" was translated to \\"calidad de recepción de fax\\", maintaining the correct order of the words in Spanish. 2. \\"Limit the maximum reception rate\\" was translated to \\"limite la tasa máxima de recepción\\". The term \\"limit\\" was translated into the verb \\"limite\\", which is the command form of \\"limitar\\" to instruct the user. \\"Maximum reception rate\\" was translated as \\"tasa máxima de recepción\\", which is the noun form and maintains the correct word order in Spanish. 3. \\"To 4800 bps\\" was translated to \\"a 4800 bps\\". The preposition \\"to\\" simply becomes \\"a\\" in Spanish for this context. 4. \\"Under the Fax - Rate Limits tab\\" was translated to \\"en la pestaña Fax - Límites de tasa\\". The term \\"under\\" was translated to \\"en\\" to indicate the location of the desired setting. For the tab's title, \\"Fax - Rate Limits\\" was translated directly to \\"Fax - Límites de tasa\\" to maintain consistency with the original. \\"Tab\\" was translated to \\"pestaña\\", which is the most commonly used word for a tab in computing environments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Goal: large tarp Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","completion":"Without specific methods listed, I am unable to provide a direct comparison or choose one method over another. However, I can offer some advice and steps to reach your goal of obtaining a large tarp effectively, efficiently, and within your budget. Before implementing any method, go through these steps that will help you understand which method would be appropriate: 1. Define the purpose and requirements: Determine the specific reason why you require a large tarp, which will help clarifying the necessary features such as size, color, material, waterproof vs. non-waterproof, and additional features like grommets, UV protection, and reinforcement. 2. Set a budget: Establish the amount of money you are willing to spend on a large tarp. Tarps can range from very cheap to expensive depending on the material, durability, and size. 3. Research materials and quality: Familiarize yourself with common tarp materials such as polyethylene, canvas, vinyl, and mesh. Each material has its advantages and disadvantages and might be more suitable for specific uses. Once these initial steps are complete, you can now delve into potential methods for obtaining a large tarp: Method A: Purchase from a local store Pros: - Immediate availability. - Ability to inspect the tarp physically before purchasing. - Personal assistance from sales representatives. Cons: - Limited options and stocks. - Potentially higher prices due to local overhead costs. Method B: Purchase from an online retailer Pros: - Greater variety of options, materials, and sizes. - Competitive prices due to lower overhead costs. - Possibility of customer reviews, allowing for more informed decisions. Cons: - Inability to see and touch the tarp before purchasing. - Potential shipping costs. - Waiting time for delivery. Method C: DIY (Do it yourself) Pros: - Customizable to your requirements. - Potential cost reduction if you already possess suitable materials. Cons: - Time-consuming. - Requires appropriate skills and tools. - Potential lack of durability. After reviewing these possible methods, consider the specific context of your situation and your criteria from steps 1 to 3. This will help you in choosing the most suitable method for obtaining a large tarp. For example, if you need the tarp urgently, Method A might be reasonable given the immediate availability. If budget and variety are your primary concerns, Method B may work best. If customization and a hands-on approach are your top priorities, Method C might be the most reasonable method for you."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

When localising, follow these rules - (1) General names and concepts can be translated (2) Domain specific names can just be transliterated (3) Localised phrases can have both partial translated and transliterated parts (4) But only partial translation or only partial transliteration is not allowed (5) Copy special characters and numbers as is Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Are you sure you want to remove the program \` %1 '? Student:","completion":"Part #1: Translation of general names and concepts. Usage: You have to translate the English phrase into Telugu, taking into account the cultural variations. For example, the word \\"remove\\" can be translated into Telugu as \\"తొలగించు\\" which implies the same action in Telugu culture. Part #2: Transliteration of domain-specific names. Usage: Domain names or technical terminologies can be retained as they are in the original language but written in Telugu script. For example, the term \\"Program\\" can be written as \\"ప్రోగ్రామ్\\" in Telugu script. It still maintains its original pronunciation. Part #3: Localised phrases can have both transliteration and translation. Usage: A phrase can contain general names and domain-specific names. Therefore, the phrase \\"Are you sure you want to remove the program \` %1 '?\\" can localised into Telugu as: \\"మీరు నిజంగానే \` %1 ' ప్రోగ్రామ్ ను తొలగించాలనుకుంటున్నారా?\\" This mean the same in Telugu. Part #4: Prohibition of only partial translation or only partial transliteration. Usage: A localised phrase cannot be half-translated or half-transliterated. Considering the previous Telugu phrase: \\"మీరు నిజంగానే \` %1 ' ప్రోగ్రామ్ ను తొలగించాలనుకుంటున్నారా?\\" it contained both translation (for general names like \\"Are you sure, want to remove\\") and transliteration (for the domain-specific name \\"program\\").

Usage: In the Telugu phrase \\"మీరు నిజంగానే \` %1 ' ప్రోగ్రామ్ ను తొలగించాలనుకుంటున్నారా?\\" the placeholder \\"%1\\" and special character \\"\`\\" are copied as is from the original English phrase, that's why it complies with this rule."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They did the same thing a year earlier with \\"Detour\\" which is probably one of the finest low-budget films ever made. \\"Strangler\\" is basically a one set film, filled with mist and shadows, a technique used by most poverty row studios to hide the sets, or lack thereof. But here, it works well. The ghost of Charles Middleton (better known as Ming the Merciless) lurches around the swamp killing those involved in his wrongful execution for murder and generates some sympathy from the viewer. His final victim is to be the daughter of the ferryman.....he concentrates his wrath not only on those directly involved in his fate but their relatives as well. Rosemary LaPlanche does her usual imitation of someone in a coma that passes for her acting style. She offers herself up to the strangler in order to put a stop to the killing but as a sop to the audience, the strangler sees the goodness of her gesture as a sign that his mission is complete and he returns to the hereafter, somewhat chastened.

Well, I've got the details about different jobs and I'd like your opinion about which would be the best one to go for. F: Where are the jobs? M: One's in Munich, one's in Frankfurt and the other one's in Hamburg. F: Munich's supposed to be a very nice place. M: Yes it is, and it's also in a beautiful part of Germany, not far from the Alias. F: That would be great for the kids--they'd love to be able to go skiing at weekends! M: But, one problem with Munich is that it's growing very fast. That means the cost of living will probably be very high. F: It's a higher salary than the job in Frankfurt but lower than the one in Hamburg. The Hamburg job has the most responsibility. From the point of view of career progression that would probably be the best job for me. F: Hamburg's the closest to Britain, too, so it would be easy to come back for long weekends and holidays. M: That's right, and there's a regular ferry service which would save quite a bit on fares. F: What about the cost of living in Germany as a whole? How does it compare with Britain? M: Well, it's definitely higher than over here, but salaries are substantially higher, so we'd certainly be better off than we are now. F: And what about accommodation? M: Well, actually, flats are much cheaper to rent in towns like Munich, Frankfurt and Hamburg than they are here in London, so we'd be able to afford to live in a nice, spacious flat, I'd think. F: Mmm, that'd be nice! And do you know what the cultural facilities are like in these cities? M: In fact, they're quite good in all three. But, of course, Munich has an international reputation as a cultural center. F: Another thing we'll have to consider, of course, are the educational possibilities. How long would you want to go to Germany for? M: I think a maximum of five years. I think working overseas will be good for my career and, of course, it'd be a good experience for you and the kids, too! F: So we'd be there...

Shirer is almost prescient in his assessment of Hitler's actions and their consequences. It is unfortunate that he could not continue his reporting after 1940, because an account of this caliber of the years when Germany was at war with America, made from inside Germany, would have been a valuable historical record.

Question: \\"How does the warp occur?\\" Context: \\"Vinyl records can be warped by heat, improper storage, exposure to sunlight, or manufacturing defects such as excessively tight plastic shrinkwrap on the album cover. A small degree of warp was common, and allowing for it was part of the art of turntable and tonearm design. \\"wow\\" (once-per-revolution pitch variation) could result from warp, or from a spindle hole that was not precisely centered. Standard practice for LPs was to place the LP in a paper or plastic inner cover. This, if placed within the outer cardboard cover so that the opening was entirely within the outer cover, was said to reduce ingress of dust onto the record surface. Singles, with rare exceptions, had simple paper covers with no inner cover.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The warp in vinyl records occurs due to a combination of factors, such as heat, improper storage, exposure to sunlight, and manufacturing defects. When records are exposed to high temperatures or direct sunlight, the vinyl material may soften and lose its original shape, resulting in a warped surface. This is further exacerbated if the storage conditions are not optimal, like stacking records horizontally or placing them tightly together, which puts additional stress on the vinyl and can contribute to warping. Another factor causing warping could be manufacturing defects, such as an excessively tight plastic shrinkwrap on the album cover, which applies uneven pressure on the record and may lead to distortion over time. Additionally, imperfections in the spindle hole, which is not precisely centered, can cause \\"wow\\" or once-per-revolution pitch variation in the sound, further affecting the playback quality. To prevent or minimize warping, it is essential to use proper storage techniques and protect the vinyl records from harsh environmental conditions. Standard practice includes placing the LP in a paper or plastic inner cover and placing it within the outer cardboard cover in such a way that the opening is entirely inside the outer cover. This helps to reduce dust ingress onto the record surface and preserves its shape. Singles should also be stored in simple paper covers without an inner cover, except for rare exceptions. Following these storage guidelines can help maintain the quality and longevity of vinyl records."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The National Center for Educational Statistics (or NCES) reported that U.S. colleges and universities received more than 9 million applications between 2013 and 2014 and admitted more than 5 million students. But the problem is not in the number of students, a new report says. The report is called \\"Turning the Tide -- Making Caring Common.\\" The report argues that the process schools use to choose students causes major problems. David Hawkins is the Executive Director for Educational Content and Policy. He says that most colleges and universities require many things from students when they apply. Schools usually require an essay describing a student's interests or why they want to study at that school. The schools also ask for letters from teachers describing why a student is a good candidate. But, Hawkins says, schools are most concerned with a student's high school grades and standardized test results. The Education Conservancy is an organization that fights to make higher education equal and available. Lloyd Thacker is the Executive Director of the Education Conservancy, saying that the college admission process has changed a lot. \\"Over the past 30 years, college admissions have become more complex.\\" He says that ranking systems for colleges and universities are a big part of the problem. U.S. News and World Report is a media company that creates a list of what it calls \\"America's Best Colleges.\\" The company bases the list on information collected from colleges and universities across the country. This information includes results of standardized tests like the SAT from all of a school's students. Higher average test results help put schools higher on the list. Thacker claims, \\"Too many students are learning to do whatever it takes in order to get ahead, even if that means sacrificing their own individuality, their health, their happiness and behavior...\\" \\"The impact on students and on parents is that college is all about where you go. The rank has nothing to do with the quality of education that goes on at the college.\\" The Harvard report states that the best way to change the admission process is by changing college applications. 1.

Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. Now, I have a new situation: Bob's parents were in their early 60's. He sent them to the doctor's for a routine check up.

Answer the following question: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Dan decided to preserve some fruit and roots to see how long they last before they spoil. He also bought other fruit that he plans to eat fresh. He candied plums, pears, ginger and quince, and he ate fresh apples, oranges and mango. Which fruit have a higher sugar content candied ginger or fresh apples? Answer:","completion":"Candied ginger has a higher sugar content than fresh apples. Step 1: Understand the process of candying fruit Candying fruit involves placing the fruit in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from the fruit and preserves it through saturation with sugar. Step 2: Compare the sugar content between candied ginger and fresh apples Candied ginger is made by the process of candying, meaning it is saturated with sugar from the syrup, which significantly increases its sugar content. Fresh apples, on the other hand, are not subjected to this process and only contain natural sugars. Step 3: Conclude which fruit has a higher sugar content As candied ginger goes through the candying process that adds more sugar to it, it has a higher sugar content than fresh apples, which only contain natural sugars."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Supremacy Clause The Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution (Article VI, Clause 2) establishes that the Constitution, federal laws made pursuant to it, and treaties made under its authority, constitute the supreme law of the land. It provides that state courts are bound by the supreme law; in case of conflict between federal and state law, the federal law must be applied. Even state constitutions are subordinate to federal law. In essence, it is a conflict-of-laws rule specifying that certain federal acts take priority over any state acts that conflict with federal law. In this respect, the Supremacy Clause follows the lead of Article XIII of the Articles of Confederation, which provided that \`\`Every State shall abide by the determination of the United States in Congress Assembled, on all questions which by this confederation are submitted to them.'' A constitutional provision announcing the supremacy of federal law, the Supremacy Clause assumes the underlying priority of federal authority, at least when that authority is expressed in the Constitution itself.

When the Supreme Court makes a ruling, it is interpreting and applying the Constitution, so all states must respect and follow that decision.

After the American Revolutionary War, Richmond emerged as an important industrial center. To facilitate the transfer of cargo from the flat-bottomed bateaux above the fall line to the ocean-faring ships below, George Washington helped design the James River and Kanawha Canal in the 18th century to bypass Richmond's rapids, with the intent of providing a water route across the Appalachians to the Kanawha River. The legacy of the canal boatmen is represented by the figure in the center of the city flag. As a result of this and ample access to hydropower due to the falls, Richmond became home to some of the largest manufacturing facilities in the country, including iron works and flour mills, the largest facilities of their kind in the South. The resistance to the slave trade was growing by the mid-nineteenth century; in one famous case in 1848, Henry \\"Box\\" Brown made history by having himself nailed into a small box and shipped from Richmond to abolitionists in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, escaping slavery. To where was the canal designed by Washington intended to ferry water?","completion":"The canal designed by George Washington, the James River and Kanawha Canal, was intended to ferry water across the Appalachians to the Kanawha River."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:What is the missing first step of the following process: - The liver produces bile - The liver produces proteins for blood plasma - The liver converts excess glucose into glycogen for storage - The liver converts ammonia to urea - The liver regulates blood clotting. A:","completion":"A: The missing first step of the following process is \\"Blood filtration by the liver\\": 1. Blood filtration by the liver: The liver receives blood from the portal vein, which carries nutrient-rich blood from the intestines, and the hepatic artery, which carries oxygenated blood from the heart. Liver cells, called hepatocytes, filter out and process toxins, waste products, and nutrients in the blood, effectively detoxifying the bloodstream. This is an essential process that contributes to overall body function and maintaining stable internal conditions. 2. The liver produces bile: One of the byproducts of blood filtration is bile, a greenish-yellow substance that helps digest fats. Bile salts break down large fat globules into smaller droplets, which can be more easily absorbed by the intestinal lining. Bile is stored in the gallbladder and released into the small intestine in response to food consumption. 3. The liver produces proteins for blood plasma: The liver synthesizes various types of proteins, which are essential components of blood plasma. These proteins serve different purposes, such as albumin, which regulates osmotic pressure in blood vessels and helps transport substances like hormones, drugs, and fatty acids. Furthermore, the liver produces clotting factors that help prevent excessive bleeding. 4. The liver converts excess glucose into glycogen for storage: The liver plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism. After a meal, blood sugar levels rise, and the liver may convert the excess glucose into glycogen for storage. When glucose levels are low, such as during fasting or prolonged physical activity, the liver breaks down glycogen and releases glucose back into the bloodstream, ensuring a stable energy supply for the body. 5. The liver converts ammonia to urea: Ammonia, a waste product resulting from the breakdown of proteins, is toxic if not quickly eliminated. The liver plays a vital role in detoxifying ammonia by converting it to urea, a less harmful compound that can be excreted in urine. This process is essential for maintaining a healthy internal environment. 6. The liver regulates blood clotting: The liver synthesizes multiple clotting factors, proteins involved in the formation of blood clots. These clotting factors help maintain the balance between clot formation and clot dissolution, preventing excessive bleeding and unnecessary clot formation (thrombosis). Disorders affecting the liver and its ability to produce these clotting factors can raise the risk of excessive bleeding or clotting. In summary, the liver is a vital organ that performs various critical functions, including blood filtration, bile production, protein synthesis, glucose metabolism, ammonia detoxification, and blood clotting regulation. Each of these functions is a crucial step in maintaining stable and healthy internal conditions for the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: Beneath Hill 60 Context: As seen in flashbacks that occur throughout the film, Oliver Woodward is an Australian miner supplying copper for the war effort. He falls in love with Marjorie Waddell, a young woman ten years his junior. However, he is under constant pressure to enlist, especially from Waddell's father. He has the opportunity to do so when the British Army forms the 1st Australian Tunnelling Company to supplement the Royal Engineers; Woodward is commissioned to lead the unit. On the Western Front, Woodward meets Frank Tiffin, a young Australian soldier who is suffering from shell shock. Woodward reassigns Tom Dwyer and Norman Morris to relieve Tiffin. Two German tunnelers break through into the tunnel. Morris and Dwyer dispatch both of them, but Dwyer is killed when a German explosive goes off, bringing down the tunnel on top of them; Morris is rescued by the other sappers. Woodward is later tasked with destroying the Red House, a fortified German position raining enfilade fire down upon the frontmost section of the British trenches. Although Woodward initially proposed tunneling beneath the Red House, his commanding officer, Colonel Wilson Rutledge, insisted that it be done by dawn. Along with Corporal Bill Fraser and Morris, Woodward crosses No Man's Land. They manage to reach the Red House and plant explosives underneath it. However, as they make their way back to the British lines, they discover that the reel of cable is too short, so Morris runs ahead to retrieve the exploder. While they wait, they discover mortally wounded Lieutenant Robert Clayton, who had been ordered to cut a gap in the wire obstacle for them. Morris arrives with the exploder and they destroy the Red House. The next day, after a friendly game of rugby league against some British soldiers, Woodward is promoted to captain and he subsequently promotes Fraser to Sergeant, he later receives word that they are to be moved up the lines to the Ypres Salient.

Options: *Because he had full custody; *Because her mother was nowhere to be found; *not enough information; *Because he dated and married another woman; Q: One summer when I was 8 years old my father, mother, and I were rear ended by a 16 year old boy in a pickup truck. Insurance companies dawdled and by the time we received a settlement over a year later my parents had divorced. I was under full custody of my father living in a trailer in very rural Tennessee (Wayne County) with no electricity and a wood burning stove for heat. My mother was nowhere to be found until a few years later. We received the settlement and it turned out to be several thousand dollars. My dad turned on the electricity and bought our first computer, a Packard Bell. Now we needed dial up internet! -My what a change! Then he started dating online. He met a woman who lived in Franklin, TN (Williamson County), dated and married her (at least for a few years), worked at CompUSA for a few years, then started his own computer repair business which he and I ran from 2001 to 2014 before selling it.

However, once you have developed the habit of seeing your professor during their office hours, you may come and just talk for a while about any other topic, not related with school. By this time, they will probably realize you are interested in them. Familiarity can lead to fondness. Simply getting in face time with your professor can lead to them developing feelings. Try to arrive to your classroom or lecture hall a few minutes early, and make it a point to greet your professor with a smile. Say hello, ask them how their day is going, discuss an aspect of the class, whatever! Just make time to talk to them one-on-one. They will appreciate your friendly and outgoing nature. Ask them with a question about class or about a homework assignment. Share your thoughts on an interesting discussion brought up during class. Send them a link to an article that you think they would find interesting. Just do anything to make yourself stand out, and find reasons to start a dialogue. In your e-mails, stay professional, but a little bit playful. If you're sending an e-mail at night or during a day off, think of a witty way to justify this. If your professor uses smileys, include a winky face too. Every professor's boundaries in correspondence are different, and you have to figure out the best way of writing to your teacher. You don't want to be just another student who sends them boring e-mails every other day. Even if you want to talk to them every day, limit your correspondence unless it’s absolutely clear that your professor wants to speak that much as well. If you overdo it, you will be a nuisance.","completion":"The article encourages students to attend professors' office hours, build rapport through conversations and thoughtful gestures, and communicate professionally with a hint of playfulness, in order to stand out and develop a closer bond with their professors."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I love a big, tasty burger, so I ordered a \\"Six Dollar Burger\\" in the Guacamole Bacon variety, with Onion Rings & a Chocolate Malt to go with it. The way they have the pricing structured here is that if you want Onion Rings instead of Fries, and/or if you want a shake or malt instead of a soda, there is no Combo discount at all... they ring everything up ala carte. That made this lunch EXPENSIVE at just under 12.00 by the time it was over. It had better be good! The dining room has a few booths as well as tables, but both the floor plan and the decor are pretty awful. There was only one booth in the whole place that I would have called a somewhat comfortable place to sit, & the one other customer was sitting in it, of course. Also, there was no escaping the two TVs. The bathroom didn't have any paper towels, only one of those stupid air blowers, so I dried my hands with half a dozen ass gaskets, used them to pull the door handle, & then threw them on the floor, since there wasn't a waste basket anywhere in the room. Back at the table with my food, both the Chocolate Malt and the Onion Rings were ok, not great. Then the burger, which I expected to be delicious given the price and ingredients, was BLAH! Both the bacon and the cheese were thinner than paper-thin, and the supposedly Angus burger patty wasn't tasty at all. Could it be that this franchisee is sneaking in cheap beef? Just a thought. In any case, this burger was a real dud for the money... nowhere near as good as what you get at Smashburger, Five Guys, or any number of other places.

When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease.

Article: At a primary school in a small town in the east of South Carolina, second-grade teachers Carneau and Lynne are convinced that separating primary boys and girls produces immediate academic improvement in both genders David Chadwell, South Carolina's coordinator of single gender education says, \\" Boys and girls learn,hear and respond to their surroundings differently. We can teach boys and girls based on what we now know.\\" Male and female eyes are not organized in the same way,he explains. The composition of the male eye makes it sensitive to motion and direction. \\" Boys interpret the world as objects moving through space,\\" he says. The male eye is also drawn to cooler color1s like silver and black. It's no accident that boys tend to create pictures of moving objects instead of drawing the happy color1ful family,as girls do in class. The female eye,on the other hand,is drawn to warmer color1s like red, yellow and orange. To attract girls, Chadwell says, the teacher doesn't need to move as much as in boys' class. Using descriptive phrases and lots of color1s in presentations or on the blackboard gets their attention. Boys and girls also hear differently. \\" When someone speaks in a loud tone,girls interpret it as yelling, \\" says Chadwell. \\" They think you're mad and can shut down. \\" Girls are more sensitive to sounds. He advises girls' teachers to watch the tone of their voices. Boys' teachers should sound more forceful, even excited. A boy's nervous system causes him to be more cautious when he is standing, moving, and the room temperature is around 6.Stress in boys,he says, tends to increase blood flow to their brains, a process that helps them stay focused. Girls are more focused when they are seated in a warmer room around 75degF. Girls also respond to stress differently. When exposed to threat and conflict, blood goes to their guts ,leaving them feeling nervous or anxious. These differences can be applied in the classroom, Chadwell adds. \\" Single gender programs are about maximizing the learning.\\" Question: Which of the students is most likely to stay focused?

Candidates to profession were tested to reveal whether they were actually married women who had merely separated from their husbands. Their intellectual abilities were also tested. Nuns were to be silent in places of prayer, the cloister, the dormitory, and refectory. Silence was maintained unless the prioress granted an exception for a specific cause.

In which layer of the Sun does nuclear fusion occur?","completion":"To find the answer to this question, I need to research and gather information about the Sun and its layers. Here's how I'll proceed: 1. I will briefly research the layers of the Sun. This will help me understand its structure and identify the layer where nuclear fusion occurs. 2. I will find reliable sources of information, such as scientific websites and articles, that explain in detail the processes happening within the different layers of the Sun. 3. Once I've gathered that information, I will identify the layer where nuclear fusion occurs and provide the answer to the question. Step 1: Based on preliminary knowledge, the Sun is composed of several layers, including the core, the radiative zone, the convective zone, the photosphere, the chromosphere, and the corona. Step 2: I will now examine these layers and their processes. Upon quickly consulting reliable sources (like NASA's website and various educational resources), I found out that: - The core is the innermost layer of the Sun, where temperatures and pressures are extremely high. This is where nuclear reactions take place. - The radiative zone is the layer surrounding the core, where energy is primarily transported via radiation. - The convective zone is the outermost layer of the Sun's interior, where energy is transported through convection currents. - The photosphere, chromosphere, and corona are considered the Sun's atmosphere, and they don't play a direct role in the process of nuclear fusion. Step 3: Based on this information, nuclear fusion occurs in the core of the Sun. This is because the extremely high temperatures and pressures found in the core facilitate the fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium, which releases a tremendous amount of energy in the form of light and heat. Answer: Nuclear fusion occurs in the core of the Sun."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Answer:","completion":"It is not entirely accurate to validate that answer, as the connection between the song and the movie title only appears to be a coincidence. To provide a better understanding, let's delve into the song's history and lyrics, and the film's origin. \\"Moody's Mood for Love\\" is a song originally performed by James Moody with vocals by Eddie Jefferson. The song itself was an improvisational jazz saxophone piece inspired by the chords and melody from the standard \\"I'm in the Mood for Love.\\" Eddie Jefferson later added lyrics to Moody's improvised saxophone solo, which became known as \\"Moody's Mood for Love.\\" The song captures the feeling of being completely enamored and infatuated with someone, describing how the emotions spark and intensify as two people fall in love. The lyrics convey the depth and warmth of this love, as the singer expresses their willingness to commit to this relationship wholeheartedly. On the other hand, Wong Kar Wai's movie \\"In the Mood for Love\\" is a Hong Kong film released in 2000, starring Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung. The story revolves around two neighbors who form a strong bond over their shared suspicions of their spouses' infidelities. The film is celebrated for its atmospheric visuals, compelling story, and subtle exploration of unrequited love, longing, and the societal norms that keep the protagonists from acting on their feelings. While the film features several songs from the era in which it is set, the movie and the song \\"Moody's Mood for Love\\" do not have a direct connection beyond sharing a similar sentiment in their titles. The movie's English title, \\"In the Mood for Love,\\" more directly references the song \\"I'm in the Mood for Love,\\" which the James Moody version was initially based on. In conclusion, it would not be accurate to validate the answer provided, as the mentioned connection appears to be coincidental. Instead, it would be more suitable to analyze the song's history, lyrics, and the film separately to understand the unique meanings behind each creative work."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more. A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life. A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care. When your daily schedule is crammed to overflowing one of the first areas of neglect is your diet. Eating regular, nutritious meals become a thing of the past. You are not only too busy to sleep or even take a deep breath now and then, there is no time to prepare decent meals Convenience foods, frozen dinners, take out and fast foods become the norm. It is a steady diet of additive filled, sugar and fat-filled dishes, loaded with empty calories that provide minimal nutrition and damage the body. It is impossible to sustain any level of good health on such a diet. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

They have a rough family life","completion":"People lead frenetic lifestyles primarily due to the desire to juggle multiple responsibilities and achieve a sense of accomplishment. This constant drive to take on more challenges and be successful can result in the initial goal of working less and enjoying life more being lost, as the individual continues to push themselves in various aspects of their life. As a result, this high-pressure lifestyle can inadvertently lead to self-negligence, with detrimental effects on one's physical, mental, and emotional well-being.

It was the first time that Easter Islanders had met people from the outside world. The strangers were about to discover something very strange themselves --that they were on an island with hundreds of huge stone statues . The Dutch explorers wondered where the Islanders had come from and why and how they had built the statues. Now science is putting together the story. The first people to arrive on the island came there around A.D. 700. The society that developed there was based on fishing and farming to feed the population, which grew to 12,000. Its success showed itself in a way that has become the island's trademark : hundreds of huge stone figures --the moai. None of the moai was standing when scientists first arrived. People put them back up later; but how had a Stone Age society ever made, moved and set them up there in the first place? And why? There are nearly 900 moai on Easter Island, and while the questions about them remain unanswered, no one doubts the years of effort that must have gone into making them. The real killer of the Easter Islanders came from across the ocean. After 1722, it became popular for explorers to visit Easter Island, bringing diseases. The final blow came in 1862, when slave traders came from Peru and took away 1,500 people, one-third of the population. Question: When the first explorers arrived on the island, they _ . Answer: Select from the following. I. were frightened by the huge stone statues. II. were surprised by what they saw. III. set many of the moai on the island upright. IV. fished and farmed. The answer is:","completion":"II. were surprised by what they saw. When the Dutch explorers arrived on Easter Island in 1722, they discovered something very strange -- an island with hundreds of huge stone statues, known as the moai. This encounter with an unknown civilization and its unique monumental artifacts would indeed have been a surprise for the explorers. They surely had many questions about the origins of the Islanders and the methods they used to create and erect these massive stone figures. This is described as the first time that the Islanders had met people from the outside world, which infers that the common global knowledge of the island was non-existent prior to this. However, the text does not indicate that the explorers were frightened by the statues (Option I), so this cannot be confirmed. As for option III, it states that none of the moai were standing when scientists first arrived and that people put them back up later. However, it does not specify that these people were the first explorers, hence not enough evidence to confirm this statement. Finally, option IV, fished and farmed, was what the original inhabitants of the island, not the explorers, did for their sustenance, so this option is not applicable."},{"prompt":"What is the first name of the person who tells Lettie that an artist can't be burdened with a wife?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Who was George C. Scott? George C. Scott was a renowned actor. Practically any movie that he's been in is the better off for it. Now ol' George had absolutely NOTHING to do with this movie..., but he once said something that describes said movie to a T. I don't recall his exact words, but he basically said that Great Writing can Save Bad Acting, But Great Acting CanNOT save Bad Writing. Never has this little observation been truer than in \\"The All New Adventures of Laurel & Hardy: For Love or Mummy\\". The casting of the two leads was absolutely perfect. Bronson Pinchot (Laurel) and Gailard Sartain (Hardy) not only look the parts, but they do an exceptionally good job at mimicking the real deal (mannerisms and all). This movie should stand as a lasting testament to their talents. That said, this movie falls flat on its face when it comes to (you guessed it) WRITING. Aside from the opening dialogue between Pinchot and Sartain (which was very \\"in character\\") and a brief gag involving a taxi, this movie is an absolute chore to sit through. PROBLEM # 1: Too much time and effort went into the plot. I don't want to know why the mummy wants to kidnap the pretty British lady. What I WANT is to see Stan and Ollie (or at least, their stand-ins). Way too much screen time was devoted to explaining the plot or to the not-very-funny secondary characters that said plot revolved around. However, even if this movie had been all jokes, that would still leave us with... ...PROBLEM # 2: Most of the jokes are what I would call \\"watered-down\\" slapstick. What do I mean by \\"watered down\\"? In slapstick, a character gets hurt in an exaggerated way for comedic effect (ala Looney Tunes, 3 Stooges...,or how about Laurel & Hardy?). In \\"watered-down\\" slapstick (as I define it), a character gets mildly hurt or inconvenienced, and the filmmakers play that up for comedic effect. Maybe an illustration would help: In Looney Tunes, Daffy Duck gets shot by Elmer Fudd. His bill falls off and he puts it back on. That is classic slapstick. In this \\"gem\\", Ollie accidentally bumps into some people. They turn around, tell him to be careful, and continue on their merry way. That's not slapstick. That's not even funny. That's just...boring...and this movie is full of these kinds of jokes. It's as though they're this movie's bread and butter. The writers and directors just take these dull moments and act like they're supposed to be funny. Granted, the example I just gave is the most extreme case, but I can only cut it so much slack. Long story short: The film just doesn't work because the script fails to capitalize on Pinchot's and Sartain's abilities to impersonate Stan and Ollie. Instead, the script capitalizes on plot exposition and lame jokes. Watching this movie is basically watching two excellent impersonators who were given no real material to work with.

In the United States, the verdict in criminal cases must be unanimous. A non-unanimous verdict results in a hung jury which in turn forces a mistrial. The question they are deciding is whether the defendant, a teenaged boy from a city slum, murdered his father. The jury is further instructed that a guilty verdict will be accompanied by a mandatory death sentence. Under current American criminal law, a defendant must first be found guilty, and then the jury in the sentencing phase must find an aggravating circumstance and unanimously agree to recommend the death penalty, if the state has the death penalty.[citation needed] The jury of twelve retires to the jury room, where they begin to become acquainted with their personalities and discuss the case. The story revolves around their difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict, mainly because of the personal prejudices of several of the jurors. An initial vote is taken and eleven of the jurors vote for conviction. Juror number 8, the lone dissenter, states that the evidence presented is circumstantial and the boy deserves a fair deliberation, upon which he questions the accuracy and reliability of the only two witnesses to the murder, the fact that the knife used in the murder is not as unusual as the testimony indicates (he produces an identical one from his pocket), and the overall shady circumstances.

Paragraph: Expansion quickly peaked however, and the European powers who had carved up the New World set about testing each other in dynastic conflicts and colonial rivalry. The English were the main rivals of the Dutch on the high seas, and there were several wars between the two in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1665–1667 the Dutch sailed up the River Medway and sank the British fleet moored there. The 18th century saw Amsterdam grow into the foremost financial center in the world, but the seeds of decline had already been planted. When the English colonies in New England rose up in revolt against the British, they found ready Ailies in the Dutch. From their colonies in the Caribbean they sent caches of arms and ammunition. The British were furious and went to war in 1780, destroying the Dutch navy and signaling a sudden decline in power and influence from which the Netherlands never recovered. Trade suffered to such an extent that in 1791 the VOC went into liquidation. In the latter part of the century there were anti-Orange demonstrations by pro-French factions in the country, and in 1795 Napoleon Bonaparte took the Netherlands in his epic march across Europe. Under the yoke of another foreign power, and with trade at an all time low, the Golden Age was truly dead. The Return of the House of Orange Napoleon installed his brother Louis as King of Holland and he chose to take the fine Town Hall on Dam Square as his palace — now the Koninklijk Palace. But only four years later he fled the city after civil disturbances broke out when he raised taxes. When Napoleon's bubble burst and French power began to wane, William of Orange emerged from exile and was proclaimed king in 1813. Amsterdam had to work its way out of economic decline, but throughout the 19th century the city grew steadily. Industrialization changed the city. With the building of the Central Station at the end of the century, Amsterdam turned its back on its seafaring past and looked towards the mechanical age for its future. The station was built over the old harbor wall and some of the oldest canals in the city center were filled in to allow better access to motorized vehicles. Dam Square was landlocked for the first time in its history.

Like our sun, stars are unbelievably hot furnaces that burn their own matter as fuel. When most of the fuel is used up, the star begins to die. The death of a star is not a quiet event. First there is a huge explosion. As its outer layer is blasted off into space, the dying star shines as brightly as a billion suns. After the explosion gravity pulls in what's left of the star. As the outside of the star sinks toward the center, the star gets smaller and smaller. The material the star is made of becomes tightly packed together. A star is so dense that a teaspoon of matter from it weighs billion of pounds. The more the star shrinks, the stronger the gravity inside it becomes. Soon the star is very tiny, and the gravity pulling it in is unbelievably strong. In fact, the gravity is so strong that it even pulls light into the star! Since all the light is pulled in, none can go out. The star becomes black when there is no light. Then a black hole is born! That's what we know about black holes.

A banner hangs off his back. \\"Ogami: Suiouryo technique\\" (Child and expertise for rent)(å­ã[son] è²¸ã[for hire] è [arm|skill] è²¸ã[for hire] ã¤ãã¾ã¤ã [to serve] æ°´ é·æµ [Suiouryo] æä¸å [ogami ittÃ´]), it says. His services are asked for in a most unexpected way, when an insane woman seizes Daigoro from the cart and proceeds to try to breastfeed the boy. Daigoro at first hesitates, but after stern look from his father, he proceeds to suckle the crazy woman's breast. The woman's mother then apologizes for her daughter's behavior and tries to give IttÅ money, but the stoic ronin refuses, saying his son was hungry anyway. As he walks in the rain, he remembers another rainy day several months earlier when his wife, Asami, was slain by three ninjas, ostensibly in revenge for IttÅ's execution of a boy daimyo, but it was really part of a complicated plot by the shogun's inspector Bizen and the \\"Shadow\\" YagyÅ« Clan to frame IttÅ for treason and take over the executioner's post. Now a wandering assassin for hire, IttÅ takes a job from a Chamberlain, to kill a rival and his gang of henchmen, who pose a threat to the chamberlain's lord. The chamberlain plans to test IttÅ, but a quick slash behind his back with his Dotanuki sword dispatches the chamberlain's two men. The targets are in a remote mountain village that is home to hot-spring spa pools. As IttÅ pushes the baby cart, and Daigoro observes scenes of nature, such as a mother dog suckling one puppy, and two children singing a song and bouncing a ball, IttÅ thinks back again to the time just after his wife was killed. He gave Daigoro a choice between a toy ball or the sword. If the child chose the ball, IttÅ would put him to death send him to be with his mother â a better place in his opinion.

Plot title: Nell Movie plot: When stroke victim Violet Kellty dies in her isolated cabin in the North Carolina mountains, Dr. Jerome \\"Jerry\\" Lovell, the town doctor, finds a terrified young woman hiding in the house rafters. She speaks angrily and rapidly, but seems to have a language of her own. Looking at Violet's Bible, Jerry finds a note asking whoever finds it to look after Violet's daughter Nell. Sheriff Todd Peterson shows Jerry a news clipping that Nell was conceived through rape. Jerry seeks the help of Dr. Paula Olsen, a researcher working with autistic children. Paula and her colleague Dr. Alexander \\"Al\\" Paley are interested in studying a \\"wild child\\" (feral child), and Al continues calling Nell this even after studying films showing that Nell does not fit the \\"wild child\\" profile. Paula and Al get a court order to institutionalize Nell for further study. Jerry hires lawyer Don Fontana and prevents it. The judge gives Jerry and Paula three months to interact with Nell and see what her needs are. Paula shows up on a houseboat with electronic equipment to monitor Nell's behavior while Jerry chooses to stay in Nell's cabin and quietly observe. Paula discovers that Nell's seemingly indecipherable language is English, based partly on her mother's aphasic speech after a stroke, and partly on the secret language she shared with her decades deceased identical twin sister. Jerry and Paula begin a grudging friendship. Nell sleeps during the day or works inside her home and is active outdoors only after sunset. She explains to Jerry that her mother told her about the rape and warned her that men were evildoers.

Dog: \\"The most widespread form of interspecies bonding occurs between humans and dogs\\" and the keeping of dogs as companions, particularly by elites, has a long history. (As a possible example, at the Natufian culture site of Ain Mallaha in Israel, dated to 12,000 BC, the remains of an elderly human and a four-to-five-month-old puppy were found buried together). However, pet dog populations grew significantly after World War II as suburbanization increased. In the 1950s and 1960s, dogs were kept outside more often than they tend to be today (using the expression \\"in the doghouse\\" to describe exclusion from the group signifies the distance between the doghouse and the home) and were still primarily functional, acting as a guard, children's playmate, or walking companion. From the 1980s, there have been changes in the role of the pet dog, such as the increased role of dogs in the emotional support of their human guardians.

Based on the sentence \\"Before onlookers in a park, a man in a black shirt and rollerblades slides backward down a railing.\\", is the sentence \\"A man is sliding down a railing.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"A man is sliding down a railing\\" can be considered a true sentence based on the original sentence provided: \\"Before onlookers in a park, a man in a black shirt and rollerblades slides backward down a railing.\\" Both sentences describe the action of a man sliding down a railing. While the second sentence omits several specific details provided in the original sentence, such as the description of onlookers in a park, the man's attire (a black shirt), his use of rollerblades, and the direction of his movement (backward), it still accurately captures the main action occurring – a man sliding down a railing. The simplified sentence can be seen as a more general description of the event, focusing on the main action without the specific details that contribute to the full picture. It manages to convey the core information of the scenario effectively; however, some context and richness are lost in this minimalistic approach.

Build a movie plot around this: What injury does Su discover upon awakening? torn tendons The answer to this question is:","completion":"Title: The Awakening of Su Genre: Drama/Mystery/Thriller Plot: Act 1: The film opens with the protagonist, Su, a talented and dedicated professional violinist in her early 30s, preparing for an important concert, which could potentially catapult her to international fame. Despite the nervousness and immense pressure, she goes to bed the night before the concert, hoping to have a good night's rest. The next morning, Su awakens with excruciating pain in her right arm and discovers torn tendons, rendering her right arm almost immobile. Shocked and devastated, she ends up missing the crucial concert performance and now faces an uncertain future. She confides in her best friend, Lisa, a detective, about her injury, and Lisa offers her emotional support and suggests they report the incident to the police. Act 2: Initially, Su refuses to believe the notion that someone could have deliberately caused her injury. However, as the days pass, she has no other explanation for her sudden and mysterious injury. While Su's career takes a downward spiral, Lisa starts investigating on her own, suspecting that someone from the world of music - a jealous competitor, an obsessive ex-lover, or a shrewd rival - may have a motive to sabotage Su's career. The investigation deepens as Lisa discovers several suspects with possible motives, and the film's tension builds up with a series of nail-biting twists and turns. The clues lead Lisa to uncover a secret from Su's past: Su had once been involved in a car accident in which another young violinist, Anna, was fatally injured. Anna's brother, Michael, believes that Su is responsible for Anna's death and has been quietly seeking vengeance. Act 3: As Lisa gets closer to uncovering the truth, she learns that Michael is a skilled surgeon who has performed tendons surgeries before. Subsequently, the police arrest him and find incriminating evidence linking him to the debilitating injury inflicted upon Su. Michael denies all allegations and accuses the detectives of framing him. In a thrilling climax, a surprise twist emerges when it is revealed that the actual perpetrator was in fact Lisa, out of jealousy and a twisted sense of protection. Lisa had mastered the surgical procedure used to inflict the injury on Su with the help of Michael's medical books and had planted the evidence, hoping to frame him. Lisa's true intentions unravel as Su and the police realize that she had felt unappreciated and overshadowed by Su's rising success. Unable to face the fact that her best friend could betray her, Su dissociates from Lisa, who is arrested and faces serious charges. Act 4: Despite the unfortunate turn of events, Su is determined to regain control over her life. Months of physical therapy and strenuous practice follow as Su fights to rebuild her skills and career. Along the way, she comes to terms with her past and finds her passion for her music. In the emotionally charged final scene, Su gives a groundbreaking performance at her comeback concert, showcasing her resilience and determination to the world. While she may never reach the heights she once aspired to, her story serves as a powerful testament to the strength of the human spirit and the enduring bond between passion and perseverance. The movie closes with a somber reminder that friendships can be tainted by envy and obsession, but it is ultimately up to the individual to pick up the pieces and forge a new path forward."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A few months later however, Hammond decided to stop all mining operations and find other sources of income. they wanted to protect the environment. But I can use this background: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators. Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] What is an answer for this question: Which village made more money from sand mining?

Answer the following question: where does chyme go after it leaves the stomach?","completion":"After chyme leaves the stomach, it progresses into the first section of the small intestine called the duodenum. The small intestine is a highly coiled tube approximately 20 feet (6 meters) long in adults and is divided into three sections: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. Each section performs specific digestive and absorptive functions. When the partly digested food, now known as chyme, exits the stomach through the pyloric sphincter, it mixes with potent digestive enzymes and bicarbonate solution secreted by the pancreas, as well as bile produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder. This process occurs in the duodenum, which is about 10 to 12 inches (25-30 cm) in length. These secretions help neutralize the acidic chyme, preparing it for nutrient absorption and further digestion. Pancreatic enzymes, including amylase, protease, and lipase, play a crucial role in the breakdown of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats in the chyme. Bile, on the other hand, serves to emulsify fat globules, making them more accessible to lipid-digesting enzymes for absorption. The duodenum also secretes enzymes such as maltase, sucrase, and lactase, acting on disaccharides and breaking them down into simpler sugars that can be absorbed by the body. Once the nutrients are broken down into simpler forms, they are absorbed by tiny, finger-like projections called villi and microvilli that line the small intestine's walls. The nutrients are then transferred into the blood or lymph vessels, depending on their molecular properties. Blood vessels absorb water-soluble nutrients such as sugars, amino acids, and water-soluble vitamins (such as Vitamin C and B vitamins). These nutrients are transported via the hepatic portal vein to the liver in the portal circulation for further processing, detoxification, or storage before being sent back into the bloodstream. The lymphatic vessels absorb fat-soluble nutrients, such as fatty acids, fat-soluble vitamins (like Vitamin A, D, E, and K), and cholesterol. These nutrients are absorbed into the lymphatic system as chylomicrons, which eventually enter the bloodstream through the thoracic duct. After the breakdown and absorption process in the duodenum, the chyme progresses through the jejunum and then the ileum. The jejunum (about 8 feet or 2.5 meters long) and ileum (about 11 feet or 3.5 meters long) primarily function in the absorption of nutrients, especially the remaining nutrients that were not absorbed in the duodenum. Lastly, the remaining undigested chyme enters the large intestine, primarily composed of water, electrolytes, and indigestible substances. The large intestine absorbs water, electrolytes, and vitamins produced by bacterial fermentation, while also forming and storing feces to be eliminated through the rectum and anus. In summary, once chyme leaves the stomach, it moves into the duodenum where it is further broken down and mixed with digestive enzymes and bile. The chyme then journeys through the small intestine, where nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream and lymphatic system before entering the large intestine, where water and electrolytes are absorbed, ultimately resulting in the formation and excretion of feces."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Lauren Groff’s ‘Fates and Furies’ There’s always the danger, with novels structured around a marriage, that they’ll be perceived as centrally concerned not only with that particular relationship but with the nature of marriage itself. A domestic union set prominently in a work of fiction has the sometimes unfortunate capacity to obscure whatever else is going on. Yet “Fates and Furies,” Lauren Groff’s remarkable new novel, explodes and rages past any such preconceptions, insisting that the examination of a long-term relationship can be a perfect vehicle for exploring no less than the nature of existence — the domestic a doorway to the philosophical. The title sets the tone for this project, while also serving as a road map of sorts. The novel is divided into two sections, the first of which, “Fates,” is largely concerned with the husband, Lancelot (Lotto) Satterwhite, an unconventionally irresistible beacon of good will and good faith — and more than a bit of a narcissist. The opening lines introduce us both to him and to his wife, Mathilde Yoder, but we are soon told: “For now, he’s the one we can’t look away from. He is the shining one.” Wordplay abounds in “Fates and Furies,” starting with Lotto’s name and its link to such chance-related activities as lotteries. He’s the central character explicitly associated with fate and destiny, and as such he’s the more passive, the more accepting of the pair. And why not? From the beginning, fate seems to look on him with benevolence. His parents and his aunt, a crucial figure throughout, believe from Lotto’s birth that he’s destined for greatness: “It was taken for granted by this trio of adults that Lotto was special. Golden.” And indeed, despite some setbacks — including not being particularly gifted at his first career of choice, acting — he goes on to achieve world fame as a playwright. Still, Lotto’s life isn’t perfect, his optimism not always justified. An early tragedy primes him, the golden one, to need Mathilde, a woman as canny as he is trusting, as comfortable behind the scenes as he is in the spotlight, and as dissembling as he is a (mostly) open book. The second section of the novel, “Furies,” shifts to Mathilde. Her life has never been defined by a sense of glorious destiny but rather by a compulsion to even the score, any score, many scores. As with ­Lotto, there is a tragedy in her deep past, but in her case fate alone cannot be blamed, and the fallout from that fact sets her on a ruthless path — though an unnervingly steady one, at times. The equanimity with which the young Mathilde inflicts physical pain on her peers is chilling. After pinching the face of a mocking schoolmate, “she watched as, over the course of the hour, twin purple grapes developed on his cheek. She wanted to suck them.” In later years, while she is capable of love — her devotion to her husband is consuming and real — she isn’t notably softened by that emotion in any essential way. The story of Lotto and Mathilde’s marriage begins as college ends, continuing through the lean times of Lotto’s failed attempts at acting and then the riches and challenges of his success as a playwright. It’s a tale told twice, with Lotto’s perspective shaping the first version we hear. His understanding of his life with Mathilde, it turns out, is very similar to the marriage outsiders see, the public view. He has little impulse to dive much deeper than that. His trusting nature and unchallenged narcissism make him remarkably incurious, a man who questions neither the good fortune that has befallen him nor much of what his wife chooses to assert. Mathilde’s version, coming second, as it must (it’s the one that fills in the blanks), gives us a peek behind the curtain. We learn about the many secrets to which Lotto isn’t privy, secrets whose existence he never even suspects. It turns out that Mathilde’s fury has gone a long way in shaping both their fates. Almost nothing is as it has seemed. This is true to so great an extent that the discrepancy between their stories bears little relationship to the common observation that every marriage has two sides. In “Fates and Furies,” Groff doesn’t present two accounts of the same events, about which reasonable people might disagree. She presents two critically different sets of events. The deepest satisfaction gained by reading “Furies” after “Fates” lies less in admiring how tidily the puzzle pieces snap together — though they do — than in experiencing one’s own kaleidoscopic shift of emotions and concerns. The disclosure of multiple secrets can have the effect of thinning a story, an abundance of answers overpowering all mystery, but Groff somehow manages to transform revelation into an agent of intricacy. As we know more, we know less — a rare and impressive result. The questions that emerge once the novel’s disparate parts fall into place are neither small nor limited to the narrative at hand. Nor do they have much to do with the nature of marriage. They are questions about the way a person’s character can be set very early in life; what really determines such things as good fortune; the nature of an existence in which none of this is ever truly understood. Groff — whose previous books are the novels “Arcadia” and “The Monsters of Templeton,” along with the story collection “Delicate Edible Birds” — displays an exquisite sense of how best to use literary (and other) traditions and ­predecessors. Not only does she prominently rely on the classical concepts of the Fates and the Furies, but from time to time she interrupts her already linguistically pyrotechnic narrative with a second one, presented parenthetically. This shrewd voice, favoring quick, shorthand disclosures, is most obviously reminiscent of a Greek chorus, though at moments it can also feel as though the Fates themselves are irrepressibly spilling over with what they know. The aforementioned wordplay evokes Nabokov, as does the appearance of the perfect doppelgänger for a narcissist, complete with Lotto’s own initials. Groff’s sentences, often not ­traditional sentences at all but declarative fragments, bring to mind the abrupt, fractured narration found in Annie Proulx’s novel “The Shipping News.” The list goes on. Sophocles isn’t forgotten. Shakespeare finds his way in as well. Whether every association is intentional cannot be divined, but the book only benefits from the richness of discovered — or perceived — echoes and reverberations, running the gamut from the raucously bawdy to the somber. In the end, and from the beginning, Groff has created a novel of extraordinary and genuine complexity. A reader might quibble with the occasional word choice that feels forced, or the too convenient turn of a plot point here and there, but before a doubting eyebrow can be fully raised, “Fates and Furies” has you newly absorbed, admiring its next ­accomplishment. The word “ambitious” is often used as code for “overly ambitious,” a signal that an author’s execution has fallen short. No such hidden message here. Lauren Groff is a writer of rare gifts, and “Fates and Furies” is an unabashedly ambitious novel that delivers — with comedy, tragedy, well-deployed erudition and unmistakable glimmers of brilliance throughout. 390 pp. Riverhead Books. 27.95.

First, we need to subtract 103 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the 103 on the right side of the equation. This is what it looks like: -79 - 103 = 91 * l 2. Next, let's find the result of -79 - 103: -182 = 91 * l 3. Now, we have -182 = 91 * l. To find out what l needs to be, we have to divide both sides of the equation by 91: -182 / 91 = l 4.

It follows concerns about rulings by the European Court of Human Rights and their application to the UK. Opposition parties and a minority of Tories oppose scrapping the HRA. Proposed legislation on a Bill of Rights and Responsibilities will not feature in the government's programme for the year ahead, announced by the Queen, either in full or draft form. However, ministers have insisted they are committed to the plans and are consulting on the issues involved. The Human Rights Act formally incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights, of which the UK was a founding signatory in 1950 and which came in force in 1953, into UK law. Campaigners say the Act is a guarantor of fundamental freedoms, allowing people to challenge abuse, neglect or mistreatment, and that scrapping it would amount to \\"populist games with hard-won freedoms\\". But critics have said that European courts have strayed into areas, such as prisoners voting rights, that should be the preserve of Parliament and should be left to the British courts. The BBC's deputy political editor James Landale said that while the Conservatives had never said the measure would feature in its first Queen's Speech, it was now effectively being put \\"on the backburner\\". The government faced a tough fight over other legislation, he said, and the prime minister wanted to \\"choose his battles\\" - adding that No 10's view was that \\"we still want to do it but not now\\". Employment minister Priti Patel told the BBC that the government wanted to \\"bring sovereignty back to British courts\\" and the HRA had resulted in a \\"great deal of friction\\" between the British and European courts. But she said it was right for the government to \\"take time\\" and \\"implement its manifesto in the right way\\". \\"It is important that we concentrate on doing these things properly,\\" she said.

Out of the given options, \\"dissipate\\" is the most suitable term to describe this particular scenario. Now, let's analyze each of the given words: 1. Dissipate: In this context, it means to gradually disappear or to be spent until there is nothing left. When a person uses up all of their money, it can be said that their money has dissipated. This term accurately captures the idea of finite resources being steadily consumed, leading to eventual depletion. 2. Flown: This term generally refers to the movement of something through the air or being carried by the wind. It doesn't accurately convey the idea of money being spent or used up as \\"dissipate\\" does. Therefore, it is not an appropriate choice in this case. 3. Disintegrate: This term means to break down into parts or to decay. While it does communicate the idea of something decreasing in quantity, it doesn't fit well with the notion of spending money. Money doesn't physically disintegrate when it's being spent. Instead, it changes hands. So, this option isn't the most suitable choice either. 4. Fall apart: This phrase often describes an object or structure that is physically breaking down. While it might indirectly refer to the concept of spending all of one's money, it doesn't precisely capture the idea. Furthermore, this expression is typically associated with a more sudden and dramatic breakdown, which doesn't align with the gradual nature of spending money. 5. Penultimate: This term has nothing to do with the concept of spending money. Penultimate means second to last or occurring immediately before the final item in a sequence or list. As such, it is not relevant to the scenario at hand. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"dissipate\\" to answer the question because it best captures the concept of a person's money gradually disappearing as they use it up. The other options either don't convey the same idea, are unrelated, or lack the appropriate context to correctly describe the situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: In Africa, Christmas day begins with groups of carolers walking to and fro through the village, along the roadway, by the houses of the churchmen, singing the lovely carols known the world around. Often people may be awakened by a group of carolers beginning to gather at the church. They return home to make final preparation as to the clothes one must wear and also as to his offering for the Christmas service. The most important part of their Christmas service is the love offering. This is the gift in honor of Jesus. At about 8 or 9 o'clock, everyone makes their way to the celebration of the birthday of Jesus. Everyone who attends the service goes forward to lay down their gift upon the raised platform near the Communion table. Not one person will attend the service without giving a gift. Christmas in South Africa is a summer holiday. There is no snow, but it has many flowers, many beautiful varieties of wild flowers being in their full pride. In Ghana, most churches announce the coming of Christmas by decorating the church and homes beginning with the first week in Advent, four weeks before Christmas. This season happens to be the cocoa harvest time, so it is a time of wealth. Everyone returns home from wherever they might be, such as farms or mines. In Africa, it is the traditional dinner of turkey, roast beef, mince pies, suckling pig, yellow rice with raisins, vegetables, and plum pudding, or crackers. In the afternoon, families go out into the country and usually there are games or bathing in the warm sunshine, and then home in the cool of the evening. Boxing Day is also a public holiday of real relaxation usually spent in the open air, which falls on December 26. Question: The writer of this passage mainly wants to _ .

In context, the question describes a competition where the participants are required to keep their arm extended straight out while having the object in their hand. The objective is to see who can maintain this position for the longest time before dropping the object. Hence, 'holding' is the most suitable term as it clearly describes the action of keeping the object in one's hand in a firm and stable manner. The other options don't convey the same clarity and correctness as 'holding' in terms of describing the action of maintaining possession of the object: - Option B: lift up and Option D: lifting would imply that the participants are repeatedly raising the object instead of maintaining a fixed position with their arms extended. - Option C: pick up suggests the action of lifting the object from a surface or a lower position to a higher one, which is not the focus of the described competition. - Option E: hold onto is a plausible choice, but 'holding' is a more concise and accurate term to describe the action in question.

Eleanora Fagan (April 7, 1915 - July 17, 1959), better known as Billie Holiday, was an American jazz musician and singer-songwriter with a career spanning nearly thirty years. Nicknamed \\"Lady Day\\" by her friend and music partner Lester Young, Holiday had a seminal influence on jazz music and pop singing. Her vocal style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of manipulating phrasing and tempo. She was known for her vocal delivery and improvisational skills, which made up for her limited range and lack of formal music education. In 1935 Holiday was signed to Brunswick Records by John Hammond to record current pop tunes with Teddy Wilson in the new swing style for the growing jukebox trade. They were given free rein to improvise the material. Holiday's improvisation of melody to fit the emotion was revolutionary. Their first collaboration included \\"What a Little Moonlight Can Do\\" and \\"Miss Brown to You\\". \\"What a Little Moonlight Can Do\\" has been deemed her \\"claim to fame.\\" Brunswick did not favor the recording session, because producers wanted Holiday to sound more like Cleo Brown. After \\"What a Little Moonlight Can Do\\" garnered success, however, the company began considering Holiday an artist in her own right. She began recording under her own name a year later (on the 35-cent Vocalion label), producing a series of extraordinary performances with groups comprising the swing era's finest musicians. The sessions were co-produced by Hammond and Bernie Hanighen. With their arrangements, Wilson and Holiday took pedestrian pop tunes, such as \\"Twenty-Four Hours a Day\\" (number 6 Pop) and \\"Yankee Doodle Went to Town\\", and turned them into jazz classics. Most of Holiday's recordings with Wilson or under her own name during the 1930s and early 1940s are regarded as important parts of the jazz vocal library. She was then in her twenties. Another frequent accompanist was the tenor saxophonist Lester Young, who had been a boarder at her mother's house in 1934 and with whom Holiday had a special rapport. He said, \\"I think you can hear that on some of the old records, you know. Some time I'd sit down and listen to 'em myself, and it sound like two of the same voices, if you don't be careful, you know, or the same mind, or something like that.\\" Young nicknamed her \\"Lady Day\\", and she called him \\"Prez\\". Hammond spoke about the commercial impact of the Wilson-Holiday sides from 1935 to 1938, calling them a great asset to Brunswick. The record label, according to Hammond, was broke and unable to record many jazz tunes. Wilson, Holiday, Young, and other musicians came into the studio without musical arrangements and improvised as they performed, dispensing with the expense of having written arrangements, so that the records they produced were cheap. Holiday was never given any royalties for her work, instead being paid a flat fee, which saved the company money. Some of the records produced were successful, such as \\"I Cried for You\\", which sold 15,000 copies. Hammond said of the record, \\"15,000 ... was a giant hit for Brunswick in those days. I mean a giant hit. Most records that made money sold around three to four thousand.\\" Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"\\"Yes, some other interesting aspects about this article include Billie Holiday's pioneering vocal style, her improvisational skills, and the fact that she and other musicians would record without musical arrangements, improvising as they performed, which ultimately helped save the record company money. Additionally, her special rapport with tenor saxophonist Lester Young, who nicknamed her 'Lady Day,' highlights the personal connections and friendships within the jazz community during that era.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- As Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited the U.N. General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender. After reading the above, is \\"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Who came to New York the evening Nazar Ahari was sentenced?\\"?","completion":"Yes, \\"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\\" is the correct answer to the question \\"Who came to New York the evening Nazar Ahari was sentenced?\\" The text states, \\"On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The first recorded instance of this was by 16th-century Arab alchemists. A large-scale solar distillation project was first constructed in 1872 in the Chilean mining town of Las Salinas. The plant, which had solar collection area of 4,700 m2 (51,000 sq ft), could produce up to 22,700 L (5,000 imp gal; 6,000 US gal) per day and operate for 40 years. Individual still designs include single-slope, double-slope (or greenhouse type), vertical, conical, inverted absorber, multi-wick, and multiple effect. These stills can operate in passive, active, or hybrid modes. Double-slope stills are the most economical for decentralized domestic purposes, while active multiple effect units are more suitable for large-scale applications. What is the answer to this question: What is an example of a solar distillation design?","completion":"An example of a solar distillation design is the double-slope (or greenhouse type) still. Double-slope stills are a popular and economical choice for decentralized domestic purposes, owing to their relatively simple construction and efficient use of solar energy for water distillation. The double-slope still, also known as a solar still, consists of an angled, transparent cover made of glass or plastic, which allows sunlight to enter the still while confining the water vapor inside. Beneath this cover, a shallow basin holds the saline or brackish water to be purified. The basin is typically painted black or coated with a dark material to absorb solar energy and increase the water temperature, thereby accelerating the evaporation process. As the sunlight heats the water inside the basin, evaporation occurs, and water vapor rises toward the sloping cover. The angle of the cover facilitates condensation of the water vapor on its inner surface, which then forms droplets. Due to gravity, these droplets run down the sloping cover to a collection trough that is located at the bottom end of the cover. This collected distillate, now separated from the dissolved salts and impurities, is potable and safe for consumption. The advantages of double-slope solar stills include their simplicity, low cost, and eco-friendliness, as they harness solar energy for water purification without the need for electricity or chemical treatment. However, their application is most suited for small-scale and domestic use, as larger installations may require more advanced and active distillation methods, such as multiple effect units."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is \\"By 1987, Pioneer had overcome the technical challenges and was able to once again encode in CAA60, allowing a total of 60 minutes 5 seconds.\\" a good answer to the question \\"What was the maximum length of the CAA60 format?\\"","completion":"While the statement \\"By 1987, Pioneer had overcome the technical challenges and was able to once again encode in CAA60, allowing a total of 60 minutes 5 seconds.\\" does provide information about the maximum length of the CAA60 format, it does not give a comprehensive and detailed answer. To provide a more complete response, consider the following: The CAA60 format, which stands for Constant Angular Velocity 60, is a data encoding technique used in the production of LaserDiscs. As an optical disc technology in the late 20th century, LaserDiscs served as a medium for high-quality video and audio content, offering far superior quality to VHS tapes and other contemporary formats. The CAA60 format allowed for data to be stored on the disc at a constant angular velocity, ensuring smooth playback and consistent data transfer rates. Developed by Pioneer during the 1980s, the CAA60 format initially faced several technical challenges that limited its capabilities. However, by 1987, Pioneer had successfully tackled these issues, resulting in an increased maximum capacity on a single LaserDisc side encoded with CAA60. This advancement enabled a recording time of up to 60 minutes and 5 seconds on each side of the disc. While overcoming technical challenges is a crucial aspect to know, further details pertinent to understanding the CAA60 format include its advantages over competitor formats and its impact on the LaserDisc technology. The CAA60 format offered several benefits, such as a constant linear velocity and high-density storage. Additionally, playing a CAA60-encoded disc on a LaserDisc player resulted in improved video and audio quality, with reduced video noise and a clearer overall picture. Despite the eventual decline of LaserDisc technology in the face of DVD's emergence and subsequent digital media formats, the CAA60 format played a significant role in establishing Pioneer's LaserDisc technology as a superior home video platform during that era. In conclusion, the maximum length of the CAA60 format was 60 minutes and 5 seconds, as achieved by Pioneer in 1987 by overcoming technical challenges associated with initial development. The CAA60 format was pivotal in advancing LaserDisc technology and played an instrumental role in delivering high-quality video and audio content in the 1980s and early 1990s."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Prosecutors say the beatings began soon after both brothers approached church leaders with their plans to defect. It was unclear at press time why Ferguson was cleared of the murder charge while being found guilty of the manslaughter charge. Ferguson faces up to 50 years in prison when sentenced on Sept. 1. The verdict was issued hours after lawyers for the prosecution and defense presented their closing arguments. Last week, Bruce Leonard, the 66-year-old father of the two teens who were beaten inside the Word of Life Church, took the stand in Oneida County Court, providing a detailed account of the incident that took his 19-year-old son's life. Leonard described how he and several other members of the church allegedly pummeled and whipped his two teen sons during a church counseling session. The father, one of the prosecution's star witnesses, as he recalled the reason for the alleged prolonged gang attacks: Both brothers had been accused of sexually abusing their sister, Grace, as well as the children of Sarah Ferguson. Bruce Leonard was originally set to stand trial with his daughter, but accepted a plea bargain for two counts of assault last week. He faces 15 years behind bars. During testimony last week, Christopher Leonard of several church members – including Ferguson's infant child – the night before the beatings. He denied ever having intercourse with any of the victims. Prior to Leonard's testimony, prosecutors had long claimed the allegations of abuse against the Leonard brothers were baseless. In separate testimony Tuesday, Grace Ferguson, Christopher's sister, Multiple church members have been charged in Lucas's death. The other defendants in the case are expected to go on trial in September. Those with outstanding criminal charges stemming from the beatings include pastor Tiffanie Irwin; Irwin's mother, Traci Irwin; and Tiffanie's brothers Joseph and Daniel Irwin. Mother and son Word of Life members Linda and David Morey are also facing charges. All have pleaded not guilty. The parents of the beating victims – Bruce and 60-year-old Deborah Leonard – have both accepted plea bargains for assault from the prosecution. They have agreed to testify against the seven other defendants facing charges for their roles in last fall's violence.

Power Rankings: The Times' NFL rankings (after Week 13) by Lance Pugmire The top two remain the same, but the New York Giants tumble out of the top 10, Jacksonville falls back into the cellar and Dallas charges up the list. « Previous Week Next Week » Up: Cowboys + 4 | Down: Buccaneers - 4 Going to the playoffs, of course, but greater ambition is AFC top seed, which will be at hand by beating Patriots Monday Proved something to self by beating nemesis Saints convincingly and can clinch No. 1 NFC seed Sunday. Wrapped up AFC West already by putting up 21 points quickly in third quarter vs. Bucs. Should get eighth straight win Thursday at Oakland. Tom Brady wasnât at sharpest, but still notched a 10th division title. Interesting look Monday as defending AFC champions face top challenger Houston. Have a tough time against Rams, but should have won with David Akersâ kick that missed. Quarterback uncertainty intrigues. Came back from dud to beat Vikings at home, but have to be concerned how Adrian Peterson ran over them. Thatâs not title material. Had every right to bow with big, late deficit at Detroit, but refusal to yield and rookie QB Andrew Luckâs cool play means theyâre amazingly playoff bound. Losing to Charlie Batch and scuffling so on offense again reveals disturbing trend as they now venture to neighboring Redskins. Struggled to run and contain rookie QB Russell Wilson before final-play OT loss to Seahawks. Now travel to play desperate Vikings. Could look back on Charlie Batch-led effort at Ravens as game of the year. Should get Roethlisberger back vs. Chargers. Another slip back leaves division up-for-grabs, three-team race. Theyâre good with drama, though, now home to Saints. Character OT win at Bears emboldens playoff position for Russell Wilson and defense. Get shot at sorry Cardinals next. Robert Griffin III was superb in big moments vs. Giants at home Monday in his push to join rookie Luck in postseason. Doesnât seem like they deserve to be this high, elevated by run of awful AFC West teams, but Ben-Jarvus Green-Ellis has three straight 100-yard games. Awarded a nice bump even after beating down Eagles. QB Romo looked better, broke team TD pass record, now needs consistency with Bengals next. Didnât like their chances at Denver and they fell below expectation, with QB Josh Freeman missing 21 of 39 passes. They have Adrian Peterson, but QB Christian Ponder regressed (119 yards, two INTs) in Packersâ loss as they went scoreless after half. Knowing they can play with 49ers should ease others tests, like Buffalo this week. K Zuerlein also a precious commodity. Ryan Fitzpatrick threw just 17 times, but two were for TDs, and he ran for a score, too, to indicate how horrid Jaguars are. play at home vs. Dolphins likely fatal to surprise playoff position, as they now go to 49ers. Five INTs, end of Drew Breesâ TD streak a final insult to coach-less season. Well, maybe trip to Giants will be. Rookie QB Brandon Weeden (364 yards) giving stability to team that hadnât won on road in long while. Chance for another âWâ vs. Chiefs. Seem far worse than 5-7, but they did win 7-6 despite removal of QB Sanchez and now get Jaguars. Is Greg McElroy the answer? Bad teams find a way to lose like they did, on final play, after multi-score lead vs. rookie QB and Colts. Lots of head-shaking over this downfall. Never really in home game vs. Texans, and six turnovers made it worse. Only ran ball 17 times, now go to Colts. Worse part of this debacle is how bad QB Philip Rivers has been late, with 11 turnovers now in fourth quarter/OT. Firings canât happen soon enough. RB Bryce Brownâs late fumble squashes game effort at rival Dallas. Eighth loss in row robs Coach Andy Reid of an exit souvenir. Had the ball just more than 22 minutes in emotion-charged Arrowhead Stadium loss. Coach Rivera strong candidate for “Black Monday” pink slip. Rookie QB Ryan Lindley not close to joining fellow new kids in success, turning in 10-of-31, 72-yard nightmare in Jetsâ loss. Gave up nearly 600 yards to young Browns, and QB Carson Palmer operating effectively without skill-position players.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the following sentence linguistically acceptable? He is filled with sincerity.","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"He is filled with sincerity\\" is linguistically acceptable, as it adheres to the standard norms and rules of grammar, syntax, and semantics. Let's explore each of those aspects to understand why it is an acceptable sentence. 1. Grammar: The sentence follows the basic structure of a subject (he), verb (is), and object (sincerity). The verb \\"is\\" is a linking verb, which connects the subject with additional information or an adjective describing it. This sentence is in the present tense, indicating that sincerity is a current attribute or quality of the person being referred to. 2. Syntax: The sentence adheres to the basic word order of English, which is SVO (Subject-Verb-Object). In this case, \\"he\\" is the subject, \\"is\\" is the linking verb, and \\"filled with sincerity\\" is the object, which can also be thought of as a subject complement. The phrase \\"filled with sincerity\\" follows the proper prepositional pattern as well, using \\"with\\" to indicate a sense of being imbued or possessing a certain quality, in this case, sincerity. 3. Semantics: The sentence is semantically acceptable because the vocabulary used is appropriate to convey the intended meaning. The linking verb \\"is\\" serves the purpose of connecting the subject \\"he\\" to the state or condition of being \\"filled with sincerity.\\" The word \\"sincerity\\" conveys the idea of honesty, genuineness, and the absence of deceit. \\"Filled with\\" is a suitable figurative expression to indicate a person possessed or densely packed with a quality like sincerity. The overall meaning of this sentence is clear: The person being referred to is characterized by a strong sense of sincerity. It is easy to understand and interpret the intended meaning of the sentence, making it an acceptable construction in the English language."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: You and your friends are settling into your seats. The new Spider- Man movie is about to start and you've got the snacks: soda and popcorn. Food is part of what makes the movie fun. Just as the lights go out, you catch a slight smell of ...tuna fish?! You turn your head, searching for the source. Then you spot him: A couple rows back, some guy is enjoying a tuna fish sandwich. How's he get that in here? You wonder. Then you remember how much you paid for your snacks. What invites the unwelcome outside food is probably the price. Why pay 5 for a bag of M&Ms when you can get them for a dollar at the corner store? Earlier this year, a Michigan man decided to fight for his right to snack. Joshua Thompson is suing his local theatre after it banned outside food. He argues the ban breaks a Michigan law that prevents business from charging extremely high prices. However, most legal experts believe Thompson has little chance of winning his case though he does have a point: 85 percents out of every dollar of treats a movie theatre sells is pure profit . The truth is that movie theatres are more in the snack business than the movie business. A huge part of the ticket income goes to the Hollywood studio. This makes sense, since the studio have to pay the costs of movie production and advertising. But that often doesn't leave much cash for the theater, which also has its own running costs. If customers stopped buying food, owners would have to raise ticket prices even higher. Of course, there's another reason to think twice before bringing food into the movies: It's against the rules. Breaking those rules can be unpleasant consequences, too. Some theatres will kick you out if they catch you. Even without the threat of punishment, we should follow rules all the time-----out of respect. Here's a good idea: Eat before the movie. Options: A The pleasure of enjoying snacks.

Although both phrases convey a similar meaning, they employ a slightly different choice of words to communicate the same concept. 2. The first sentence uses \\"electromagnetic waves in the physical spectrum\\", while the second one uses \\"electromagnetic waves in the physical spectrum\\" as well.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What were the names of the streams where the sawmills were located? ? Like all creeks in Lycoming County, Larrys Creek served as an area for settlers to establish homesteads and farms. As logging became a major industry in the mid-19th century, the creek was a source of power for sawmills and other mills. The first sawmill on the creek, in what is now Mifflin Township, was built in 1799. The relatively low flow of water in the creek did not allow rafts of logs to be floated downstream to the river and the lumber boom at Williamsport (as they were on Pine Creek to the west).This and the lack of logging railroads along the creek led to the development of many small sawmills: the Larrys Creek watershed once had 53 sawmills within 22 miles (35 km) of the mouth (as well as other industries of the time). No other stream in the country had so many sawmills in so small a territory. Twelve sawmills were on the Second Fork, six on the First Fork, one each on Canoe Run and Lawshe Run, and the rest were on Larrys Creek itself. Eight were structures rebuilt on the site of previous sawmills, and only four were steam powered (the rest were water powered). The earliest of these sawmills was built in 1796 (near Seeley Run), the last in 1902 (on Lawshe Run), and by 1903 just two mills were still standing and only one of those was operating.Lumbering removed the tree trunks, but left many flammable limbs, branches, and stumps behind. On May 2, 1872, a large forest fire destroyed the villages of Carter and Gould, 6 miles (9.7 km) north of Salladasburg on Larrys Creek in Mifflin Township. There are large tracts of second growth forest and small lumber companies still operate in the watershed today.

Describing his vision of Michelle Obama in the mural, Devins said to DNAinfo that he \\"wanted to present her as what I think she is,\\" a queen draped in colorful clothing and jewelry reminiscent of ancient Egyptian royalty.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: Wipe desktop computer screen with scratching.","completion":"When it comes to cleaning a desktop computer screen without causing any scratches, it is crucial to use the right cleaning method and materials. There are two primary solutions that can be used for this task: Microfiber cloth with a mild cleaning solution and using a pre-moistened screen cleaning wipe designed specifically for this purpose. Let's evaluate both methods in detail: 1. Microfiber cloth with a mild cleaning solution (recommended): Pros: - A microfiber cloth is the preferred choice for cleaning computer screens because it is super-soft and can effectively remove dust, fingerprints, and debris without scratching the surface. - It is easily washable and reusable, making it environmentally friendly and cost-effective. - You have control over the cleaning solution used, allowing you to choose a gentle, non-toxic, and alcohol-free formula that will not cause any damage to your computer screen. Cons: - It may require some extra effort to properly mix your cleaning solution and dampen the cloth, as opposed to using a pre-moistened wipe. - There's the potential for using the wrong cleaning solution if you neglect to follow the manufacturer's recommendations, which can cause damage to the screen. How to use: - Turn off your computer and unplug it to ensure safety. - Mix a solution of distilled water with a few drops of gentle dish soap (do not use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaners). - Dampen a microfiber cloth with the solution and wring it out, making sure it is not too wet. - Gently wipe the screen in a circular motion, being careful not to press too hard to avoid any potential scratching. - Use another dry microfiber cloth to gently dry the screen and remove any remaining moisture or streaks. 2. Pre-moistened screen cleaning wipes: Pros: - These are convenient and easy to use, with no need to dampen a cloth or mix a cleaning solution. - They are specifically designed to clean screens and monitors without causing any damage. - Some wipes come with an anti-static feature, which may help reduce the accumulation of dust on your screen. Cons: - They can be expensive, particularly if you need to clean your screen regularly. - They are single-use, which is less environmentally friendly compared to a washable and reusable microfiber cloth. - You have limited control over the chemicals and ingredients used, which means you might end up using a wipe with harsh chemicals that could potentially damage your screen or cause discomfort for users who have sensitive skin or are allergic to certain chemicals. How to use: - Turn off your computer and unplug it to ensure safety. - Carefully remove a pre-moistened screen cleaning wipe from its packaging and unfold it. - Gently wipe the screen in a circular motion, being careful not to press too hard to avoid any potential scratching. - Allow the screen to air dry, as most screen cleaning wipes are designed to evaporate quickly without leaving any residue. Conclusion: Based on a thorough evaluation, the microfiber cloth with a mild cleaning solution is the better option for cleaning a desktop computer screen without causing scratches. It is gentle, effective, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective. Additionally, it does not introduce any abrasive or harsh chemicals to the screen, making it ideal for long-term use while minimizing the risk of screen damage. Pre-moistened screen cleaning wipes can be a convenient alternative; however, they might not be the most sustainable choice in the long run, and you have less control over the cleaning solution on the wipe."},{"prompt":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Leave a camera on a mountaintop, and chances are, you'll never see it again.

Answer the following question: Process: - The organism must die to begin the process - The soft tissue decomposes - The bones are left behind - Scavengers tear the body apart and move the bones elsewhere - Wind and rain also scatter the bones further - The bones left behind will weather and become buried by sand and soil - The proteins in the bone are replaced with minerals that are dissolved in the soil - This creates a rock-like substance called a fossil - Water and wind erosion wear away the layers of soil on top of the fossil - This makes discovery of the fossil possible. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose Less proteins are replaced with minerals happens, how will it affect more fossils can be formed. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if fewer proteins in the bones are replaced with minerals, more fossils can potentially be formed. To understand the implications of this change on the fossilization process, let's first revisit the process in detail: 1. An organism dies, allowing the process to begin. 2. Soft tissues decompose, leaving only the bones behind. 3. Scavengers tear the body apart, and weathering factors like wind and rain scatter the bones. 4. The remaining bones become buried by sand and soil. 5. Dissolved minerals in the soil replace the proteins in the bones, forming a rock-like substance called a fossil. 6. Water and wind erosion wear away the layers of soil on top of the fossil, enabling its discovery. In the context of the perturbation hypothesis, it is proposed that fewer proteins in the bones are replaced with minerals. This could have a couple of effects on the process. First, it is possible that the integrity of the resulting fossils might be compromised. By having less mineral replacement, the fossils formed could be less stable and more prone to degradation over time. With potentially weaker fossils, there is a higher likelihood that they would break down and become less distinct, making their identification and extraction more challenging. Second, with less mineral replacement, the \\"rock-like\\" substance formed during the fossilization process might not be as dense and hard. Consequently, the organic component of the bones might not be as well preserved. This could result in the fossil record becoming less accurate and representative of the original organism. However, on the other hand, if less mineral replacement occurs in the bones, it could potentially increase the chances of organic materials being preserved. Preserving organic materials might offer enhanced opportunities for researchers to study the biology of the organism, potentially contributing valuable insights into the life and evolution of the species. In summary, the perturbation of having fewer proteins replaced with minerals could result in altered fossil integrity and preservation. Although there might be potential upsides to this scenario, such as increased access to preserved organic materials, it may also lead to weakened fossils and a less accurate representation of the original organism. Therefore, the supposition does have direct and indirect effects on the fossilization process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: Play is the basic business of childhood, and more and more in recent years research has shown the great importance of play in the development of a human being.From earliest infancy , every child needs opportunity and the right material for play, and the main tools of play are toys.The main function of toys is to suggest, encourage and assist play.To succeed in this, they must be good toys, which children will play with often, and will come back to again and again.Therefore, it is important to choose suitable toys for different stages of a child's development. In recent years research on infant development has shown that the standard a child is likely to reach, within the range of his inherited abilities, is largely determined in the first three years of his life.So a baby's ability to benefit from the right play materials should not be underestimated.A baby who is encouraged, talked to and shown things and played with, has the best chance of growing up successfully. The next stage, from three to five years old, curiosity knows no bounds.Every type of suitable toy should be made available to the child, for trying out, experimenting and learning, for discovering his own particular ability. Bricks and jigsaws and construction toys; painting, scribbling and making things; sand and water play; toys for imaginative and pretending play; the first social games for learning to play and get on with others. By the third stage of play development--from five to seven or eight years old-- the child is at school.But for a few more years play is still the best way of learning, at home or at school.It is easier to see which type of toys the child most enjoys. Until the age of seven or eight, play and work mean much the same to a child.But once reading has been mastered, then books and school become the main source of learning.Toys are still interesting and valuable, which lead up to new hobbies, but their significance has changed --to a child of nine or ten years old, toys and games mean, as to adults, relaxation and fun.

He took the temperature at the base of the mountain, then took the temperature at the top of the mountain. Which area registered a higher temperature? Answer: base of the mountain A:","completion":"Explanation: The base of the mountain registered a higher temperature because, as altitude increases, the temperature usually decreases. This phenomenon is known as the temperature lapse rate, which is the rate at which temperature decreases with an increase in altitude. The reason behind this is that the Earth's atmosphere is heated from the bottom up, with the surface absorbing the Sun's energy and releasing it as heat. As one goes higher, the air becomes less dense and has less ability to hold heat, so the temperature drops. Hence, James observed a higher temperature at the base of the mountain compared to the top."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Despite retiring from professional rugby due to health issues, his legendary status and contributions to New Zealand rugby remain etched in the hearts and minds of the fans. The surreal display of adoration, which combines religious reverence, superhero admiration, and a sprinkle of whimsical humor, is a testament to the indelible impact Jonah has made on the nation. He has transcended the sport, becoming an iconic figure and a symbol of strength, resilience, and national pride. As the chants and cheers continue to fill the air, Jonah waves to the crowd, his imposing figure clad in the familiar black-and-white All Blacks kit. His expressive eyes and warm smile convey a sense of humility and gratitude for the outpouring of support from his adoring fans. Children clamber on their parents' shoulders for a glimpse of their hero, whose phenomenal skills on the rugby pitch have inspired a generation of players and cultivated a fierce passion for the sport in their homeland.

Q:What is the final step of the following process: - Chemicals like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen are released into the air - These substances rise into the high atmosphere - They react with water and oxygen - This creates a more acidic rain A:","completion":"The final step of the process, in which chemicals like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen are released into the air, rise into the high atmosphere, react with water and oxygen to create more acidic rain, is the environmental impact of acid rain on various ecosystems, human health, and infrastructure. 1. Impact on Ecosystems: Acid rain has a significant effect on aquatic ecosystems, such as lakes, rivers, and wetlands. When acidic rain falls, it can infiltrate these water bodies, leading to a decrease in the pH level, which can negatively affect the habitat and survival of aquatic organisms. Many fish, amphibians, and plankton are sensitive to even slight changes in acidity, and increased acidity in their environment can cause these populations to decline or even disappear altogether. Furthermore, acid rain could also impact the soil quality, leading to the leaching of essential nutrients and minerals that are vital for plant growth and the overall health of terrestrial ecosystems. This can lead to the decline of plant species as well as the animals that rely on these plants for sustenance. 2. Impact on Human Health: Although acid rain does not directly affect human health, the pollutants responsible for its formation, like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, can cause respiratory issues and aggravate conditions such as asthma and bronchitis when inhaled in high concentrations. Additionally, acid rain can contaminate drinking water sources, which may lead to the consumption of water with an imbalanced pH. Long-term consumption of such water can cause health problems, primarily related to the gastrointestinal tract and skin irritations. 3. Impact on Infrastructure: Acid rain can accelerate the corrosion of metals, concretes, and stones used in the construction of human-made structures, including buildings, bridges, monuments, and other infrastructure components. The increased corrosion can weaken these structures, causing them to deteriorate rapidly, which poses safety risks and leads to elevated maintenance and replacement costs. In conclusion, the final step of the process involving the release of chemicals like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen into the air, their rise into the high atmosphere, and the formation of acidic rain, is the manifestation of various adverse effects on ecosystems, human health, and infrastructure. To mitigate these impacts and protect both the environment and ourselves, it is essential to limit the emission of these pollutants through the implementation of cleaner technologies and adherence to environmental regulations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Why don't I enjoy sex with my boyfriend?","completion":"While the two questions might initially seem the same, there is a subtle difference in their implications that points to slightly different concerns. 1. \\"Why can't I enjoy sex with my boyfriend anymore?\\" This question implies that the person asking it once enjoyed sex with their boyfriend, but now they do not. It suggests that they are concerned about the change that has occurred in their relationship and want to understand the reasons behind it. It also implies a desire to regain that sense of enjoyment. Some potential factors to consider while answering this question could include: - Have there been changes in the relationship dynamics? For example, trust issues, communication breakdowns, or a feeling of decreased intimacy could all contribute to someone no longer enjoying sex with their partner. - Has there been a personal change in the person asking the question (e.g., a significant life event, a change in mental or physical health, or an alteration in their overall sexual desire or preferences)? - Are there external factors that could be influencing the person's enjoyment of sex (e.g., stress, taking medications, or other life circumstances)? - Perhaps there may be issues of dissatisfaction with sexual experiences, such as a lack of compatibility in terms of sexual preferences, desires, or communication. 2. \\"Why don't I enjoy sex with my boyfriend?\\" This question is focused more on the absence of enjoyment in the person's current sexual experiences with their boyfriend. It doesn't specify whether the person ever found these experiences enjoyable, which suggests that the problem could have been present since the beginning of their sexual relationship. Some factors to consider while exploring this question include: - Is the person naturally less interested in sex than their partner, or is there potentially a disparity in sexual desire levels? This is not an issue if both partners are content with the situation, but it can lead to dissatisfaction if one person's needs are not being met. - Does the person have any personal inhibitions or insecurities that may be impacting their ability to enjoy sex (e.g., body image issues, past trauma, or other mental health concerns)? - Have there been any unsuccessful attempts at trying new things or establishing effective communication about sexual preferences and desires between the person and their boyfriend? - Does the couple have a strong emotional connection, and is there sufficient trust, intimacy, and affection in the relationship outside of the sexual aspect? In conclusion, the two questions, \\"Why can't I enjoy sex with my boyfriend anymore?\\" and \\"Why don't I enjoy sex with my boyfriend?\\" appear similar but contain nuances that differentiate them. The first question focuses on a change in enjoyment, whereas the second question is centered around the absence of enjoyment in general. Both inquiries, however, highlight valid concerns that warrant a thorough exploration of various personal, relational, and external factors in order to provide a comprehensive answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: Visitor Q Movie plot: The film's plot is often compared to Pier Paolo Pasolini's Teorema, in which a strange visitor to a wealthy family seduces the maid, the son, the mother, the daughter, and finally the father, before leaving a few days after, subsequently changing their lives.[5] The film starts off with a question: \\"Have you ever done it with your Dad?\\"; the viewer then sees Miki Yamazaki, a young prostitute, trying to persuade her father, Kiyoshi, into having sex with her. Her father is videotaping the scene for a documentary he is preparing on Japanese youths. Once it appears the father is letting himself be persuaded, she tells him the price (50,000 Yen). They have sex, the father ejaculates after a very short time and the disappointed daughter informs him it will be 100,000 Yen now, because of this. The father then realizes the camera has been on all along. In the next scene, called \\"Have you ever been hit on the head?\\", a man (Visitor Q) hits the father over the head with a rock for no apparent reason. The film then moves on to a scene titled \\"Have you ever hit your mom?\\" In this scene, the mother, Keiko is working on a jigsaw puzzle, and her hands are shown to have red marks, showing where she was beaten. Her young son, Takuya, comes in and starts throwing things at the already broken apartment walls because he is unhappy with the toothbrush his mother bought him. He then hits his mother with a rug beating stick. Later, bullies from the son's school come to the front of the house and shoot fireworks through the son's bedroom window. The mother is later seen injecting heroin. It does not seem to have a huge effect on her, though, suggesting she is a regular user. On his way back from work, the father is yet again hit on the head by the same man. They both arrive at the father's home and the mother serves them dinner.

I finished getting ready and tried to settle down. It didn't work, so I decided that my mum and I should go. We had a little time, so I thought we could practice parking. I failed, with the wheel hitting the pavement. After that, the little bit of confidence I'd had was gone. I tried two more times, but didn't improve much. Then we headed to the test site. I went into a room for some paperwork. And I waited for 20 minutes--just enough time to make myself believe that I was going to fail. Then, finally, it was my turn. I just wanted to get it over and make sure that I had to come back next Thursday. I stepped outside and the sky was the light blue I love. It offered me some comfort and I realized something: sometime between when I pulled myself off the seat and when I got outside, I had become calmer. The first thing I had to do was parking, which I did quite well. The confidence that came with it hit me like a wave. The rest of the test went well and I passed it all. As I drove back, the instructor told me I would not be coming back for a second test next Thursday. Back in the building I didn't have to say a word. My mum knew just by looking at me.

Here is a question about this article: At the start of her reign Victoria was popular, but her reputation suffered in an 1839 court intrigue when one of her mother's ladies-in-waiting, Lady Flora Hastings, developed an abdominal growth that was widely rumoured to be an out-of-wedlock pregnancy by Sir John Conroy. Victoria believed the rumours. She hated Conroy, and despised \\"that odious Lady Flora\\", because she had conspired with Conroy and the Duchess of Kent in the Kensington System. At first, Lady Flora refused to submit to a naked medical examination, until in mid-February she eventually agreed, and was found to be a virgin. Conroy, the Hastings family and the opposition Tories organised a press campaign implicating the Queen in the spreading of false rumours about Lady Flora. When Lady Flora died in July, the post-mortem revealed a large tumour on her liver that had distended her abdomen. At public appearances, Victoria was hissed and jeered as \\"Mrs. Melbourne\\". What is the answer to this question: What was Flora hastings abdominal growth rumored to be?","completion":"Flora Hastings' abdominal growth was rumored to be an out-of-wedlock pregnancy, with Sir John Conroy being suspected as the father. This rumor was fueled by the complex dynamics between Queen Victoria, Lady Flora Hastings, Sir John Conroy, and the Duchess of Kent, as well as their associations with the Kensington System. The situation escalated when Lady Flora initially refused to undergo a medical examination, which led to increased suspicions. However, when she eventually agreed to the examination in mid-February, it was determined that she was still a virgin, debunking the pregnancy rumors. Unfortunately, when Lady Flora passed away in July, her autopsy revealed that the abdominal growth was actually a large tumor on her liver that had caused her abdomen to distend. The ordeal had significant repercussions on Queen Victoria's reputation, as her involvement in spreading the false rumors led to public backlash and negative press."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write the text above using proper case.","completion":"The 8x4 with a single front axle has a tridem bogie rear suspension, of which the tag axle is hydraulically steered. In this configuration, the vehicle features an 8x4 wheel arrangement, meaning that it has eight wheels in total, with four of them being used for steering and the other four for providing traction and supporting the vehicle's weight. The single front axle is responsible for steering, making it easier to maneuver the vehicle in tight spaces or navigate through challenging terrain. The tridem bogie rear suspension system is designed to provide additional stability, load capacity, and ride comfort for the vehicle. This setup includes three distinct axles in the rear, with the third axle (the tag axle) being capable of being hydraulically steered. The steering of the tag axle is controlled by hydraulic pressure, allowing it to turn in coordination with the front axle to provide a smoother and more comfortable ride. The hydraulic steering system for the tag axle has several advantages over traditional mechanical steering systems. Firstly, it offers better handling and control, due to the greater range of motion allowed by the hydraulic system. Additionally, the hydraulic system can automatically adjust to varying road conditions, providing a more consistent level of steering assistance and ensuring a stable driving experience. Furthermore, because there are fewer moving parts in a hydraulic system when compared to a mechanical system, it is generally more reliable and less prone to wear and tear. Overall, a vehicle with an 8x4 wheel configuration and a tridem bogie rear suspension system with hydraulically steered tag axle offers superior handling and control, as well as improved ride comfort and load carrying capacity. This unique combination of features makes it an attractive option for a wide range of applications, including construction, transportation, and heavy haulage, where both maneuverability and payload capacity are crucial to successful operation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The FiveThirtyEight forecast is unchanged for Saturday, with President Obama maintaining a 67.9 percent chance of winning the Electoral College. You’d have to stretch to find much in Saturday’s national polls that would change your view about the condition of the race. Mr. Obama gained ground in three daily tracking surveys — from Public Policy Polling, Investor’s Business Daily and United Press International — but lost ground in two others, from Ipsos and Rasmussen Reports. The Gallup national tracking poll continues to diverge from the consensus and show a six-point lead for Mitt Romney among likely voters; Mr. Romney gained one point in the version of the survey among registered voters on Saturday. Saturday’s battleground state polls provided for a bit more action, but some of the numbers aren’t quite as good for the candidates as they might appear on the surface. Polls by Grove Insight, for example, had Mr. Obama with a three-point lead in both Florida and Wisconsin. But Grove Insight has had strongly Democratic-leaning numbers in its recent surveys, and these polls are about what you might expect given that tendency. A SurveyUSA poll showing Mr. Obama with a one-point lead in Florida is really the slightly better result for him. Even so, Florida has had some very dense polling, so it will take quite a lot of evidence to push the model much off its current take on the race there, which projects a win for Mr. Romney by about two percentage points. If a candidate holds a two-point lead in the polling average in a state, it’s going to be pretty normal to see a few polls showing a tied race or his opponent up by a point or two, along with others that show him up ahead by a margin in the mid-single digits. That’s pretty much what we see right now among the higher-quality polls of Florida, with Mr. Romney retaining the overall advantage. The best number of the day for Mr. Romney was almost certainly the Public Policy Polling survey of Ohio, which had him down by one point there — improved from a five-point deficit in a poll they conducted there last week. If this had been the only poll of the day in Ohio, Mr. Romney would probably have made an Electoral College gain on that basis, since the forecast is very sensitive to anything in Ohio. There was another Ohio poll, however, from Gravis Marketing, which showed a tied race. Isn’t that an even better result for Mr. Romney? Not in this case, because Gravis Marketing polls have had a Republican lean of two or three percentage points this cycle. (Their prior poll of Ohio had shown Mr. Romney up by about one point.) The FiveThirtyEight model adjusts for these “house effects” and so treats the Gravis Marketing poll as equivalent to showing a two- or three-point lead for Mr. Obama. It also adjusts the Public Policy Polling survey of Ohio slightly downward for Mr. Obama — but Public Policy Polling has lost most of the strong Democratic lean that it had earlier in the cycle, and it has even been on Mr. Romney’s side of the consensus in a few states like Iowa and New Hampshire. We now calculate their house effect as being only about half a percentage point in favor of Mr. Obama. Still, if Saturday’s polls were something of a wash, it’s also hard to make the case that the polls have moved much toward Mr. Obama since Tuesday night’s debate in New York. Mr. Obama now holds a popular vote lead of one percentage point in the FiveThirtyEight “now-cast,” an estimate based on both state and national surveys. He led by 0.8 percentage points by the same measure before the debate. Although many of the surveys that are influencing the forecast preceded the debate, meaning that it will take another day or two before we can close the book on its effects, at the very least it seems clear that Mr. Obama will not see anything like the sharp break toward Mr. Romney that followed the first debate in Denver. A gain of two or three points for Mr. Obama in the polls, for instance, would very probably have become obvious by now. Perhaps the debate was worth a half a point or a full point for Mr. Obama — these trends would be more difficult to distinguish from statistical noise — but it probably wasn’t worth much more than that. What makes this challenging is that although something like a half-point shift is hard to detect in the polls, it is also potentially meaningful given how late it is in the race and how close the contest is. The most natural analogy might be to a baseball game. Scoring a run in the first inning is worth something, but it won’t shift the win probabilities all that much: there’s too much that can happen later on in the game. We’re now in the political equivalent of the eighth inning, however. A run scored in the eight inning is potentially much more important than one in the first. The reason I say “potentially” is that it makes a tremendous difference depending what the score is. In a blowout, the eighth inning won’t matter at all. A team down 9-1 is almost certainly going to lose; but so will one that gets a solo home run and trails 9-2 instead. (The political equivalent: Walter Mondale, in 1984, improved to a 17-point deficit from a 20-point deficit in national polls after his first debate with Ronald Reagan. This may have helped him to carry his home state of Minnesota, and lose the Electoral College 525-13 rather than 535-3.) But if the score is tied, or if it’s a one-run game, a run scored in the eighth will make a huge difference. That’s where we find ourselves right now in the presidential race. This election is close and is likely to end up that way. There’s about a 50-50 chance that the election will end up within 2.5 percentage points, according to the forecast, against only a 15 percent chance that either candidate will win by five points or more. For this reason, the percentage estimates in the forecast are likely to be volatile from here on out. Early in the year, we’d treat as a pretty big deal if a candidate’s Electoral College win probability increased by a percentage point or more (for instance, to 63 percent from 62 percent). Now, changes like that are going to be fairly common, and there will often be larger shifts. Thursday, for example, was a good but hardly spectacular day for Mr. Obama in the polls, and that was enough to produce about a 5 percent swing toward him. Friday, however, brought a 2 percent shift back toward Mr. Romney, despite polling that seemed fairly mixed on the surface. There are some other reasons the forecast is likely to become more volatile over these final two weeks. The FiveThirtyEight forecast is technically a combination of a polling-based model and a “fundamentals” model based on economic statistics and Mr. Obama’s incumbency status. The forecast is also designed, however, to weight the economic component less and less as time goes on, eventually defaulting to a purely poll-based model by Election Day. (The guiding principle behind this is simply that voters’ views of the economy should be priced into the polling by late in the race.) Although the economic component of the model is dynamic — it can change as new economic statistics are released — it is generally less volatile than the polling component. (While there have been some ups and downs in the economic numbers, nothing has changed the basic story of an economy that is recovering, but slowly.) So as the polling component comes to predominate, the overall forecast will become more volatile as well. Photo Also, the model is designed to be more aggressive about buying into a potential change in the polls in the closing stages of the race. Most people’s intuition will lead them to overstate the volatility in the presidential race. Furthermore, they often do so for the wrong reasons — because they pay too much attention to one or two outlier polls rather than to the consensus evidence. On the other hand, because we are often now getting 20 polls on a given day — instead of two or three — there is potentially more evidence to testify to a statistically meaningful change in the race if it is reflected in the polling consensus. Furthermore, it is now late enough in the race that news events that produce what would ordinarily be a temporary “bounce” in the polls could carry forward to Election Day. The writer Jazz Shaw joked recently, for instance, that he didn’t think Mr. Romney’s bounce from his debate in Denver would persist for more than another four weeks — just long enough, of course, that it might be enough to win him the election on Nov. 6. Perhaps in some abstract sense, this is true. If Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama debated another 10 times, and the election were held next March, the Denver debate would be discounted by voters. But it won’t be such a distant memory when voters go to the polls in 17 days. ||||| A cluster of party and outside groups gives Republican nominee Mitt Romney an overall cash on hand lead, but President Obama has greater control over the campaign cash at his disposal, reports show.

Ebenhack, AP) Story Highlights Obama leads in cash that is under the sole control of the candidate. Republican Party and outside groups give Romney an overall cash advantage WASHINGTON – Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the Republican Party and a constellation of outside GOP groups entered the final campaign stretch with a nearly 46 million cash advantage for the last-minute advertising and get-out-the-vote push in this nail-biter election, a USA TODAY analysis of new campaign reports shows. The candidates and political parties collectively have raised close to 2 billion through the end of September, giving Romney and President Obama ample cash to devote legions of staffers to swing states. Both men and their allies readied a fresh round of advertising over the weekend ahead of Monday's third and final debate in Boca Raton, Fla. A Romney ad released Sunday describes him as a bipartisan problem-solver during his tenure as Massachusetts governor. A new Obama ad in Ohio, a manufacturing state with 18 Electoral College votes, faults Romney for not supporting the federal auto bailout. \\"There's certainly no shortage of cash to do the things they need to do between now and Election Day,\\" said Costas Panagopoulos, a Fordham University political scientist. \\"As helpful as money can be in an election, it can also have the potential to backfire given how concentrated it is in battleground states. \\"In places that have been targeted for months, there are some people who just can't wait for this election to be over,\\" he said. The campaign-finance reports filed over the weekend show Obama's camp spent heavily to deploy staffers throughout the country and to blister Romney on the airwaves in September. The president's campaign employed 974 staffers to Romney's 434 last month and outspent Romney by more than 2-to-1 on advertising, mailings and postage. Filings show Romney rewarded his staffers with bonuses, handing out more than 217,000 to 10 top aides last month. The biggest check, 37,500, went to political director Rich Beeson. The payments marked the second round of bonuses to staffers for helping Romney secure his party's nomination. More than 207,000 in bonuses had been paid out in August. The Republican has ramped up his advertising spending in recent weeks, aided by a fundraising surge after his strong performance in the first of three presidential debates on Oct. 3. Romney raised more than 27 million online during the first two weeks of October — more than the campaign had previously collected on the Internet in a single previous month, campaign aides said this weekend. \\"Our campaign has the resources and organization to win,\\" Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul said. Obama campaign officials said the president scored the most lucrative day of campaign fundraising of his political career Oct. 17, a day after the candidates' second, feisty debate at Hofstra University. The campaign said it has amassed more than 4 million donors. Campaign spokesman Adam Fetcher said the money is being plowed into the ground game, which he said is leading to large numbers of Democrats turning out to vote early in swing states. In a bid to promote early voting, Obama plans a whirlwind campaign tour, starting Wednesday that will take him to six battleground states in 48 hours and end with him casting an early ballot in Chicago. Among Republican groups, the Republican National Committee started this month with the biggest pile of available cash, stockpiling 82.6 million to spend in the final weeks. Relying on the party's money poses a potential risk to Romney, however, because there are limits on how closely candidates and parties can coordinate their activities. While Democrats ended the month with less available cash, two-thirds of that money remained in Obama's direct control. Reports released over the weekend also show independent super PACs aiding Obama and Romney had among their strongest fundraising months in September, as some of America's wealthiest individuals wrote seven-figure checks to influence the presidential race. The pro-Obama Priorities USA Action led the way, taking in nearly 15.3 million — its best monthly haul, after struggling to compete with Republican groups earlier in the campaign. Donors writing 1 million checks to the group last month included director Steven Spielberg, DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg, the United Auto Workers union, and David Boies, the Democratic super lawyer who represented Al Gore in the Supreme Court case that decided the 2000 presidential election. The last-minute generosity of Democratic donors helped Priorities best the pro-Romney super PAC, Restore Our Future. That group took in 14.8 million last month, boosted by checks from Houston homebuilder Bob Perry, who gave 2 million and 1 million from Houston Texans owner Bob McNair. Records show 63 corporations donated a total of 4 million to the group in September. American Crossroads, a major Republican super PAC backed by former Bush administration strategist Karl Rove, raised 11.7 million, its strongest month of the year. Top donors include Dallas billionaire industrialist Harold Simmons, who gave 2.5 million. In all, Simmons and his wife have donated nearly 22 million to Republican super PACs in this election. Seventy percent of the money has flowed to Crossroads. Details on October fundraising comes Thursday when candidates, the political parties and super PACs file their final reports before the election. ||||| If only women voted, President Obama would be on track for a landslide re-election, equaling or exceeding his margin of victory over John McCain in 2008. Mr. Obama would be an overwhelming favorite in Ohio, Florida, Virginia and most every other place that is conventionally considered a swing state. The only question would be whether he could forge ahead into traditionally red states, like Georgia, Montana and Arizona. If only men voted, Mr. Obama would be biding his time until a crushing defeat at the hands of Mitt Romney, who might win by a similar margin to the one Ronald Reagan realized over Jimmy Carter in 1980. Only California, Illinois, Hawaii and a few states in the Northeast could be considered safely Democratic. Every other state would lean red, or would at least be a toss-up. Although polls disagree on the exact magnitude of the gender gap (and a couple of recent ones seemed to show Mitt Romney eliminating the president’s advantage with women voters), the consensus of surveys points to a large one this year — rivaling the biggest from past elections. The gender gap is nothing new in American politics. Since 1972, when exit polling became widespread, men and women split their votes in three elections: 1996, 2000, and 2004. They came close to doing so on several other occasions. In 2008, for example, Mr. Obama won resoundingly among women, beating Mr. McCain by 13 points, but only won by a single point among men. The biggest gender gap to date in the exit polls came in 2000, when Al Gore won by 11 points among women, but George W. Bush won by 9 points among men — a 20-point difference. The numbers this year look very close to that. Since the first presidential debate in Denver, there have been 10 high-quality national polls that reported a breakout of results between men and women. (I define a “high-quality” poll as one that used live telephone interviews, and which called both landlines and cellphones. These polls will collect the most representative samples and should provide for the most reliable benchmarks of demographic trends.) The results in the polls were varied, with the gender gap ranging from 33 points (in a Zogby telephone poll for the Washington Times) to just 8 (in polls by Pew Research and by The Washington Post). On average, however, there was an 18-point gender gap, with Mr. Obama leading by an average of 9 points among women but trailing by 9 points among men. Photo If that difference carries forward to the exit polls, it would reflect among the largest gender splits ever, rivaling the 20-point difference from 2000, and a 17-point difference in both 1980 and 1996. Photo The gender gap has been growing over time. It was nearly absent, for instance, in 1972 and 1976, the first two years that the exit polls tested it. But after the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, reproductive rights became a greater focus in presidential elections — particularly under Ronald Reagan in 1980, who was more willing to campaign on the issue of abortion than most of his predecessors. The gender gap jumped to 17 points that year, with men much more likely to vote for Mr. Reagan. The gender gap has sometimes been widest when there is a Democratic president running for re-election, as in 1980 or 1996 (or a Democratic vice president looking to ascend to the presidency, as in 2000). Women, apart from their tendency to vote Democratic, also seem slightly more inclined than men to give the incumbent party another chance. When the incumbent is a Republican, as in 1976 or 1992, this can mitigate the gender gap. When the incumbent is a Democrat instead, as for Mr. Obama this year, both trends operate in the same direction, making it wider. One area where gender politics is less important is in planning Electoral College strategy, since roughly equal numbers of men and women vote in each state. Nevertheless, the Electoral College can serve as a way to demonstrate to scope of the difference in how men and women vote. If the current FiveThirtyEight forecast were re-calibrated to show an overall 9-point lead for Mr. Obama — his lead among women in polls since the Denver debate — he would be a clear favorite in states totaling 347 electoral votes. Mr. Romney would be favored in states containing just 140 electoral votes. Another 51 electoral votes would be too close to call. Photo About the opposite would happen if Mr. Romney led nationally by 9 points — his current advantage among men. He would be all but certain to win states with a total of 321 electoral votes, and would be highly competitive in traditionally blue-leaning states like New Jersey, Oregon, and Washington. Photo The large gender gap comes despite the fact that men and women’s economic roles are becoming more equal — according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women represented 47 percent of the labor force as of September — and that women suffered at least as much as men in the recent economic downturn. The unemployment rate among women was 7.5 percent as of September — up from 7.0 percent when Mr. Obama took office in January 2009. The unemployment rate among men is higher — 8.0 percent as of September — but it has declined rather than increased since Mr. Obama took office. It had been 8.6 percent in January 2009, and peaked at as high as 11.2 percent later that year. This suggests the gender gap instead has more to do with partisan ideology than with pocketbook voting; apart from their views on abortion, women also take more liberal stances than men on social issues ranging from same-sex marriage to gun control. Presidential candidates have faced increasing pressure to align with the bases of their parties on social issues. Mr. Obama reversed his previous position to support same-sex marriage this year. Mr. Romney has long since abandoned a number of moderate stances he took on social issues as governor of Massachusetts, when he said he supported abortion rights. So long as the ideological gap between the parties grows, the gender gap may grow as well. ||||| DELRAY BEACH, Fla. — Mitt Romney has taken a narrow national lead, tightened the gender gap and expanded his edge over President Barack Obama on who would best grow the economy. A new POLITICO/George Washington University Battleground Tracking Poll of 1,000 likely voters — taken from Sunday through Thursday of last week — shows Romney ahead of Obama by 2 percentage points, 49 to 47 percent. That represents a 3-point swing in the GOP nominee’s direction from a week ago but is still within the margin of error. Obama led 49 percent to 48 percent the week before. Text Size - + reset Presidential polls: Mitt leads POLITICO/GWU latest Romney’s toughest debate: POLITICO Game Film Romney has not led in the poll since the beginning of May. Across the 10 states identified by POLITICO as competitive, Romney leads 50 percent to 48 percent. On the generic congressional ballot, Republicans now tie Democrats, 46 percent to 46 percent, after trailing slightly over the past six weeks. Two weeks from Election Day, the GOP nominee also continues to maintain a potentially pivotal advantage in intensity among his supporters. Seventy-two percent of those who support Obama say they are “extremely likely” to vote, compared to 80 percent who back Romney. Among this group, Romney leads Obama by 7 points, 52 percent to 45 percent. Women propelled Romney’s move into first place in the poll — a majority of which was conducted before the Hofstra debate. Obama’s 11-point advantage a week ago among the crucially important group dwindled to 6 points. The Democratic incumbent still leads 51 to 45 percent with women, but Romney leads by 10 points among men. Romney also doubled the size of his advantage over Obama on which candidate would better handle the economy. This week, 51 percent of respondents picked Romney and 45 percent chose Obama, compared to 50 percent for Romney and 47 percent for Obama a week ago. The former Massachusetts governor also leads by 4 points, 50 to 46 percent, on who would create more jobs. A majority, 53 percent, disapprove of Obama’s handling of the economy, compared to 45 percent who approve. That 8-point spread was only 3 points a week ago. Celinda Lake, the Democratic pollster who helped conduct the poll, sees the drop in Obama’s support among women and who can best handle the economy as connected. Obama now has only a 4-point advantage among women on who is better for the economy, even though respondents give the president significantly higher marks on a host of other questions, such as who shares their values and who is fighting hardest for the middle class. Romney, meanwhile, is again underwater with women on likability: Forty0five percent view him favorably, and 50 percent view him unfavorably. ||||| 5 days ago (CNN) - Put down that checkbook: Mitt Romney's formal fund-raiser season is over. Just over two weeks out from Election Day, the Republican presidential candidate held on Saturday night his final formal fund-raising event, spokesman Rick Gorka said. – Follow the Ticker on Twitter: @PoliticalTicker – Check out the CNN Electoral Map and Calculator and game out your own strategy for November. Romney has attended fund-raisers from coast to coast - and even overseas in London and Israel - on his quest to win the White House. In total, he has raised more than 361.3 million this cycle, Federal Election Commission records through the end of September show. From these events came a number of headlines, such as the candidate's 47% remarks and the detailed suggestion of several government departments he might scale back or close. Between fund-raising events in August, the candidate told reporters he would rather be on the campaign trail, but fund-raising would be essential to remain competitive with President Barack Obama. Through the end of September, Obama raised more than 567.4 million, according to FEC records. \\"That's a challenge with a president who blew through the federal spending limits,\\" Romney said. \\"It means that campaigns now have to spend a disproportionate amount of time fund-raising. You appreciate all the help you get, but you wish you could spend more time on the campaign trail.\\" Saturday's final fund-raisers - which included events at two separate locations for donors of different levels - were held at private homes and reporters were not allowed to attend. The first half was held at the home of Dwight Schar, who is part owner of the Washington Redskins. The second half was at the home of billionaire investor Wilbur Ross. Although he will no longer attend formal fund-raising events, the GOP candidate will continue to accept donations through his website, by mail and via text message. His running mate, Rep.

Write an article based on this summary: A government-backed pensioner bond offering competitive rates of up to 4% interest is to be offered for a further three months, George Osborne has said.","completion":"Title: Government-backed Pensioner Bond: Extending Competitive Rates for The Elderly Introduction Chancellor George Osborne recently announced the extension of a government-backed pensioner bond offering competitive interest rates of up to 4%. The initiative, designed to support the financial well-being of senior citizens, is being extended for an additional three months. The move showcases the government's commitment to addressing the financial challenges faced by elderly citizens in today's world. This article delves into the details and implications of this extension and how it stands to benefit the senior citizens of the country. Government-backed Pensioner Bond: A Brief Overview The government-backed pensioner bond is a financial product designed explicitly for the elderly population. It offers attractive interest rates, typically higher than those available in the market. The bond's primary aim is to offer pensioners an opportunity to invest and earn higher returns on their savings, thereby improving their financial stability and quality of life. Extended Tenure and Competitive Interest Rates Chancellor George Osborne's decision to extend the offering of this bond for another three months allows more pensioners to tap into the benefits it offers. The bond is open for investment to individuals aged 65 and above; it provides an investment avenue with attractive interest rates, ensuring a stable and assured income for them. The extension comes as a response to the overwhelming demand and success of the initial phase of the government-backed pensioner bond. The bonds offer interest rates of up to 4%, which is significantly higher than the average interest rates currently available in the market. This extension is expected to attract more senior citizens, who will now have an opportunity to invest in the scheme and enjoy higher returns. Impact on the Elderly Population The extended offering of the government-backed pensioner bond could potentially have a significant positive impact on the elderly population. The bond's attractive interest rates make it an ideal investment option for senior citizens, helping them maintain their financial independence. Additionally, the bond's secure nature instills confidence in investors. With the ongoing challenges faced by pensioners due to low-interest rates and the ever-increasing cost of living, the extension of this bond is a welcome move. By delivering a higher return on savings and ensuring steady income, the bond directly addresses the financial concerns faced by the elderly population. Furthermore, the bond's popularity serves as an indication of the need for more inclusive financial products for the elderly. The government's decision to extend the offering demonstrates a commitment to providing suitable financial support for aging citizens. Conclusion The extension of the government-backed pensioner bond for an additional three months is a step in the right direction, offering senior citizens more investment opportunities with competitive interest rates. By providing seniors with a secure and lucrative financial product, the government demonstrates its commitment to addressing the financial challenges experienced by the elderly. The bond's success also highlights the need for more inclusive financial options for senior citizens. As the country's population continues to age, it becomes crucial that government and financial institutions devise more innovative strategies to cater to the evolving needs of this demographic. The pensioner bond's popularity illustrates the demand for such products, and the extended offering will help meet the needs of more seniors seeking financial stability in their golden years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","completion":"Flamingos, three species of prion, and some ducks are unlikely to be found with an insect in their diet, as they are filter feeders. Filter feeders use specialized adaptations to strain food particles (such as algae, plankton, or small animals) from water, rather than actively hunting and consuming insects.

While some people prefer to to throw an overhead pass with one hand, utilizing both of your hands will make it so you have more control over the ball. Make sure that your thumb is behind the ball and that your fingers are tightly gripping the sides. Use an overhead pass if there is a large distance between you and your teammate, if there is a potential for a break down the court, or you need to pass the ball over defenders' heads. The grip you use on an overhead pass is the same as you'd use for a chest or bounce pass. Lift the ball over your head so that your fingers are pointing towards the ceiling. Your elbows should be pointed forward, in front of you, with your legs slightly bent and your hips squared up. Make sure your dominant foot is slightly behind your other foot. Do not put the ball behind your head. This is the perfect opportunity for the opposing team to steal the ball from behind you. Make sure you have identified your target before bringing the ball up over your head. Release the ball by bringing your arms down and snapping your wrists forward. Keep your elbows in, and aim for the chest of your target. If you need to really get the ball far down the court, a large arc on the ball is good, especially because you want to keep it over defenders heads. If you are closer to your teammate you should limit the arc because it can be easily stolen by a defender. The bigger your step, the more power you put into your pass.

In Sentence 2, the main point is that the company offers a matching program where they match up to 50% of retirement investments. Step 2: Compare the main points of both sentences. Comparing the main points, Sentence 2 provides more specific information about the matching program offered by the company, while Sentence 1 only suggests the possibility of such a program existing. Step 3: Determine the relationship between the main points. Since Sentence 1 suggests the possibility of a matching program and Sentence 2 describes the details of that program, there seems to be a connection between the two. Step 4: Make a conclusion. Based on the comparison, if Sentence 1 is true - meaning there is a possibility that the company has a matching program - then it is possible that Sentence 2 is also true, as it provides details about the type of matching program the company offers. However, Sentence 1 doesn't definitely confirm the existence of the program, so we cannot conclusively say that Sentence 2 is true based on Sentence 1 alone."},{"prompt":"Question: Information: - Georgian architecture is the name given in most English-speaking countries to the set of architectural styles current between 1714 and 1830. It is eponymous for the first four British monarchs of the House of HanoverGeorge I, George II, George III, and George IVwho reigned in continuous succession from August 1714 to June 1830. The style was revived in the late 19th century in the United States as Colonial Revival architecture and in the early 20th century in Great Britain as Neo-Georgian architecture; in both it is also called Georgian Revival architecture. In America the term \\"Georgian\\" is generally used to describe all building from the period, regardless of style; in Britain it is generally restricted to buildings that are \\"architectural in intention\\", and have stylistic characteristics that are typical of the period, though that covers a wide range. Characteristics. The style of Georgian buildings is very variable, but marked by a taste for symmetry and proportion based on the classical architecture of Greece and Rome, as revived in Renaissance architecture. Ornament is also normally in the classical tradition, but typically rather restrained, and sometimes almost completely absent on the exterior. The period brought the vocabulary of classical architecture to smaller and more modest buildings than had been the case before, replacing English vernacular architecture (or becoming the new vernacular style) for almost all new middle-class homes and public buildings by the end of the period. - Middlesex (abbreviation: Middx) was a county in southeast England that is now mostly part of Greater London, with small sections in neighbouring counties. It was established in the Anglo-Saxon system from the territory of the Middle Saxons, and existed as an official unit until 1965. The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from east to west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries. The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831. - Calligraphy is a visual art related to writing. It is the design and execution of lettering with a broad tip instrument, brush, among other writing instruments. A contemporary calligraphic practice can be defined as, \\"the art of giving form to signs in an expressive, harmonious, and skillful manner\\". - The London Borough of Harrow is a London borough of north-west London, England. It borders Hertfordshire to the north and other London boroughs: Hillingdon to the west, Ealing to the south, Brent to the south-east and Barnet to the east. The local authority is Harrow London Borough Council. - Vellum (derived from the Latin word \\"vitulinum\\" meaning \\"made from calf\\", leading to Old French \\"vélin\\", \\"calfskin\\") often refers to a parchment made from calf skin, as opposed to that from other animals. It is prepared for writing or printing on, to produce single pages, scrolls, codices or books. The term is sometimes used with a more general meaning referring to finer-quality parchments made from a variety of animal skins. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - A charity school, sometimes called a blue coat school, was significant in the history of education in England. It was erected and maintained in various parishes by the voluntary contributions of the inhabitants for teaching poor children to read, write, and other necessary parts of education. It was usually maintained by religious organizations, which provided clothing and education to students freely or at little charge. In most charity schools, children were likewise put out to trades, services, etc., on the same charitable foundation. Some schools were more ambitious than this and sent a few pupils on to university, as depicted in the illustration. - The Public Schools Act 1868 was enacted by the British Parliament to reform and regulate seven of the leading English boys' schools of the time, most of which had grown out of ancient charity schools for the education of a certain number of poor scholars, but were then, as they do today, also educating many sons of the English upper and upper-middle classes on a fee-paying basis. - Letters patent (always in the plural) are a type of legal instrument in the form of a published written order issued by a monarch, president, or other head of state, generally granting an office, right, monopoly, title, or status to a person or corporation.

Letters patent are issued for the appointment of representatives of the Crown, such as governors and governors-general of Commonwealth realms, as well as appointing a Royal Commission. In the United Kingdom they are also issued for the creation of peers of the realm. A particular form of letters patent has evolved into the modern patent (referred to as a utility patent or design patent in United States patent law) granting exclusive rights in an invention (or a design in the case of a design patent). In this case it is essential that the written grant should be in the form of a public document so other inventors can consult it to avoid infringement and also to understand how to \\"practice\\" the invention, i.e., put it into practical use. - Harrow is a large suburban town in the London Borough of Harrow, northwest London, England.

Basically every day of my life has been being blamed for his misdeeds or getting yelled at, or just getting criticized on everything. I'm now a senior and I (18) have the best girlfriend (18) in the world. We get along really well and I have thought from the day that I met her that I wanted to marry her. I talked to her about this and she said she felt the same way. I understand high school relationships don't usually become lifetime commitments but I really want this to work. So when I mentioned this to my mother, who I absolutely adore, my dad was eavesdropping and laughed aloud. We both turned and he said that a girl like her, he had met my gf, wouldn't marry someone like me. I got mad and told him that he was just doing that to piss me off. This instantly made him mad and he stomped upstairs. This happened about 6 months ago, and I still haven't forgotten it.

A). no; B). yes;","completion":"To answer the first question: \\"Why do old people become grumpy as they age?\\" Step 1: Understanding the question I need to provide an explanation for why some elderly individuals may become grumpier as they age. Step 2: Research factors that may contribute to increased grumpiness in older individuals After researching, it seems several factors can contribute to this change in behavior: 1. Physical discomfort/pain: As people age, they may experience more aches and pains, which can make them irritable. 2. Cognitive decline: Deterioration of cognitive functions may cause them to become more easily frustrated or upset. 3. Loss of independence: Older individuals might feel a loss of control over their lives, making them more irritable. 4. Social isolation: Lack of social contact or the death of loved ones can lead to negative moods and grumpiness. 5. Changes in sleep patterns: Sleep disturbances are common in older people, and poor sleep can lead to irritability.

Process: - An airline reservation is made - The passenger arrives early at the airport - The luggage is checked - The passenger waits in line - The passenger shows their identification and gets a boarding pass - The passenger goes to their gate - The passenger gets in line when it's time to board - The person boards the plane - The plane arrives at the destination - The passenger gets off the plane at their destination. Question: suppose less oxygen travels in the body happens, how will it affect passenger arrives later. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"B: less If less oxygen travels in the body, it can negatively affect the passenger who arrives later at the airport. This occurs mainly due to the consequences of decreased oxygen supply on the body's overall functioning. The detailed explanation of this effect includes: 1. Lower energy levels: When less oxygen is supplied to the body, it can lead to reduced energy production. Since oxygen plays a crucial role in cellular respiration and energy production, a decreased level of oxygen can make the passenger feel fatigued or exhausted. This condition can make it challenging for the passenger to manage their luggage and proceed through the various steps involved in boarding the plane. 2. Impaired cognitive function: Adequate oxygen supply is essential for the optimal functioning of the brain. Reduced oxygen levels can impair cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and decision-making. This could result in the passenger being forgetful about essential documents or making slow and incorrect decisions in the boarding process, leading to further delays. 3. Increased stress levels: Stress and anxiety can increase when the body receives less oxygen. High-stress levels can make it difficult for the passenger to focus on their journey and manage time effectively. Moreover, stress can exacerbate feelings of fatigue and might lead to irritability, making it harder for the passenger to cooperate with airport staff and other travelers. 4. Risk of altitude sickness: If the passenger arrives later, they might not have enough time to acclimate to the altitude (if they are traveling to or from a high-altitude location). Altitude sickness can result from lower oxygen levels in the blood and is characterized by symptoms such as headache, dizziness, and nausea. This can significantly affect the passenger's overall condition, making it harder for them to efficiently navigate the airport and board their flight on time. 5. Health complications: Depending on the degree of oxygen reduction in the body, the passenger might experience some severe health problems. Shortness of breath, chest pain, and even fainting episodes can make it difficult for the passenger to complete the boarding process, and might require medical assistance. In conclusion, less oxygen traveling in the body can have a considerable impact on a passenger who arrives later at the airport. It can lead to fatigue, cognitive impairments, increased stress, and potential health risks, all of which can negatively affect the ease and efficiency of the passenger's journey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, the increase in fallen branches may influence the bird's selection of twigs and other materials for constructing the nest.

The equation has two constants, -848 and 936. We will add these two numbers to simplify the equation. -848 + 936 = 88 Now the equation becomes: 0 = -11*h + 88 Step 2: Isolate the variable h To do this, we need to get h by itself on one side of the equation. Right now, 88 is being added to -11*h, so we will subtract 88 from both sides of the equation. 0 - 88 = -11*h + 88 - 88 Which simplifies to: -88 = -11*h Step 3: Solve for h Now, we need to get h by itself. Since h is being multiplied by -11, we will divide both sides of the equation by -11. (-88) / (-11) = (-11*h) / (-11) Which simplifies to: 8 = h So, h = 8."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It took the top spot for cleanest air in all three of the American Lung Association's pollution categories: ozone, as well as short-term and year-round particle pollution (see footnote). \\"We don't have any dirty industries here,\\" said Richard Goodyear, chief of the Air Quality Bureau for the state's environmental agency. In fact, the closest major power plant is about 200 miles away in the northwest corner of the state, he said. The state's strict emission standards can also be credited for its high air quality. According to Goodyear, New Mexico's rules are more stringent for nitrous oxide and other pollutants than those of the Environmental Protection Agency. Year-round particle pollution is in the air we breathe and consists of such things as dust, metals, smoke, exhaust, pollen and acids, like nitrates and sulfates. Short-term particle pollution is measured over a 24-hour period. Ozone is created when a chemical or fossil fuel, like coal or gasoline, is partially burned and the unburned hydrocarbons, when combined with ultraviolet light, form a gas that is corrosive to lungs.

Marvelous cult film from 1979 in which the students of Vince Lombardi High School are confronted with a new, dictatorial principal named Miss Togar (Mary Woronov). Togar is a music hater and blames the musical tastes of the students for their transgressions. Leading the charge against her is fun-loving Riff Randell (P.J. Soles), the #1 Ramones fan who, more than anything, wants the rock group to record her songs. Now *this* is an impossible movie to resist. First and foremost, the soundtrack is incredible, with songs by such artists as Alice Cooper and the Velvet Underground in addition to the infectious non-stop assortment of Ramones songs. \\"Teenage Lobotomy\\", \\"Sheena is a Punk Rocker\\", and \\"Blitzkrieg Bop\\" are just a few of them. Next, the cast truly gives it their all, with Soles an ideal choice for the role of Riff; she is a true delight. Vincent Van Patten and Dey Young are earnest as Tom and Kate, Woronov is well cast against type as the snooty and disdainful Togar, Clint Howard has one of his best ever parts as washroom-occupying entrepreneur Eaglebauer, and New World regulars such as Dick Miller, Paul Bartel (particularly fun as music teacher Mr. McGree) and The Real Don Steele are fun as always. And, of course, it's a treat to see The Ramones playing themselves. The movie has true spirit. The energy level is high, with co-story author and director Allan Arkush bringing a great deal of flair to the proceedings. There's also a great sense of humor. The paper airplane gag is a superb example of this. This extends right to the \\"wipe\\" style of scene transitions.

We see the room's occupant, retired Special Forces Colonel Stuart (William Sadler), practicing martial arts exercises, nude. The reporter on TV notes that two years ago, Esperanza led his country's military campaign against communist insurgents, financed by the United States, but recently, several high-ranking Pentagon officials have been charged with violating a congressional ban and supplying him with weapons. Mounting evidence that Esperanza violated the neutrality of neighboring countries also made Congress withhold funding, which he is accused of replacing by entering the market of drug trafficking. At that point, Stuart's watch goes off, and he pulls his coat out of the closet, then turns off the TV, aiming the remote like a gunfighter.In the terminal, McClane finds the payphones.

Background: Rene Noel Theophile Girard (; French: [ZiRaR]; 25 December 1923 - 4 November 2015) was a French historian, literary critic, and philosopher of social science whose work belongs to the tradition of anthropological philosophy. Girard was the author of nearly thirty books, with his writings spanning many academic domains. Context: In Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World, Girard discusses for the first time Christianity and the Bible. The Gospels ostensibly present themselves as a typical mythical account, with a victim-god lynched by a unanimous crowd, an event that is then commemorated by Christians through ritual sacrifice -- a material re-presentation in this case -- in the Eucharist. The parallel is perfect except for one detail: the truth of the innocence of the victim is proclaimed by the text and the writer. The mythical account is usually built on the lie of the guilt of the victim in as much as it is an account of the event seen from the viewpoint of the anonymous lynchers. This ignorance is indispensable to the efficacy of the sacrificial violence. The evangelical \\"good news\\" clearly affirms the innocence of the victim, thus becoming, by attacking ignorance, the germ of the destruction of the sacrificial order on which rests the equilibrium of societies. Already the Old Testament shows this turning inside-out of the mythic accounts with regard to the innocence of the victims (Abel, Joseph, Job...), and the Hebrews were conscious of the uniqueness of their religious tradition. With the Gospels, it is with full clarity that are unveiled these \\"things hidden since the foundation of the world\\" (Matthew 13:35), the foundation of social order on murder, described in all its repulsive ugliness in the account of the Passion. This revelation is even clearer because the text is a work on desire and violence, from the serpent setting alight the desire of Eve in paradise to the prodigious strength of the mimetism that brings about the denial of Peter during the Passion (Mark 14: 66-72; Luke 22:54-62). Girard reinterprets certain biblical expressions in light of his theories; for instance, he sees \\"scandal\\" (skandalon, literally, a \\"snare\\", or an \\"impediment placed in the way and causing one to stumble or fall\\") as signifying mimetic rivalry, for example Peter's denial of Jesus. No one escapes responsibility, neither the envious nor the envied: \\"Woe to the man through whom scandal comes\\" (Matthew 18:7). Question: Is there anything else interesting about his views on Biblical texts?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Rene Girard, a French historian and philosopher, had some interesting views on Biblical texts. One of his main ideas is that the Bible, especially the Gospels, reveals the truth about human violence and the innocence of the victims. This is different from other myths, which usually focus on the guilt of the victim. Girard believed that by showing the innocence of the victims, the Bible helps destroy the cycle of violence that societies are built upon. Another interesting aspect of Girard's view on Biblical texts is his idea about \\"scandal\\" or \\"snare.\\" He thinks that scandal represents mimetic rivalry, which means people copying each other's desires and actions, leading to conflict and violence. For example, when Peter denies Jesus, it's because he gets caught in this cycle of mimetic rivalry. So, Girard's views on the Bible highlight the importance of recognizing the innocence of victims and understanding the dangers of mimetic rivalry to help break the cycle of violence in society."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Next question: when did girl on the train come to theaters?","completion":"\\"The Girl on the Train\\" is a psychological thriller film directed by Tate Taylor and written by Erin Cressida Wilson. The movie is based on a 2015 novel of the same name by British author Paula Hawkins. A key aspect of the novel and the movie is the unreliable narration offered by the protagonist who is entangled in a missing person's investigation, yet struggles with her own problematic alcohol consumption and the blurry memories it spawns. The film features an ensemble cast that includes Emily Blunt, Rebecca Ferguson, Haley Bennett, Justin Theroux, Luke Evans, Allison Janney, Edgar Ramirez, and Lisa Kudrow. Emily Blunt received wide acclaim for her portrayal of the main character, Rachel Watson. When it comes to the release of the movie \\"The Girl on the Train\\", there are usually two dates people inquire about, namely: The date of its world premiere (which is usually held at a film festival or a special event) and the date of its general theatrical release. \\"The Girl on the Train\\" had its world premiere in London on September 20, 2016. After this highly anticipated premiere event, the movie was released in theaters in the United Kingdom on October 5, 2016. For the United States, \\"The Girl on the Train\\" was released in theaters a few days later on October 7, 2016. The release was spread over the non-holiday period of October, a choice that was likely made based on factors such as the availability of theaters, competition from other films, marketing strategies, and potentially capitalizing on the Halloween season known for its uptick in interest for thriller and horror movies. The film was later released on digital download on January 3, 2017, followed by a DVD and Blu-ray release on January 17, 2017. Since its release, the film has gained a mixed to positive reception from critics and audiences, with particular praise going to Emily Blunt's performance. Despite the mixed reviews, the film was a commercial success, grossing over 173 million worldwide against a 45 million budget."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article:A race that has turned the political rules on their head, we'll know in few days if the actual result does so too. And here's a reminder of how a Jeremy Corbyn victory might seem almost unintentional. I understand a few weeks ago, one of Mr Corbyn's own senior supporters urged him to consider pulling out of the race. The left wing's point of making its voice heard by entering a candidate had been proven, they said. The supporter told Mr Corbyn that he should think about withdrawing because, after all, he's never entered with any intention of winning. The message was, this has gone far enough, time to stop. The request fell on deaf ears I'm told. After the success Corbyn's campaign has had in attracting new supporters and crowds around the country, who can blame him for answering that he believed he could win, and go on to become prime Minister? He is not like most politicians, but he is a politician after all. His team won't confirm that such a conversation took place, but they don't deny it. A spokeswoman said \\"Jeremy Corbyn is standing to be the next PM. The question is, who will be the Tory candidate?\\" This gives an intriguing picture of how despite the hype, even some of his senior supporters have concerns about his mission and its long term impact on Labour's fortunes. As the former Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, who knows Corbyn well, suggested, perhaps the person who is most terrified about Jeremy Corbyn winning is Jeremy Corbyn. Despite the clamour of the summer, there is not enough reliable data, nor understanding of the implications of the new expanded electorate to predict the result with any confidence. And in the last couple of weeks the fizz has gone out of the Corbyn campaign and both Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham's teams report support coming their way. But if Mr Corbyn does win, he may well be haunted by a sense that he didn't really want the job in the first place. Refreshing to some perhaps, but for the Labour Party itself, a worry to many more. A summary of the above article is?","completion":"In a surprising turn of political events, Jeremy Corbyn's victory in the race has raised questions about his original intentions.

To provide a detailed and long answer, let's delve into what Spumante is and why it is classified as an entity in this context. Spumante is a type of Italian sparkling wine, primarily known for its effervescence and distinctive flavor profile. In Italian, \\"spumante\\" translates to \\"foaming\\" or \\"sparkling,\\" which refers to the carbonation that gives this wine its bubbly characteristic. While there are many different kinds of sparkling wines produced across various regions in Italy, Spumante encompasses a broader category, and wines bearing this label can be made from different grape varietals, with varying levels of sweetness and production methods. There are several subcategories of Spumante wines, including Asti Spumante, which originates from the Piedmont region and is made primarily from the Moscato Bianco grape, and Prosecco Spumante, which comes from the Veneto region and is made using the Glera grape variety. The method of production can also differ, as some Spumante wines are produced using the Metodo Classico (Champagne method), while others may be made using the Charmat-Martinotti method, where secondary fermentation takes place in large pressurized tanks rather than individual bottles. As a specific type of sparkling wine, Spumante falls under the broader category of \\"wine,\\" which in turn, is an entity. An entity can be defined as an object or concept that exists independently and can be distinctly recognized. Spumante, as an individual subclass of wine, has recognizable characteristics that set it apart from other wines, such as its carbonation and various production methods.

A:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"light.\\" Based on the information you provided, coral reefs provide food and shelter to animals that require \\"salinity.\\" Coral reefs are initially formed by the accumulation and compactification of dead coral skeletons and other marine organisms.

Salinity is an essential requirement for many marine organisms, as their bodily functions are heavily dependent on maintaining appropriate balances in their internal and external environments. Coral reefs provide an essential habitat for such salty water-dependent organisms. The well-being and functioning of coral reefs are also reliant on sunlight, which is a crucial factor for photosynthesis to occur among the microscopic algae called zooxanthellae, living within coral tissues.

William Patrick Corgan Jr. (born March 17, 1967) is an American musician, songwriter, producer, poet, and professional wrestling magnate. He is best known as the lead singer, primary songwriter, guitarist, and sole permanent member of The Smashing Pumpkins. Formed by Corgan and guitarist James Iha in Chicago, Illinois, in 1988, the band quickly gained steam with the addition of bassist D'arcy Wretzky and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. Strong album sales and large-scale tours propelled the band's increasing fame in the 1990s until their break-up in 2000. William Patrick Corgan Jr. was born at Columbus Hospital in Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood on March 17, 1967 as the oldest son of William Corgan Sr., a blues/rock guitarist, and Martha Louise Maes Corgan Lutz. He was raised Catholic. His parents had one more son, Ricky, before divorcing in 1970. His father was soon remarried to a flight attendant, and Corgan and his brother went to live with them in Glendale Heights, Illinois. During this time, Corgan alleges he was subject to much physical and emotional abuse by his stepmother. Corgan also developed a protective bond with his younger paternal half-brother, who had special needs as a child. When Corgan's father and stepmother separated, all three boys would live alone with the stepmother, with both of Corgan's birth parents living separately within an hour's drive. Corgan, who grew much faster than his fellow students, was a strong athlete in elementary school. In addition to being a member of his Marquardt Middle School baseball team, he collected baseball cards (amassing over 10,000) and listened to every Chicago Cubs game. However, by the time he began attending Glenbard North High School in Carol Stream, Illinois, he had become only an average athlete. He decided to start playing guitar when he went over to a friend's house and saw his friend's Flying V. Corgan gave his savings to his father, who bought him a used Les Paul knock-off. Corgan, Sr. steered his son stylistically, encouraging him to listen to Jeff Beck and Jimi Hendrix, but offered little other support, and the younger Corgan taught himself to play the instrument. His musical interests in his formative years included hard rock like Guts-era John Cale, heavy metal pioneers Black Sabbath, and mainstream rock like Queen, Boston, ELO, Rush, and Cheap Trick. In high school, Corgan discovered alternative rock through Bauhaus and The Cure. Corgan performed in a string of bands in high school, and graduated as an honor student. Despite grant and scholarship offers from a number of schools, and a tuition fund left by his grandmother, Corgan decided to pursue music full-time. Not finding the Chicago music scene to his liking, he moved from Chicago to St. Petersburg, Florida in 1985 with his first major band, The Marked (so named for the conspicuous birthmarks of both Corgan and drummer Ron Roesing). Not finding success in St. Petersburg, the band dissolved; Corgan moved back to Chicago to live with his father. Corgan performed with Wayne Static in Static's first band Deep Blue Dream, in 1987/88.

Reviewing the album for Esquire, Gary Giddins hailed it as another landmark recording from Coleman and his most accomplished work of harmolodics, partly because of compositions which he found clearly expressed and occasionally timeless. In his opinion, the discordant keys radically transmute conventional polyphony and may be the most challenging part for listeners, who he said should concentrate on Coleman's playing and \\"let the maelstrom resolve itself around his center\\". Giddins also highlighted the melody of \\"Sleep Talk\\", deeming it among the best of the saxophonist's career. Kofi Natambu from the Detroit Metro Times wrote that Coleman's synergetic approach displays expressive immediacy rather than superficial technical flair while calling the record \\"a multi-tonal mosaic of great power, humor, color, wit, sensuality, compassion and tenderness\\". He found the songs inspirational, danceable, and encompassing developments in African-American music over the previous century. Robert Christgau called its \\"warm, listenable harmolodic funk\\" an artistic \\"breakthrough if not a miracle\\".

Berry farm, which used organic methods, no fertilizers and pesticides, and Rose farm, which used conventional agricultural methods, including fertilizers and pesticides. But I can use this background: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. What is an answer for this question: Which farm contributes less to the carrying of chemicals to nearby rivers? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background information provided and the farming practices of the two farms in the Seattle markets, it is evident that Berry farm contributes less to the carrying of chemicals to nearby rivers. Berry farm uses organic methods, which means they do not use synthetic fertilizers and pesticides on their crops. Organic farming practices prioritize ecological balance, soil health, and environmental preservation. These methods include crop rotation, cover cropping, composting, the use of organic fertilizers, and if needed, organic pesticides. As a result, the chemical runoff from Berry farm is significantly lower than that of a conventional farm. On the other hand, Rose farm relies on conventional agricultural methods, which heavily utilize chemical fertilizers and pesticides. These chemicals can easily enter the local water systems through surface runoff, which occurs when rainwater or irrigation water picks up fertilizers and pesticides from the fields and carries them to nearby rivers, lakes, or groundwater sources, causing water pollution. The dissolved fertilizer in water bodies promotes excessive growth of aquatic plants and algae, a phenomenon called eutrophication. This rapid growth can lead to dead zones, where the oxygen supply is consumed so fast that other organisms cannot survive, ultimately disrupting the balance of local ecosystems. Moreover, infiltration of these chemicals into groundwater may contaminate wells and drinking water sources, posing risks to human health if consumed. In conclusion, Berry farm contributes notably less to the carrying of chemicals to nearby rivers due to their organic farming methods. These practices help preserve the environment, minimize pollution, and maintain the balance of local ecosystems. In contrast, Rose farm, with its heavy reliance on chemical fertilizers and pesticides, contributes significantly more to water pollution and its associated risks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This is because the question seeks to identify the number of people who have pets, which involves a quantifiable aspect. To provide a more detailed answer, it is essential to consider factors influencing pet ownership, such as the specific geographical region, the type of pet, and the time frame for which the information is being requested. However, obtaining an exact numerical figure may be difficult due to the dynamic nature of pet ownership and the potential differences in the definition of pet ownership in various cultures. For example, in the United States, it is estimated that about 67% of households own a pet, as per the American Pet Products Association's 2021 report. Considering that there are approximately 128 million households in the US, one could roughly estimate that around 85.7 million households in the country have pets. The number of pets owned varies widely, as some households may have multiple pets while some may have none. To get global numbers, a similar approach would need to be taken for various countries and then combined together. It's important to note that pet ownership rates fluctuate due to factors like economic conditions, cultural attitudes towards pets, and changes in lifestyle preferences. Therefore, the numeric value would only provide an approximation and will be subject to change over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Rally Dakar podría llegar a Sudamérica Tuesday, January 8th 2008, 2:15 PM SANTIAGO DE CHILE (AP) â El gobierno chileno respaldarÃ¡ la idea de traer al paÃ­s el Rally Dakar, luego que el tradicional recorrido africano fuera cancelado por razones de seguridad. El director del gubernamental Servicio Nacional de Turismo, Oscar Santelcies, dijo que la prÃ³xima semana se enviarÃ¡ una carta a la empresa organizadora de la prueba formalizando en interÃ©s de Chile por ser parte de un eventual recorrido por paÃ­ses sudamericanos. Santelices aclarÃ³, sin embargo, que el paÃ­s no harÃ­a aportes financieros a la organizaciÃ³n del cruce del rally por su territorio. Si el proyecto se concreta, el tramo chileno serÃ­a el desierto de Atacama, en el norte del paÃ­s, donde ya se realiza cada aÃ±o un rally local. TambiÃ©n se mencionan tramos en Brasil y Argentina. El director de servicio estatal de deportes, el ex futbolista internacional Jaime Pizarro, tambiÃ©n seÃ±alÃ³ que el gobierno podrÃ­a estar interesado, ya que la idea \\"encaja en la polÃ­tica oficial\\" de alentar la realizaciÃ³n en el paÃ­s de eventos deportivos de importancia internacional. Uno de los principales propulsores de la candidatura chilena es el piloto Carlo de Gavardo, quien logrÃ³ figuraciÃ³n destacada en varias versiones del rally por territorio africano. Versiones de la prensa local aseguran que tambiÃ©n existe interÃ©s de los organizadores del rally por las Pampas en Argentina, y que si SudamÃ©rica finalmente es escogida, el recorrido incluirÃ­a un paso por territorio brasileÃ±o, posiblemente por la AmazonÃ­a. La primera versiÃ³n sobre la posibilidad de un Rally Dakar por territorio sudamericano la dio el diario deportivo espaÃ±ol As. TambiÃ©n se ha mencionado a Australia, China y Rusia u alguna otra regiÃ³n de Asia como posibles alternativas al territorio africano, descartado, al menos, por ahora tras recibirse amenazas de grupos terroristas contra los participantes. De Gavardo dijo que una de las ventajas de los paÃ­ses sudamericanos es el nivel de seguridad que ofrecen en los territorios ofrecidos para posible trazado de la prueba. El rally 2008 se disputarÃ­a posiblemente en diciembre, peo segÃºn De Gavardo la decisiÃ³n del lugar debe adoptarse a mÃ¡s tardar el prÃ³ximo mes.

Little do they know the dark secrets that lay ahead and the sinister forces at work on the island that will change their lives forever. Plot: Act 1: James, a wealthy adventurer, and his team of five friends – Sarah, an archaeologist, Tom, a thrill-seeker, Mike, a journalist, and Emma, a doctor – embark on a sailing trip around the Caribbean. After a storm pushes them off course, they find themselves approaching the rumored Isla de la Muerte. The group is intrigued by the island's forbidden reputation, and James convinces them to explore it. Act 2: Upon arrival, the group discovers remnants of an old village, with clues pointing to a long-forgotten dark past. Their investigation leads them to the remains of a cursed temple that holds the secrets of the island's unspeakable horrors. There, they accidentally awaken an ancient and malevolent curse, unleashing evil spirits that begin wreaking havoc on the island. Among the spirits is the vengeful ghost of Captain DeSilva, the island's original inhabitant, who was turned to evil by the mystical powers he found within the cursed temple. The captain, now fueled by the dark energies within him, binds himself with the spirits and seeks revenge on anyone who dares enter his island. Act 3: The group soon comes into several dangerous encounters with the ghosts and demonic creatures inhabiting the island. These terrifying events force them to confront their deepest fears and form alliances with the native spirits who want to end Captain DeSilva's reign of terror.

Risking their lives, the group manages to gather the elements needed to unlock the full potential of the artifact. In a final confrontation, James, Sarah, and the rest of the trapped spirits use the artifact's power to both save their friends and banish Captain DeSilva's evil influence, freeing the island from its curse forever.

As consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations in check. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. For their part, protozoa are important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms. Story: Students learned about protozoa in school this week.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Samsung, Lotte, LG, Hyundai: they are unavoidable, selling everything from mobiles to laptops, cars to washing machines as well as food, drink and even health insurance. Staggeringly, sales revenue from the top five chaebols are worth more than half of South Korea's entire economy. But increasingly these empires have come under the spotlight because of the influence they wield (the word chaebol is a combination of the Korean words for \\"wealth\\" and \\"clan\\"). Calls for them to be reformed have come and gone before, but as South Koreans head for a presidential election, could this time be different? At a recent protest in Seoul I watched scores of young people raise their arms and voices against chaebols and the powerful position they hold in the country. In the crowd, I met Kim Seung-yeon, a young part-time worker who was there to campaign for better pay and working conditions. Like many young Koreans, she told me the system feels stacked in favour of the chaebols. \\"Right now chaebols monopolise too much of the wealth in South Korea, and it isn't being used properly,\\" she said to me. \\"I think this needs to be corrected.\\" The frustration over the close ties between business and politics has only grown through the complex corruption scandal that has engulfed the nation. South Korea's President Park Geun-hye, and the heads of Samsung and Lotte, two of the country's biggest chaebols have all been charged with bribery. But these very same businesses helped to build South Korea at a time when the country was emerging from a war and they are vital to the economy. Nowhere was that made more apparent to me than at a study centre in the capital. There I met a group of young women who were all preparing for entrance exams to get jobs with chaebols. It is a rigorous and exhaustive process. But in South Korea's ultra-competitive society, it is also a ticket to success. \\"If I get into a chaebol it means that I will have a well-paid job, and people will look at me and think 'wow',\\" explains Kang Da-heun who was studying to get a job with Lotte. \\"It will help me with my marriage prospects, and my future will be very bright.\\" Did it bother her, I asked, that the boss of Lotte might potentially go to prison for his role in a long-running corruption scandal? \\"It won't affect the company's prospects at all,\\" she said to me. \\"Lotte will keep being Lotte.\\" On the face of it, she appeared to be right, as I learned from a visit to Lotte's massive department store complex and the new premises of the Lotte World Tower. It's the tallest building in the country, at almost 500m high. It opened its doors a few weeks ago, against the backdrop of the bribery charges levelled at the company's boss. Lotte and other chaebols say they are changing, and trying to improve corporate governance at their firms, but also point to the fact that they are responsible for a sizeable portion of growth in the economy. \\"At the moment chaebols have this negative image,\\" Hwang Kag-gyu, head of Lotte's corporate innovation office told me. \\"But we feel partially falsely charged. It was necessary [in South Korea's history] for big companies to grow... I believe everyone benefited from these mutual growth partnerships.\\" Not everyone feels that way though. A few hours outside Seoul, in the city of Gwangju, I met Cho Seong-gu, who used to own a fairly small, but he says thriving, software business. To expand, he partnered with a chaebol and when there was a dispute over the terms of the deal, Mr Cho lost everything - his business, his house, even his marriage. He blames the culture of chaebol-worship in South Korea for his problems. \\"I have fought for 15 years,\\" he told me in his tiny flat. \\"I have met more than 170 congressmen, my case has even been discussed in the national assembly and featured countless times in the media. It's impossible in Korea for a small business to win against a chaebol.\\" Back on the 123rd floor of the Lotte World Tower, hordes of local tourists gathered to take selfies and marvel at the city below. Much of what they were looking at was built by chaebols, an achievement only these sprawling empires could pull off. As I watched from the sidelines, it struck me that the relationship between Koreans and their chaebols is a complicated one, and that any hope of real reform is going to be a long and difficult process. Chaebols are an essential part of South Korea's economy, and helped to transform what was once a poor nation into Asia's fourth largest economy. But along the way, their tentacles have spread into pretty much every single sector of business, meaning they are now towering giants, overshadowing everything in their sight.

Question: Information: - The National Hockey League (NHL) is a professional ice hockey league currently composed of 31 member clubs. Of the 30 clubs currently playing, 23 are in the United States and 7 in Canada. Headquartered in New York City, the NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world, and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. The Stanley Cup, the oldest professional sports trophy in North America, is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season. - Edward James Livingstone ( September 12 , 1884 -- September 11 , 1945 ) was a Canadian sports team owner and manager . He was the principal owner of the Toronto Shamrocks and the Toronto Blueshirts of the National Hockey Association , where his battles with his fellow owners led them to create the National Hockey League . - An earl is a member of the nobility. The title is Anglo-Saxon in origin, akin to the Scandinavian form jarl, and meant \\"chieftain\\", particularly a chieftain set to rule a territory in a king's stead. In Scandinavia, it became obsolete in the Middle Ages and was replaced by duke (\\"hertig\\"/\\"hertug\\"/\\"hertog\\"). In later medieval Britain, it became the equivalent of the continental count (in England in the earlier period, it was more akin to a duke; in Scotland it assimilated the concept of mormaer). However, earlier in Scandinavia, \\"jarl\\" could also mean a sovereign prince. For example, the rulers of several of the petty kingdoms of Norway had the title of \\"jarl\\" and in many cases they had no less power than their neighbours who had the title of king. Alternative names for the \\"Earl/Count\\" rank in the nobility structure are used in other countries, such as Hakushaku during the Japanese Imperial era. - The Canadian titles debate has been ongoing since the presentation to the Canadian House of Commons of the Nickle Resolution in 1917. This resolution marked the earliest attempt to establish a Canadian government policy requesting the sovereign not to grant knighthoods, baronetcies, and peerages to Canadians and set the precedent for later policies restricting Canadians from accepting titles from foreign countries. Dissatisfaction with the British honours system led to the gradual creation of a separate system for Canada. - A global city, also called world city or sometimes alpha city or world center, is a city generally considered to be an important node in the global economic system. The concept comes from geography and urban studies, and the idea that globalization can be understood as largely created, facilitated, and enacted in strategic geographic locales according to a hierarchy of importance to the operation of the global system of finance and trade. - Ontario, one of the 13 provinces and territories of Canada, is located in east-central Canada. It is Canada's most populous province by a large margin, accounting for nearly 40 percent of all Canadians, and is the second-largest province in total area. Ontario is fourth-largest in total area when the territories of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are included. It is home to the nation's capital city, Ottawa, and the nation's most populous city, Toronto. - The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. At the 2011 census, it had a population of 6,054,191, and the census metropolitan area had a population of 5,583,064. The Greater Toronto Area is defined as the central city of Toronto, and the four regional municipalities that surround it: Durham, Halton, Peel, and York. The regional span of the Greater Toronto Area is sometimes combined with the city of Hamilton, Ontario and its surrounding region, to form the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. The Greater Toronto Area is the northern part of the Golden Horseshoe. - A baronet (or ; abbreviated Bart or Bt) or the rare female equivalent, a baronetess (, or ; abbreviation \\"Btss\\"), is the holder of a baronetcy, a hereditary title awarded by the British Crown. The practice of awarding baronetcies was originally introduced in England in the 14th century and was used by James I of England in 1611 as a means of raising funds. - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America. With over 2.7 million residents, it is the most populous city in the state of Illinois and the Midwestern United States, and the county seat of Cook County. The Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland, has nearly 10 million people and is the third-largest in the U.S. - A knight is a person granted an honorary title of \\"knighthood\\" by a monarch or other political leader for service to the monarch or country, especially in a military capacity. Historically, in Europe, knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors. During the High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility. By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior. Often, a knight was a vassal who served as a fighter for a lord, with payment in the form of land holdings. The lords trusted the knights, who were skilled in battle on horseback. Since the early modern period, the title of knight is purely honorific, usually bestowed by a monarch, as in the British honours system, often for non-military service to the country. The modern female equivalent in the United Kingdom is Dame. - The Stanley Cup is the championship trophy awarded annually to the National Hockey League (NHL) playoff winner. Originally commissioned in 1892 as the \\"Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup\\", the trophy is named for Lord Stanley of Preston, thenGovernor General of Canada, who awarded it to Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club, which the entire Stanley family supported, with the sons and daughters playing and promoting the game. The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC, and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play. Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906. In 1915, the two professional ice hockey organizations, the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), reached a gentlemen's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup. After a series of league mergers and folds, it was established as the \\"de facto\\" championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the \\"de jure\\" NHL championship prize in 1947. - The National Hockey Association (NHA), officially the \\"National Hockey Association of Canada Limited\\", was a professional ice hockey organization with teams in Ontario and Quebec, Canada. It is the direct predecessor to today's National Hockey League (NHL). Founded in 1909 by Ambrose O'Brien, the NHA introduced 'six-man hockey' by removing the 'rover' position in 1911. During its lifetime, the league coped with competition for players with the rival Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), the enlistment of players for World War I and disagreements between owners. The disagreements between owners came to a head in 1917, when the NHA suspended operations in order to get rid of an unwanted owner (Eddie Livingstone). The remaining NHA team owners started the NHL in parallel as a temporary measure, to continue play while negotiations went on with Livingstone and other lawsuits were pending. A year later, after no progress was reached with Livingstone, the other NHA owners decided to permanently suspend the NHA. The NHA's rules, constitution and trophies were continued in the NHL. - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County. Situated in Southern California, Los Angeles is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, sprawling metropolis, and as a major center of the American entertainment industry. Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over . - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - John Ambrose O'Brien (May 27, 1885 April 25, 1968), was an industrialist and sports team owner. He was a founder of the National Hockey Association (NHA), owner of the Renfrew Millionaires and the founding owner of the Montreal Canadiens professional ice hockey team. - Quebec (pronounced or ) is the second-most populous province of Canada and the only one to have a predominantly French-speaking population, with French as the sole provincial official language. - Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. Growing in population, the 2011 census recorded a population of 2,615,060. As of 2015, the population is now estimated at 2,826,498, making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on the population within its city limits. Toronto trails only Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles by this measure, while it is the fifth-largest (behind also Chicago) if ranked by the size of its metropolitan area . An established global city, Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and widely recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world. - Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually in a rink, in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent's net to score points. Ice hockey teams usually consist of six players each: one goaltender, and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team. - The major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada are the highest professional competitions of team sports in the United States and Canada. The four leagues universally included in the definition are Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League (NFL), and the National Hockey League (NHL). Other prominent leagues include Major League Soccer (MLS) and the Canadian Football League (CFL). - The Toronto Hockey Club, known as the Torontos and the Toronto Blueshirts were a professional ice hockey team based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. They were a member of the National Hockey Association (NHA). The club was founded in 1911 and began operations in 1912. The club won its sole Stanley Cup championship in 1914. - Mexico City, officially City of Mexico (, ; abbreviated as \\"CDMX\\"), is the capital and most populous city of the United Mexican States. As an \\"alpha\\" global city, Mexico City is one of the most important financial centers in the Americas. It is located in the Valley of Mexico (\\"Valle de México\\"), a large valley in the high plateaus at the center of Mexico, at an altitude of . The city consists of sixteen municipalities (previously called boroughs). - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border.

Bartlett's decision to deposit stores on the ice ensured that an ice camp, known as \\"Shipwreck Camp\\", was more or less established by the time Karluk sank. Two shelters had been built, one a snow igloo with a canvas roof, the other constructed from packing cases. To the latter was added a kitchen with a large stove rescued from Karluk's engine room. A small, separate shelter was built for the five Inuit, and a rough perimeter created from coal bags and assorted containers. In McKinlay's words, the camp provided \\"substantial and comfortable houses on which we could rely for shelter for a long time.\\" Stores were plentiful, and the party was able to eat well. Much of the time in the first days of the camp was spent preparing and adjusting clothing and sleeping gear, in readiness for the forthcoming march to Wrangel Island. The ice drift was slowly moving the camp in the direction of the island, but as yet there was insufficient daylight to attempt the march.Amid this activity Mackay and Murray, now joined by the anthropologist Henri Beuchat, played little part in the general life of the camp and expressed their determination to leave it, independently, as soon as possible. Bartlett wanted to wait for the longer daylight hours of February before attempting the march, but was persuaded by McKinlay and Mamen to send a trailbreaking group to set up an advance camp on Wrangel Island.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was prone to impulsiveness and a lack of self-restraint? , can you please find it? The Allied invasion of Sicily began on 10 July 1943, with Lieutenant General George S. Patton leading 90,000 men of the Seventh United States Army in a landing near Gela, Scoglitti, and Licata to support Bernard Montgomery's British 8th Army landings to the north. Initially ordered to protect the British forces' flank, Patton took Palermo after Montgomery's forces were slowed by heavy resistance from troops of Nazi Germany and the Kingdom of Italy. Patton then set his sights on Messina. He sought an amphibious assault, but it was delayed by lack of landing craft and his troops did not land in Santo Stefano until 8 August, by which time the Germans and Italians had already evacuated the bulk of their troops to mainland Italy. Throughout the campaign, Patton's troops were heavily engaged by German and Italian forces as they pushed across the island.Patton had already developed a reputation in the U.S. Army as an effective, successful, and hard-driving commander, punishing subordinates for the slightest infractions but also rewarding them when they performed well. As a way to promote an image that inspired his troops, Patton created a larger-than-life personality. He became known for his flashy dress, highly polished helmet and boots, and no-nonsense demeanor.

A foil cylinder of diameter 10cm likely has greater or less resistance than a foil cylinder of diameter 1cm? Assuming that: The thinner the wire, the more resistance it offers. The answer is:","completion":"The foil cylinder of diameter 1cm will have greater resistance than the foil cylinder of diameter 10cm. To understand this, we need to discuss the basic principles of resistance. The resistance (R) of a wire or conductor depends on its length (L), cross-sectional area (A), and the material's resistivity (ρ). The relationship between these factors is given by the formula: R = (ρ * L) / A In the context of the problem, we have two aluminum foil cylinders with different diameters but made of the same material (aluminum). Therefore, the resistivity (ρ) of the material remains constant in both cases. Let's recall the given information: \\"The thinner the wire, the more resistance it offers.\\" A thinner wire corresponds to a smaller diameter, which means a smaller cross-sectional area. As we can see from the formula, if the area (A) decreases, the resistance (R) increases, assuming the length and resistivity remain constant. Therefore, since the foil cylinder with a diameter of 1cm is \\"thinner\\" compared to the one with a diameter of 10cm, it will have a smaller cross-sectional area and, as a result, offers greater resistance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Geoff Tate (born Jeffrey Wayne Tate, January 14, 1959; he later changed his first name to Geoffery or Geoffrey) is a German-born American singer and musician. He rose to fame with the progressive metal band Queensryche, who had commercial success with their 1988 album Operation: Mindcrime and 1990 album Empire. Tate is ranked fourteenth on Hit Parader's list of the 100 Greatest Metal Vocalists of All Time. Context: Since 2012, Geoff Tate has attracted some controversy, mostly in part to the circumstances surrounding the split with Queensryche (when his bandmates, guitarist Michael Wilton, bassist Eddie Jackson and drummer Scott Rockenfield fired him from the band and replaced him with then-Crimson Glory vocalist Todd La Torre). Tate attracted negative attention for spitting on and physically assaulting Wilton and Rockenfield before and during a show in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on April 14, 2012. Then, during a later show the Rocklahoma Festival on May 26, Tate commented to an unresponsive crowd \\"You guys suck,\\" which his bandmates, as well as some fans, felt was an insult, but Tate would later defend his actions by stating in a court declaration \\"I was not insulting the audience. I was trying to motivate or excite them.\\" He finds that this was used against him in the lawsuit: \\"It's just something that the other guys [in the band] and their team of people are trying to twist into a 'Geoff doesn't respect the fans' type of thing.\\" He elaborated on that in an interview, saying: \\"I say that stuff all the time, you know. It's part of being a front man, you know. You got to motivate the audience, you know. And I say things to get people motivated. I think... I say things to push people's buttons to get them to react. It's part of a performance. But if you're in a lawsuit, of course, these things get taken out of context and put into a new format. I guess the objective is to make me look like I don't care about the fans. Which is unfortunate.\\" During the \\"Operation: Mindcrime Anniversary Tour\\" tour, ten minutes into a show in St. Charles, Illinois on May 17, 2013, Tate grabbed an audience member's smartphone, turned around, and threw it over his shoulder into the crowd.On the subject, Tate commented: \\"Some actions that I have become very normal with as a performer are getting scrutinized and manipulated to paint a picture of me [to make me look like a bad guy].\\" He accused the uploader of the video showing this footage to have manipulated the footage to make it appear as though he threw it, as he insists that he accidentally dropped it while trying to take pictures of the fan and of himself. Tate has commented on these controversies in relation to the Queensryche lawsuits, saying: \\"I guess that's the nature of being in a lawsuit. Now you have to watch what you say, and trust that who you are talking to does the right thing, you know, and push the information out in the way that it happened. And not try to construct something different, you know?\\" Question: Did he comment on the situation? Answer:","completion":"Yes, Geoff Tate did comment on the situation. He explained that some of his actions, like trying to motivate the audience, can be taken out of context. He also mentioned that during a performance, he sometimes says things to push people's buttons and get them to react. Geoff believes that these things are being twisted to make him look like he doesn't care about the fans. He also talked about the smartphone incident, saying that the video was manipulated and he accidentally dropped the phone while taking pictures.

To create the material for Highway 61 Revisited, Dylan spent a month writing in his new home in the Byrdcliffe artists' colony of Woodstock in upstate New York. When he returned to Studio A on July 29, he was backed by the same musicians with Harvey Brooks on bass replacing Joe Macho and his producer had changed from Tom Wilson to Bob Johnston. Their first session together was devoted to three songs. After recording several takes each of \\"Tombstone Blues\\", \\"It Takes a Lot to Laugh\\" and \\"Positively 4th Street\\", masters were successfully recorded. \\"Tombstone Blues\\" and \\"It Takes a Lot to Laugh\\" were included in the final album, but \\"Positively 4th Street\\" was issued as a single-only release. At the close of the July 29 session, Dylan attempted to record \\"Desolation Row\\", accompanied by Al Kooper on electric guitar and Harvey Brooks on bass.

However, this negativity is somewhat restricted with the use of the word \\"kinda,\\" which shows that the subjectivity of this opinion may not be that strong. 3. \\"and depressing\\" - Here we see a stronger negative emotion attributed to the given weather condition. The word \\"depressing\\" implies that the cold and cloudy weather negatively affected the person's emotional state and overall experience of the day. Taking these points into consideration, the sentiment of this tweet is not entirely negative, but it does express a personal dissatisfaction with the cold and cloudy weather. While it may not reflect the feelings of a bigger group or audience, it does give us a general understanding of how the author feels about the weather at that time and location.

Just hours before the panel, the president again took aim at Mueller and his team, calling them a “group of Angry Democrat Thugs” in response to a New York Times story about White House counsel Don McGahn cooperating with Mueller’s team as part of the probe into whether Trump obstructed justice. Later Monday morning, Donald Trump again attacked former CIA Director John Brennan, whose security clearance the president revoked last week. He called Brennan, who has frequently criticized the administration, a “political ‘hack.’” Everybody wants to keep their Security Clearance, it’s worth great prestige and big dollars, even board seats, and that is why certain people are coming forward to protect Brennan.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) (Associated Press) ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) — Melania Trump encouraged technology and social media companies Monday to provide more opportunities for young people to share ideas for how to be good citizens online. Pressing forward with an effort to combat youth cyberbullying, the first lady said that while most children are more aware than some adults of the \\"benefits and pitfalls\\" of social media, adults must still do \\"all we can\\" to provide them with information and tools for safe online habits. With her brief remarks, Mrs. Trump helped open a federal conference on cyberbullying in Maryland. Neither she nor any of those who spoke during morning sessions mentioned President Donald Trump and his aggressive use of Twitter to berate his foes and call them names. The first lady instead spoke highly of a group of students she recently met who participate in Microsoft's Council for Digital Good. The students provide the computer software maker with ideas and feedback for Microsoft's policy work on youth-centered online safety. She told scores of people attending the Federal Partners on Bullying Prevention summit in a conference room at the Health Resources and Services Administration building in Rockville how impressed she was by the students' \\"deep understanding of how important it is to be safe.\\" She said she was also \\"inspired by their sincere commitment to reducing peer-to-peer bullying through kindness and open communication.\\" \\"I encourage technology and social media companies, schools and community groups, to establish more opportunities for children such as Microsoft's Council for Digital Good,\\" the first lady said. \\"By listening to children's ideas and concerns, I believe adults will be better able to help them navigate this often-difficult topic.\\" \\"Let's face it: Most children are more aware of the benefits and pitfalls of social media than some adults, but we still need to do all we can to provide them with information and tools for successful and safe online habits.\\" After speaking, Mrs. Trump took a seat in the front row and listened to a panel discussion featuring representatives of Facebook, Google, Twitter and the nonprofit Family Online Safety Institute talk about how they're responding to the issue. As the panelists spoke, Trump sent fresh tweets about John Brennan, calling him \\"the worst CIA Director in our country's history\\" and a political \\"hack.\\" Brennan, who led the CIA under President Barack Obama, a Democrat, has been an outspoken critic of Trump, a Republican, over his performance and behavior as president. Trump recently revoked Brennan's security clearance. The first lady's appearance came as part of her campaign to help children \\"Be Best,\\" which also includes an emphasis on child well-being overall and opioid addition. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the Health Resources and Services Administration, which his department oversees, began an anti-bullying campaign in 2001 to help raise awareness. He said one in five children experience bullying, and that 16 percent of children currently are victims of cyberbullying. \\"We need to recognize that bullying is bullying wherever it occurs,\\" Azar said. \\"And we need to stop it.\\" The conference also heard from Joseph Grunwald, who described his experiences being bullied during middle and high school. Grunwald said the bullying started as taunts on the school bus and had grown into physical harassment by high school, including violence. He did not go into detail. As the same time, he said he was also being harassed on social media. \\"Because the bullying was also online, I couldn't escape it, no matter where I was,\\" Grunwald said. ___ Follow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap ||||| (CNN) First lady Melania Trump spoke out against cyberbullying Monday as part of her Be Best campaign, warning against \\"destructive and harmful\\" uses of social media and once again highlighting a messaging rift between the East Wing and the West Wing. \\"In today's global society, social media is an inevitable part of our children's daily lives,\\" Trump said at a cyberbullying summit in Rockville, Maryland. \\"It can be used in many positive ways, but can also be destructive and harmful when used incorrectly.

Despite firing off multiple tweets Monday morning, none were about the first lady's Be Best initiatives or her speech. The President's well-known Twitter habit, exemplified last week by his harsh attack on former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman, has drawn criticism and highlights the seeming disconnect between the East Wing and the West Wing. \\"When you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the White House, I guess it just didn't work out.

In a White House with a President who makes his own rules -- especially on social media -- his wife has faced criticism for being unable to curb her own husband's behavior. Instead, she's made an independent choice to do what she can. \\"She is aware of the criticism but it will not deter her from doing what she feels is right. The President is proud of her commitment to children and encourages her in all that she does,\\" Grisham said in a statement. Responding to the apparent hypocrisy between the first lady's assertion that social media can be \\"destructive and harmful when used incorrectly\\" and the President's own habits, Grisham deflected. \\"Rather than dissecting her remarks, let's focus on the countless children who struggle w bullying & online safety each day,\\" she tweeted She later described Trump's advocacy against cyberbullying as \\"a sincere campaign meant to help children.\\" During her speech, the first lady acknowledged that children can be more aware of the \\"pitfalls\\" of social media than adults. \\"Let's face it: most children are more aware of the benefits and pitfalls of social media than some adults, but we still need to do all we can to provide them with information and tools for successful and safe online habits,\\" she said.

The agreement came after two weeks of talks between the leaders at the 21st Conference in Paris, France. As part of the Paris agreement, countries said they would cut down on pollution However, according to the terms of the deal, countries that don't do this will not be punished, or fined. Instead,the document is meant to show that governments around the world take climate change seriously and are willing to work together to fight global warming. World leaders have met many times to discuss climate change. But, the 21st Conference of Parties, or COP21, which began on November 30 in Paris, was the first time they agreed on a global, legal pact . Before the conference, each nation was asked to create plans on how to reach the shared goal. The pact that was signed allows countries to decide the best way to cut down their gas pollution. No matter how they decide to go green, each country must report honestly on all of their efforts. Every five years, nations must look at the work they've done and submit new plans on how they will improve over the next five years. In the pact, the countries pledge to limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the levels that trees,soil and oceans can absorb naturally. It urges countries to spend trillions of dollars on creating new energy sources, like solar and wind power. It also requires countries to raise at least 100 billion each year to help developing countries. However, critics of the pact say it is not detailed enough, and doesn't include specifics about how the plan will be enforced and how improvements will be measured. The pact does include one large, specific goal: how countries will aim to keep global temperatures from rising more than 3. 60degF(20degC) by 2100. Nonetheless,the agreement is considered by many world leaders to be a major victory. The U. N. has been working more than two decades to convince governments to work...

Article: Japanese sailor Kenichi Horie has finished a 110-day solo voyage across the Pacific Ocean in a boat pushed by sea waves to win another world first. Weak waves and ocean water movements made his arrival late, which was going to be in late May. \\"When waves were weak, the boat slowed down. That's a problem that needs to be solved,\\" the adventure told reporters from his boat in western Japan. His 9.5-meter-long boat can move like a dolphin's tail, and it rises or falls with the waves. Horie reached his destination in the channel between the main Japanese islands just before midnight after covering about 7,000 kilometers from Hawaii. Horie first made world record in 1962 when, at the age of 23, he became the first person to sail alone across the Pacific. He made the three-month voyage from his hometown in spite of breaking Japanese law, which did not allow his citizens to sail on their own out of the country, and without a passport or money. He was arrested upon arrival in San Francisco but the city mayor freed him, gave him a 30-day visa and made him an honorary citizen. News of his achievement made him a hero back home in Japan and his book of the voyage In the Pacific was made into a film. Since then, he has completed many sailing trips across the Pacific and around the world. After his latest adventure with an environmentally friendly theme, Horie planned to return to his hometown on Sunday.

Yet, in other types of relationships, the ability to see each other physically can keep insecurities at bay. In long-distance relationships when you’re only seeing your partner every couple of weeks or months, it’s easy to become envious of the time they are spending with others. Unless your partner has given you any reason to have distrust, give them the benefit of the doubt and try to keep your jealousies in check. Checking their Facebook or worrying about who’s talking in the background during a phone call can cause resentment. Reconsider if a long-distance relationship is a good choice for you if you continuously have trouble trusting. Normal, face-to-face relationships count on seeing one another and engaging regularly to keep the spark alive. Since you and your partner don’t have the option to do that, it’s important that you are consistent and committed about putting time and effort into the relationship. Establish a pattern or “routine” with your partner in which the both of you can depend on the other to be a constant part of life. Coordinate your schedules so that you know when the other is available. Make an effort to stick to your “routine,” such as calling each other around the same time each day. Maintaining satisfaction on both accounts relies on frequent communication. In order to feel fulfilled in your long-distance relationship it’s essential that the two of you are actively involved in one another’s lives. This doesn’t mean you have to talk all day long, but it does mean you should be willing to share what’s going on in your everyday lives, express your thoughts and opinions, and ask for your partner’s input. A successful long-distance relationship equates to both partners having an understanding of the other’s expectations. Being miles apart becomes even more difficult when you don’t know where you stand in the relationship. This creates an environment that is susceptible to distrust, jealousy, and even infidelity. Have a talk with your partner to discuss what both of you want from the relationship. Are you in it for the long haul or just casually seeing how things go? Clearly communicate your expectations to your partner and be willing to listen as he or she does the same. You should also discuss romantic boundaries. Some couples opt to allow each other to have physical relationships with others if they are going to be apart for months or years, while other couples would see this as a betrayal. Discuss this with your partner, as you might have different ideas about what is allowed in long-distance You can broach the subject by saying “I really like you and I hope you feel the same. Where do you see us going?” and then being patient as your partner communicates their goals for your long-distance relationship. If your goals do not align, you may have to decide if you want to end the relationship.","completion":"Trust is very important for relationships, especially if you live far away from each other. It's normal to feel a little jealous, but try not to worry too much about your partner's friends or check their social media all the time.

Today, we are going to talk about an amazing achievement in the world of football. We will learn about the longest touchdown ever! Isn't that exciting? But before we start, let's quickly learn what a 'touchdown' is. In football, when a player carries the ball into the opponent's end zone or catches it there, we call it a touchdown. It's very exciting and a great way to score points for your team! Now, let's talk about the longest touchdown in the history of football. It happened during a game between two professional football teams, and it was truly amazing! The longest touchdown ever recorded was 109 yards long! Wow! That's almost as long as a football field! This incredible feat was accomplished by two players: Antonio Cromartie and Cordarrelle Patterson. They both did it in separate games, so they share the record. Antonio Cromartie managed this fantastic play on November 4, 2007, when he was playing for the San Diego Chargers against the Minnesota Vikings. Cordarrelle Patterson followed in his footsteps on October 27, 2013, as part of the Minnesota Vikings playing against the Green Bay Packers. Just imagine, these two talented players had to run the whole length of the football field and even a little more to score a touchdown. They were super fast, like superheroes, weren't they?! So now, when someone asks you about the longest touchdown in football history, you can confidently say it was 109 yards long and done by both Antonio Cromartie and Cordarrelle Patterson. I hope you enjoyed learning about this exciting record! Football is such a fun and exciting sport, and it's always amazing when talented players do extraordinary things! Keep on learning, little ones, and maybe someday you'll be a football star too!"},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

The went back on top at last. \\"Yeah, it's pretty cool. That goes without saying,\\" first baseman Aubrey Huff (FSY) said. Huff hit a three-run homer, Buster Posey (FSY) had a solo shot and San Francisco moved into first place in the division race with a 10-2 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Thursday night. \\"It says a lot about this club and how hard they've been fighting,\\" manager Bruce Bochy said. \\"It's going to be a tough race, we know it.\\" Jonathan Sanchez (FSY) (11-8) struck out a career-high 12 as the Giants took a half-game lead on the Padres after San Diego lost 4-0 at St. Louis. San Francisco is in sole possession of first place for the first time since May 6. The Giants are trying to end a six-year playoff drought. \\"Hopefully we can stay there all the way until the end,\\" Sanchez said. \\"It feels good to be in first place. We've got a lot of games to go and we've got to keep playing like this if we're going to finish first.\\" Dodgers starter Ted Lilly (FSY) (8-11) was done after 3⅓ innings for his shortest outing of the season. This was just his third loss in nine starts since joining the Dodgers at the trade deadline. Russ Mitchell homered just fair inside the left-field foul pole for his first career hit leading off the fifth for Los Angeles. He had been 0-for-15. \\"The silent treatment is over,\\" Mitchell said of his funk. \\"I was talking to it, hoping it would stay fair.\\" Huff and Posey connected for back-to-back homers in the third, the seventh time the Giants have hit consecutive homers this season. Jose Guillen (FSY) added a two-run drive in the fifth to make it 8-2. It was his 18th home run of the season and second with the Giants. Guillen returned to the starting lineup after missing Wednesday's game with a painful neck. He underwent an MRI exam Thursday and said everything was fine. Freddy Sanchez (FSY) added a two-run double in the eighth. All the offense helped Jonathan Sanchez win his third consecutive decision. The left-hander, who has been one of the Giants' most reliable starters down the stretch, recorded his seventh career game with double-digit strikeouts and fourth of the season. He allowed four hits and one run in seven innings and didn't walk a batter for the second time in his 30 starts. \\"They're on a roll and swinging the bats,\\" Dodgers manager Joe Torre said. \\"Sanchez was terrific.\\" Sanchez's strikeouts were the second-most by a Giant this year. Tim Lincecum (FSY) struck out 13 at Florida on May 4. Sanchez has one motivation to keep throwing strikes: \\"I just want to win it and make the playoffs,\\" he said. The Giants allowed an unearned run in the first, but Sanchez was unfazed and quickly found his groove. \\"It seems like about a month now he's been throwing strikes and getting ahead,\\" Huff said. \\"When he's doing that, he's one of the most dangerous guys on our staff.\\" Lilly was tagged for five runs and seven hits, and he struck out three and walked one. He had been so reliable for Los Angeles every fifth day that Torre said before the game, \\"Lilly's been such a savior for us in more ways than one.\\" Bochy is using a leadoff man by committee in the absence of the injured Andres Torres (FSY), recovering from an emergency appendectomy Sunday. Edgar Renteria (FSY) took on the job with a lefty starter going and had a triple among his four hits. Milwaukee starts left-hander Randy Wolf (FSY) on Friday night, so Renteria will be in there again Friday night. The Giants captured the season series with the Dodgers 10-8, San Francisco's first series victory against its rivals since going 10-9 in 2005. The teams open the 2011 season facing off for four games at Dodger Stadium from April 1-4, 2011. Los Angeles finished up a 10-game road trip and returned home for a weekend series with the Rockies. Los Angeles faces divisional opponents the rest of the way. Matt Kemp (FSY) struck out in the sixth to match his career high of 153 also done in 2008. NOTES: Torre attended Raiders practice across the Bay in Alameda and spent some time with owner Al Davis in his office. \\"I'll tell you, he's sharp,\\" Torre said. \\"I've known Al a long time. ... It was fun there. You don't realize how big those guys are 'til you're right up next to them.\\" Former Raiders coach John Madden also took Torre around. ... Los Angeles INF Jamey Carroll (FSY) isn't available for a few days because of a sore wrist that he hurt on a swing several days ago. ... Bochy said rookie C Posey could play every day the rest of the way, perhaps getting a break from behind the plate with some starts at first. ... Struggling San Francisco slugger Pablo Sandoval (FSY), in an 0-for-15 funk and 3 for his last 37, sat against an LHP starter and likely won't start Friday either. ... A thick fog hovered over the outfield for the entire game. ... Sanchez became the fourth Giants lefty to strike out 12 or more without a walk since 1920.

This was the first time that they had played outside of their normal home ground of Olympic Park Stadium which held 18,500 people. Their first game was held on 3 March 2000 against the St. George Illawarra Dragons in a rematch of the infamous 1999 NRL Grand Final. Dragons player Anthony Mundine said the Storm were not worthy premiers and they responded by running in 12 tries to two, winning 70–10 in front of 23,239 fans. This was their biggest crowd they had played against until 33,427 turned up to the 2007 Preliminary Final at Docklands Stadium which saw Melbourne defeat the Parramatta Eels 26–10. The record home and away crowd record has also been overhauled, when a match at Docklands in 2010 against St George attracted 25,480 spectators.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - A record producer or music producer oversees and manages the sound recording and production of a band or performer's music, which may range from recording one song to recording a lengthy concept album. A producer has many roles during the recording process. The roles of a producer vary. He or she may gather musical ideas for the project, collaborate with the artists to select cover tunes or original songs by the artist/group, work with artists and help them to improve their songs, lyrics or arrangements. - A concept album is an album unified by a larger purpose or meaning to the album collectively than to its tracks individually. This may be achieved through a single central narrative or theme, or through a sense of artistic cohesiveness. The scope and definition of a \\"concept album\\" varies, and there is no consensus over what exactly the term constitutes. - Michigan is a state in the Great Lakes and Midwestern regions of the United States. The name Michigan is the French form of the Ojibwa word \\"mishigamaa\\", meaning \\"large water\\" or \\"large lake\\". Michigan is the tenth most populous of the 50 United States, with the 11th most extensive total area (the largest state by total area east of the Mississippi River). Its capital is Lansing, and its largest city is Detroit. - Detroit is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Michigan, the fourth-largest city in the Midwest and the largest city on the United StatesCanada border. It is the seat of Wayne County, the most populous county in the state. - A song, most broadly, is a single (and often standalone) work of music that is typically intended to be sung by the human voice with distinct and fixed pitches and patterns using sound and silence and a variety of forms that often include the repetition of sections. Written words created specifically for music or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs in a simple style that are learned informally are often referred to as folk songs. Songs that are composed for professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs. These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers and lyricists. Art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are performed live and recorded on audio or video (or in some, cases, a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded). Songs may also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage shows of any form, and within operas. - Vol. 1 : Unreleased ( aka The Official Jay Dee Instrumental Series Vol.1 : Unreleased ) is an instrumental album by the late Detroit record producer , Jay Dee , released in 2002 .

Body of the Article: A British police inspector, whose identity remains undisclosed, has received a suspended prison sentence after being found guilty of possessing indecent images of children on his home computer. The case has resulted in widespread condemnation from the community and calls for stricter checks on law enforcement personnel. The police inspector's indecent activities came to light during a routine investigation conducted by the cybercrime division of the police force. On discovering the illicit material on the inspector's computer, the cybercrime team promptly notified their superior officers, and disciplinary actions were initiated. The Digital Forensic Unit carefully and meticulously examined the inspector's computer, only to find a significant number of images classified as indecent content involving children. Moreover, the unit concluded that the images had been stored on the device for a substantial period, indicating that this was not a one-time transgression. The victimized children's ages ranged from just a few years old to their early teens, an aspect that only intensifies the horrifying nature of the crime. For someone entrusted with safeguarding society and fighting against such depravities, this discovery is both shocking and heartbreaking. Authorities decided against revealing the name or specific location of the police inspector to protect the ongoing investigation and any connected parties. However, the public has been assured that this case has received widespread attention, and significant actions are being taken to rectify and prevent such instances in the future. The court handed down a suspended prison sentence to the inspector, further explaining that he would be subjected to probation and closely monitored activities during the suspension period. Additionally, his name will be registered on the Sex Offenders Register, thereby preventing him from working with children and vulnerable individuals in the future. This case has generated significant public outrage, with many questioning how someone working within the law enforcement system could engage in such despicable activities. Consequently, demands for greater scrutiny and background checks on police personnel have been made. Conclusion: The suspended prison sentence handed to the police inspector involved in possessing indecent images of children on his home computer sheds light on the importance of ongoing vigilance and the role of the digital forensic unit in combating these heinous crimes. While this incident has further eroded the public's trust in law enforcement, authorities have emphasized their commitment to addressing and rectifying concerns to ensure safety and justice for vulnerable individuals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Shutter Movie plot: Shutter tells the story of photographer Ben (Joshua Jackson) and his new wife Jane (Rachael Taylor). The film begins with the couple's wedding, and the audience learns that they are planning to leave their apartment in Brooklyn for Japan, where Ben has been hired to take pictures for a particular client. The couple has made the decision to leave for Japan a few days early, renting a cabin so they can enjoy a shorter honeymoon. In the car on the way to the cabin, Jane gets lost and asks a sleeping Ben to check the map. While attempting to get their bearings, Jane sees a girl walk into the road. She hits the girl, and swerves off the road, crashing the car into a tree. They both fall unconscious. When she awakens, Jane realizes the girl could very well still be laying in the road, and rushes out of the car to find her, Ben on her heels. They find nothing, and Ben thinks that the girl was already found and has gotten the medical help that she would need. He also thinks the injuries weren't life-threatening, as they cannot find any blood or evidence of a collision and wants to call for help. Later, help does arrive for them, and they are able to continue with their travel to the cabin, but Jane is haunted by the image of the girl. Ben's shoulder is bothering him, since the accident. Jane tells him he needs to get it checked out. Ben chooses to ignore it, and at the cabin, they are able to enjoy a few day long honeymoon, and Ben wants to take pictures to record the event.Days later, Ben has to report for work with his friend Bruno (David Denman) Jane accompanies him but is somewhat left to her own devices as Ben needs to meet with the clients right away. We learn that Ben is fluent in Japanese, while Jane is not. Later, the pair are taken to their home, a building of which they are the solo occupants, and also the home of Ben's photography studio. Jane notices an alcove where an old chair sits, and the image sticks with her. After meeting Ben's assistant Seiko (Maya Hazen), Jane again is left to her own devices... Answer:","completion":"Ben's occupation in the movie \\"Shutter\\" is a professional photographer. His proficiency in this occupation is significant enough to have him be hired by a client in Japan, where he moves to with his new wife, Jane. Moreover, his job as a photographer also necessitated him being fluent in Japanese to namely interact with clients. He seems to possess a dedicated photography studio in his new home in Japan as well. His photographic skills aren't relegated strictly to professional settings though, he also enjoys taking personal pictures, such as those to record their few days long honeymoon. His deep interest in the field is further hinted when even after getting injured in a car accident, Ben chooses to ignore his own discomfort in order to continue to take pictures. His occupation as a photographer seems to be a significant element of both Ben's character and the plot of the film itself. Indeed, the role of photography in the movie could suggest further investigations in the storyline such as revealing certain truths or discovering hidden elements related to the tragic event they experienced on their way to their honeymoon cabin. Therefore, understanding Ben's profession could uncover some layers of the movie's narrative and provide insights on the potential sequence of events."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer?","completion":"The Battle of Naseby took place in the English county of Northamptonshire. This critical battle occurred during the English Civil War, a series of armed conflicts and political disputes between the Royalists, who supported King Charles I, and the Parliamentarians, who were led by Oliver Cromwell. The Battle of Naseby occurred on June 14, 1645, and was the first significant encounter between the Royalists and the newly-formed Parliamentarian army, known as the New Model Army. The location of the battle was near the small village of Naseby, which is situated in the present-day local government district of Daventry, in the county of Northamptonshire. The area consists primarily of open farmland and rolling hills, which made it a suitable battleground for that era's military tactics. Both the Royalist and the Parliamentarian armies were approaching from different directions to converge near Naseby. The Royalists, under King Charles I and Prince Rupert, were advancing from the north and west, while the Parliamentarian forces, commanded by Sir Thomas Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell, were moving from the southeast. The battle commenced in the morning of June 14th, with skirmishes occurring between detachments of cavalry from both sides. As the day progressed, the Royalists attacked the Parliamentarians in their carefully chosen positions. Initially, it seemed as though the Royalists would emerge victorious from these engagements, but the tide changed dramatically when the Parliamentarian forces launched a counter-attack. Leading the way was Oliver Cromwell and his \\"Ironsides,\\" a highly trained and disciplined group of cavalrymen, who were instrumental in turning the tide of the battle. Their charge ultimately shattered the Royalist infantry and forced the King's troops to retreat. The Parliamentarian forces pursued the enemy, capturing many prisoners and seizing a significant amount of supplies and ammunition. The outcome was a decisive victory for the Parliamentarians and dealt a critical blow to the Royalist cause. The Battle of Naseby is considered one of the most important engagements in the English Civil War, as it significantly altered the trajectory of the conflict. It highlighted the effectiveness of the New Model Army and its leadership, bolstering the Parliamentarian cause. The victory also weakened King Charles I's authority, leading to his eventual execution and the eventual establishment of a republic in England under Oliver Cromwell. In summary, the Battle of Naseby took place in the county of Northamptonshire, England, on June 14, 1645. The engagement was a crucial turning point in the English Civil War, securing a major victory for the Parliamentarians against the Royalists and demonstrating the effectiveness of the newly-formed New Model Army. This battle largely determined the outcome of the war, leading to the eventual fall of the monarchy and the rise of the English republic."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The infected townspeople are treated by the sinister Dr. William Block (Josh Brolin) and his unhappy, unfaithful bisexual anesthesiologist wife Dakota (Marley Shelton) at a local hospital. Random zombie attacks begin along the highway, causing El Wray, with Cherry as his passenger, to crash his truck. In the aftermath, several zombies tear off Cherry's right leg. Also falling victim, fatally, is Tammy (Stacy \\"Fergie\\" Ferguson), who was on her way to into town to reunite with her former lover Dakota. When Tammy's body arrives at the hospital, Dr. Block recognizes her and by comparing text messages on the cellular phones of Tammy and his wife, realizes Dakota was about to leave him.

I'm going out for bird provisions","completion":"To describe the sentiment of the given tweet, we must first break down the statement into its various components and analyze each of them to fully understand the emotions and attitudes behind the message. The sentiment in this tweet can be understood through the following analysis: 1. \\"Trouble is, I may have been sucked into Twitter.\\": This part of the statement presents a somewhat negative sentiment. The use of the word \\"trouble\\" signifies that the user is experiencing a conflict or issue. Additionally, the phrase \\"sucked into Twitter\\" implies that the user has unintentionally become engrossed or absorbed in using the platform, potentially against their better judgment. 2. \\"I still think it's stupid though.\\": This statement also portrays a clearly negative sentiment. The user explicitly mentions that they believe Twitter is \\"stupid,\\" implying that they have a low opinion of the platform and its value. This negative viewpoint may be tied to their earlier mention of being \\"sucked into\\" the platform, with the user disliking their involvement in something they deem unworthy or nonsensical. 3. \\"I'm going out for bird provisions\\": The sentiment in this part of the statement is neutral, perhaps even slightly positive. By announcing their intention to leave for \\"bird provisions,\\" the user is signaling that they are stepping away from the online world of Twitter and engaging in a real-life activity - potentially something they find more worthwhile or enjoyable. The mention of birds could also be a subtle wordplay on Twitter's bird logo, adding a touch of humor to the message. It shows that, despite negative feelings towards the platform, the user chooses to focus on taking a break and attending to their offline responsibilities. In summary, the overall sentiment of this tweet can be described as a mix of negative and neutral emotions, with a hint of humor. The user expresses dissatisfaction and disapproval towards Twitter, while also acknowledging their unintended attachment to the platform. At the same time, they decide to step away and engage in an offline activity, incorporating a subtle wordplay on the platform's bird logo. This sentiment analysis captures the complexity and multidimensionality of the emotions and attitudes present in the tweet."},{"prompt":"Given the question: I loved the little guy from the day she brought him home. She carried him wrapped in a sweatshirt from the shelter at the corner where she'd been saying for months she was going to go. She set him down on the hardwood floor and he clipped around like a fawn - - clip, clip -- looking through doorways and carefully eyeing us both. He was tiny but he was strong. He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath. Miss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: \\"Well honey? What do you think?\\" And I told her: \\"I love the little guy.\\" He was never really my dog. He was more like my step-dog, but together we named him Steve. We thought it was funny, giving a dog a man's name like that. But it fit, like Miss Tennessee, which I started just to tease her about being full-grown and long- legged and pretty, but in a tomboyish way that made it both absolutely ridiculous and absolutely plausible that she had ever been Miss Anything. It always made her swallow a grin. Steve's name, on the other hand, made it sound like he wasn't a dog at all, but this little man. Miss Tennessee often called him that: the little man. Steve liked me okay but he loved Miss Tennessee. With me it was man things. After he got snipped or when he was stung by bees, down there, in grass that came up to his chin, he would come sit by me, hoping I'd understand. With her, it was everything else.

Question: What does Terrori tell Pepito to have as his last drink? Movie title: Â¡Vampiros en La Habana! Movie plot: Joseph Amadeus von Dracula, known as Pepito to his friends, is a trumpet player in 1930s Havana who spends his time away from the bandstand dabbling in quasi-terrorist plots to overthrow the Cuban government of dictator, Gerardo Machado. He is unaware that he is really a vampire, and that his uncle, Werner Amadeus von Dracula, the son of Count Dracula, has been using him as a test subject for a formula that negates the usually fatal effects of sunlight. A Chicago-based crime syndicate and a group of vampires with members from several countries in Europe have both learned of the formula and wish to possess it for different reasonsâthe Chicago group to suppress it and thus maintain their monopoly on indoor, artificial beach resorts, and the Europeans to market it as \\"Vampisol.\\" When Pepito learns of his true heritage (and his uncle's wish to give the formula away to vampires everywhere) he becomes the target of a multi-pronged manhunt, leading all parties involved on a wild chase through some of the seediest neighborhoods of Havana. At the film's climax, Pepito and his girlfriend find themselves cornered by the Chicago vampire cartel, led by vampire mobster Johnny Terrori. He tells Pepito to have some O positive blood as his last drink, the blood type which vampires consider to be the most delicious. However, when he spits it out in disgust, Terrori realizes that Pepito's dislike of drinking blood, the fact that he was harmed by a lead bullet earlier (vampires can only be harmed by silver bullets) and that he is completely impervious to sunlight (it instantly kills vampires) means that Pepito has stopped being a vampire. Terrori loses interest in the Vampisol formula, realizing that its effect is to turn vampires into humans. However, the leader of the European vampires suggests a deal with his counterparts from Chicago, whereby they can encourage vampires to take small amounts of Vampisol in the summer and visit the mobsters' artificial beaches in the winter.

Translate this to English?","completion":"Financial sustainability is important, but we should also take into consideration the necessity of ensuring an adequate income. Financial sustainability is a crucial aspect of managing any business, organization, or even personal finances. It refers to the ability to maintain or improve one's financial situation over time without depleting resources, indebting oneself, or causing any long-term financial distress. This requires adequate financial planning, risk management, and utilizing efficient processes to ensure that monetary resources are allocated in a way that balances immediate needs with long-term goals. At the same time, ensuring an adequate income is an equally critical component for overall financial stability. Without sufficient income, meeting expenses, saving for future endeavors, and maintaining a good quality of life becomes a significantly tougher challenge. Ensuring an adequate income can be achieved through various means, including securing a stable job with fair compensation, pursuing additional education or certification to improve one's earning potential, and investing wisely to generate passive income. Taking both financial sustainability and adequate income into consideration is vital for several reasons: 1. Financial stability: Ensuring a balance between both concepts helps to create a strong foundation for financial stability, as it allows individuals or organizations to meet their current needs without jeopardizing their future financial situation. 2. Long-term planning: Considering both the sustainability of financial resources and the importance of maintaining a steady income allows for more effective long-term planning. This includes setting achievable goals, creating realistic budgets, and identifying potential areas of growth. 3. Risk management: Understanding the relationship between financial sustainability and income is essential for managing risks. This includes developing contingency plans for potential income fluctuations, preparing for unexpected expenses, and setting aside funds for emergencies. 4. Debt management: Achieving financial sustainability and ensuring an adequate income helps in preventing excessive debt accumulation. By successfully managing finances, it is possible to avoid falling into debt traps and ensure that all liabilities are paid off in a timely manner. 5. Quality of life: Ultimately, balancing financial sustainability with the need for an adequate income enables individuals and organizations to maintain a high quality of life, ensuring that financial pressures do not adversely impact well-being. In conclusion, financial sustainability and ensuring adequate income are two interconnected aspects of managing finances effectively. By taking both elements into account, individuals and organizations can strive to achieve a stable, secure, and successful financial future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Donna Foster works for publisher John Caine. She agrees to have his niece, Christabel, live with her in San Francisco while attending business school. Christabel proves to be a scheming, socially ambitious woman. She flirts with Donna's fiance, the wealthy Curtis Carey, at a party for Donna's friend, painter Gabriel Broome. She also attracts the interest of aspiring author Nick Bradley. While having her portrait done by Broome, a call from Curtis brings her eagerly to a jeweler, only to discover to her disappointment that he merely seeks her advice in buying Donna an engagement gift. After he purchases an expensive one, Christabel plants a seed of doubt in Donna's mind and makes her feel guilty by insinuating that in accepting such a lavish gift, Donna is giving Curtis the appearance of being after his money. Christabel then turns around and cunningly does the same to Curtis by convincing him to propose a pre-nuptial agreement.

The incident, which involved the car hitting a tree and flipping onto its roof, has left communities reeling and sparked discussions about road safety. In this article, we will explore the details surrounding the tragic event, its implications, and the importance of driving safely. The Incident: The tragic event unfolded as the three friends were traveling together in their vehicle. The driver, whose identity has been withheld, lost control of his car and collided with a nearby tree, causing the vehicle to flip onto its roof. As a result, two passengers, both close friends of the driver, suffered fatal injuries in the gruesome accident. The Investigation: Following the incident, authorities initiated a thorough investigation to determine the cause of the accident and the level of the driver's culpability. After analyzing evidence and interviewing witnesses, it was concluded that the driver was highly responsible for the outcome of the crash due to reckless and dangerous driving. Consequently, the driver was charged with two counts of causing death by dangerous driving. The Judicial Proceedings: Facing the enormous grief of his actions and the serious legal consequences, the driver ultimately pleaded guilty to both charges. This step is significant, as it not only denotes a clear admission of guilt but also sets the stage for a faster judicial process, saving both the families of the victims and the accused from a lengthy trial. The Aftermath: As the case reaches its conclusion, the local community is still grappling with the loss of two lives in such a tragic manner. The incident has served as a brutal reminder of the importance of responsible driving and the potential consequences of negligence on the roads. Many have called for increased awareness of road safety, better education on risky driving behaviors, and stricter penalties for those who endanger others while behind the wheel. In Conclusion: This heartbreaking incident serves as a stark warning to all drivers about the potential dangers of risky and reckless driving. The driver's guilty plea reminds us that taking responsibility for our actions is vital, not only for seeking justice for those affected but also for learning from our mistakes to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future. As we mourn the loss of two lives to this unfortunate event, we must also work collectively to promote safe driving practices and ensure our roads are safe for all who use them."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

My job was to help little children get on the back of a little horse. I kept telling the children to wait their turn and holding ice cream for them while they rode about. It's clear that I was growing older and should be more responsible. Suddenly, a boy came to the horse. He took the little horse's reins ! The horse stopped, and the girl on its back started to fall. I was trying to reach the girl when I saw Tiger go by my legs. It held the horse's reins and pulled the horse away from my legs. I caught the girl just before we both hit the ground. The girl sat on top of me. She was laughing at the ice cream on my face. The horse's reins were in Tiger's mouth! Thanks to Tiger's fast action, I saved the little girl. We were both heroes.

Context: I have another guest post for you today. This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. Question: What does Selina think will help repair redness and brown spots from skin?

The album debuted at No. 1 on the Australian ARIA Albums chart, and spent 58 weeks in the top 50. It peaked at No. 11 during its 18-week stay on the New Zealand albums chart.Tea & Sympathy comprised songs Fanning had written in his time with Powderfinger, as well as new content written after the band went on hiatus. Most of the writing was done in what Fanning described as a \\"creative burst\\" between March and May 2005. Much of the inspiration for the work on the album came from Fanning's reaction to the death of his brother in 2002, and to the ending of a 12-year relationship with his girlfriend, Philippa Sison. The majority of the album was recorded at Real World Studios with Tchad Blake in June 2005, except for \\"Not Finished Just Yet\\", \\"Believe\\", \\"Wash Me Clean\\", and \\"Hope & Validation\\", which were recorded at Fanning's Brisbane home. Fanning was supported by musicians Jerry Marotta, Keith Duffy, and John Bedggood, who also formed part of his live band. The album was developed in a relaxed manner, with Fanning stating, \\"We had a ball putting the songs together.\\"Three singles were released from the album. The most successful of these was the lead single, \\"Wish You Well\\", shortly followed by \\"Songbird\\". These releases were only sold as digital download singles. The third single from the album, \\"Watch Over Me\\", was the only to be released as a CD single and achieved minor success on the Australian singles chart. It entered the chart on 9 July 2006 at No. 16, and spent eight weeks in the top 50. On 26 January 2006, \\"Wish You Well\\" was voted No. 1 for the Triple J Hottest 100, 2005. Following \\"Watch Over Me\\", Fanning digitally released a fourth single \\"Weekend of Mystery\\", which was not officially on the album, except for those who purchased the album from the iTunes Store. Fanning also took home the award for Best Music Video at the 2006 ARIA Awards for the iconic 'Wish You Well' clip.On 2 December 2005, Fanning announced a nationwide Which Way Home Concert Tour, named after the song on the album of the same name. Fanning played seven shows between 25 February and 10 March 2006, in all of Australia's major capital cities. He was supported by Perth band The Panics and Brisbane singer Andrew Morris. He followed this with the \\"Yesterday's Gone\\" tour, announced on 11 August 2006, and concluding with Powderfinger re-uniting and returning to the recording studio— Fanning later stated that while he enjoyed making Tea & Sympathy, \\"Powderfinger is my real job\\".

Options: - office - bar - barn - industrial area - museum The answer is \\"barn\\" because","completion":"The answer is \\"barn\\" because a milking machine is a piece of equipment used predominantly in the dairy farming industry for the extraction of milk from cows or other dairy animals like goats and sheep. A barn, which is a large structure typically found on farms, is the most suitable location to house and operate milking machines. It provides a safe, clean, and organized environment for the collection of milk. In contrast, the other options are not suitable for the purpose of milking animals. An office is a space used for conducting business, while a bar is a public establishment that serves beverages and is meant for leisure. Neither of these places would be appropriate for dairy farming activities. An industrial area has more to do with large-scale manufacturing and commercial activities rather than agricultural pursuits. Lastly, a museum is a space reserved for the preservation and exhibition of historical and cultural artifacts, which would not typically involve the daily operation of milking machines. That being said, it is important to note that depending on the context, it is theoretically possible to find a milking machine in some of these other settings (e.g., an agricultural museum that showcases historical milking machines). However, the most common and practical location for a milking machine in use would be a barn on a dairy farm."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Mrs. Fairfax confuses her a little at first, because _ is so informal and welcoming. But in due course Jane discovers that Mrs. Fairfax is the housekeeper. Jane's pupil, Adele Varens, is the eight-year-old French child under the legal protection of Mr. Edward Rochester, the owner of the house. (We learn later that her mother had claimed she was his illegitimate daughter. Mr. Rochester is not convinced by this claim, but felt he could not leave the little girl poor when her mother died.) Adele is a pleasant little girl, even if she is not a particularly eager student. Life goes on very peacefully for three months, until the return of Mr. Rochester. Jane first meets him on his horse, and her description of him is quite fanciful. He takes a fall and Jane helps him, although she does not know who he is until they are both back at Thornfield. It is obvious to the reader, although not to Jane, that the reason why Mr. Rochester stays at Thornfield much longer than usual is that he finds her company enjoyable. Jane, unknowingly at first, falls in love with him. Their closeness is very apparent. There is something about Thornfield that is mysterious. Jane is encouraged to focus her attention on the servant Grace Poole, who is Mr. Rochester's mad wife Bertha Mason's keeper at Thornfield, and whose drunken carelessness frequently allows Bertha to escape and do something violent. It is clear to the reader, though, that Mr. Rochester's emotional engagement is immense. When his bed is set on fire, Jane rescues him, but does not understand why the matter is not pursued, despite Mr. Rochester assuring her the criminal is Grace. The next morning Grace behaves as though she has done nothing wrong. Eventually, Mr. Rochester leaves, to go to a house party. He brings everyone at the party back with him, transforming the atmosphere in the house, and delighting Adele. One of the guests is Blanche Ingram, whom Mr. Rochester is confidently expected to marry. However, it is clear from the way she is portrayed in the book that she is too proud; our sympathies are not with her. Mr. Rochester is called away from the house, and when he returns he chooses to play the role of a fortune teller. It is clear to the reader that one of his motives is to try to turn Blanche against the idea of marriage to him. While he has clearly bothered her, he is unsuccessful. One afternoon, Jane hears that her cousin John Reed is dead and Mrs. Reed, who is probably on her deathbed, has been asking for her. With strict instructions from Mr. Rochester to return quickly, she sets off to Gateshead. On arrival, she realizes she no longer hates her cousins. However, Mrs. Reed is still bitter towards her, owing to the fact that Jane's mother was Mr Reed's favourite sister and this resulted in him apparently favouring Jane over his own children. A short time later, Mrs. Reed gives Jane a letter from her uncle, John Eyre, that was written three years earlier. It explains how he planned to adopt Jane and allow her to inherit his fortune. Mrs. Reed never handed the letter over because of her bitterness. Jane tries once more to seek reconciliation , but without success; her aunt dies that night. 1. Who arrives at Thornfield? 2.

Contemporary hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry. The first known instance of Newton's lines joined to music was in A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon's Hymns (London, 1808), where it is set to the tune \\"Hephzibah\\" by English composer John Husband. Common meter hymns were interchangeable with a variety of tunes; more than twenty musical settings of \\"Amazing Grace\\" circulated with varying popularity until 1835 when William Walker assigned Newton's words to a traditional song named \\"New Britain\\", which was itself an amalgamation of two melodies (\\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\") first published in the Columbian Harmony by Charles H. Spilman and Benjamin Shaw (Cincinnati, 1829). Spilman and Shaw, both students at Kentucky's Centre College, compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals, to satisfy \\"the wants of the Church in her triumphal march\\". Most of the tunes had been previously published, but \\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\" had not. As neither tune is attributed and both show elements of oral transmission, scholars can only speculate that they are possibly of British origin.

Write highlights for this article: Britain should have no fear of quitting the European Union, which could ‘open up opportunities’ for the country, a senior Tory minister says today. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, increasingly tipped as a future party leader, said he was not concerned about Britain’s prospects outside the EU if people voted to leave in a referendum. ‘I think it would open up opportunities. I am not afraid of that at all,’ he told the Daily Mail in a wide-ranging interview. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, increasingly tipped as a future party leader, said he was not concerned about Britain’s prospects outside the EU if people voted to leave in a referendum. He said it could 'open opportunities' The Tories’ pledge to give people their first say on Britain’s place in Europe for nearly 40 years – and a commitment to stop European human rights judges interfering in British law – will be centrepieces of the party’s pitch at next year’s general election. The Prime Minister will unveil plans to curtail the role of the controversial European Court of Human Rights in the UK at the final Conservative Party conference before the election, which starts this weekend in Birmingham. He is expected to pledge to scrap Labour’s Human Rights Act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights. Mr Cameron will promise a mechanism which will establish pre-eminence for Britain’s Parliament and Supreme Court, allowing them to over-ride Strasbourg rulings, according to sources. Mr Javid backed the Prime Minister’s plan to renegotiate looser ties with Brussels before holding a referendum by the end of 2017. ‘We have reason to be confident,’ he said. ‘Look at what we have already achieved – getting us out of the EU bailout fund, reducing the budget of the EU, vetoing a treaty.’ But the Culture Secretary went further than Mr Cameron on the possibility of an exit, insisting Britain could prosper outside the EU. ‘If you said to me: “Are you worried or frightened or concerned that the British people might vote to leave?”, that doesn’t frighten me,’ Mr Javid said. The Culture Secretary backed Prime Minister David Cameron’s plan to renegotiate looser ties with Brussels before holding a referendum by 2017. ‘We should have a referendum on in/out, and if the British people decide Britain is better off outside, I would respect that decision. I think it would open up opportunities. I am not afraid of that at all.’ The European Convention on Human Rights, which is enshrined in British law by the Human Rights Act, has become increasingly unpopular with most Conservatives. Critics say the Strasbourg court has roamed way beyond its remit and created new rights never intended by the founders of the convention – such as its recent attempt to insist Britain must overturn a blanket ban on prisoners voting in elections. The ECHR has also been cited by dozens of people fighting deportation, who have argued its provisions mean they are entitled to various rights to be considered, including the right to a family life. Mr Cameron is understood to be convinced that much anti-European sentiment is due to Strasbourg rulings preventing the removal of foreign-born criminals and terror suspects, though the convention and the court in fact have nothing to do with Brussels. Two of the Government’s biggest defenders of the court – former Attorney General Dominic Grieve and veteran Cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke – were sacked in the Prime Minister’s Cabinet reshuffle this summer. ‘This issue is now going to be dealt with,’ said one government source. Tory strategists also hope a harder line on human rights laws will help win over disaffected voters considering backing Ukip.","completion":"A senior Tory minister, Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, believes that Britain should not be afraid of leaving the European Union.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Bring a notebook and pen to the speech, so you can make note of areas that need improvement. Writing down a shorthand account of what the speaker said will help you to organize the points when it’s time to deliver your critique. Being as detailed as possible in your notes will help the speaker understand exactly what to work on for next time. If there are no restrictions against it and you have time, record the speech using either a video camera or a tape recorder. This way, you will have the opportunity to play back the speech more than once to get an idea of what point the speaker was making, as well as how well they said it. Organize your notes so there’s a section on content and a section on delivery. Include examples to back up your evaluation of each. Deconstruct the speech by part, starting with the introduction and ending with the conclusion. Give an overall evaluation of whether you felt the main points of the speech were adequately presented and reinforced, and whether you felt the speech as a whole seemed convincing and credible. Would you consider it a successful speech, or does it need to be revised? Tell the speaker what elements of the speech were interesting, which parts were confusing, and which areas need more references to back them up. If there were certain jokes or anecdotes that didn’t work, let the speaker know. It’s better to be honest now than to let the person tell the same bad joke twice. Tell the speaker whether you felt the speech was appropriate for the intended audience. It is in this area that speakers often need the most feedback, since it’s difficult to evaluate your own body language and style. Give the speaker a gentle but honest critique of the effectiveness of his or her body language and delivery, including tone of voice, pacing, eye contact, and posture. It might be helpful to discuss the concept of emotional intelligence, or EQ, which refers to the ability to read an audience and keep people engaged by affecting their emotions. The point of making eye contact, speaking clearly and sounding natural is to make the audience feel as though you care about them and you want them to understand where you’re coming from. Helping them feel included will make them more likely to stay engaged. If the speaker seemed nervous, you might suggest that he or she practice techniques that help reduce stage fright, like exercising before the speech, laughing before the speech and practicing in front of a small group of people first. The speaker you’re critiquing likely put some time and effort into writing and practicing the speech. Any time you’re giving a critique, it’s just as important to point out what went right as it is to discuss what needs improvement. If you’re working with a student or someone who needs help improving their speech-giving skills, be encouraging and complimentary so they have the confidence to keep working on their skills. Try the feedback sandwich technique: give the person a compliment on an element of their speech, tell them what needs improvement, then give them another compliment. This classic way to deliver constructive criticism makes the medicine go down more easily. For example, you could tell the person he or she started with a brilliant hook, but you were confused about how the second point related to the thesis. However, the conclusion clarified the main point. As a way to encourage the person to keep learning and improving, you might suggest he or she watch videos of speeches given by famous speakers. Point out similarities and differences between the speech you’re critiquing and the famous speech. Summary:","completion":"The article provides comprehensive guidance on how to effectively critique a speech, recommending recording the speech for detailed analysis, taking thorough notes on both content and delivery, and dissecting the speech into sections for precise feedback. It emphasizes honest feedback on each aspect, and the importance of informing the speaker about their strengths, parts of the speech that were confusing, and areas that need more substantiation. The article suggests informing the speaker if certain joking or storytelling parts were ineffective. After discussing the appropriateness of the speech for the target audience, it emphasizes providing constructive criticism on body language, delivery style, and emotional engagement with the audience. It advises discussing emotional intelligence and strategies to mitigate nervousness.

Here is a goal: Easily clean grease off backsplash tiles behind stove. Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal? Available choices: + Coat tiles with car wax.. + Coat tiles with candle wax..","completion":"To accomplish the goal of easily cleaning grease off backsplash tiles behind a stove, the best available choice between the two provided options would be to coat the tiles with car wax. Here is a detailed reasoning and comparison for both options: Car Wax: 1. Composition: Car wax is a formula specifically designed to protect surfaces from dirt, grease, and other contaminants. It usually contains solvents, polymers, and natural and synthetic waxes that create a protective layer on the surface, making the surface hydrophobic and resistant to dirt. 2. Application: Car wax is easy to apply, typically using a microfiber cloth to spread it onto the surface evenly and allow it to dry. It also requires a simple buffing after drying, which can be quickly accomplished by wiping the surface with a clean cloth. 3. Benefits: Using car wax on the backsplash tiles will create a durable barrier against grease and grime, making it easier to clean off any stains resulting from cooking. The hydrophobic properties will prevent water-based substances from adhering to the surface and protect the tiles from potential damage. 4. Safety: Car wax is appropriate for household use, safe for use on various materials, and does not pose any significant health risks. Candle Wax: 1. Composition: Candle wax is made from a variety of materials, such as paraffin, stearin, beeswax, or soy, primarily designed for candle-making purposes and not suitable for protecting surfaces from dirt or grime without additional processing. 2. Application: Applying candle wax to a surface would require melting the wax, which can be hazardous if not done carefully. Moreover, it is difficult to spread it evenly on a vertical surface, such as backsplash tiles, without the risk of wax drips and an uneven coat. 3. Benefits: Although candle wax may offer temporary protection against grease and dirt, it lacks the durable and robust characteristics of car wax, making it less efficient for this purpose. It may also require frequent reapplication to maintain effectiveness. 4. Safety: Chemical additives found in some candle waxes, such as paraffin, may release harmful fumes when heated, posing potential health risks. Furthermore, the process of melting wax can be dangerous, leading to potential burns or fire hazards, especially in a kitchen environment. In conclusion, car wax emerges as the more reasonable option to protect backsplash tiles from grease and grime. It is specifically designed for protecting surfaces from dirt and contaminants, is easy and safe to apply, and provides a durable solution that would simplify the cleaning process. In comparison, candle wax is not suitable for this purpose due to its inadequate protective properties, complicated application process, and potential safety concerns."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness.

Analyze the given information. 2. Compare it with the question. 3. Research if necessary. 4. Provide the final answer. Step 1: Analyze the given information The information provided tells us about the government of the Greek state of Sybaris offering a one-year patent for new refinements in luxury around 500 BCE. Step 2: Compare it with the question The question asks about the recognition of copyright in Jewish law. The provided information is not about Jewish law or copyright but rather a patent in the Greek state of Sybaris. Step 3: Research if necessary I will conduct quick research to determine when Jewish law recognized copyright. Based on my research, Jewish law does address concepts of intellectual property rights dating back to the Talmud, which discusses the idea of \\"hasagat ge'vul,\\" meaning \\"boundary encroachment.\\" This concept prevents unfair competition and defends intellectual property rights, though it does not directly align with the modern concept of copyright. The recognition of copyright in Jewish law, as we understand it today, comes later during the Jewish Enlightenment (Haskalah) period, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries. Step 4: Provide the final answer The answer \\"In 500 BCE, the government of the Greek state of Sybaris offered one year's patent to all who should discover any new refinement in luxury\\" is not a good answer to the question \\"When did Jewish law recognize copyright?\\". Instead, you could answer that Jewish law recognized concepts related to intellectual property rights as early as in the Talmud with the \\"hasagat ge'vul\\" concept, while the understanding of copyright in Jewish law as we know it today developed during the Jewish Enlightenment period in the 18th and 19th centuries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The City of London is a city and county within London. It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders. The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the City of Westminster). - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - Prince of Orange is a title originally associated with the sovereign Principality of Orange, in what is now southern France. Under the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713, Frederick William I of Prussia ceded the Principality of Orange to King Louis XIV of France (while retaining the title as part of his dynastic titulature). After William III of England died without children, a dispute arose between Johan Willem Friso and Frederick I of Prussia, which was settled in the Treaty of Partition (1732); consequently, Friso's son, William IV had to share use of the title \\"Prince of Orange\\" (which had accumulated prestige in the Netherlands and throughout the Protestant world) with Frederick William I of Prussia. The title is traditionally borne by the heir apparent of the Dutch monarch. The title descends via absolute primogeniture since 1983, meaning that its holder can be either Prince or Princess of Orange. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The Treaty of Utrecht, which established the Peace of Utrecht, is a series of individual peace treaties, rather than a single document, signed by the belligerents in the War of the Spanish Succession, in the Dutch city of Utrecht in March and April 1713. The treaties between several European states, including Spain, Great Britain, France, Portugal, Savoy and the Dutch Republic, helped end the war. - Prussia was a historic state originating out of the Duchy of Prussia and the Margraviate of Brandenburg, and centred on the region of Prussia. For centuries, the House of ruled Prussia, successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organised and effective army. Prussia, with its capital in and from 1701 in Berlin, shaped the history of Germany. In 1871, German states united to create the German Empire under Prussian leadership. In November 1918, the monarchies were abolished and the nobility lost its political power during the German Revolution of 191819. The Kingdom of Prussia was thus abolished in favour of a republicthe Free State of Prussia, a state of Germany from 1918 until 1933. From 1933, Prussia lost its independence as a result of the Prussian coup, when the Nazi regime was successfully establishing its ' laws in pursuit of a unitary state. With the end of the Nazi regime, the division of Germany into allied-occupation zones and the separation of its territories east of the line, which were incorporated into Poland and the Soviet Union, the State of Prussia ceased to exist de facto in 1945. Prussia existed \\"\\" until its formal liquidation by the Allied Control Council Enactment No. 46 of 25 February 1947. - Frederick William I (14 August 1688 31 May 1740), known as the 'Soldier King,' was the King in Prussia and Elector of Brandenburg from 1713 until his death, as well as the father of Frederick the Great. He was in personal union the sovereign prince of the Principality of Neuchâtel. - The London Assembly is an elected body, part of the Greater London Authority, that scrutinises the activities of the Mayor of London and has the power, with a two-thirds majority, to amend the Mayor's annual budget and to reject the Mayor's draft statutory strategies. The assembly was established in 2000 and meets at City Hall on the South Bank of the River Thames, close to Tower Bridge. The assembly is also able to investigate other issues of importance to Londoners (transport, environmental matters, etc.), publish its findings and recommendations, and make proposals to the Mayor. - Francesco Guerini ( fl . 1740 -- 1770 ) was a Neapolitan violinist and composer whose works were published throughout Europe in the mid 18th century . While his birthdate is unknown , Guerini worked in The Hague for the Prince of Orange from 1740 until 1760 , at which time he moved to London , where he was active until 1770 . Most of Guerini 's published compositions were sonatas for one or two violins and continuo , but he also wrote keyboard works as well as Six Sonates / A deux Flûtes , ou deux Violons ... Ouevre III ( with no continuo ) , Paris , ca . 1750 , or Six Solos for a Violoncello with a Thorough Bass for the Harpsichord , Opus 9 , first published in London in 1765 . - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union.

London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Middlesex (abbreviation: Middx) was a county in southeast England that is now mostly part of Greater London, with small sections in neighbouring counties. It was established in the Anglo-Saxon system from the territory of the Middle Saxons, and existed as an official unit until 1965. The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from east to west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries. The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831. - The Mayor of London is an elected politician who, along with the London Assembly of 25 members, is accountable for the strategic government of Greater London. The current mayor is Sadiq Khan, who took up office on 9 May 2016. The position had been held by Ken Livingstone from the creation of the role on 4 May 2000 until he was defeated in 2008 by Boris Johnson, who served two terms before being succeeded by Khan. - William III (4 November 1650 8 March 1702; also widely known as William of Orange) was sovereign Prince of Orange from birth, Stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Gelderland, and Overijssel in the Dutch Republic from 1672, and King of England, Ireland, and Scotland from 1689 until his death. It is a coincidence that his regnal number (III) was the same for both Orange and England. As King of Scotland, he is known as William II. He is informally known by sections of the population in Northern Ireland and Scotland as \\"King Billy\\". - Surrey is a county in the south east of England and also one of the home counties bordering Greater London. Surrey shares borders with Kent to the east, East Sussex to the south-east, West Sussex to the south, Hampshire to the west and south-west and Berkshire to the north-west. The county town is Guildford. Surrey County Council sits extraterritorially at Kingston upon Thames, administered as part of Greater London since 1965. With a resident population of 1.1 million, Surrey is the most densely populated and third most populated county in the South East region, after Kent and Hampshire. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Frederick I (11 July 1657 25 February 1713), of the Hohenzollern dynasty, was (as Frederick III) Elector of Brandenburg (16881713) and Duke of Prussia in personal union (Brandenburg-Prussia). The latter function he upgraded to royalty, becoming the first King in Prussia (17011713). From 1707 he was in personal union the sovereign prince of the Principality of Neuchâtel. He was also the paternal grandfather of Frederick the Great. - The Principality of Orange (in French \\"la Principauté d'Orange\\") was, from 1163 to 1713, a feudal state in Provence, in the south of modern-day France, on the left bank of the river Rhone north of the city of Avignon. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean.

Question: You are given a new situation: Ryan is carrying groceries from his car back to his apartment when he trips and falls landing on his knees. Embarrassed, he gets back up, picks up his groceries and carries them into his apartment with his head down. After putting his groceries away, he notices that although both of his knees are scraped, only his left knee is warm to the touch. His right knee feels cool when he puts his hand on it. and a hint : The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. Please answer this question : Is more blood flowing to the right or left knee? Answer:","completion":"More blood is flowing to the left knee. Step 1: Identify the symptoms of both knees. - Both knees are scraped, but only the left knee is warm to the touch. The right knee feels cool. Step 2: Refer to the hint for information about the body's response to inflammation. - Inflammation is a response to infections or injuries and causes blood vessels to dilate, increasing blood flow to the damaged area, making it red and warm. Step 3: Compare the symptoms with the information from the hint. - The left knee is warm, indicating increased blood flow due to inflammation as a response to the injury. Step 4: Determine which knee has more blood flow. - Since the left knee is warm and the right knee is cool, it can be concluded that more blood is flowing to the left knee as a result of the body's inflammatory response to the injury."},{"prompt":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

UK factories enjoyed a surge in new orders over the summer, but high oil prices weighed on the service sector, surveys suggest.","completion":"The situation being discussed here involves the UK's manufacturing and service sectors' performance over the summer period. It highlights the contrasting circumstances faced by these two key areas of the economy. On one hand, UK factories experienced an increase in new orders, contributing positively to the overall production capacity and economic growth. On the other hand, the service sector faced challenges due to high oil prices, which negatively impacted its performance. To provide more context, let's delve into these two aspects individually: 1. Surge in new orders for UK factories: During the summer months, UK manufacturing facilities witnessed a significant increase in new orders. This can be attributed to a variety of factors. Firstly, with COVID-19 restrictions easing in the UK and globally, businesses and consumers alike experienced increased confidence in economic stability, leading to higher demand for goods. This, in turn, resulted in new orders for factories to fulfill. Additionally, the Brexit transition period concluded at the end of 2020, and businesses in the UK and EU have been adapting to the new trade arrangements. This could have led to an increased demand for UK-made goods, contributing to the rise in factory orders. Furthermore, various government stimulus programs and support measures for both businesses and individuals were introduced to alleviate the economic impact of the pandemic. This increased disposable income and encouraged spending, translating into higher demand for consumer goods and, consequently, increased orders for UK factories. 2. High oil prices and the service sector: Conversely, the UK service sector faced headwinds during the same period, primarily due to high oil prices. The price of oil is a critical factor for the service sector because it influences the costs of transportation, energy, and production. When oil prices rise, it often results in increased operating costs for businesses operating in the service industry. Higher oil prices can cause numerous challenges for businesses in the service sector. For instance, transportation costs for goods and people increase, directly affecting the service industry, such as logistics, courier services, and public transportation. In addition, businesses that rely on energy-intensive processes or equipment may need to pay higher energy costs, subsequently influencing their overall expenses and profit margins. Moreover, higher fuel prices can also contribute to inflation, leading to increased costs of living and curbed consumer spending, which negatively affects service providers reliant on consumer spending. In conclusion, the summer months brought mixed fortunes for the UK's manufacturing and service sectors. While factories enjoyed a surge in new orders due to increased demand, eased COVID-19 restrictions, government stimulus programs, and businesses adapting to post-Brexit trade, the service sector faced challenges due to the rising oil prices that added pressure on operating costs, and potentially suppressed consumer spending. These contrasting situations demonstrate the complexities and interconnectedness of different parts of the economy and the importance of maintaining a balanced approach to foster sustainable growth and development across all sectors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Kai turned their lights away from the house because they didn't want to wake anyone inside. Given the context: What does Kai need to do before this? Possible answers: have their lights on, have their lights broken, drive in front of the park A:","completion":"In the given context, prior to turning their lights away from the house, Kai would need to have their lights on. This action suggests that they are most likely in a vehicle, and the presence of functional lights is necessary for them to illuminate the house in the first place. Having their lights on indicates that Kai is using their headlights or some other source of light that is attached to their vehicle. These lights would be shining towards the house, causing potential disturbance to the people inside. Kai's decision to turn the lights away from the house is likely out of courtesy, aiming to prevent unwanted light from entering the rooms of the residents who may be sleeping or need a dark environment. Having their lights broken would not be a factor in this situation, as Kai would not be able to light up the house with broken lights. Additionally, driving in front of the park does not seem directly related to the given context since it's not an activity Kai must do before turning their lights away from the house. In summary, the most appropriate and logical answer is that Kai needs to have their lights on before turning them away from the house in order to avoid disturbing anyone inside."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At the opening of his latest exhibition, Colorful World in the Eyes of Sean Chen, at the National Museum of China recently, the artist told his story. Chen left China for Australia in 1986 to seek artistic freedom, and like many new immigrants then, he had little money in his pocket. To make ends meet, he drew portraits of people in the street. Every day, he saw people buy ice cream from a shop. Chen couldn't help wondering: \\"It must taste great, that's why so many people buy it.\\" But he didn't buy one for himself because he had to save money to support his studies. After four months of painting there and watching people eat ice cream, Chen didn't resist the temptation --- he bought an ice cream. \\"The first bite took me to heaven,\\" Chen recalls while laughing. \\"You know, as a poor young man in a new country, an ice cream was too expensive then.\\" Since then, he kept the taste of the ice cream in his heart and included the happy feelings in his paintings, which turn out to be colorful and sweet. His current exhibition is part of his nationwide tour that began at the National Art Museum of China in Beijing in 2011. He plans to take his artworks to 24 cities around China by 2016. The exhibition at the National Art Museum of China will last until April 22. After the exhibition tour, he will sell his works through an auction , and all the money will be donated to protection of the environment in China. \\"The natural environment of New Zealand has inspired my artwork and brought me enjoyment.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What is the punishment called when a member loses service privileges but is not shunned?\\" Context: \\"Formal discipline is administered by congregation elders. When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help and possibly administer discipline. Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that \\"losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses,' see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah.\\" The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior. Members who disassociate (formally resign) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned. Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced. Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service, but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship. Marking, a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship, is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin.[note 4]\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The punishment called when a member loses service privileges but is not shunned is known as \\"Reproof.\\" This is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin.

Please answer a question about the following article about Chihuahua (state): The state united behind the Plan of Ayutla and ratified the new constitution in 1855. The state was able to survive through the Reform War with minimal damage due to the large number of liberal political figures. The 1858 conservative movement did not succeed in the state even after the successful military campaign of the conservative Zuloaga with 1,000 men occupied the cities of Chihuahua and Parral. In August 1859, Zuloaga and his forces were defeated by the liberal Orozco and his forces; Orozco soon after deposed the state governor, but had to flee to Durango two months later. In the late 1860s the conservative General Cajen briefly entered the state after his campaign through the state of Jalisco and helped establish conservative politicians and ran out the liberal leaders Jesús González Ortega and José María Patoni. Cajen took possession of the state capital and established himself as governor; he brooked no delay in uniting a large force to combat the liberal forces which he defeated in La Batalla del Gallo. Cajen attained several advantages over the liberals within the state, but soon lost his standing due to a strong resurgence of the liberal forces within the state. The successful liberal leaders José María Patoni of Durango and J.E. Muñoz of Chihuahua quickly strengthened their standing by limiting the political rights of the clergy implementing the presidential decree.

Here's why: The premise clearly specifies that \\"You can drive right up to some; others require a walk.\\" This statement implies that there are certain things (the nature of these things is not specified in the premise, but let’s call them ‘points’ for the sake of discussion) that one can reach directly using some form of vehicular transportation, i.e., drive up to them. However, it also explicitly says that there are other points that \\"require a walk.\\" The phrase \\"require a walk\\" suggests that there is a necessity for certain points to be reached on foot, thereby eliminating vehicular transportation as an option for those points. This necessity could be due to various factors like the nature of the terrain, environmental protection rules, accessibility issues, etc. Therefore, it could be judged that the premise consists of two distinct groups of points according to their accessibility: 1. Points that can be reached by driving 2. Points that necessitate walking So, when the hypothesis suggests that \\"You can drive to all of them,\\" it contradicts the information provided in the premise, as the premise clearly states not all points allow or can be reached by driving. Thus, this generalization is not valid based upon the given premise. To align with the premise, the hypothesis could be modified to a conditional statement such as, \\"You can drive to some of them, and will have to walk to reach others.\\" This would reflect the description and conditions given in the initial premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Roman histories and biographies anticipated the extensive mediaeval literature of lives of saints and miraculous chronicles, but the most characteristic form of the Middle Ages was the romance, an adventurous and sometimes magical narrative with strong popular appeal. Controversial, religious, political and instructional literature proliferated during the Renaissance as a result of the invention of printing, while the mediaeval romance developed into a more character-based and psychological form of narrative, the novel, of which early and important examples are the Chinese Monkey and the German Faust books. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What genre was the most characteristic form of the Bronze Ages?","completion":"To answer this question, I will perform some research on the literature and writing forms of the Bronze Age. Step 1: Research the time period and literature of the Bronze Age. - The Bronze Age was a historical period characterized by the use of bronze, the early development of urban civilization, and often marked by advancements in areas such as writing, architecture, and art. This period occurred between approximately 3300 and 1200 BCE. - The ancient civilizations known for their Bronze Age accomplishments include the Sumerians, the Ancient Egyptians, the Minoans, the Mycenaeans, and the Hittites among others. Step 2: Identify prominent literary forms and genres of the Bronze Age. - The earliest forms of writing appeared during the Bronze Age. This included the development of cuneiform by the Sumerians and hieroglyphics by the Egyptians. - Literature in the Bronze Age was primarily focused on religious texts, laws, accounts, and poetry. - Some examples of Bronze Age literature include the Egyptian Book of the Dead, the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh, the Instructions of Shuruppak, and the Hittite Code of the Nesilim. Based on the available information, it is difficult to pinpoint a specific genre as the most characteristic form of the Bronze Age, as the various genres and texts produced during this time were primarily religious or legal in nature, and storytelling or narrative genres, like romance or novel, were not as developed or prominent during this time period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hint: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry.

The Bush administration then turned its attention to Iraq, and argued the need to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq had become urgent. Among the stated reasons were that Saddam's regime had tried to acquire nuclear material and had not properly accounted for biological and chemical material it was known to have previously possessed, and believed to still maintain. Both the possession of these weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the failure to account for them, would violate the U.N. sanctions. The assertion about WMD was hotly advanced by the Bush administration from the beginning, but other major powers including China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced that Iraq was a threat and refused to allow passage of a UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force. Iraq permitted UN weapon inspectors in November 2002, who were continuing their work to assess the WMD claim when the Bush administration decided to proceed with war without UN authorization and told the inspectors to leave the country. The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, along with a \\"coalition of the willing\\" that consisted of additional troops from the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, from Australia and Poland. Within about three weeks, the invasion caused the collapse of both the Iraqi government and its armed forces, however, the U.S. and allied forces failed to find any weapon of mass destruction in Iraq. Traces of former materials and weapons labs were reported to have been located, but no \\"smoking guns\\". Nevertheless, on May 1, George W. Bush landed on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, in a Lockheed S-3 Viking, where he gave a speech announcing the end of \\"major combat operations\\" in the Iraq War. Bush's approval rating in May was at 66%, according to a CNN–USA Today–Gallup poll. However, Bush's high approval ratings did not last. First, while the war itself was popular in the U.S., the reconstruction and attempted \\"democratization\\" of Iraq lost some support as months passed and casualty figures increased, with no decrease in violence nor progress toward stability or reconstruction. Second, as investigators combed through the country, they failed to find the predicted WMD stockpiles, which led to debate over the rationale for the war.

Q:Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What is the genre that AllMusic defines as the \\"most abrasive and aggressive fusion of rock and electronic music\\" and is used in the fourth and final studio album by The Axis of Perdition? A:","completion":"The genre that AllMusic defines as the \\"most abrasive and aggressive fusion of rock and electronic music\\" is known as Industrial Metal. Industrial Metal is a diverse and innovative musical style that combines the hard-hitting and powerful elements of heavy metal with the futuristic and experimental sounds of industrial music. The roots of Industrial Metal can be traced back to the late 1970s and early 1980s when rock bands and electronic artists began experimenting with new ways to combine their sounds. With the advent of digital sampling technology, musicians and producers were able to integrate synthesized sounds, digital effects, and distorted recordings into their compositions. This resulted in dense, abrasive, and aggressive soundscapes that pushed the boundaries of contemporary music. As a genre, Industrial Metal typically features aggressive guitar riffs, powerful drumming, and commanding vocals. These elements are often enhanced with electronic elements such as synthesizers, drum machines, and looping equipment. Lyrically, Industrial Metal often explores themes of dystopia, oppression, societal decay, and individual freedom, reflecting the heavy and brutal nature of its sound. The Axis of Perdition, a UK-based experimental extreme metal band, has released four studio albums throughout their career. Their fourth and final studio album, \\"Tenements (Of The Anointed Flesh),\\" released in 2011, prominently features the Industrial Metal genre. This album showcases the band's penchant for combining the aggressive and dark aspects of black metal, death metal, and grindcore, with the ambient and experimental qualities often found in industrial music. The end result is a sonic journey that explores the depths of darkness, despair, and sonic chaos - a fitting representation of the abrasive and aggressive nature of Industrial Metal. The inclusion of Industrial Metal on the Axis of Perdition's final studio album further solidifies the importance of this genre within the world of extreme music. With its innovative fusion of rock and electronic music, Industrial Metal has left a significant impact on various subgenres and continues to challenge the limits of musical expression."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

PUBLISHED:. 21:02 EST, 24 February 2013. |. UPDATED:. 05:27 EST, 25 February 2013. Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, whose fortune is estimated at more than 1 billion, has been on the run since 2001 when he escaped from a Mexican prison in a laundry truck. Officials now say there is no evidence the world's most powerful drug baron Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman was killed in a February 21 shootout in the Guatemalan jungle. Earlier reports claimed 'El Chapo' died in a hail of bullets February 21 in a jungle shootout with a rival gang near the Mexican border. Last week, villagers in the Peten province near the border with Mexico, claimed they spotted a blood-soaked body that resembled the fugitive Sinaloa cartel leader slumped in a car after after a clash between two heavily-armed drugs gangs. Guatemalan Interior Minister Mauricio Lopez Bonilla now calls the reports a misunderstanding. After police and soldiers assessed the area of the shootout, no evidence the kingpin was even there was found. He called the confusion a result of mistaken eyewitness accounts and apologized for the earlier reports. 'I apologize if where was a misunderstanding. It was a mix-up,' Bonilla told Guatemalan radio station Emisores Unidos. 'We were referring to information generated from the area that there was possibly a crime scene with a dead person resembling El Chapo.' 'As of now, we have no verification,' he said. Misunderstanding? Villagers in the Peten province of Guatemala near the border with Mexico claimed they found a body resembling El Chapo but officials have now called it all a 'misunderstanding' Public Enemy Number One: Chicago's crime commission this month officially recognized him as the city's Public Enemy Number One, a year after the US Treasury Department named the kingpin as the 'world's most influential drugs trafficker' before. He is the top dog in Mexico's bloody drug war, presiding over a 1 billion drug empire and accused of firing the first shot in a bloody cartel war that has so far killed 38,000 people. And in 2011, aside from a personal fortune to rival Bill Gates and Warren. Buffet, Joaquin Guzman Loera was officially named as the. world's most wanted man. Guzman has been the subject of a vast manhunt for the last ten years after he escaped from a Mexican high security prison in a complex break out that reportedly cost him £2.5million. Since then the drug lord known as 'El Chapo' - meaning 'Shorty' - because of his 5ft 2in height has eluded capture, protected by his vast Sinaloa drug cartel and no doubt a legion of corrupt officials paid from his vast wealth. He has attained almost mythical status in Mexico vast drugs operation that runs shipments of tons at a time from Columbia into Mexico and on to the United States. He is accused of starting Mexico's cartel wars when his hitmen. assassinated the leader of the Juarez cartel and his wife in 2004 in a. bid to take control of the city of Cidudad Juarez, breaking the pact of. non-aggression that had previously existed. As tit for tat. fighting escalated, government troops were sent into drug strongholds in. 2006 marking the start of a conflict that has so far claimed. 38,000 lives. Now. El Chapo is said to have infiltrated the highest level of Mexico's. government as President Felipe Calderon fights to keep control of his. country amid claims that such drug lords are. really the ones in charge. Government spokesman Francisco Cuevas. first told Guatevision Television that two drug gangs had clashed in. Peten, an area that has seen an increase in drug violence and that at. least two men had died in the shootout. Later, Cuevas told Mexico's Televisa. network that authorities hadn't yet found a body or the scene where. reports said a shootout took place. He never said what led officials to think that one of the dead men might be Guzman. But Interior Department spokeswoman. Carla Herrera told The Associated Press that one of the victims. physically resembled the drug lord. She said officials had asked the. Mexican government to send Guzman's fingerprints to compare them to the. man found inside a vehicle and to send investigators. Even then, Bonilla told the AP that it was residents of the town of San Francisco who had told officials of a gun battle and reported that one of the people killed looked like Guzman. Peten province is an isolated area of jungle and ranches where 27 ranch workers were massacred in 2011 by the Zetas drug gang, a top rival for Guzman's Sinaloa drug cartel. Guzman, who has been in hiding since escaping from a Mexican prison in a laundry cart in 2001, is one of the world's most dangerous and most wanted fugitives. El Chapo's, fortune is estimated at more than 1 billion, and he's been on the run since 2001 when he escaped from a Mexican. prison in a laundry truck. There has been a 7million bounty on his head ever since. Last year, the US Treasury Department. named the kingpin as the 'world's most influential drugs trafficker' before. Chicago's crime commission this month officially recognized him as the city's. Public Enemy Number One - the first time the infamous soubriquet has. been rolled out since Al Capone in the 1920s. Authorities say his Sinaloa cartel. has recently been expanding his drug business abroad, building. international operations in Central and South America and the Pacific. And earlier this month, Guzman formally received the title of Chicago's Public Enemy No. in both the Chicago Crime Commission and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's first use since Prohibition. The. Public Enemy No. 1 label was created for mobster Al Capone. But the DEA. said Sinaloa cartel leader Guzman is more menacing than the Chicago. gangster was.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person that Minnesota is the only state in the nation that did not for vote for in either of his presidential runs? Minnesota is known for a politically active citizenry, and populism has been a long-standing force among the state's political parties. Minnesota has a consistently high voter turnout. In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, 78.2% of eligible Minnesotans voted—the highest percentage of any U.S. state—versus the national average of 61.2%. Voters can register on election day at their polling places with evidence of residency.Hubert Humphrey brought national attention to the state with his address at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota is the only state in the nation that did not vote for Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota has gone for the Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Republican Richard Nixon. Both the Democratic and Republican parties have major-party status in Minnesota, but its state-level \\"Democratic\\" party is actually a separate party, officially known as the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL). It was formed out of a 1944 alliance of the Minnesota Democratic and Farmer-Labor parties. The state has had active third-party movements. The Reform Party, now the Independence Party, was able to elect former mayor of Brooklyn Park and professional wrestler Jesse Ventura to the governorship in 1998. The Independence Party has received enough support to keep major-party status. The Green Party, while no longer having major-party status, has a large presence in municipal government, notably in Minneapolis and Duluth, where it competes directly with the DFL party for local offices.

The young man used the motorcycle to get to work instead of the bicycle because the","completion":"day was exceptionally hot and humid, and he didn't want to arrive at work drenched in sweat. As his motorcycle rumbled to life, he decided to take a longer, more scenic route that would weave through the outskirts of the city and offer him the cool breeze that would make the unbearable heat more tolerable. He knew it would add to his commute time, but he didn't mind. After all, he had always been one to appreciate the beauty of nature and the environment around him. The sun had just begun to rise, casting a golden hue on the sky and illuminating the tiny specks of dew that clung to the leaves. The young man rode his motorcycle across the empty roads, the warm air buffeting against his body as he carved through the city’s early morning stillness. He enjoyed the feeling of freedom the motorcycle gave him, something he found to be lacking in the confined spaces of public transit or in the slow crawl of a bicycle journey. His route took him past a serene lake, its waters reflecting the sky like a mirror. The sight was so enchanting he couldn’t help but pull over to admire it, and as he sat on the edge of the shore, he noticed small ripples in the water as if invisible creatures were dancing beneath the surface. Some distance away, a group of ducks floated gracefully, their synchronized movements a charming spectacle. The young man made a mental note to pack a sketchpad and some pencils the next time he stopped here, wanting to capture the scene that had mesmerized him so. He spent a few minutes basking in the peaceful atmosphere, allowing the subtle sounds around him to wash over his senses – the distant hum of a car, the gentle rustling of leaves, the melodious chirping of birds. Finally, feeling rejuvenated, he continued his ride through the winding roads, noticing the subtle changes in the flora and fauna as he went. Wildflowers lined the edge of the roads, their vibrant colors sprinkling the landscape with subtle beauty. He marveled at the way the morning light, now stronger, filtered through the trees and dappled the earth with a kaleidoscope of hues. He sighed with contentment, knowing that despite the extra time this route had added to his journey, it had also filled him with a resplendent joy that made the daily grind of work more bearable. The young man zipped past farmhouses, their grazing cows lazily eyeing the stranger as he whizzed by. As he entered the city's limits, he noticed the landscape becoming more urban and uniform. All around him were concrete structures rising into the sky, perhaps once magnificent but now eroding under the unyielding pressure of time. The city bustled with people heading to work, and the hum of machinery echoed louder as the day awoke. The young man arrived at work just in time, savoring the memory of the morning's adventure as he carefully parked his motorcycle and donned his familiar work attire. Navigating through the office, he greeted his colleagues with a warm smile and an undeniable energy that could only have come from starting his day with such a splendid detour. As he began his workday, he couldn't help but feel that he had discovered a ritual that would forever change his mornings. It was a simple act, choosing a different mode of transportation and taking a longer route to work, but in its simplicity lay a profound joy – a connection to the world around him and a constant reminder that there was beauty to be found amidst the demands of everyday life. And so, from that day onward, the young man would find solace and happiness in his scenic commute, making his days just a little more magical."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The finished product will look rustic, and will look like the wood of a barn. Because this technique is designed to create a rustic look, you almost never have to sand. The roughness of the wood actually adds to the final, barn-like, product. The wood does not need to be perfectly clean, but if it’s very dirty, wash it with soapy water. Let it dry completely before you begin painting. It is best to pour the paint on the center of the wood. Start with a small amount, and add more if necessary. You can use any type of paint with this technique, although most people find latex paint the easiest to work with. Add water if the paint is too thick. Adding water will also make it easier to drag the paint across the wood. Spread the paint across the wood, into the grain, and let it soak into the grooves. If you want a light coat of paint, you can spread the paint out thinly. For more coverage, don’t spread the paint as widely. Repeat this step to fill in blank areas. Let the piece sit overnight, and then check it. The paint may take longer to dry in areas where you applied thick layers of paint. Make sure it is completely dry, and not tacky to the touch, before you move the wood. If you want the wood to have more coverage, or a brighter finish, add more paint and scrape it across the wood. Add as many layers as you like, but remember that the more paint you apply, the less the wood will show through. Summary:","completion":"The article discusses a technique for giving wood a rustic, barn-like appearance without the need for sanding. Ideal for rough or reclaimed wood, this method involves applying paint, preferably latex, directly onto the wood's surface and allowing it to soak into the grooves and grain. The wood should be reasonably clean, but not necessarily spotless. Paint can be thinned with water to facilitate easy spreading, and the amount of coverage can be adjusted according to preference. Once painted, the wood should be left to dry overnight, with additional layers of paint added if desired.

Hypothesis: A graffiti-covered van is taking children to the market. .Multi-select problem: Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true? Pick from: (a). yes; (b). it is not possible to tell; (c). no;","completion":"(b). it is not possible to tell; Explanation: Given the premise that \\"a white van with graffiti is driving in front of a market,\\" we are provided with a few pieces of information regarding the scenario. However, the hypothesis suggests that \\"a graffiti-covered van is taking children to the market.\\" It's important to analyze these statements and determine if the premise's truth makes the hypothesis true, and in this case, the answer is that it is not possible to tell. First, let's consider what the premise tells us: 1. There is a white van. 2. The van has graffiti on it. 3. The van is driving in front of a market. Now looking at the hypothesis, we can point out the following additional pieces of information: 1. The van is carrying children. 2. The purpose of the van being there is to take the children to the market. None of the above information provided in the hypothesis is implied or directly stated in the premise. Although the premise informs us about the existence and location of the white van with graffiti, it does not provide any details on the passengers of the van (if there are any) or the reasons behind the van's action. In other words, the premise doesn't reveal why the van is there and the intentions of its occupants, especially if there are children involved. It is important to note that although the hypothesis could be true, given that the premise is true, we cannot definitively confirm or deny this scenario solely based on the information provided in the premise. There could be many reasons the van is driving in front of the market – perhaps it is making a delivery or simply passing through. It could be taking children to the market or not, but based solely on the premise at hand, we cannot determine if our assumptions are accurate and conclusive. So, to answer the question, given that the premise is true, we cannot conclusively determine if the hypothesis is true as well. Therefore, the most appropriate answer in this case would be (b) - it is not possible to tell."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Read the following article and select the best answer.

News article: Japanese pop star shaves her head in shame and begs for forgiveness after spending night with boyfriend Japanese starlet Minami Minegishi was scrambling to redeem her girl-next-door image with a remorseful YouTube video on Friday. The real life sorrow of a J-pop fantasy reaches millions. A Japanese pop starlet recorded a tearful video and shaved her head, a traditional gesture of contrition, to apologize for breaking her band's cardinal rule: no dating. \\"If it is possible, I wish from the bottom of my heart to stay in the band. Everything I did is entirely my fault. I am so sorry,\\" said Minami Minegishi, 20, during the nearly four minute video that has been seen nearly 6.9 million times. Her phenomenally successful band AKB48 consists of about 90 girls from their mid-teens to early 20s, who are strongly marketed on their sex appeal. The band's management forbids the members from dating boys for fear that it might shatter the illusion that their male fans might end up with them one day, reports the Agence France-Presse. RELATED: JAPAN’S AKB48, CHOSEN BY FANS, SET TO GO GLOBAL The Japanese tabloid Shukan Bunshun published photographs of Minegishi, one of AKB48's founding members, leaving boy band dancer Alan Shirahama's apartment Thursday. The magazine claimed they had a passionate night together. Within hours, Minegishi shaved off her long hair and called her actions \\"thoughtless and immature\\" as she begged for forgiveness from fans on the band's official YouTube channel. \\"I don't believe just doing this means I can be forgiven for what I did, but the first thing I thought was that I don't want to quit AKB48,\\" said Minegishi. The soft spoken idol's eyes welled up with tears that cascaded down her cheeks in steady streams. Her face conveyed genuine pain and embarrassment. She bowed her head in shame before a stark gray wall — a far cry from the AKB48 fantasy world she supposedly betrayed. RELATED: JAPAN'S PURSUIT OF CUTE SPAWNS 30 BILLION INDUSTRY AKB48, considered the world's largest pop group, is divided into several teams that appear daily throughout Japanese media — in theater, television, advertisements and magazines. The group's management demoted Minegishi to a trainee team for aspiring members Friday for \\"causing a nuisance to the fans.\\" Last June a fellow band member, Rino Sashihara, was also demoted and compelled to make a similar apology after a magazine revealed her dating history. Japanese cultural critic Hiroki Azuma lambasted the management's treatment of Minegishi for a normal romance as \\"disgusting.\\" Many fans, too, have defended Minegishi and said she, like everyone else, is entitled to date as she pleases, according to the BBC. \\"What's the point of this public execution show?\\" one fan tweeted. \\"It's like something from the war or a totalitarian state.\\" On a mobile device?

I read this background article the other day: Since AM fungi are biotrophic, they are dependent on plants for the growth of their hyphal networks. Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield. I am facing a new situation today: Bubba and Dean are two farmers which realized the benefits of having AM fungi in their soil. Dean, however, took active steps in helping the growth of AM fungi so he grew cover crops on his lands. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which farmer didn't increase the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop?","completion":"Based on the information provided and your new situation, the farmer who didn't increase the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop is Bubba. This is because Dean took active steps to promote the growth of AM fungi by growing cover crops on his lands, which helps create a more extensive hyphal network. In contrast, Bubba did not take any specific measures to enhance the growth of AM fungi and thus did not contribute to the increase of the extraradical hyphal network in his soil."},{"prompt":"In this task you are given a sentence.

СДР, или особые права заимствования - искусственная денежная единица, которая используется в расчетах между структурами МВФ и его членами.

Изменить правила учета и операций МВФ, консолидировав счета СДР и общие счета, чтобы все операции проходили в рамках единой структуры. 2. Выработать механизмы обмена национальных валют членов-участников МВФ на СДР, учитывая курсовые котировки и стабильность на международных рынках, что снизит валютные риски и зависимость от отдельных валют (например, от доллара США). 3.

Input: What is the sentiment of the following document towards the entity Hillary Clinton ? The Justice Department is reviving investigations involving Hillary Clintonâs emails and the degree to which the State Department during Mrs. Clintonâs tenure as secretary was put in the service of the Clinton Foundation. Good. Indeed it is long overdue. It underscores a point weâve tried to make repeatedly here: You donât need a special counsel for this kind of thing; such investigations are what we have a Justice Department full of career prosecutors for. The perverse institution of the independent prosecutor should be shunned whenever possible â and its jurisdiction tightly confined in the rare necessary case. Obamaâs first point led to one of the great head-fakes in modern law-enforcement history â one that reverberates to this day. Using his bully pulpit the president framed the Clinton case as one of negligence. The portrayal stuck: Incessantly the Justice Department the media and eventually James Comey then-director of the FBI addressed the case in terms of Mrs. Clintonâs purported carelessness â a hardworking public officialâs regrettable but forgivable inattention to detail. Even now critics of Clinton and the FBI are in a lather over reports that as Comeyâs team drafted his remarks exonerating Clinton (notwithstanding that key witnesses including Clinton herself had not been interviewed) agent Peter Strzok changed the term âgrossly negligentâ to âextremely careless.â Substantively these terms are indistinguishable. The emendation is said to be critical though because the statute applicable to Clinton âs conduct criminalizes âgross negligence.â If Comey had said the words âgrossly negligent â so the story goes it would be the equivalent of pronouncing Clinton guilty. This was a straightforward case of criminal intent. Negligence was the fallback position â for a prosecutor an âeven ifâ theory as in: âEven if youâre not convinced by our overwhelming evidence of Clinton âs willfully illegal retention and transmission of classified information you can still comfortably find her guilty if you conclude that she was grossly negligent â which as the judge will tell you in his instructions simply means âextremely careless.ââ Mrs. Clintonâs criminal intent was so clear that its obfuscation also required Obamaâs second point: Mrs. Clintonâs lack of intent to imperil the United States. Director Comey hammered his bossâs legerdemain again and again. And why not? After all it was true â Clinton unquestionably had no desire to endanger our country. Itâs always good to go with the truth . . . especially if you have the luxury of a Democrat-smitten media that wonât ask whether the truth youâve highlighted is relevant to the matter under investigation. Second you may be saying to yourself: âBut âintent to harm the United Statesâ is significant so it should be part of a classified-information offense.â Thatâs right and thatâs why it is a part of a classified-information offense â it just happens not to be the offense weâre talking about in Mrs. Clinton âs case. If an official illegally transmits classified information âwith an intent or reason to believe that the information is to be used to the injury of the United States â then that official commits the more serious felony offense prescribed at the top of the Espionage Actâs scale â subsection (a). If someone had suggested charging Mrs. Clinton with this treasonous offense then she President Obama and Director Comey would have been quite right to stress that she had no such intent. But no one suggested that. Rather it was urged that she had transmitted classified information on purpose but not with intent to do the country harm. That is less heinous than the treasonous offense. But it is still egregious. It is a crime that puts the lives of intelligence sources and the effectiveness of life-saving intelligence operations at risk. That Clinton did not intend that any harm come to the United States does not make her innocent of willfully transmitting classified information to unauthorized persons or places. Moreover it is a black-letter principle that a personâs innocence of Crime A is inadmissible to prove that the person has not committed Crime B. For example the fact that I have not personally sold drugs has no bearing on whether I laundered drug money. And the fact that Mrs. Clinton did not intend that any harm come to the United States does not make her innocent of willfully transmitting classified information to unauthorized persons or places or of retaining it when she left the government and when the State Department finally requested that she surrender the government records in her possession. Regardless of whether my motive theory is sound however the evidence that Clinton willfully mishandled classified information is mountainous. Before she was ever secretary of state Clinton lived and worked in a White House where classified-information protocols were observed. She had to apply these protocols for years as a senator whose committee assignments were intelligence-intensive. Before becoming secretary of state she was indoctrinated in the handling of classified information and signed documentation attesting that she had read and understood the relevant executive orders about intelligence classification and handling. Clinton well understood that the position of secretary of state involved immersion in classified information. She wrote in her memoir about the extraordinary steps she was required to take to safeguard classified information. Given the nature of her responsibilities for foreign relations and national security her decision to conduct all her government business on a private server system made it inevitable that classified information would be transmitted in and stored on the private system. There is no possibility that she did not know this. The private system she set up was in violation of government and State Department regulations. Her loyal staff fought efforts to bring her into the government email system â even though she forced the resignation of an ambassador over among other things his conducting of government business over an unauthorized private email system. When the request was made that Clinton surrender her emails to the State Department she turned them over to her own lawyers and subordinates who did not have the security clearances required for access to the information. She destroyed tens of thousands of emails even though they were under subpoena so that they could not be reviewed by the State Department or the FBI. Of the 30 000 she deigned to surrender to the State Department over 2 000 contained classified information some of it among the nationâs most highly classified national-defense secrets. And she serially lied in her public statements about her emails in congressional testimony (in which she brazenly claimed to have turned over all work-related email to the State Department and that her lawyers had carefully reviewed every email before designating which should be surrendered and which withheld) and in her FBI interview (in which she pretended not to know what the ubiquitous â[C]â designation â for confidential â in classified documents meant). Any prosecutor who understood there was no need to prove intent to harm the United States would be delighted to take that case to the jury â especially once the prosecutor realized heâd get to tell the jury: âEven if you suspend disbelief and buy the defense argument that she didnât mean to horde and transmit classified information you must still find her guilty if you conclude she was grossly negligent â as in âextremely carelessâ.â Output:","completion":"Negative"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Craig listened to William but still wanted to give acupuncture a try. He believed that it could be like a special healing spell that might work for him. So, Craig went to a professional acupuncturist to let them use their tiny magic wands (needles) to poke him very gently.

William started to understand that different people might need different forms of healing, just like how different animals need different types of food. After a few acupuncture sessions, Craig found that his sore muscles started to feel better. He was happy that he listened to his heart and tried this new method.

According to the Chinese zodiac, Lee was born in both the hour and the year of the Dragon, which according to tradition is a strong and fortuitous omen. Lee and his parents returned to Hong Kong when he was three months old. Bruce's father, Lee Hoi-chuen, (Li Hai Quan ) was Han Chinese, and his mother, Grace Ho (He Ai Yu ), was of Eurasian ancestry. After attending Tak Sun School (De Xin Xue Xiao ) (several blocks from his home at 218 Nathan Road, Kowloon), Lee entered the primary school division of the Catholic La Salle College at the age of 12. In 1956, due to poor academic performance (or possibly poor conduct as well), he was transferred to St. Francis Xavier's College (high school), where he would be mentored by Brother Edward, a teacher and coach of the school boxing team. In 1958 Bruce won the Hong Kong schools boxing tournament, knocking out the previous champion in the final. In the spring of 1959, Lee got into another street fight and the police were called. Until his late teens, Lee's street fights became more frequent and included beating the son of a feared triad family.

Context: William White sat across from me, fidgeting nervously with an empty packet of artificial sweetener while his coffee went cold, ignored on the table in front of him. He rolled the torn yellow paper up like a tight little spliff, then unrolled it, smoothed it out flat, and then rolled it again. I was midway through my third cup of coffee with no intention of stopping soon. I was tired and edgy, irritated at William for dragging me out at this time of night, and getting even more irritated at his refusal to get to the point. 'Did you know Philip K. Dick had a twin sister?' I stared at him blankly. 'Her name was Jane. She died shortly after their birth. They were six weeks premature,' he continued, his eyes drifting off to the window to his right. I wasn't sure if he was looking at something through it or staring at his own reflection in it. 'Dick never got over Jane's death; her ghost haunted him throughout his life, and the idea of a phantom twin pops up throughout his work. Some have even speculated that Dick's inability to make peace with the loss of his sister contributed to his drug abuse, and by extension also his death at the relatively young age of 53.' He unrolled the sweetener packet, laid it on the table, placed both index fingers together in its center, and then spread them outward, smoothing the paper flat. I reached out and slammed my own hand on top of the packet, preventing him from fiddling with it anymore. 'Sorry,' he said sheepishly. I let out a sigh.

Facebook's new buy button. Facebook is testing a new 'buy' button on its website that will let consumers purchase and pay for products without have to leave the site. The button wil appear in ads, and take users to a page to process their payment. The new service, which Facebook described as a test with a 'few small and medium-sized businesses' in the United States, represents the Internet social networking company's latest effort to play a bigger role in the e-commerce business. Facebook said its new Buy button will be available on the mobile and desktop PC version of its website and will allow consumers to purchase goods directly from participating businesses. 'None of the credit or debit card information people share with Facebook when completing a transaction will be shared with other advertisers, and people can select whether or not they’d like to save payment information for future purchases,' the company said in a blog post. Facebook is not currently taking any portion of the revenue for products sold with the Buy button, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Credit card transactions will be handled by a third-party payment processing company, the person said. Facebook in 2012 introduced a way for its users to buy their friends gifts such as socks and teddy bears. However, Facebook stopped selling physical goods through the service after a year, letting consumers buy only gift cards instead. The button will allow people to buy without having to leave Facebook's app. 'We’ve built this feature with privacy in mind, and have taken steps to help make the payment experience safe and secure, the firm said.

Question: What does Armstrong receive? Title: Torn Curtain Movie plot: Michael Armstrong (Paul Newman), an American physicist and rocket scientist, is traveling to a conference in Copenhagen with his assistant and fiancÃ©e, Sarah Sherman (Julie Andrews). Armstrong receives a radiogram to pick up a book in Copenhagen; it contains a message which says, \\"Contact Ï in case [of emergency.]\\" He tells Sherman he is going to Stockholm, but she discovers he is flying to East Berlin and follows him. When they land, he is welcomed by representatives of the East German government. Sherman realizes that Armstrong has defected, and is appalled that, given the circumstances of the Cold War, if she stays with him, she will likely never see her home or family again. Armstrong visits a contact, a \\"farmer\\" (Mort Mills), where it is revealed that his defection is in fact a ruse to gain the confidence of the East German scientific establishment, in order to learn how much their chief scientist Gustav Lindt (Ludwig Donath) and by extension, the Soviet Union, knows about anti-missile systems. Armstrong has made preparations to return to the West via an escape network, known as Ï. However, he was followed to the farm by his official guard, Hermann Gromek (Wolfgang Kieling), an East German security officer. Gromek realizes what Ï is and that Armstrong is a double agent, and as Gromek is calling the police, a tortuous fight scene commences that ends with Gromek being killed by Armstrong and the farmer's wife (Carolyn Conwell). Gromek and his motorcycle are then buried. The taxicab driver (Peter Lorre Jr., uncredited) who drove Armstrong to the farm, however, reports on Armstrong's behavior to the police. Visiting the physics faculty of Karl Marx University in Leipzig, Armstrong's interview with the scientists ends abruptly when he is questioned by security officials about the missing Gromek. The faculty try to interrogate Sherman about her knowledge of the American \\"Gamma Five\\" anti-missile program, but she refuses to cooperate and runs from the room, even though she has agreed to defect to East...

Two rivers spring from the same mountain. Olt was a fast moving river, while Mures river was slow moving and deep. Both rivers are very important for the local economies. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which river had a water that contains lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen? Hint: The major zones in river ecosystems are determined by the river bed's gradient or by the velocity of the current. Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into upland and lowland rivers. The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a canopy derive the majority of their food base from algae. Anadromous fish are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and introduced species. A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed. The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The Mures river had a water that contains lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen. This is because, as mentioned in the hint, faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which supports greater biodiversity than the slow-moving water of pools. Since the Olt river was fast-moving and the Mures river was slow-moving and deep, the Mures river would have a lower concentration of dissolved oxygen in comparison to the Olt river."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no","completion":"It is not possible to tell whether we can conclude \\"A motocross racer turns his gsxr during a race\\" from the given statement \\"A motocross biker rides mid-turn in the middle of a race.\\" First, let us break down the components of both statements: 1. \\"A motocross biker rides mid-turn in the middle of a race.\\" Here, we have the following information: - The subject is a motocross biker. - The biker is in the middle of a turn during a race. 2. \\"A motocross racer turns his gsxr during a race.\\" In this statement, we have: - The subject is a motocross racer - The racer is turning his gsxr during a race. Now, let's analyze the differences between these two statements: 1. \\"Biker\\" vs. \\"Racer\\": While both terms are related, they are not exactly synonymous. A motocross biker might simply refer to an individual who rides a motocross bike, whereas a motocross racer refers to someone who competes in motocross races. However, since both statements are describing a person who is participating in a race, we can assume that these terms are interchangeable in this context. 2. The \\"gsxr\\": The main difference between the two statements is the inclusion of the \\"gsxr\\" in the second statement. A gsxr is a type of sport motorcycle manufactured by Suzuki. It is important to note that although gsxr motorcycles can be used for racing, they are not specifically designed for motocross races. Motocross races usually involve off-road, dirt tracks with jumps and obstacles, requiring specialized bikes with specific features such as long-travel suspension, off-road tires, and lightweight construction. The gsxr, on the other hand, is a sportbike built for use on paved race tracks and public roads. Given these differences, it is not possible to tell whether the statement \\"A motocross racer turns his gsxr during a race\\" can be concluded from the original statement \\"A motocross biker rides mid-turn in the middle of a race.\\" The presence of the gsxr in the second statement introduces an additional piece of information that is not present or implied in the first statement. While we know that the biker in the first statement rides mid-turn, we cannot make any conclusions about the type of motorcycle being ridden or whether it is a gsxr in this context.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Some fortunate people can go on a diet, lose the excess fat and then simply get on with their lives. Others get stuck in the eternal cycle of wanting to be thin, dieting, craving, bingeing, regaining the weight and then wanting to be thin again. You want to break free from this exhausting and depressing merry-go-round of losing and regaining weight but you’re not ready to give up doing what you know best. Let’s examine the diet cycle mentality. THERE IS A MAGIC CURE The reason you haven’t lost weight and kept it off is because you haven’t found the right diet that suits you particular physical and emotional needs. You need to eat more carbs, or more fat, you need to cycle your calories or have cleaner re-feeds, and you need a coach for accountability. Once you figure out precisely what the optimum formula is for you and you have an expert to help you then you will lose weight and keep it off. ONE LAST DIET Once you lose the weight, then you will learn how to get in tune with your body’s hunger signals and eat mindfully. You just need to commit totally to this last diet, get to your goal and then you will stop for good. YOU LOVE HEALTH AND FITNESS You really enjoy being in control of your food and planning your training regime. Time spent scouring the latest fitness magazines and entering your weight into a spreadsheet is fun and rewarding. You spend most of your waking hours plotting and planning how you are going to burn that fat! I WANT TO BREAK FREE!! The only way to break free from the diet cycle is to come to the place where you no longer believe the stories you tell yourself. If there was a magic cure that worked for you, you or someone else would have found it by now. Count the number of diet books on your bookshelf, the e-books on your computer and the magazines on the coffee table. Have any of them given you permanent weight loss? Why do you need to commit totally to your diet? - In order to reach your goals and become in tune with your body - not enough information - to utilize the diet books and magazine you have bought - to burn that fat off your body The answer is:","completion":"In order to break free from the diet cycle mentality, it is essential to change your mindset and approach to weight loss and health. The belief that there is a magic cure or one last diet that will solve your weight issues may be doing more harm than good. It's important to recognize that no single diet will work for everyone, and permanent weight loss requires a sustainable lifestyle change rather than a temporary fix. To truly break free from the diet cycle, consider the following: 1. Acknowledge that there is no magic cure or one-size-fits-all diet. Instead, focus on finding a balanced and sustainable approach to eating that meets your individual needs, preferences, and lifestyle. 2. Recognize that committing totally to a diet may not be the answer. Extreme commitment can lead to an unhealthy relationship with food and may even result in bingeing or regaining the weight once the diet ends. Instead, strive for consistency and moderation. 3. Learn to listen to your body's hunger signals and practice mindful eating. Pay attention to when you're truly hungry and when you're full. Eating in tune with your body's needs can help prevent overeating and create a healthier relationship with food. 4. Focus on developing a genuine love for health and fitness, beyond just losing weight. Find physical activities that you enjoy and incorporate them into your routine. Additionally, educate yourself on proper nutrition and overall well-being beyond the pages of diet books and magazines. 5. Be patient and realistic with your weight loss expectations. Remember that sustainable weight loss takes time, and progress may be slow. It's crucial to stay consistent, be kind to yourself, and remember that taking care of your body is a lifelong journey, not a temporary destination. By shifting your mindset and approaching weight loss and health with a balanced and sustainable perspective, you can break free from the diet cycle and maintain a healthier relationship with food and your body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He first takes Iron Bar A and puts it out on his porch on a rainy day. Then he puts Iron bar B in an airtight bag and removes all of the oxygen and air to vacuum seal it. After some time passes the bar he left outside is completely covered in rust. He removes the bar in the vacuum sealed bag and to his surprise it has no rust at all. Because there was no oxygen and water in the air tight bag, iron bar B has no rust at all. Iron bar A was exposed to a lot of water and oxygen and there for it rusted completely. Which iron bar was exposed to more water and oxygen, Iron Bar A or Iron Bar B? Answer:","completion":"Iron Bar A was exposed to more water and oxygen compared to Iron Bar B. This is because it was placed outside on the porch during a rainy day, which provided a significant amount of water and atmospheric oxygen to react with the iron. The presence of both water and oxygen is essential for the process of rusting, also known as iron corrosion or oxidation. Rusting occurs when iron reacts with water and oxygen to form hydrated iron(III) oxide, commonly known as rust. The chemical reaction can be represented as follows: 4 Fe (iron) + 6 H2O (water) + 3 O2 (oxygen) → 4 Fe(OH)3 (hydrated iron oxide) Iron Bar B, on the other hand, was placed in an airtight bag, and all the oxygen and air were removed to create a vacuum seal. This means that there was no water or oxygen available to react with the iron. Consequently, Iron Bar B did not rust at all. The difference in the rusting outcomes of Iron Bar A and Iron Bar B clearly demonstrates the significant role that water and oxygen play in the process of iron rusting. By exposing Iron Bar A to an environment rich in water and oxygen, you would naturally expect it to rust, while Iron Bar B, in its sealed environment, deprived of both necessary reactants, remained rust-free."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve -3538*a = -1219*a + 1472*a + 422099 + 55567 for a. Solve this problem.","completion":"Okay, little buddy! Let's solve this step by step! We have: -3538*a = -1219*a + 1472*a + 422099 + 55567 First, we will simplify the equation by combining the terms with \\"a\\" in it: -1219*a + 1472*a = 1472*a - 1219*a This equals to: 253*a So now our equation looks like: -3538*a = 253*a + 422099 + 55567 Now, let's get all the \\"a\\" terms on one side of the equation. To do that, let's add 3538*a to both sides. When we add 3538*a to -3538*a, it becomes 0 (because -3538*a + 3538*a = 0).

Sentence 1: so oh that's great that you have them are they oaks that around there Sentence 2: I wish to have them as well, it is great that you do. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"The relationship between the truth values of these two sentences is not directly contingent upon one another. Truthfulness, in this case, is a measure of accuracy, logic, or factuality in a given statement or proposition. To determine the truth value of Sentence 1 \\"So oh that's great that you have them are they oaks that around there,” one would have to verify if the speaker actually has \\"them\\", presumably referring to oak trees. If the speaker indeed has oak trees around, then Sentence 1 would be true. If not, the sentence would be false. However, the truth value of Sentence 2 \\"I wish to have them as well, it is great that you do\\" isn't directly linked with the first sentence's truth value. This statement is expressing a personal wish or desire from the speaker, indicating they want to have \\"them\\" as well, implying oak trees. Even if the first sentence were false (i.e., the original speaker does not have oak trees), the second speaker's desire for oak trees could still be true. Therefore, the truth of Sentence 1 doesn't directly determine the truth of Sentence 2. Suppose we go further and interpret both of these sentences in a broader emotional or sentimental context, where 'truth' might indicate sincerity or belief. Even in this scenario, the truth value of Sentence 1 does not determine that of Sentence 2. The second speaker's wish or sentiment expressed in Sentence 2 could genuinely be their belief, regardless of the validity of Sentence 1. Summing up, truth in logic and facts is not determined by wishes or feelings. Therefore, even if Sentence 1 is true, it doesn't necessarily make Sentence 2 true, and vice versa. To determine the truth value of Sentence 2, one would need to establish whether or not the speaker genuinely wishes to possess oak trees, which is a subjective evaluation and not dependent on the factual correctness of Sentence 1."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Fed dollar concern shows how tight fix is: James Saft (James Saft is a Reuters columnist. The opinions expressed are his own) EDINBURGH Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's new found strong dollar policy is in part a reflection of weakness, caught as he is between inflation and a still fragile economy and banking system. Bernanke on Tuesday deviated from the usual policy of leaving jawboning the dollar to the Treasury department, warning on the unwelcome inflationary effect of its continued fall. \\"We are attentive to the implications of changes in the value of the dollar for inflation and inflation expectations,\\" Bernanke said, nodding as well to its impact on the price of oil and other commodities. Given the situation -- the economy, particularly the banking system, is too weak to withstand higher rates but yet inflation is rising and risks becoming entrenched -- talking the dollar up and hopefully helping to moderate the price of energy is a sensible and low cost strategy. The problem of course is that Bernanke can't do much about demand from China and elsewhere for energy and other commodities and having drawn a line in the sand it is always possible, some might say inevitable, that he is asked to defend it. \\"Bernanke is signaling that he has reached the limits of how much dollar and commodity-driven inflation he can tolerate,\\" said John Kemp, an economist at Sempra Metals in London. \\"He is saying: If there is renewed slide in the dollar, if there is a renewed escalation in the oil price we will have no choice but to respond, no matter how painful that is.\\" It is the Treasury which has responsibility for the dollar and would make the call for intervention in currency markets to support it, if such a call came, but it is probably fair to presume that the Fed and Treasury are singing from the same song sheet, especially given recent stronger comments from Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. It's worth noting too that a study published last week by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas laid at least part of the blame for the rising price of oil on a weak dollar. The paper, Crude Awakening: Behind the Surge in Oil Prices, by economists Stephen P. A. Brown, Raghav Virmani and Richard Alm found that about a third of oil's 60 per barrel rise between 2003 and 2007 could be laid at the feet of the falling dollar. Of course, there is that pesky other two-thirds of appreciation and as it is being driven by rising living standards in China and elsewhere it is largely outside the Fed's influence. There is no question that the recent run of data from the U.S. has shown a disturbing trend, especially in inflation expectations. The Reuters/University of Michigan Survey of Consumers final reading for May showed one-year inflation expectations surging to 5.2 percent -- the highest since February 1982 -- from 4.8 percent in April. And as for the Fed's mantra that inflation will fade over time, the public isn't buying it: five-year inflation expectations jumped to 3.4 percent, the highest since April 1995. \\"When inflation expectations show a significant rise -- as they have of late -- the standard central bank playbook prescribed tougher anti-inflation rhetoric,\\" Morgan Stanley economist Dave Greenlaw wrote in a note to clients. \\"However the economy is quite fragile at present and markets are jittery. Moreover, it's not clear that the threat of a tighter monetary policy would have much impact on households' inflation expectations in the current environment.\\" If the dollar did make another run lower, it's fair to expect more verbal intervention from the U.S. authorities rather than any quick move to actually buy dollars. And of course there is also the possibility that something out of Mr. Bernanke's control goes his way for once. Having peaked above 135 per barrel, U.S. crude fell on Wednesday to below 124 amid growing signs of at least the possibility of a fall in demand. Americans drove 11 billion miles less in March 2008 than a year earlier, the first time estimated travel on public roads fell in March since 1979 and the sharpest year-on-year drop in the 66 years records have been kept. Perhaps as significantly, India, which subsidizes fuel prices, hiked petrol and diesel prices by about ten percent, while Malaysia has junked all fuel subsidies, both moves that theoretically should help to curb demand for oil and could point the way to a trend in Asia. But it's important to remember that any U.S. desire to see a stable dollar is still vulnerable to cracks in the banking and financial system.

After the 1998 embassy bombings, the U.S. government tried to develop a clearer picture of Bin Laden's finances. A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.

Write a summary based on this article: EXCLUSIVE: President Obama is planning to unveil a 10-part plan for overhauling U.S. immigration policy via executive action -- including suspending deportations for millions -- as early as next Friday, a source close to the White House told Fox News. The president's plans were contained in a draft proposal from a U.S. government agency. The source said the plan could be announced as early as Nov. 21, though the date might slip a few days pending final White House approval. Obama was briefed at the White House by Homeland Security officials before leaving on his Asia-Pacific trip last week, Fox News has learned. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters traveling with Obama in Burma Thursday that the president had not made a final decision on any executive actions concerning immigration and would not announce any until he returned to Washington. The draft plan, though, contains 10 initiatives that span everything from boosting border security to improving pay for immigration officers. But the most controversial pertain to the millions who could get a deportation reprieve under what is known as \\"deferred action.\\" More on this... Epic showdown over immigration on the horizon? The plan calls for expanding deferred action for illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children -- but also for the parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents. The latter could allow upwards of 4.5 million illegal immigrant adults with U.S.-born children to stay, according to estimates. Critics in the Senate say those who receive deferred action, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, receive work authorization in the United States, Social Security numbers and government-issued IDs. Another portion that is sure to cause consternation among anti-\\"amnesty\\" lawmakers is a plan to expand deferred action for young people. In June 2012, Obama created such a program for illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, entered before June 2007 and were under 31 as of June 2012. The change would expand that to cover anyone who entered before they were 16, and change the cut-off from June 2007 to Jan. 1, 2010. This is estimated to make nearly 300,000 illegal immigrants eligible. One of the architects for the president's planned executive actions at DHS is Esther Olavarria, the late Sen. Ted Kennedy's former top immigration lawyer. Under the changes, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers also would see a pay raise in order to \\"increase morale\\" within the ICE workforce. DHS also is planning to \\"promote\\" the new naturalization process by giving a 50 percent discount on the first 10,000 applicants who come forward, with the exception of those who have income levels above 200 percent of the poverty level. Tech jobs though a State Department immigrant visa program would offer another half-million immigrants a path to citizenship. This would include their spouses as well. The other measures include calls to revise removal priorities to target serious criminals for deportation and end the program known as \\"Secure Communities\\" and start a new program. The planning comes as immigrant advocates urge Obama to act. As lawmakers returned for a lame-duck session, Democrats in Congress on Wednesday implored Obama to take executive action. \\"We're begging the president. Go big. These [illegal immigrants] are a plus to our nation. Mr. President, please. You said you were going to do something. Do it. Act now,\\" said Rep. Juan Vargas, D-Calif. House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer said: \\"I join with my colleagues in urging the president to take action. What he needs to do is give immediate relief to families who are being wrenched apart and living in fear.\\" Angela Maria Kelley, vice president for immigration policy at the Center for American Progress, touted executive action as a \\"tried and true component of immigration policy used by 11 presidents, 39 times in the last 60 years.\\" She said for many undocumented immigrants who have been here for years, \\"there is no line for people to get into.\\" Obama has vowed to act in the absence of congressional action and has claimed that congressional action could still supersede his executive steps. That claim was restated by Earnest, who said Thursday that if the House approved an immigration reform bill previously passed by the Senate, Obama would \\"retract\\" any executive order. In a recent op-ed in Politico, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., said Congress would stop Obama from taking executive action by adding language explicitly barring money from being used for that purpose. \\"Congress has the power of the purse. The president cannot spend a dime unless Congress appropriates it,\\" Sessions wrote. He also pointed out that similar language in the past has prevented the president from closing the Guantanamo Bay prison camp.

You can follow him on Twitter: @LucasFoxNews ||||| WASHINGTON — President Obama will ignore angry protests from Republicans and announce as soon as next week a broad overhaul of the nation’s immigration enforcement system that will protect up to five million unauthorized immigrants from the threat of deportation and provide many of them with work permits, according to administration officials who have direct knowledge of the plan. Asserting his authority as president to enforce the nation’s laws with discretion, Mr. Obama intends to order changes that will significantly refocus the activities of the government’s 12,000 immigration agents. One key piece of the order, officials said, will allow many parents of children who are American citizens or legal residents to obtain legal work documents and no longer worry about being discovered, separated from their families and sent away. That part of Mr. Obama’s plan alone could affect as many as 3.3 million people who have been living in the United States illegally for at least five years, according to an analysis by the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration research organization in Washington. But the White House is also considering a stricter policy that would limit the benefits to people who have lived in the country for at least 10 years, or about 2.5 million people. Extending protections to more undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children, and to their parents, could affect an additional one million or more if they are included in the final plan that the president announces. White House officials are also still debating whether to include protections for farm workers who have entered the country illegally but have been employed for years in the agriculture industry, a move that could affect hundreds of thousands of people. ||||| Summary:","completion":"President Obama is planning a big change in the way we deal with immigration in the United States. He wants to create a 10-part plan that would help millions of people who came to the U.S. without permission to stay here without fearing they will be sent back to their home countries. This plan would also make it easier for some of these people to work and live in the United States. Some people think this is a good idea because it helps families stay together and makes our country more diverse and strong. Other people are worried that this plan might encourage more people to come to the U.S. without permission, and could make it harder for Americans to find jobs. This is a big decision, and President Obama wants to make sure everything is just right, so he is still thinking about all the details of the plan before he announces it."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer a question about this article: The propagation of universities was not necessarily a steady progression, as the 17th century was rife with events that adversely affected university expansion. Many wars, and especially the Thirty Years' War, disrupted the university landscape throughout Europe at different times. War, plague, famine, regicide, and changes in religious power and structure often adversely affected the societies that provided support for universities. Internal strife within the universities themselves, such as student brawling and absentee professors, acted to destabilize these institutions as well. Universities were also reluctant to give up older curricula, and the continued reliance on the works of Aristotle defied contemporary advancements in science and the arts. This era was also affected by the rise of the nation-state. As universities increasingly came under state control, or formed under the auspices of the state, the faculty governance model (begun by the University of Paris) became more and more prominent. Although the older student-controlled universities still existed, they slowly started to move toward this structural organization. Control of universities still tended to be independent, although university leadership was increasingly appointed by the state. Which university is said to have started faculty governance?","completion":"The University of Paris is said to have started the faculty governance model.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What areas were the introduction of the raccoon a success?, using the article: As a result of escapes and deliberate introductions in the mid-20th century, the raccoon is now distributed in several European and Asian countries. Sightings have occurred in all the countries bordering Germany, which hosts the largest population outside of North America. Another stable population exists in northern France, where several pet raccoons were released by members of the U.S. Air Force near the Laon-Couvron Air Base in 1966. Furthermore, raccoons have been known to be in the area around Madrid since the early 1970s. In 2013, the city authorized \\"the capture and death of any specimen\\". It is also present in Italy, with one reproductive population in Lombardy.About 1,240 animals were released in nine regions of the former Soviet Union between 1936 and 1958 for the purpose of establishing a population to be hunted for their fur. Two of these introductions were successful—one in the south of Belarus between 1954 and 1958, and another in Azerbaijan between 1941 and 1957. With a seasonal harvest of between 1,000 and 1,500 animals, in 1974 the estimated size of the population distributed in the Caucasus region was around 20,000 animals and the density was four animals per square kilometer (10 animals per square mile)., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The areas where the introduction of the raccoon was a success include: 1. Germany: As the article states, Germany hosts the largest population of raccoons outside of North America, which indicates a successful introduction. 2. Northern France: A stable population of raccoons exists in this area, resulting from the release of several pet raccoons by members of the U.S. Air Force near the Laon-Couvron Air Base in 1966. 3. Italy (Lombardy): The presence of a reproductive population in Lombardy indicates a successful introduction of raccoons in this area. 4. Belarus (south): Between 1954 and 1958, a successful introduction occurred in the south of Belarus. 5. Azerbaijan: Another successful introduction took place between 1941 and 1957 in Azerbaijan.

Solve 14004*y = 14055*y - 612 for y.","completion":"To solve the given equation 14004*y = 14055*y - 612 for y, we first need to simplify the equation and isolate the variable y. Let's follow these steps: Step 1: Move all terms containing the variable y to one side of the equation. In this case, let's move the term 14004*y to the right side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides. This gives us: 0 = 14055*y - 14004*y - 612 Step 2: Combine like terms on the right side of the equation. Subtract 14004*y from 14055*y to get: 0 = 51*y - 612 Step 3: To isolate the variable y, we need to get rid of the constant -612 from the right side. We can do this by adding 612 to both sides of the equation: 612 = 51*y Step 4: Finally, to solve for y, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of y, which is 51: y = 612 ÷ 51 y = 12 So the solution to the equation 14004*y = 14055*y - 612 is y = 12."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Hydrophones are underwater microphones used to detect and record underwater sounds, and their presence is not directly related to the number of submarine volcanoes.

If researchers and scientists are more interested in monitoring the activity of underwater volcanoes, then they may place more hydrophones in the Tropical Ocean since it has thousands of active volcanoes on the ocean floor. This would mean that the Ice Ocean, with fewer submarine volcanoes, might have fewer hydrophones. However, this assumption is based on the premise that hydrophones are installed primarily for tracking volcanic activity, and without more information, we cannot definitively answer the question regarding hydrophone quantity in each ocean.

The smell of shaving foam fills the small, steamy room as he sprays an ample amount onto his hand and begins to methodically apply it to his left calf. He thoughtfully chose a fragrance-free foam, as he was always mindful of the sensitivity of his skin – a trait he inherited from his mother. Tiny droplets of water from the fogged-up mirror above the sink gradually roll down the glass, making an almost rhythmic sound as they splash onto the porcelain below. Drawing a deep breath, the young man braced himself for the first stroke of the blade. He recognized that to some, this might seem like a trivial or odd endeavor, yet for him, it was a right of passage in a personal journey towards self-discovery and acceptance. Memories of childhood filled his mind, as he recalled countless naïve questions his younger self had asked his father regarding why only his mother got to shave her legs. His father's dismissive laughter reverberated in his ears, echoing the conventional attitudes that had weighed on him like a heavy burden throughout his adolescence. With a renewed sense of determination, he slowly guided the razor along the contour of his calf muscles, being extra cautious not to nick his delicate skin in the process. Once the first shave was completed, he couldn't suppress a victorious smile as he rinsed the razor under the warm water, and the now detached hairs swirled down the drain. That smile was an affirmation of his ownership in defining his identity – a silent rebellion against the societal norms that tried to confine him. Upon completing the first leg, he carefully repeated the process on his right, remembering important tips he had learned from reading articles on the subject. With each slide of the razor, his confidence grew, and gradually, he saw his vision of himself – the person he truly wanted to be – materialize before his very eyes. For the first time in his life, he felt an unparalleled sense of freedom, as if he had finally unlocked a secret that set him apart from the rigid expectations placed upon him by others. With both legs now smoothly shaved, he marveled at the transformation he had accomplished in the confines of his own bathroom. Although it was only the first step in his journey, he knew that it signified to him a fundamental break from the constraints of his past. Wrapped in a newfound sense of empowerment, he vowed to embrace the aspects of himself that others questioned or misunderstood, and to never doubt his right to explore who he truly was. Meanwhile, outside the bathroom door, his sister waited impatiently, knocking loudly and complaining about how long he was taking. But inside that small, steamy space, a young man was reshaping his destiny, embarking on a path that would redefine his life and carve an uncharted trail for others who dared to challenge convention and forge their futures on their own terms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili conceded his party's defeat Tuesday, setting the stage for the nation's first peaceful, democratic transition through election since the breakup of the Soviet Union. Victory in the parliamentary elections went to a coalition headed by billionaire businessman Bidzina Ivanishvili. Ivanishvili is set to become the next prime minister. Saakashvili will remain president until presidential elections next year.
