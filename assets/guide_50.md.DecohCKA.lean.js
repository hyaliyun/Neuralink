MABs from newspapers, other media outlets, universities, think tanks, advocacy groups, and similar institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog traffic.

The Republican presidential nominee ticked down a list of issues he failed to sufficiently hammer Clinton on during their 90-minute bout -- from her foreign policy failures to her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. He also insisted on defending two factually incorrect statements he made the previous night. Trump touted unscientific, online post-debate polls as \\"things of beauty.\\" He also again claimed to be \\"holding back\\" during the faceoff because he \\"didn't want to do anything to embarrass\\" Clinton. That comment came after blaming debate moderator Lester Holt of NBC News for being tough on him earlier in the day, \\"For 90 minutes I watched her very carefully and I was also holding back. I didn't want to do anything that embarrassed her,\\" Trump said Tuesday. \\"For 90 minutes, she argued against change, while I called for dramatic change. We have to have dramatic change.\\" But while he spent much of the debate on the defense, Trump was free to unleash on Clinton without abandon as he rallied thousands of supporters Tuesday night in an airplane hangar. He slammed Clinton for having \\"defended every major failure she helped create,\\" placing particular emphasis on Clinton's track record as secretary of state. \\"Iraq and Libya are in chaos,\\" Trump said. \\"Here in America we've seen one Islamic terror strike after another.\\" Trump pointed to Clinton's decades-old career in the political spotlight -- arguing she has not accomplished enough, and failed too often, in that time period. \\"I kept saying for 26 years you've been doing nothing,\\" Trump said. \\"She's the candidate of yesterday. And ours is the campaign and we're the people of the future.\\" Clinton was the first lady of Arkansas and then the United States before she was elected for the first time to public office in 2000 as a US senator from New York. And while Clinton made it through the debate on Monday with relatively few attacks from Trump on the subject, on Tuesday, Trump attacked her over her email practices, including her false assertion she neither sent nor received information marked classified. \\"Another Crooked Hillary lie,\\" Trump said. \\"Have you ever seen a greater embarrassment to our country?\\" Clinton is \\"an insider fighting only for her donors and insiders,\\" Trump said, touting his outsider status. But Trump also entrenched himself on two issues the debate's moderator, Holt, called out on for being factually inaccurate. He insisted the stop-and-frisk practice used in New York City that a federal judge ruled unconstitutional in 2013 was constitutional.

But while we can count on this semiotic orgy coming around every year, we cannot be so sure that the way we use punctuation will be the same from one to the next—even if the ostensible reason for this holiday is to celebrate “the importance of proper punctuation.” After all, the proper among us once wrote today as to-day; they once referred to the 1920s as the 1920’s; and they once marked quotations with diples (>) rather than these guys: (“”). Here are five modern examples of how punctuation is evolving, with no certain conclusion and whether the traditionalists like it or not. Emoji are being wielded as punctuation. Especially on platforms like Twitter, emoji are being used to serve the same key purpose of punctuation: aiding understanding by providing clues to how the surrounding words should be interpreted. Take the text of this real tweet, randomly selected from emojitracker.com: “Who tf put cheese in my bag today ” Just as exclamation points can convey excitement or question marks can suggest a lack of certainty, the angry face helps the reader understand that writer was angry about discovering their bag contained cheese of uncertain origin. There is more freedom from conventions. Look back at the above tweet. While an English teacher might whip out her red pen and put a question mark at the end of the sentence, we can easily discern the writer’s uncertainty about the cheese-smuggler’s identity by the word who. We don’t need the mark, and space-constrained platforms like Twitter and text messages have made us more apt to drop unnecessary characters—as well as less likely to make the assumption that character-dropping equals ignorance. Meanwhile, the same marks missing from the ends of sentences or middle of words are settling into non-traditional roles. “Now you have Twitter and email taking older marks and giving them new life as emoticons,” says Keith Houston, author of Shady Characters, a history of punctuation marks. “People are punctuating in unstandard ways, and they are freed from convention because these messages are ephemeral.” The apostrophe is losing steam in some circles. Social media analytics firm Brandwatch scoured Twitter for trends in 2013 and found that the top five “grammatical errors” were: im, wont, cant, dont and id. Meanwhile, corporations like British super-bookstore Waterstones (neé Waterstone’s) have seen fit to erase those marks from their names. Cities are dropping them from street signs. And while some grammarians may cry most foul, others are calling for the apostrophe’s dumb round head. The advocates behind the “Kill the Apostrophe” website have been joined by author James Harbeck in asserting that, in most cases, rules about apostrophe usage only serve to irritate those people who know the rules and confuse those who do not. “The great question with a lot of punctuation is, Do you really need it?” says Ammon Shea, author of hilarious grammar-police-takedown Bad English. And, he says, there’s often little risk of confusion when theyre absent. Exclamation marks are becoming harder to avoid, for those who would like to avoid them. As many have noted, the period that used to innocuously signal the end of a thought—like an orchestra conductor pinching his hand—has taken on a brusque aura these days, leaving the reader of any declarative sentence open to detect apathy or annoyance. This has led to a rise in exclamation marks, because people need something to fill the gaps left by informative cues we get only in face-to-face communication—the raised brows, the wide eyes, the smile. Fearing that we could come across as unfriendly, we tack on an exclamation mark (“Thanks!”) to make sure our fine disposition comes across. The data supporting this shift is largely anecdotal, but the anecdotes are abundant. “The exclamation mark, once reserved for expressing joy or excitement, now simply marks baseline politeness,” writes New York Magazine’s Melissa Dahl, who goes on to quote a grammarian who describes them as nearly “mandatory” in email. “Dealing with such bare bones language,” says Shea, “you use whatever help you can get.” (If you don’t want this kind of help, there is a handy TIME guide on alternatives.) Hyphens are being retired, perhaps faster than ever. Hyphens have, of course, been chucked for centuries, as in the previous example of to-day becoming today. But that shift, Houston says, took about a century and wasn’t finalized until the 1900s. Today, at least some of the hyphen-tossing is happening faster. Take electronic mail, which started as the crazy notion of “E-mail” in the 1970s and became the un-hyphenated, ho-hum “email” among prevailing American media outlets in about 40 years.“The migration to ebook, ecommerce and email is not unexpected,” Merriam-Webster President John Morse previously told TIME. “This transition may come more readily in today’s technological environment.” We can only wonder what tricksy technology is going to do to punctuation between now and next year’s National Punctuation Day. In the meantime, I need to get back to my em-dash bath. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The way we use punctuation has been changing and evolving over time, as demonstrated by these five modern examples: 1.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Mao Asada (Qian Tian Zhen Yang , Asada Mao, born September 25, 1990) is a former Japanese competitive figure skater. She is the 2010 Olympic silver medalist, a three-time World champion (2008, 2010, 2014), a three-time Four Continents champion (2008, 2010, 2013), and a four-time Grand Prix Final champion (2005-06, 2008-09, 2012-13, 2013-14). She is the only female figure skater who has landed three triple Axel jumps in one competition, which she achieved at the 2010 Winter Olympics. During the summer of 2007, Asada received additional training in Russia from Tatiana Tarasova, while Arutyunyan remained her primary coach. At the 2007 Skate Canada International, Asada was third in the short program and first in the long, finishing with the gold medal ahead of silver medalist Yukari Nakano. Asada won her second gold at the 2007 Trophee Eric Bompard with over 21 points ahead of silver medalist Kimmie Meissner. Asada advanced to the 2007-08 Grand Prix Final in Turin, Italy. In the short program, Asada did not do the jump out of footwork required element and placed 6th with a score of 59.04 points. But the next day, she rebounded in the free skating to win the free skating with 132.55 points. She executed a triple axel, a triple flip-triple toe loop combination, a triple loop, a triple flip-triple loop, a double axel-double loop-double loop combination, and a double axel, but had a change-of-edge error in triple lutz. She won the silver medal with 191.59 points, 5.24 behind gold medalist Yuna Kim, who repeated as champion. As in the previous year, Asada won the 2007-08 Japan Championships. Her final score was 1.15 points ahead of silver medalist and reigning World champion Miki Ando. Asada was placed on the Japanese team for both the World and Four Continents Championships. Before Four Continents, she split with Arutyunyan and returned to Japan to practice on the new Aurora Rink at Chukyo University, where she had no problems obtaining ice time. Asada competed at both ISU Championships without a coach but an official from the Japan Skating Federation accompanied her as needed. Competing for the first time at Four Continents Championships, Asada won both segments and finished 13.71 points ahead of silver medalist Joannie Rochette. In March 2008, at the Worlds Championships, Asada won her first World title. She was second in the short program, 0.18 behind Carolina Kostner. In the free skating, she was second to bronze medalist Yuna Kim by 1.92 points but 0.88 ahead of silver medalist Carolina Kostner.

Title: The Hunchback of Notre Dame Movie plot: On a street in Paris, during the Middle Ages, a Gypsy named Clopin performs puppet shows for children. Before starting his next show, he draws attention to the bells ringing in the nearby Cathedral of Notre Dame. He offers to tell the tale of the mysterious bell-ringer--who he is, and how he came to the cathedral:Twenty years ago, on a cold winter night, four Gypsies sneaked into Paris on a hired riverboat; the Gypsies were persecuted in Paris (and possibly all over France), so the only way to enter the city without being arrested was to sneak in. These particular Gypsies consisted of two men, one woman, and her child (it is implied that one of the men was the husband and father to the last two mentioned). Upon landing, however, the group was ambushed and arrested.The man leading the arrest was Judge Claude Frollo, the Minister of Justice. He is the primary instigator of the persecution and oppression against the Gypsies in Paris, claiming that their ways will corrupt the other citizens. He arrested the men, but when he ordered his troops to take the bundle in the woman's arms (mistakenly assuming them to be stolen goods), she ran. Though he was on horseback, she outmaneuvered him by using shortcuts too small for his horse. She made it to the doors of the Cathedral of Notre Dame to claim sanctuary, but because it was nighttime the doors were locked. Before they could be opened, Frollo caught up with her. He wrested the bundle from her grasp, kicking her while doing so; she fell back and hit her head on the stone steps, which killed her.The baby started to cry. When Frollo pulled back the cloth surrounding him, he gasped in horror, proclaiming the baby to be a monster (the baby is never shown). He nearly dropped the infant down a well, but he was stopped by the Archdeacon of the cathedral, who condemned his killing of the woman and his attempt to kill the baby. Though Frollo tried to justify his actions, deceiving himself, the Archdeacon reminded him that God, the angels, etc, are fully aware of what he had...

This experience, combined with his subsequent exposure to the efficient German autobahn limited-access road systems during the concluding stages of World War II, convinced him that a better highway system in the United States would be necessary for both military operations and economic growth.

Q:And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event.

Answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - You breathe in - Diaphragm and other muscles expand to allow room for your lungs to fill - The air flows into the narrow bronchioles in the lungs - From the bronchioles to the alveoli - The oxygen enters into the bloodstream - Is switched with the carbon dioxide in the bloodstream - The carbon dioxide enters through the alveoli - Through the narrow bronchioles - Into the lungs Answer:","completion":"The final step in the process you described, after the carbon dioxide travels back through the bronchioles and into the lungs, is exhalation. This is where you breathe out, expelling the carbon dioxide from your body. Just for further understanding, let's elaborate on this final stage. Exhalation, or breathing out, is primarily a passive process in which the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles (muscles situated between the ribs) relax. This causes the chest cavity to decrease in size and the volume of the lungs to reduce. As a result, the pressure inside the lungs becomes greater than the air pressure outside the body, causing air to flow out of the lungs through the bronchioles and larger bronchi, up the trachea, and finally, out through your nose and mouth. During exhalation, the elastic properties of the lungs and chest wall assist in deflation, but additional effort can be applied to force a more rapid or deeper exhalation. This is typically seen during strenuous activities or exercise where the rate of carbon dioxide production in the body increases and thus needs to be expelled more quickly. The expelled air contains a higher concentration of carbon dioxide and lower concentration of oxygen, compared to the inhaled air. This whole process ensures the continuous exchange of gases in the lungs, making certain that the bloodstream consistently receives fresh oxygen while eliminating the waste product, carbon dioxide. So, in summary: After the incoming oxygen switches with carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, the carbon dioxide goes into the alveoli, through the narrow bronchioles, and into the lungs. Here, the body readies itself to finally exhale or breathe out this \\"used\\" air, ridding the body of its main waste product from the process of respiration: carbon dioxide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

OPT: (1). yes. (2). it is not possible to tell. (3). no.","completion":"(2). It is not possible to tell. Based on the information provided, it appears that you have been involved in and accomplished several things, but it is not clear if your college career is indeed the \\"only thing\\" you ever accomplished. To fully address the statement, \\"The only thing I ever accomplished was my college career,\\" we need more context and depth of understanding about what you consider as an accomplishment and the nature of these achievements. Your gardening experience suggests some form of accomplishment. You mentioned having gardens for a \\"long long time,\\" and growing various types of crops such as squash, tomatoes, and watermelons. This suggests that over the years, you have been successful at maintaining gardens and producing fruits and vegetables, which itself can be considered an accomplishment. It demonstrates sustained effort, commitment, and mastery of specific skills such as understanding plant cultivation and management of natural resources. However, the statement's relevance and accuracy largely depend on your personal interpretation of 'accomplishment.' If your definition of accomplishment is strictly tied to professional or academic successes, then maybe your college career could indeed be the 'only thing' you've accomplished. But if accomplishment encompasses personal achievements, hobbies, and life experiences like gardening, then it seems that you have accomplished more than just your college career. Additionally, the phrase, \\"the only thing I ever accomplished,\\" suggests a reflection on one's entire life to the present. Therefore, unless your life experiences consist solely of college education and no other noteworthy events, tasks, or achievements, it might be inaccurate to say that your college career is the 'only' thing you've accomplished.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Ellington was born on April 29, 1899, to James Edward Ellington and Daisy (Kennedy) Ellington in Washington, D.C. Both his parents were pianists. Daisy primarily played parlor songs and James preferred operatic arias. From 1936, Ellington began to make recordings with smaller groups (sextets, octets, and nonets) drawn from his then-15-man orchestra and he composed pieces intended to feature a specific instrumentalist, as with \\"Jeep's Blues\\" for Johnny Hodges, \\"Yearning for Love\\" for Lawrence Brown, \\"Trumpet in Spades\\" for Rex Stewart, \\"Echoes of Harlem\\" for Cootie Williams and \\"Clarinet Lament\\" for Barney Bigard. In 1937, Ellington returned to the Cotton Club which had relocated to the mid-town Theater District. In the summer of that year, his father died, and due to many expenses, Ellington's finances were tight, although his situation improved the following year. After leaving agent Irving Mills, he signed on with the William Morris Agency. Mills though continued to record Ellington. After only a year, his Master and Variety labels, the small groups had recorded for the latter, collapsed in late 1937, Mills placed Ellington back on Brunswick and those small group units on Vocalion through to 1940. Well known sides continued to be recorded, \\"Caravan\\" in 1937, and \\"I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart\\" the following year. Billy Strayhorn, originally hired as a lyricist, began his association with Ellington in 1939. Nicknamed \\"Swee' Pea\\" for his mild manner, Strayhorn soon became a vital member of the Ellington organization. Ellington showed great fondness for Strayhorn and never failed to speak glowingly of the man and their collaborative working relationship, \\"my right arm, my left arm, all the eyes in the back of my head, my brain waves in his head, and his in mine\\". Strayhorn, with his training in classical music, not only contributed his original lyrics and music, but also arranged and polished many of Ellington's works, becoming a second Ellington or \\"Duke's doppelganger\\". It was not uncommon for Strayhorn to fill in for Duke, whether in conducting or rehearsing the band, playing the piano, on stage, and in the recording studio. The 1930s ended with a very successful European tour just as World War II loomed in Europe.

Asexually The answer to this question is:","completion":"Step 1: Establish the Setting Setting: A mysterious, remote island that has been cut off from the modern world for centuries. Step 2: Define the Main Characters 1. Dr. Jane Carter - A passionate and skilled biologist researching asexual reproduction in species around the world. 2. Thomas Barton - A tech-savvy coder and explorer specializing in geographical locations that are disconnected from the rest of the world. 3. Commander Alexandra Smith - A retired military commander who now leads expeditions to the remote corners of the Earth. 4. The Creature - A mysterious, ancient, and rapidly evolving species that resides within the deep jungles of the island. Step 3: Create the Main Plot Conflict Conflict: The creature's rapid asexual reproduction is causing an imbalance in the ecosystem and poses a threat to the entire island and, potentially, the world. Step 4: Develop the Story's Act Structure Act 1 - Setup: Dr. Jane Carter, Thomas Barton, and Commander Alexandra Smith form a team to explore the unknown island for research purposes and ancient secrets. Upon arrival, they discover a unique species on the island. Through her research, Dr. Carter discovers that the creature reproduces asexually, which is causing an alarming rate of population growth that threatens the island's ecosystem. Act 2 - Confrontation: As the team investigates the consequences of the creature's rapid reproduction, they cross paths with the creature itself. They succeed in capturing a specimen, which they take back to their research facility to study. Dr. Carter begins analyzing its DNA and cellular structure to identify a way to prevent its uncontrollable asexual reproduction. Meanwhile, Thomas and Commander Smith explore the island further and discover ancient ruins holding secrets about the creature's origins. Act 3 - Resolution: With time running out, Dr. Carter successfully identifies a genetic solution to prevent the creature's rapid reproduction, but the team must now find a way to deliver it to the entire population. Through the ancient ruins, Thomas and Commander Smith learn of a hidden location containing a gateway to the creature's hidden lair. The team ventures deep into the island and locates this lair, where they successfully administer the genetic solution to the creatures. The creatures' reproduction rate significantly reduces, restoring balance to the island's ecosystem. Together, they have saved the island, and potentially the world from unforeseen consequences. In conclusion, the movie plot revolves around the team's research and efforts to curb the creature's asexual reproduction, ensuring the balance of the ecosystem and solving ancient secrets that unveil the creature's origin.

Solve -441*w + 149 = -463*w + 567 for w.","completion":"To solve the given equation -441*w + 149 = -463*w + 567 for w, you need to isolate the variable w on one side of the equation. To do this, follow these steps: Step 1: Add 463*w to both sides of the equation to eliminate the -463*w term from the right side. -441*w + 463*w + 149 = -463*w + 463*w + 567 Simplifying this, we get: 22*w + 149 = 567 Step 2: Now, we have a simpler equation with the variable w on one side. To further isolate w, subtract 149 from both sides of the equation. 22*w + 149 - 149 = 567 - 149 Simplifying this, we get: 22*w = 418 Step 3: Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 22 to get the value of w. 22*w / 22 = 418 / 22 w = 19 So the solution to the equation -441*w + 149 = -463*w + 567 is w = 19."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - A larva is born - The caterpillar eats constantly until it grows bigger - The caterpillar starts to form a cocoon around itself - The caterpillar becomes a pupa - After some time the cocoon hatches - And a butterfly is born. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose sediment is not picked up by wind or water happens, how will it affect less cocoon. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"This process describes the life-cycle of butterflies. To analyze the impact of the perturbation hypothesis which is \\"suppose sediment is not picked up by wind or water happens, how will it affect less cocoon?\\", let's break down the process into steps: 1. A larva is born: This is the initial stage of the butterfly's lifecycle. The supposed perturbation related to sediment movement by wind or water does not have a direct impact on this step. 2. The caterpillar eats constantly until it grows bigger: The caterpillar's growth is driven by dietary intake, predominantly leaves, which do not involve sediments directly. Again, the proposed hypothesis of no sediment transport via wind or water seems not to affect this phase. 3. The caterpillar starts to form a cocoon: The cocoon or chrysalis is created by the caterpillar using its own body's resources. Sediment not being moved by wind or water doesn't impact this process. 4. The caterpillar becomes a pupa: The transformation from caterpillar to pupa is internal and involves no external factors like sediments. 5. After some time the cocoon hatches: The hatching process is dependant on the internal transformation of the pupa into a butterfly. Sediment dynamics do not influence this process. 6. And a butterfly is born: This is the final stage of the process which is equally unaffected by sediment transportation. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation does not appear to have a direct or indirect effect on the described butterfly life-cycle process. The process is largely independent of sediment movement enabled by wind or water. The perturbation of sediment not being able to be picked up or moved by wind or water would more likely impact processes involving landforms, erosion, deposition, or directly, the life cycles of certain aquatic or soil-dwelling macroinvertebrates, who rely on sediment for various parts of their life-cycle.

Please answer this question: What was the name of the Independent Counsel who investigated the death of White House Counsel Vince Foster, the Whitewater real estate investment scandal, and Bill Clintons less than stellar grasp of the truth, ultimately leading to Clinton's impeachment?","completion":"The Independent Counsel who investigated the death of White House Counsel Vince Foster, the Whitewater real estate investment scandal, and President Bill Clinton's alleged misconduct, which eventually led to Clinton's impeachment, was Kenneth Winston Starr. Kenneth Starr, an attorney and former federal judge, was appointed as the Independent Counsel in August 1994. Initially, his investigation focused on the Whitewater Development Corporation, a real estate venture in which Bill and Hillary Clinton had invested. The Clintons were accused of fraud and unethical conduct in connection to the failed investment, though no major legal repercussions arose from the investigation for them. In 1995, Starr's mandate was expanded to include the investigation into Vince Foster's death, who was the Deputy White House Counsel and a close associate of both Clintons. Foster's death in July 1993 was ruled a suicide, but conspiracy theories suggested that the Clintons may have been involved in his death. Starr concluded in his report that Foster indeed committed suicide, and there was no evidence of foul play. The investigation took a major turn when the focus shifted towards President Bill Clinton's personal life. This shift was sparked by a lawsuit filed by Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee who claimed that Clinton had sexually harassed her. During the discovery phase of the lawsuit, Linda Tripp, a friend of Monica Lewinsky, provided Starr with recorded phone conversations between herself and Lewinsky discussing her affair with Clinton. Starr's investigation shifted to include allegations of perjury, obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and abuse of power related to the president's relationship with Lewinsky and his testimony in the Paula Jones lawsuit. As a result of Starr's investigation and report, known as the Starr Report, the House of Representatives voted to impeach President Clinton on two charges, perjury, and obstruction of justice, in December 1998. Though President Clinton was impeached by the House, the Senate acquitted him in February 1999, and he completed his second term as President. In summary, Kenneth Winston Starr was the Independent Counsel who investigated the Whitewater scandal, the death of Vince Foster, and the various allegations surrounding President Bill Clinton, which ultimately led to his impeachment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Brennan lives with his mother, Nancy; and Dale has been living with his father, Robert; the parents meet and fall in love. Robert and Nancy get married, forcing Brennan and Dale to live with each other as step brothers. Brennan and Dale dislike each other, blaming the other for interfering with their lifestyles. Brennan plays Dale's drum set and a brawl on the front lawn ensues. They are grounded for a week and they must find jobs within a month or they will be forced out of the house. When Brennan's younger brother Derek, a helicopter leasing agent, comes to visit with his family, he mocks their unsuccessful lives and being spoiled brats, which entices Dale to punch him in the face. Brennan is awed that Dale stood up to Derek, while Derek's wife Alice finds Dale's courage a turn on, beginning a sexual affair between the two. Brennan and Dale use the incident to discover their shared interests and develop a brotherly friendship. Robert schedules several job interviews for Brennan and Dale, who offend the interviewers with their disrespectful attitudes. Robert and Nancy reveal their plans to retire and sail the world on Robert's boat and allow Derek to sell the house, and demand that Brennan and Dale attend therapy and find other living arrangements.

Answer:","completion":"In the movie Step Brothers, Brennan Huff and Dale Doback initially blame each other for interfering with their lifestyles. As men-children still living at home with their respective parents, Nancy and Robert, the two are forced to live together as stepbrothers when their parents fall in love and get married. This sudden change in their lives causes tension and animosity between Brennan and Dale as they each view the other as the reason for their disrupted lifestyles. Over time, however, they come to realize that other factors are contributing to their struggles. One of these factors is Brennan's younger brother, Derek, who mocks their unsuccessful lives and calls them spoiled brats. This leads Dale to stand up to him, which in turn helps Brennan and Dale discover their shared interests and develop a genuine brotherly bond. Additionally, their parents, Robert and Nancy, serve as another external factor. They announce their plans to retire and sail the world, intending to have Derek sell their house and requiring Brennan and Dale to find new living arrangements. This further pushes the two stepbrothers together, as they devise a plan to start their own entertainment company called \\"Prestige Worldwide.\\" Ultimately, it is the combination of external factors and their own personal growth that leads Brennan and Dale to stop blaming each other for their disrupted lifestyles. Instead, they learn to work together and become more mature adults in the process. To invest in this film proposal, you should consider several aspects, such as the humor and chemistry between the lead actors, the relatability of the story to the target audience, and the potential for the film to resonate with viewers.

Hollywood shows some support for Israeli actors' refusal to perform in West Bank settlement To David and HumaneBeing: Here are a few quotes from independent sources that describe \\"Palestine\\" during the time of the Jews initial return: For many centuries, Palestine was a sparsely populated, poorly cultivated and widely-neglected expanse of eroded hills, sandy deserts and malarial marshes. Mark Twain, who visited Palestine in 1867, described it as: \\"...[a] desolate country whose soil is rich enough, but is given over wholly to weeds-a silent mournful expanse....A desolation is here that not even imagination can grace with the pomp of life and action....We never saw a human being on the whole route....There was hardly a tree or a shrub anywhere. Even the olive and the cactus, those fast friends of the worthless soil, had almost deserted the country.\\" As late as 1880, the American consul in Jerusalem reported the area was continuing its historic decline. \\"The population and wealth of Palestine has not increased during the last forty years,\\" he said. The Report of the Palestine Royal Commission quotes an account of the Maritime Plain in 1913: The road leading from Gaza to the north was only a summer track suitable for transport by camels and carts...no orange groves, orchards or vineyards were to be seen until one reached [the Jewish village of] Yabna [Yavne]....Houses were all of mud. No windows were anywhere to be seen....The ploughs used were of wood....The yields were very poor....The sanitary conditions in the village were horrible. Schools did not exist....The western part, towards the sea, was almost a desert....The villages in this area were few and thinly populated. Many ruins of villages were scattered over the area, as owing to the prevalence of malaria, many villages were deserted by their inhabitants. Lewis French, the British Director of Development wrote of Palestine: We found it inhabited by fellahin who lived in mud hovels and suffered severely from the prevalent malaria....Large areas...were uncultivated....The fellahin, if not themselves cattle thieves, were always ready to harbor these and other criminals. The individual plots...changed hands annually. There was little public security, and the fellahin's lot was an alternation of pillage and blackmail by their neighbors, the Bedouin. Surprisingly, many people who were not sympathetic to the Zionist cause believed the Jews would improve the condition of Palestinian Arabs. For example, Dawood Barakat, editor of the Egyptian paper Al-Ahram, wrote: \\"It is absolutely necessary that an entente be made between the Zionists and Arabs, because the war of words can only do evil. The Zionists are necessary for the country: The money which they will bring, their knowledge and intelligence, and the industriousness which characterizes them will contribute without doubt to the regeneration of the country.\\" Even a leading Arab nationalist believed the return of the Jews to their homeland would help resuscitate the country. According to Sherif Hussein, the guardian of the Islamic Holy Places in Arabia: The resources of the country are still virgin soil and will be developed by the Jewish immigrants. One of the most amazing things until recent times was that the Palestinian used to leave his country, wandering over the high seas in every direction. His native soil could not retain a hold on him, though his ancestors had lived on it for 1000 years. At the same time we have seen the Jews from foreign countries streaming to Palestine from Russia, Germany, Austria, Spain, America. The cause of causes could not escape those who had a gift of deeper insight. They knew that the country was for its original sons (abna'ihi­l­asliyin), for all their differences, a sacred and beloved homeland. The return of these exiles (jaliya) to their homeland will prove materially and spiritually [to be] an experimental school for their brethren who are with them in the fields, factories, trades and in all things connected with toil and labor.

Gilmour recorded his second solo album, About Face, in 1984, and used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters. He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him.

Vita Sackville-West, poet, author, and gardener, was born at Knole, about 25 miles from Sissinghurst, on 9 March 1892. The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through agnatic primogeniture, held enormous importance for her throughout her life. Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover Violet Trefusis in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn. She wrote to her mother that she would like \\"to live alone in a tower with her books\\", an ambition she achieved in the tower at Sissinghurst where only her dogs were regularly admitted. From 1946 until a few years before her death, Sackville-West wrote a gardening column for The Observer, in which, although she never referred directly to Sissinghurst, she discussed a wide array of horticultural issues. In an article, \\"Some Flowers\\", she discussed the challenge of writing effectively about flowers: \\"I discovered this only when I started to do so. Before ...

I read this background article the other day: Desertification is a type of land degradation in which a relatively dry area of land becomes a desert, typically losing its bodies of water as well as vegetation and wildlife.[2] It is caused by a variety of factors, such as through climate change (particularly the current global warming)[3] and through the overexploitation of soil through human activity.[4] When deserts appear automatically over the natural course of a planet's life cycle, then it can be called a natural phenomenon; however, when deserts emerge due to the rampant and unchecked depletion of nutrients in soil that are essential for it to remain arable, then a virtual \\"soil death\\" can be spoken of,[5] which traces its cause back to human overexploitation. Desertification is a significant global ecological and environmental problem with far reaching consequences on socio-economic and political conditions.[6] I am facing a new situation today: People in Iran used extensive grazing, fell most of their trees so they have lots of problems with desertification. Iraq took a more mindful approach to land use, they preserved native species, planted trees and didn't overgraze the land. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which country lost fewer bodies of water to desertification? A:","completion":"Based on the background article you provided and the new situation, it can be concluded that Iraq lost fewer bodies of water to desertification compared to Iran. This is because Iraq took a more mindful approach to land use, preserving native species, planting trees, and preventing overgrazing, which are all factors that help to mitigate the effects of desertification. In contrast, Iran's extensive grazing and deforestation practices have contributed to their desertification problems, likely resulting in the loss of more bodies of water."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Who falls in love with Corbin? , can you please find it? Drama critic John Earl observes a piece of artwork in a museum, gazing at it reverently. He asks the museum curator how much it costs, and the curator says that it is not for sale. The artist, James Harlan Corbin [Lederer], does not wish to sell the painting. Nonplussed, Earl returns to his office and phones Corbin with his proposal to sell. Again, Corbin refuses. Earl continues his pursuit to find out who the model for the painting was. He learns it is Helen North, a young woman who looks nothing like the woman in the painting. He visits with her to learn his location, but she refuses, telling him that she will be singing at a local nightclub, where Corbin frequents. Earl finds both of them in the museum, and again confronts Corbin. Becoming clearly annoyed, Corbin invites the singer out for a night in his yacht. She agrees, but is later found washed ashore. Although Police Lt. Roberts initially questions Helen's suitor Hunt Mason, Mason implicates Corbin as the last person who saw Helen North. John Earl works with the police department to arrange for Helen's sister Linda to apply for modeling, in order to spy on Corbin. The two return to Corbin's boathouse. While there, Linda calls for Earl and tells his chef that she is in danger and to notify the police. There, she learns that Corbin did not murder her sister. Thereafter, she falls in love with Corbin and agrees to support him against the district attorney's allegations he killed both Helen and another model, Madonna. Although Corbin has visions that he did so, Linda tells him to make sure he is telling the truth before confessing such heinous crimes. Linda returns home with Corbin's mother, who poisons her tea and tries to inject her with a lethal substance before police shoot. Corbin had suddenly recognized who it was that had planted evidence at the boathouse to implicate him.

Abu (Salim Kumar) and Aishumma (Zarina Wahab) are an elderly Moplah Muslim couple living in Kerala's Malabar region. Their aspiration is to go for Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca, and they sacrifice to achieve this aim. Their son Sattar has migrated to the Middle East (as a part of the Kerala Gulf boom) with his family and has virtually discarded his parents. Now in their late 70s, the couple decide to go for Hajj that year and they scrimp and save so that they can materialize their earnest wish to visit the holy place.Salim Kumar and Zarina Wahab as Abu and Aishumma, holding their new passportsAbu sells attar (a perfume obtained from flowers), religious books and Unani medicines that nobody seems to want. Aishumma breeds cattle and chickens, helping her husband realise their shared dream. Abu feels as outdated and discarded by a fast-changing world as the traditional products that he sells.A school teacher (Nedumudi Venu), Abu's friend, comes to his aid at his time of need. Hyder (Suraj Venharammud), a local teashop owner also empathises with Abu who in turn is frequently given genuine advice by a mysterious saint known simply as \\"Ustad\\" (Tampi Antony). Good-natured people try to help Abu by offering to lend him the amount but, as this goes against the accepted Islamic practices, he refuses to take anything.With the advancing years, Abu's desperation grows. Finally, in frustration and distress, he sells his cow and old jackfruit tree. Abu is helped by the manager of a travel agency (Mukesh) to get flight tickets and other documents for his journey. A policeman (Sasi Kalinga) initially tries to reject Abu's passport application, but once he gets his usual bribe he becomes quite helpful. The couple begins their preparations which include attending the Hajj preparation classes conducted by the travel agency, being vaccinated for meningococcal meningitis and buying new Ihram clothing. Abu pays off even the smallest of his old debts as part of the preparations and travels miles to seek forgiveness from Sulaiman, a previous neighbour with whom he once fought.When the passports and the tickets are ready and a bus journey away in Kozhikode, the sawmill owner (Kalabhavan Mani), while handing over the money for Abu's tree, says that its wood turned out to be rotten and useless. He insists that Abu take the money, however, since his cause is noble. Abu refuses it, saying that it wouldn't be halal and hence could anger God. When he is sure that he cannot fulfill his dream, Abu reaches another conclusionÂ â that the tree too had life, and several lives must have died when he cut the tree in front of his house. Abu conjectures that maybe one of the reasons for his not being able to go on the journey. On the dawn of the Hajj, Abu tells his wife that they will go the next year; he plants a new jackfruit sapling and is seen going to the mosque to pray on the morning of Hajj.","completion":"Question: Who are the main characters in the story?

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell visits domestic violence hotline headquarters September 27, 2014: NFL commissioner Roger Goodell arrives at the headquarters of the National Domestic Violence hotline in Austin, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) Austin, TEXAS – Facing criticism about the handling of recent abuse cases, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell spent three hours Saturday night visiting the headquarters of the National Domestic Violence Hotline and getting an up-close look at the realities victims face. Hotline CEO Katie Ray-Jones, whose organization has received a multiyear, multimillion dollar pledge of assistance from the NFL, described the private meeting as \\"emotional\\" for Goodell. \\"At one point he was physically moved to tears as he heard stories from our advocates about what women were encountering, that we took today,\\" Ray-Jones said. Hotline officials had invited Goodell to visit the facility, which is housed in a non-descript, unmarked building in suburban Austin. \\"Doing the work, as they say,\\" was all Goodell would say when as he and several league officials walked into the building. He gave a brief wave to cameras when he stepped out of his limousine. When he left, Goodell was flanked by two hotline staff members and refused to answer questions. Goodell and the league have been heavily criticized over how they handled the recent suspension of Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, who punched his then-fiancee Janay Palmer in the face in an elevator. The league was criticized as not acting quickly or emphatically enough when handling domestic violence cases and Goodell has said he mishandled the Rice case. Goodell met with 11 former players this week and was told the league must act immediately when someone is accused of domestic violence. The hotline was created in 1996 and receives about 70 percent -- just over 3 million -- of its budget from the federal government and the rest from private donations. The hotline web page said that as of 2013, the service had helped more than 3.4 million people on issues of domestic violence or dating abuse. Ray-Jones said the hotline has seen an 84 percent spike in calls since the Rice video punch video was made public, but also noted that tens of thousands of calls go unanswered because the hotline doesn't have enough staff. Goodell didn't listen to specific calls, but heard the stories related from the victim advocates. Ray-Jones said Goodell did not discuss any specific policies the NFL may put in place for domestic violence. \\"He mentioned they are very committed to understanding the issue further, and that he has a team of advisers who will continue to inform him on those policies,\\" Ray-Jones said. Initially, Goodell suspended Rice -- who has since married Palmer -- for two games. After criticism, Goodell announced new stiffer penalties for future domestic violence cases. After video of the punch was released, the Ravens cut Rice and Goodell suspended him indefinitely. League and Ravens officials said they requested the video from law enforcement but were denied. ESPN and others have reported that the Ravens had a detailed description of the video shortly after Rice was arrested. After the AP reported that the video was sent to NFL headquarters, Goodell announced that former FBI Director Robert Mueller would lead an internal investigation. That probe is ongoing, and there is no timetable for its completion.

In 219 , while Cao Ren Fancheng was attacking , Sun Quan agreed to send reinforcements to help the enclosed Guan Yu .","completion":"No, these two sentences are not paraphrases of each other. Paraphrasing is the act of rewording or reshaping a text or statement in order to retain its original meaning but through alternative expression. However, these two sentences represent two diametrically opposite situations. The first sentence establishes the following facts: 1. In 219, Guan Yu, a leading military general, was involved in an assault campaign to capture the city of Fancheng. 2. Cao Ren was under siege or trapped in Fancheng, perhaps as the defensive commanding officer against the assault. 3. Sun Quan, another third-party figure, agreed to send aid in the form of military reinforcement to assist Cao Ren in the entrapment scenario against Guan Yu's attack. On the other hand, the second sentence establishes a different set of scenarios: 1. In 219, Cao Ren was attacking, although it's unclear whether it's Fancheng or a different location. 2. Contrary to first sentence, Guan Yu is the one that's enclosed or trapped in this situation. 3. Sun Quan agreed to send military reinforcement to assist Guan Yu this time, who is under siege, flanked or enclosed.

Q:Build a movie plot around this: How did Van Helsing find out Dracula was a vampire? Renfeild, with the help of a mirror in the box. A:","completion":"Title: \\"Mirror of Darkness\\" Introduction: When renowned monster hunter Abraham Van Helsing receives an intriguing letter from Jonathan Harker, a lawyer visiting Transylvania to finalize the purchase of an estate in England, he is compelled to investigate the peculiar happenings plaguing his friend's business dealings. Ignoring his initial skepticism, Van Helsing brings along an ancient mirror rumored to reveal the true nature of supernatural beings. Act 1: Van Helsing arrives at the Carpathian village where Harker resides. The locals share stories about strange occurrences and the ominous Castle Dracula that sullies their once-peaceful town. Harker informs Van Helsing about Renfield, a patient of Dr. Seward's psychiatric institution, whose recent erratic behavior includes obsessing over a mysterious box that he claims will uncover the truth behind Count Dracula. Act 2: While Van Helsing tries to root out the source of the village's unease, he discovers that several people have been suffering from inexplicable bouts of anemia, leaving them pale and weak. Following Renfield's cryptic hints, Van Helsing manages to locate and open the very box the madman had spoken of. Inside, he finds a mirror with an inscription in Latin, which translates as \\"Darkness cannot hide from the light.\\" Act 3: Determined to face the malevolent Count Dracula, Van Helsing takes the mirror to Castle Dracula. He encounters and does battle with the Count's supernatural servants along the way. Inside the castle, the monster hunter finds Dracula in the midst of feeding on another unsuspecting villager. As Van Helsing confronts the Count, he shows him the mirror, revealing to Dracula his true form - a gruesome, bloodthirsty vampire. Act 4: The agonizing battle between Van Helsing and Dracula ensues, taking them through the castle's unnerving depths and across its treacherous grounds. Eventually, Van Helsing is able to trap Dracula in a room where sunlight breaches through the crumbling walls. Seizing the opportunity, Van Helsing drives a stake through the vampire's heart. As Dracula disintegrates into dust, the castle itself begins to crumble, signaling the end of the vampire's reign of terror. Conclusion: In the aftermath of Dracula's destruction, Van Helsing cements his reputation as a legendary monster hunter and protector of humanity. The mysterious mirror, too, gains notoriety as a powerful relic capable of revealing the truth behind the supernatural. And with Van Helsing's resolute victory, villagers and visitors alike can finally rest assured that no trace of darkness remains to haunt the Transylvanian town."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: Guns N’ Roses, the Beastie Boys, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Eric B. & Rakim and the Cure are among the 15 nominees for induction as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s class of 2012. In addition, ‘70s female-fronted rock acts Heart and Joan Jett & the Blackhearts are under consideration along with singer-songwriter Laura Nyro, disco queen Donna Summer, R&B collective War and British rock group Small Faces. Blues guitarist and singer Freddie King, R&B band the Spinners and Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan round out the latest batch of Hall of Fame nominees. Inductees are typically announced in December, ahead of a ceremony that takes place in New York in March. At least 25 years must have elapsed since a musician or group released its debut recording for the act to be eligible for induction. That makes Guns N’ Roses eligible for the first time because the L.A. hard rock outfit’s debut album, “Appetite for Destruction,” was released in 1987. Likewise, this is the first year of eligibility for rap duo Eric B. & Rakim, whose debut, “Paid in Full,” also appeared in 1987. King and Donovan are the senior members of this year’s nominees, having released their first recordings in 1961 and 1965, respectively. Because of the rancor over the years between Guns N' Roses founding member Axl Rose and former members of the band who have since departed, including guitarist Slash, the group's induction sets up the prospect of a dramatic reunion, if all parties opt to set aside their differences for the occasion. In a similar situation, Creedence Clearwater Revival singer, guitarist and songwriter John Fogerty refused to join with the Bay Area band's surviving members -- bassist Stu Cook and drummer Doug Clifford -- when Creedence was inducted in 1993.

After founding Puerto de Caballos, Gil Gónzalez sailed west along the coast to the Amatique Bay, and founded a Spanish settlement somewhere near the Dulce River, within modern-day Guatemala, which he named San Gil de Buena Vista. He launched a campaign of conquest in the mountainous region dividing Honduras from Guatemala. González left some of his men under the command of Francisco Riquelme at San Gil de Buena Vista, and sailed back east along the coast to Honduras. The colonists at San Gil did not prosper, and soon set out in search of a more hospitable location. They resettled in the important indigenous town of Nito, near the mouth of the Dulce River. Although they were in a desperate state, and near-starving, they were still there when Cortés passed through en route to Honduras, and were absorbed into his expedition.The Dominicans established themselves in Xocolo on the shore of Lake Izabal in the mid-16th century. Xocolo became infamous among the Dominican missionaries for the practice of witchcraft by its inhabitants. By 1574 it was the most important staging post for European expeditions into the interior, and it remained important in that role until as late as 1630, although it was abandoned in 1631.In 1598 Alfonso Criado de Castilla became governor of the Captaincy General of Guatemala. Owing to the poor state of Puerto de Caballos on the Honduran coast and its exposure to repeated pirate raids he sent a pilot to scout Lake Izabal. As a result of the survey, and after royal permission was granted, Criado de Castilla ordered the construction of a new port, named Santo Tomás de Castilla, at a favourable spot on the Amatique Bay not far from the lake. Work then began on building a highway from the port to the new capital of the colony, modern Antigua Guatemala, following the Motagua Valley into the...

Given the following context: Christopher Columbus discovered the Americas for the Kingdom of Castile and León in 1492. By 1580 this had unified with neighbouring kingdoms to form one Spanish kingdom. Private adventurers thereafter entered into contracts with the Spanish Crown to conquer the newly discovered lands in return for tax revenues and the power to rule. In the first decades after the discovery, the Spanish colonised the Caribbean and established a centre of operations on the island of Cuba. They heard rumours of the rich empire of the Aztecs on the mainland to the west and, in 1519, Hernán Cortés set sail with eleven ships to explore the Mexican coast. By August 1521 the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the Spanish. Within three years of the fall of Tenochtitlan the Spanish had conquered a large part of Mexico, extending as far south as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The newly conquered territory became New Spain, headed by a viceroy who answered to the Spanish Crown via the Council of the Indies. Cortés despatched Pedro de Alvarado with an army to conquer the Mesoamerican kingdoms of the Guatemalan Sierra Madre and neighbouring Pacific plain; the military phase of the establishment of the Spanish colony of Guatemala lasted from 1524 to 1541. The Captaincy General of Guatemala had its capital at Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala and covered a wide territory that also included the Mexican state of Chiapas as well as El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica. The Spanish imposed colonial rule over Yucatán between 1527 and 1546, and over Verapaz from the 16th to the 17th centuries, leaving the area between – essentially Petén and much of Belize – independent long after surrounding peoples had been subjugated. answer the following question: What territories were not conquered by the Spanish?

Answer a question about this article: On 14 June 1925, in a spontaneous reaction against Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, the crowd in the stadium jeered the Royal March. As a reprisal, the ground was closed for six months and Gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club. This coincided with the transition to professional football, and, in 1926, the directors of Barcelona publicly claimed, for the first time, to operate a professional football club. On 3 July 1927, the club held a second testimonial match for Paulino Alcántara, against the Spanish national team. To kick off the match, local journalist and pilot Josep Canudas dropped the ball onto the pitch from his airplane. In 1928, victory in the Spanish Cup was celebrated with a poem titled \\"Oda a Platko\\", which was written by a member of the Generation of '27, Rafael Alberti, inspired by the heroic performance of the Barcelona goalkeeper, Franz Platko.

In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa. In which place plant roots would play greater role in soil development, Kenya or Tanzania? Answer:","completion":"In terms of soil development, plant roots would play a greater role in Kenya, where grasslands are more prevalent. This is due to several reasons pertaining to the characteristics of grasslands and the role of grass roots in soil development, as compared to forests, like those in Tanzania. Grasslands are characterized by the dominance of grasses and the relative absence of trees. Grasses have extensive, fibrous root systems that penetrate deeply into the soil, providing a stable network for the soil to attach to and preventing erosion. These root systems also contribute significantly to the soil's organic matter. In grasslands, the decomposition of dead roots and the exudation of sugars, proteins, and other compounds by living roots promote the formation of humus, which is essential for soil fertility, water retention, and soil structure. On the other hand, forests, such as those in Tanzania, have a different soil development pattern. While the organic matter in forests comes primarily from fallen leaves and other debris on the forest floor, tree roots generally do not contribute as much to soil development as grass roots do. Forest soils typically have a thinner A horizon and a thicker O horizon, which is composed mostly of decomposing leaves and other organic material. The greater acidity under forests can also inhibit the action of soil organisms that would otherwise mix the surface litter into the mineral soil, leading to a more superficial distribution of organic matter in comparison to grasslands. Moreover, grasslands are often subjected to natural fires, which remove much of the aboveground biomass but stimulate further growth of grass roots. This process results in a net increase in root mass and contributes to the soil's organic matter. Therefore, considering the significant role that grass roots play in soil development and the contrasting characteristics of soils under grasslands and forests, it can be concluded that plant roots would have a greater influence on soil development in Kenya's grasslands than in Tanzania's forests."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In a new study in Molecular Biology and Evolution, Cornell University researchers explain that people who come from a line of mostly plant eaters likely carry a gene mutation used to help compensate for a lack of essential fatty acids from meat or fish. The problem is that those who have the mutation—about 70% of South Asians, 53% of Africans, 29% of East Asians, 17% of Europeans, and 18% of Americans, per Australia Network News—can actually hurt their bodies with a fatty acid overload, particularly if their diet is heavy in things like meat and sunflower oil, reports the Australian. The result is an increased risk of heart disease, colon cancer, and chronically high inflammation. Researchers identified the mutation in the FADS2 gene when comparing 234 people from Pune, India, where populations have historically eaten a plant-based diet, with 311 meat eaters from Kansas. Some 68% of the Indians had two copies of a sequence of DNA used to regulate genes FADS1 and FADS2—which make long-chain polyunsaturated fats like omega-3 and omega-6, used for brain development and to curb inflammation—compared to just 18% of the Americans, reports Metro. While the gene came in useful generations ago, \\"changes in the dietary omega-6 to omega-3 balance may contribute to the increase in chronic disease seen in some developing countries,\\" researchers say in a release. People with South Asian and southern African ancestry are particularly prone to high inflammation. (This population produces very little fatty acid.) Expand this summary.","completion":"So, long ago, people who mostly ate plants had a special change in their genes to help their bodies get important things called essential fatty acids, because they didn't eat much meat or fish, which have these important things. Today, many people around the world still have this gene change, especially those whose families come from South Asia and Africa. But now, if these people eat a lot of meat or use something called sunflower oil, their bodies can get too much of these essential fatty acids. Too much of these things can lead to a higher chance of getting sick with heart disease or colon cancer, and can make their body feel too much inflammation (like when you get a mosquito bite and it gets red and puffy). Researchers found out about this by studying groups of people who live in India and in Kansas, and comparing how their bodies are different. They noticed a lot more people from India had this special gene change, because their families have been eating mostly plants for a very long time. Now that we know about this gene change, we can try to help people who have it to stay healthy by choosing the right things to eat, and avoid getting too much essential fatty acids in their bodies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: President Donald Trump's approval rating has headed into unfamiliar territory in recent weeks — upward. Trump's approval hit 43 percent in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, with 52 percent disapproving. That represents a 3 percent improvement from last month in the same survey. Several other new surveys also show Trump at or slightly above 40 percent. The RealClearPolitics polling average puts the president's approval rating at 41 percent, a noticeable bump from August, when the rating was often in the mid-30s. For much of the second half of August, Trump's approval rating in the Gallup Daily Tracking poll was either 34 percent or 35 percent, historically a low mark for a new president. On Thursday, Gallup had Trump at 37 percent. The previous day, Trump hit 39 percent, his highest mark since late July. Trump's recent outreach to Democrats on budget issues and, possibly, immigration has boosted his poll numbers, as has his administration's response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that 71 percent of those surveyed approved of Trump's deal with Democrats to fund the government until December and raise the debt ceiling, while 8 percent disapproved. The question is whether Trump has turned a political corner, or is merely seeing a temporary respite from the low poll ratings that have plagued him since the beginning of his presidency. That could depend on whether working with Democrats is a long-range goal or a passing fad, and experts said that making a forecast on that could turn out to be foolish. \\"When it comes to President Trump, I have gotten out of the prediction business,\\" said Brookings Institution scholar Bill Galston. \\"For now, this is a significant shift of strategy and tactics.

It hadn't.

UPDATE: March 28 5:30 p.m. The University of Florida is closing a fraternity after allegations that its members hurled drunken insults and spat at a group of disabled military veterans during the Warrior Beach Retreat. The school said Tuesday Zeta Beta Tau's Fraternity's closing is effective immediately. It comes a week after the school suspended the fraternity, and ZBT's international office expelled three of its members after saying they had behaved inappropriately. The school previously said it's charging the fraternity with obscene behavior, public intoxication, theft, causing physical or other harm and damage to property. The situation occurred while the fraternity and veterans were at the Laketown Wharf Resort the weekend of April 18. -------------------------- UPDATE: March 23 12:30 p.m. Emory University released this statement Thursday morning by email: \\"Emory University was appalled to learn of acts of disrespect and harassment that were directed at attendees of the Warrior Beach Retreat in Florida this past weekend. Our brave veterans who have sacrificed much for our country deserve the utmost respect and appreciation for their service. The disrespectful behavior exhibited by students toward our veterans is not acceptable and will not be tolerated by members of the Emory community. When Emory received complaints that students from one of our fraternities might be involved, Campus Life administrators immediately began an investigation. To date, no evidence has been found to implicate Emory students in these reported incidents. If any members of our community are identified as being responsible, they will be held accountable for their actions by the university. Emory University thanks veterans for the significant contributions they have made to our country, and for exhibiting the values that we hold with great respect within our university community.\\" In a phone interview with CBS 46 in Atlanta Thursday morning, Warrior Beach Retreat Linda Cope responded to Emory's statement, saying, \\"There were too many students from Emory for none of them to be involved. It is hard for me to believe that no Emory student was a part of this. This denial is a slap in the face of veterans.\\" --------------------------------- Twice a year Panama City Beach welcomes our wounded heroes into the community for the Warrior Beach Retreat, but an event aimed at honoring our nation's veterans took a different turn at their hotel. A group of college students didn't show these veterans the respect they deserve. \\"This retreat has just been an eye opener. It's been more amazing than I ever thought it would be,\\" said Gina Harden, the wife of a wounded veteran. Our community has always gone above and beyond to give them a heroes welcome. However, during this Warrior Beach Retreat it was a different story when it comes to some of our visitors. Some veterans say they now know how Vietnam Veterans felt when they came home. They say they were subjected to similar harassment by a group of college students. \\"They actually spit on me and my service dog as well, and that's just so disrespectful and it hurts. I come and I feel honored and I feel safe and that I belong, but now I feel like I'm defending myself,\\" said wounded veteran Nicholas Connole. Veterans say they were shocked at the level of disrespect these college students had. They told me that they threw beer on them from their balconies and even spit on them. Linda Cope, founder of the Warrior Beach Retreat, says she's never seen such disgusting behavior. \\"They're a total disgrace for our military,\\" she siad. \\"They were urinating on the American flag they were throwing things off of the balconies.\\" These injured soldiers were staying at the Lake Town Wharf Resort at the same time students in the fraternity Zeta Beta Tau from the University of Florida and Emory University were in town for their spring formal. \\"I have not stood up and said anything about spring break because we constantly want to get the support of the community, but if this is at all indicative of what these college students do we need to get rid of it,\\" said Cope. Veterans say it comes down to respect for our country. \\"There was a group of very intoxicated college kids that actually ripped the American flag out of the ground and was trying to run around with it.\\" Cope did receive an apology letter from the president of UF who said he has started an investigation. \\"I said do your investigating, but I want to know what you're going to do. What are you going to do? I think they all should be put on probation. I'm hoping that this will make a dramatic change in their life to realize they do not need to take the sacrifice and the service of these men and women in vain,\\" said Cope. Cope also received a letter of apology from the University of Florida fraternity's president, who was there during the incidents, but she still has not heard anything from Emory University. ||||| A University of Florida fraternity accused of hurling bottles and insults at a group of wounded combat veterans in Panama City Beach was closed Tuesday, just days after the launch of a misconduct investigation by the university. “Vice President of Student Affairs Dave Kratzer said on Friday we would deal swiftly with this and we have,” said Janine Sikes, UF assistant vice president for media relations. Kratzer, a retired U.S. Army general, said he was disgusted by the reports of the way the students treated military vets at the Laketown Wharf resort. The UF chapter of Zeta Beta Tau was already on probation for a hazing incident last fall involving sleep deprivation when it was charged Friday with public drunkenness, obscene behavior, causing physical harm, theft, and property damage. “I continue to be saddened and disappointed by the reported mistreatment and disrespect of our military veterans,” UF President Kent Fuchs said in a prepared statement. “Our university has always honored, and will always honor, the service of veterans.” UF has refused to say whether any fraternity members have been suspended or expelled as a result of the incident, citing federal privacy laws. About 60 veterans at the Warrior Beach Retreat were staying as guests of the Laketown Wharf in Panama City Beach two weekends ago when members of ZBT fraternity members attending their spring formal yelled at them, spat on them, tore flags off their cars, and threw beer bottles at them, according to people attending the veterans retreat. Panama City Beach police were called, but let hotel management handle the situation. The management kicked the fraternity off the property. No police report was filed. After receiving information on the incident last week, the university charged the fraternity — already on probation for a hazing incident last fall — with obscene behavior, public drunkenness, causing physical or other harm, theft and property damage. The university worked with the fraternity's parent organization to come to a mutual decision on closing the UF chapter. “We are absolutely disgusted by the accusations that have been made regarding the behavior of members of this chapter,” ZBT International Fraternity President Matthew J. Rubins said in a news release. “ZBT will work diligently to demonstrate that the alleged behavior of a few does not represent the values of the many.” Zeta Beta Tau is conducting its own investigation into the matter. Linda Cope, founder of the Warrior Beach Retreat, a nonprofit group based in Panama City Beach, said she was pleased with the rapid response of the university and the international fraternity. “The nation needs to see they're not going to take this lightly,” Cope said. Because of numerous threats against the fraternity posted on social media, including death threats, the fraternity has removed the name and photo of the chapter president from its website. Also, UF has posted campus police at the fraternity house. The safety and security of the rest of the UF campus was another reason behind the decision to close the chapter, Sikes said. UF Department of Student Affairs is helping to find alternate housing for the students living in the frat house and letting students vacate when they are done with their final exams, Sikes said. The spring semester ends this week. Zeta Beta Tau was renting the house owned by Sigma Phi Epsilon, popularly known as “Sig Ep.” Sig Ep was kicked off campus in January 2013 following accusations of hazing, underage drinking and theft. Sigma Phi Epsilon's international organization withdrew the chapter's charter before a hearing could be held. Sig Ep will not be returning to campus in the fall, Sikes said. ZBT was also the subject of a hazing investigation last fall after university officials received separate complaints of pledges being forced to stay up all night, sit cross-legged on the floor for several hours and perform physical acts that made them vomit. Jack Causseaux, UF director of Sorority and Fraternity Affairs, reported on Oct. 21 that he got a call from a staff member reporting that a student complained he was forced to sit “Indian style” on a floor for seven hours while fraternity members grilled him, and that it was affecting his academic performance. On the same day, the Office of Student Affairs received a separate phone call from the father of another pledge saying his son was forced to stay awake all night and well into the next morning and perform “lots of cleaning” and physical activity that made some of the other pledges vomit. In November, the fraternity was accused of two counts of hazing — one for conduct that interferes with a student's academic performance, and another for activities that threaten a student's physical or mental health and safety. In December, the fraternity was placed on probation with sanctions that included suspension or expulsion if any other violations were committed. Two months after the fraternity was placed on probation, Cory Baach, the chapter's executive vice president, was arrested and charged with breaking the sideview mirror of a SNAP van after the driver refused to let him in the van, authorities said. Baach agreed to a pretrial diversion program on April 17 to avoid prosecution. ||||| UF chapter of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity to close Posted: Tuesday, April 28, 2015 3:12 PM EDT Updated: Tuesday, May 5, 2015 3:12 PM EDT The University of Florida chapter of Zeta Beta Tau will close in the wake of misconduct allegations following a recent event in the Florida Panhandle, officials from the national organization and the University of Florida announced Tuesday.

An interim suspension means the organization is suspended from all activities. There will be a complete investigation by the university. “I am personally offended and disappointed by the behavior that has been described to me,” said Student Affairs Vice President Dave Kratzer, also a retired U.S. Army major general and combat veteran. “This is not representative of our students or of the university.” Panama City police responded to the incident and no charges were filed. UF policies establish standards of conduct for individuals and organizations, and officials are addressing the situation through appropriate channels. The fraternity is currently on probation at UF for hazing during the fall semester, and as a result faces stiffer penalties if found to be in violation. Federal laws prohibit the university from discussing anything about the conduct process for individuals. The University of Florida takes pride in serving the veteran community in many ways and will continue to do so, using this opportunity as a teaching moment. The Collegiate Veterans Society, a UF student organization, has reached out to the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity to propose a restorative justice meeting, and the Collegiate Veterans Success Center on campus hosted discussions with veterans to talk through the situation. Kratzer also will contact local veterans groups, and a team from UF and ZBT will offer to attend each group’s meetings to hear concerns. UF President Kent Fuchs, UF’s dean of students and UF’s director of sorority and fraternity affairs have reached out to apologize to Warrior Beach Retreat founder Linda Cope and the individual veterans who reported the incident. The president’s letter is included as part of this release. The ZBT chapter and the national organization also have apologized. The national office has placed the organization on interim suspension awaiting the conclusion of a full investigation. “In the days and weeks ahead, I assure you that the University of Florida will address this immediate situation as well as reinforce the long term commitment to community service and respect for others that have always been hallmarks of the University of Florida community,” Kratzer said.

Plot title: The Blue Lagoon Movie plot: In the Victorian period, two young cousins, Richard (Glenn Kohan) and Emmeline Lestrange (Elva Josephson), and a galley cook, Paddy Button (Leo McKern), survive a shipwreck in the South Pacific and reach a lush tropical island. Paddy cares for the small children and forbids them by \\"law\\" from going to the other side of the island, as he had found remains from bloody human sacrifices. He also warns them against eating a scarlet berry which is apparently deadly. (He calls it the \\"never-wake-up berry\\".) Paddy soon dies after a drunken binge, and his body is discovered by Richard and Emmeline. Now alone, the children go to another part of the island and rebuild their home. Years pass and they both grow into tall, strong, and beautiful teenagers. They live in their hut, spending their days together fishing, swimming, and diving for pearls. Richard and Emmeline (now portrayed by Christopher Atkins and Brooke Shields) begin to fall in love, although this is emotionally stressful for them because of their lack of education on human sexuality. Emmeline is frightened after she begins her first menstrual period; confused about it, she refuses to allow Richard to inspect her for what he imagines is a cut. Sometime later, their relationship suffers a major blow when a ship appears for the first time in years. Richard's desire to leave comes into conflict with Emmeline's desire to stay, and she does not light the signal fire. As a result, the ship passes by without noticing them. Richard's fury leads him to kick Emmeline out of their hut. They make up for this fight after Emmeline is nearly killed upon stepping on a stonefish and Richard admits to his fear of losing her. Emmeline recovers and after she regains her ability to walk, they go skinny dipping in the lagoon and then swim to shore. Still naked, Richard and Emmeline discover sexual intercourse and passionate love. They regularly make love from then on while occasionally spending their time together in the nude.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Goldfrapp are an English electronic music duo from London, formed in 1999. The duo consists of Alison Goldfrapp (vocals, synthesizer) and Will Gregory (synthesizer). Despite favourable reviews and a short-listing for the Mercury Prize, their 2000 debut studio album Felt Mountain did not chart highly. Goldfrapp's second album Black Cherry, which incorporated glam rock and synthpop sounds into their music, was released in 2003. Goldfrapp's second album Black Cherry was released in April 2003. The band recorded the album in a darkened studio in Bath, England. The album focused more heavily on dance music and glam rock-inspired synths than its predecessor. Alison Goldfrapp commented that the album differed from Felt Mountain because the band \\"felt that we really didn't want to repeat what we had done...we kind of wanted to do something that felt equally as fresh to us as the first one felt fresh to us, and we wanted to put more kind of \\"oomph\\" in it.\\" The album received positive reviews from critics. The Guardian found it to be an \\"unexpected delight\\" and About.com called it a \\"rare electronica album of warmth and depth...the ultimate chillout pleasure\\". Black Cherry peaked at number 19 on the UK Albums Chart and number four on the Billboard Top Electronic Albums chart in the United States. It sold well, reaching platinum status in the UK and selling 52,000 copies in the US as of August 2006. The first single released from the album was \\"Train\\", which reached number 23 on the UK Singles Chart. The song's lyrics discuss obsession and overindulgence and were inspired by Goldfrapp's visit to Los Angeles while touring in support of Felt Mountain. \\"Strict Machine\\" was released as the album's second single. The song proved successful on several formats, and reached number one on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart. In 2004, \\"Strict Machine\\" won an Ivor Novello Award for \\"Best Dance Single\\". The third single released from Black Cherry was \\"Twist\\", a song inspired by a fantasy that Goldfrapp had about a boy who worked in a fairground. The title track was released as the album's fourth single and reached number 28 in the UK. In 2003, Alison Goldfrapp modified her image, from a sophisticated Marlene Dietrich inspired look to that of a new wave diva. The reinvented image included false eyelashes, customised T-shirts, military uniforms and fishnet stockings. Starting in March 2003, the band toured the album, with a concert series entitled Black Cherry Tour. In 2004, the band further toured Australia, Japan, Europe and North America and embarked on the Wonderful Electric Tour. Sections of the stage show featured Goldfrapp in a white dress wearing a horse tail and dancers with deer heads, and were inspired by Goldfrapp's interest in animals and mythology. was the album a success","completion":"Yes, the album was a success.

He is a physics professor from California. Although the weather in California is usually warm and sunny, Ken's hobby is taking pictures of snowflakes. He travels to cold areas like Alaska and Canada to find snowstorms and take pictures of the snowflakes. \\"They are often beautiful, and every snowfall brings new surprises,\\" says Ken. Ken takes pictures of snowflakes with a high-quality digital camera. He uses a microscope to make the tiny snowflakes larger. To get the best images, Ken built a special photo-microscope just for snowflakes. He collects flakes by letting them fall onto a piece of foam board . The pictures must be taken outdoors, so Ken wears lots of clothes to stay warm. But his fingers often get cold, because it's difficult for him to take pictures of a tiny snowflake with gloves.

Movie title: Sucker Punch Context: In the 1950s,[10] a 20-year-old woman[10] nicknamed Babydoll (Emily Browning) is institutionalized by her widowed stepfather (Gerard Plunkett) at the Lennox House for the Mentally Insane after she is blamed for the death of her younger sister. The stepfather bribes Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), one of the asylum's orderlies, into forging the signature of the asylum's psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), to have Babydoll lobotomized so she cannot inform the authorities of the true circumstances leading to her sister's death. During her admission to the institution, Babydoll takes note of four items that she would need to attempt an escape. At the moment she is lobotomized, Babydoll slips into a fantasy world in which she is newly arrived in a brothel owned by Blue, whom she envisions as a mobster. She befriends four other dancers Amber (Jamie Chung), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (Jena Malone), and Rocket's sister and \\"star of the show\\", Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish). Dr. Gorski is envisioned as the girls' dance instructor. Blue informs Babydoll that her virginity will be sold to a client known as the High Roller (Jon Hamm), who is actually the doctor scheduled to perform the lobotomy. Gorski encourages Babydoll to perform an erotic dance, during which Babydoll further fantasizes she is in feudal Japan, meeting the Wise Man (Scott Glenn). After she expresses her desire to \\"escape\\", the Wise Man presents Babydoll with weapons and tells her that she would need to collect five items: a map, fire, a knife, a key, and a fifth, unrevealed item that would require \\"a deep sacrifice\\" but bring a \\"perfect victory\\". She then fights three samurai giants. As her fantasy ends, she finds herself back in the brothel, her dance having impressed Blue and other onlookers.

The Berg mountains in Berg county are of a volcanic nature, very massive, few caves. The Gorge mountains in Gorge county are made of sedimentary rocks, predominantly limestone. They were exposed to water and that lead to karst lanscapes, caves, blue holes, stalactites and stalagmites. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which of the two mountains had fewer karst landscapes? Hint: About 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones. The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years. Most cave systems are through limestone bedrock. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The Berg mountains. Step 1: Identify the types of rocks in each mountain range. - Berg mountains: volcanic rocks - Gorge mountains: sedimentary rocks, predominantly limestone Step 2: Understand the relationship between limestone and karst landscapes. - Limestone is a sedimentary rock that is soluble in water and weak acid solutions, which leads to the formation of karst landscapes. Step 3: Evaluate the formations in each mountain range. - Berg mountains have a volcanic nature, which typically does not have any limestone. Thus, they have very few karst landscapes. - Gorge mountains have limestone formations, which have been exposed to water and led to the development of karst landscapes, caves, blue holes, stalactites, and stalagmites. Step 4: Compare the karst landscape presence in both mountain ranges. - The Berg mountains, being of volcanic nature, tend to have the least amount of karst landscapes. - The Gorge mountains, being composed primarily of limestone, have a higher amount of karst landscapes.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered a thinly veiled criticism of China, even while insisting on closer relations with Beijing, during a speech Friday in Singapore. Speaking at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue defense conference, Modi called for the Indo-Pacific region to embrace freedom of navigation, territorial integrity, and respect for all nations, regardless of their size. \\"We will promote a democratic and rules-based international order in which all nations, small and large, count as equal and sovereign,\\" the Indian prime minister said. \\"We will work with others to keep our seas, space and airways free and open.\\" While those comments did not specifically mention China, Modi's remarks are seen as a reference to Beijing's increasingly assertive behavior toward its smaller neighbors in disputed areas of the South China Sea. Modi also implicitly criticized the United States. He slammed growing protectionism, presumably a reference to recent tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. He also said nations should keep their commitments — a possible reference to Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal. India has grown close with the U.S., especially as China projects its growing military power beyond its shores. The U.S.-India relationship, Modi said, \\"has resumed new significance in the changing world.\\" An important aspect of that partnership is \\"a shared vision of an open, stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific,\\" he added. For decades, India has embraced a non-aligned status, which means it does not choose sides between world powers. In keeping with that position, Modi warned against a \\"return to great power rivalries.\\" The Indian prime minister also insisted that \\"Asia and the world will have a better future when India and China work together in trust and confidence, sensitive to each other's interests.\\" India is the world's largest democracy. It has the world's seventh-largest economy. Within a decade, it is expected to pass China to become the world's most populous country.

Question: Big continent used more air polluting substances, while Small continent was very protective towards the environment. Big continent got a hole in its ozone layer as a consequence of their actions. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which continent killed less plankton? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the key information given in the paragraph: - Big continent used more air polluting substances - Small continent was very protective towards the environment - Big continent got a hole in its ozone layer as a consequence Step 2: Understand the consequences of air pollution and ozone depletion: Ozone depletion is a well-known factor in harming the environment. A hole in the ozone layer can cause increased ultraviolet (UV) radiation to reach the Earth's surface. High levels of UV radiation can negatively impact plankton populations. Since plankton are at the base of the food chain, their decrease can cause ripple effects in the marine ecosystem. Step 3: Draw a conclusion: Based on the information provided, Small continent was more protective towards the environment and did not cause any notable harm to their ozone layer. Therefore, given the consequences of ozone depletion and its impact on plankton populations, it can be concluded that Small continent killed less plankton compared to Big continent.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Three Little Bops Context: The short opens with a display of the book that shows the Three Little Pigs who used to play pipes and dance jigs. The short then focuses to the present day and reveals the pigs now play modern instruments and perform as The Three Little Bops. During a gig at the House of Straw, the Big Bad Wolf appears and proves he is friendly by stating that he wants to join the band. The Wolf happens to be terrible at playing his choice instrument (a trumpet) so the pigs throw him out. Feeling insulted, the Wolf retaliates by blowing down the straw house, forcing the pigs to go to the Dew Drop Inn, the House of Sticks. Things go well (including the piano playing pig doing an imitation of Liberace's \\"I wish my brother George was here\\"), until the Wolf comes in and attempts to play his trumpet again. Like the pigs, the people watching also think the wolf's playing is corny, so they call for the pigs to \\"throw the square out\\", which they do. Again, the Wolf retaliates by blowing down, or \\"dropping out,\\" the Dew Drop Inn. The pigs then realize that in order to escape the Wolf's \\"windy tricks,\\" they will go to the House of Bricks (built in May 1st 1776, according to a cornerstone). Coincidentally, another relevant event related to that date is the foundation of the Illuminati Society. For the pigs, the House of Bricks has a \\"No Wolves Allowed\\" rule, so when the Wolf tries to get in, he is punched in the face by a bouncer. Then he tried to ram the door down with a log but with no success. The Wolf runs out of breath in trying to blow away the club, but thinks he can get in by disguising himself. He reenters in fur coat and ukulele with his perfect rendition of the Charleston song (cut short by slipping on a strategically thrown banana peel). He returns in the disguise of a houseplant with his trumpet but gets blasted outside by a plunger shot from the double bass. For his third try, the Wolf shows up in a drum major outfit playing a big bass drum to the tune of \\"Don't Give Up the Ship\\". A dart is shot into the drum to deflate...

By late 1990, Phish's concerts were becoming more and more intricate, often making a consistent effort to involve the audience in the performance. In a special \\"secret language\\", the audience would react in a certain manner based on a particular musical cue from the band. For instance, if Anastasio \\"teased\\" a motif from The Simpsons theme song, the audience would yell, \\"D'oh!\\" in imitation of Homer Simpson . In 1992, Phish introduced a collaboration between audience and band called the \\"Big Ball Jam\\" in which each band member would throw a large beach ball into the audience and play a note each time his ball was hit. In so doing, the audience was helping to create an original composition. In an experiment known as \\"The Rotation Jam\\", each member would switch instruments with the musician on his left. On occasion, a performance of \\"You Enjoy Myself\\" involved Gordon and Anastasio performing synchronized maneuvers, jumping on mini-trampolines while simultaneously playing their instruments. Phish, along with Bob Dylan, the Grateful Dead, and the Beatles, was one of the first bands to have a Usenet newsgroup, rec.music.phish, which launched in 1991. Aware of the band's growing popularity, Elektra Records signed them that year. The following year A Picture of Nectar was complete: their first major studio release, enjoying far more extensive production than either 1988's Junta or 1990's Lawn Boy. These albums were eventually re-released on Elektra, as well. The first annual H.O.R.D.E. festival in 1992 provided Phish with their first national tour of major amphitheaters.

Please answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump says he may veto a 1.3 trillion spending bill because it does not offer protections for young undocumented immigrants who arrived as children and does not fully fund the border wall. In a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he is considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on \\"the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\\" Previously, White House officials said Trump would sign the spending package, a move that would head off a potential government shutdown due to a lack of funding. The measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill considers major legislation this year. The measure fulfills Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

Premise: Agency policy must assign accountability for recording and maintaining T Hypothesis: No one has to record and maintain minutes of the meetings. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"In order to analyze if the premise entails the hypothesis, let's break down each one: Premise: The agency policy necessitates assigning accountability for recording and maintaining 'T.' Hypothesis: No one has the responsibility to record and maintain the minutes of the meetings. Step 1: Understand the premise The first step to determine entailment is to understand the premise. The premise here establishes that there is a firm rule within the agency to make someone responsible for recording and maintaining 'T.' However, it's not explicit what 'T' represents. Step 2: Understand the Hypothesis The hypothesis states that there is no requirement for any person to record and maintain the minutes of the meetings. This is a clear statement with no ambiguity. Step 3: Compare and Analyze In entailment, the truth of the premise should guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. In this scenario, the premise talks about recording and maintaining 'T', but we don't know exactly what 'T' stands for. If 'T' meant \\"minutes of the meetings,\\" then the premise would directly contradict the hypothesis since the policy assigns someone to maintain 'T'. Therefore, if 'T' stands for something else, the premise doesn't say anything about the recording and maintaining of meeting minutes, thus not guaranteeing the truth of the hypothesis. Conclusion: The premise does not entail the hypothesis. Without more information about what 'T' refers to, we cannot definitively say that the premise entails the hypothesis. The statement about recording and maintaining 'T' in the premise does not directly involve maintaining and recording minutes of meetings as described in the hypothesis, hence they do not entail each other based on the information provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He was the first High King of the Elven Noldor to lead his people on the journey from Middle-earth to Valinor in the blessed realm of Aman. He was a great friend of Elu Thingol, the King of Doriath. The story of Finwë and Míriel, his first wife, has been described as an important element of Tolkien's mythology. \\"The Silmarillion\\", prepared by Christopher Tolkien from his father's unpublished writings, only briefly mentions the tale, although sources suggest that Tolkien had intended to incorporate a fuller version. - Fëanor is a fictional character from J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium who plays an important part in \\"The Silmarillion\\". He was the eldest son of Finwë, the High King of the Noldor, and his first wife Míriel Serindë. Fëanor's mother, Míriel, died shortly after giving birth, having given all her strength and essence to him. - In J. R. R. Tolkien 's legendarium , Amrod ( IPA : ( amrod ) ) is a fictional character . He was the youngest son of Fëanor and the younger twin of Amras . From their mother Nerdanel they inherited red hair , instead of Fëanor 's black . Amrod 's father name in Quenya is Telufinwë , \`\` Last Finwë '' , for he was the last of Fëanor 's sons . His mother name was originally Ambarussa ( \`\` top - russet '' , referring to his hair ) , the same as his brother Amras , but Fëanor insisted that the twins ought to have different names and Nerdanel later called him Umbarto , \`\` the Fated '' . His father , disturbed by it , changed it to Ambarto . Nevertheless , both twins called each other Ambarussa . However \`\` Umbarto '' proved to be a prophetic name , for Amrod was accidentally killed in the swan ships of the Teleri , when his father ordered them to be burnt at Losgar . - A pen name (\\"nom de plume\\", or \\"literary double\\") is a pseudonym (or, in some cases, a variant form of a real name) adopted by an author and printed on the title page or by-line of his or her works in place of their \\"real\\" name. A pen name may be used to make the author's name more distinctive, to disguise his or her gender, to distance an author from some or all of his or her previous works, to protect the author from retribution for his or her writings, to combine more than one author into a single author, or for any of a number of reasons related to the marketing or aesthetic presentation of the work. The author's name may be known only to the publisher, or may come to be common knowledge. - The Lord of the Rings is an epic high-fantasy novel written by English author J. R. R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel \\"The Hobbit\\", but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is one of the best-selling novels ever written, with over 150 million copies sold. - In the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, the Noldor (also spelled Ñoldor, meaning \\"those with knowledge\\" in Quenya) are High Elves of the Second Clan who migrated to Valinor and lived in Eldamar. The Noldor are called \\"Golodhrim\\" or \\"Gódhellim\\" in Sindarin, and \\"Goldui\\" by Teleri of Tol Eressëa. The singular form of the Quenya noun is \\"Noldo\\" and the adjective is \\"Noldorin\\". They were the Second Clan of the Elves in both order and size, the other clans being the Vanyar and the Teleri. Like the Teleri, they typically had grey eyes and dark hair (except for those who had Vanyarin blood, most prominently the members of the House of Finarfin). - The Hobbit, or There and Back Again is a children's fantasy novel by English author J. R. R. Tolkien. It was published on 21 September 1937 to wide critical acclaim, being nominated for the Carnegie Medal and awarded a prize from the \\"New York Herald Tribune\\" for best juvenile fiction. The book remains popular and is recognized as a classic in children's literature. - The Silmarils (Quenya pl. Silmarilli, \\"radiance of pure light\\") are three fictional brilliant jewels composed of the unmarred light of the Two Trees in J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. The Silmarils were made out of the crystalline substance \\"silima\\" by Fëanor, a Noldorin Elf, in Valinor during the Years of the Trees. The Silmarils play a central role in Tolkien's book \\"The Silmarillion\\", which tells of the creation of Eä (the Universe) and the beginning of Elves, Men, and Dwarves. - In J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium, Amras is a fictional character, the twin brother of Amrod being the youngest sons of Fëanor and Nerdanel.

Answer the following question: What is the full name of the person who denounced his faith after being influenced by a shipmate's discussion of a book written by the Third Earl of Shaftesbury? Answer the above question based on the context below: According to the Dictionary of American Hymnology \\"Amazing Grace\\" is John Newton's spiritual autobiography in verse.In 1725, Newton was born in Wapping, a district in London near the Thames. His father was a shipping merchant who was brought up as a Catholic but had Protestant sympathies, and his mother was a devout Independent unaffiliated with the Anglican Church. She had intended Newton to become a clergyman, but she died of tuberculosis when he was six years old. For the next few years, Newton was raised by his emotionally distant stepmother while his father was at sea, and spent some time at a boarding school where he was mistreated. At the age of eleven, he joined his father on a ship as an apprentice; his seagoing career would be marked by headstrong disobedience. As a youth, Newton began a pattern of coming very close to death, examining his relationship with God, then relapsing into bad habits. As a sailor, he denounced his faith after being influenced by a shipmate who discussed Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times, a book by the Third Earl of Shaftesbury, with him. In a series of letters he later wrote, \\"Like an unwary sailor who quits his port just before a rising storm, I renounced the hopes and comforts of the Gospel at the very time when every other comfort was about to fail me.\\" His disobedience caused him to be pressed into the Royal Navy, and he took advantage of opportunities to overstay his leave and finally deserted to visit Mary \\"Polly\\" Catlett, a family friend with whom he had fallen in love. After enduring humiliation for deserting, he managed to get himself traded to a slave ship where he began a career in slave trading.

The easiest way to do this would be to slide it over a 5-gallon (18.5-L) bucket. Pull the hanger off of the bucket when you are done. Use some pliers to untwist the wire at the top of the hanger. Open up the hanger; you will be stringing the flowers onto the hanger, then twisting it back together. Leave the hook intact; do not cut the hanger. Purchase a bunch of fake flowers with wired stems; they must have wired stems or the next step won't work. Use wire cutters to cut the flowers so that the stems are 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) long. If there are any leaves on the cut stems, be sure to pull those off too. Large flowers, such as roses or peonies work the best for this. How many flowers you buy depends on how big they are and how full you want the wreath to be. You are not attaching these to the hanger just yet. Instead, twist the flower stem into a loop about halfway down. When you are done, you'll have a flower with a short stem that has a loop at the bottom. Repeat this step for all of your flowers. Use a skewer or knitting needle to form the loops. They need to be small enough to slide onto the hanger. The wreath should be full enough so that the flowers don't slide around. You can fit more flowers by rotating the flowers around the wreath in a spiral rather than stacking them together. Do not cover the twisted part of the coat hanger, or you won't be able to reassemble it. Move the flowers aside if needed, then twist the wires back together like they used to be. Once your wreath is reassembled, hang it up somewhere using the hook. You can reuse this wreath base simply by untwisting it, pulling off the old flowers, then adding new ones.","completion":"This article explains how to create a wreath using a wire coat hanger and fake flowers with wired stems by shaping the hanger into a ring, cutting the stems, looping the flowers, and attaching them to the hanger."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I think it was back in the day where I picked out metal CD's based on the cover and font. Anyway...this CD kicked my ass from the first listen, and still does to this day. I don't know how to describe the sound, because it's kinda unique, but it was ALL HEAVY. The vocalist is rough, but understandable...and the music is aggressive and violent, but each song has amazing songwriting that builds up to a climax and doesn't dissapoint. I find myself singing along to each song. This CD is definitely one of my faves of all time. Imagine Pissing Razors on steroids. I honestly can't believe there's not another CD out there from this band...oh well...at least they came out with a perfect albumn. Is this product review negative? A:","completion":"No, this product review is not negative. In fact, it is quite the opposite. The reviewer is praising the CD and describing it as a hidden gem. They mention how the CD exceeded their expectations, being heavy, aggressive, and violent while showcasing amazing songwriting.

Here are possible answers to this question: - believe in god - migraine - complete high school - die suddenly - cross river I believe the correct choice is \\"die suddenly\\", here's why: The answer is:","completion":"\\"die suddenly\\", here's why: When a bullet penetrates the skull and enters the brain, it can cause severe damage to the brain tissue, blood vessels, and surrounding structures. The brain is a vital organ responsible for controlling all bodily functions, including breathing, heartbeat, and consciousness. Consequently, such an injury can result in immediate death. There are several reasons why \\"die suddenly\\" is the most likely outcome when a person is shot in the head: 1. Massive brain damage: A bullet can cause widespread destruction of vital areas in the brain, leading to an instant loss of consciousness and an inability to sustain basic life functions such as breathing and circulation. 2. Hemorrhage and swelling: The injury can lead to significant bleeding inside the skull, which can cause increased pressure on the brain. This can lead to a rapid decline in brain function and ultimately prove fatal. 3. Damage to the brainstem: The brainstem controls essential functions such as breathing and heart rate. If the bullet penetrates or damages the brainstem, it can cause an immediate cessation of these functions, resulting in sudden death. It is important to note that not everyone who suffers a gunshot wound to the head will die instantly, as various factors such as bullet size, speed, trajectory, and location of injury can influence the outcome. However, the majority of individuals who experience a gunshot wound to the head will suffer severe, often fatal consequences, making \\"die suddenly\\" the most probable answer.

Please answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump says he may veto a 1.3 trillion spending bill because it does not offer protections for young undocumented immigrants who arrived as children and does not fully fund the border wall. In a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he is considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on \\"the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\\" Previously, White House officials said Trump would sign the spending package, a move that would head off a potential government shutdown due to a lack of funding. The measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill considers major legislation this year. The measure fulfills Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"No, those questions do not have the same meaning. They both ask about charging times for batteries, but they are pertaining to different types of batteries used in different applications. 1) How long does it take to charge a Nikon camera battery? The time it takes to charge a Nikon camera battery depends on the specific battery model and the charger being used. Most Nikon camera batteries are Li-ion or Lithium-polymer batteries, and their charging times may differ. Here's a breakdown of approximate charging times for some common Nikon camera batteries: - Nikon EN-EL14a (used in Nikon D3300, D3400, D3500, D5300, D5500, D5600, etc.): It takes around 1.5 to 2.5 hours to charge this battery fully, using the Nikon MH-24 Quick Charger. - Nikon EN-EL15 (used in Nikon D610, D750, D800, D810, D850, D500, D7500, D7200, etc.): It takes around 2 to 3 hours to charge this battery fully, using the Nikon MH-25a Quick Charger. - Nikon EN-EL20 (used in Nikon 1 J1, 1 J2, 1 J3, 1 S1, etc.): It takes around 2.5 to 3 hours to charge this battery fully, using the Nikon MH-27 Charger. - Nikon EN-EL3e (used in Nikon D50, D70, D70s, D80, D90, D100, D200, D300, D300S, D700): It takes around 2 hours to charge this battery fully, using the Nikon MH-18a Quick Charger. Please note that these charging times are approximate, and various factors like battery age, temperature, and charger performance can affect the actual charging time. 2) How long does it take to charge a 12v 85 MH battery? The question seems to have a typo and should be asking about charging a 12v 85Ah (85 amp-hours) battery. The charging time for a 12v 85Ah battery depends on the type of battery (lead-acid, AGM, gel, lithium, etc.) and the charger's output amperage. To calculate the charging time, you can use the following formula: Charging time (hours) = (Battery Capacity (Ah) / Charger Output Current (Amps)) * 1.2 (Factor for inefficiencies) For example, if you have a 12v 85Ah battery and a charger with 10A output current: Charging time (hours) = (85Ah / 10A) * 1.2 ≈ 10.2 hours This calculation assumes that the battery is fully discharged and needs to be charged up to its full capacity.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the storm has passed happens, how will it affect the sky is filled with clouds. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has an indirect effect on the process. When the storm passes and the sky is filled with clouds, the amount of sunlight reaching the greenhouse is reduced. This decrease in sunlight will cause less sunlight to pass through the glass into the greenhouse, and therefore less absorbed sunlight will be converted to heat. As a result, the overall temperature inside the greenhouse may be lower than when there are no clouds, and the heating cycle described in the process might be less efficient or slowed down."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Charles kept the bulk of his troops several miles away from the river bank in hopes of concentrating them at the point where Napoleon decided to cross. On 21 May, the French made their first major effort to cross the Danube, precipitating the Battle of Aspern-Essling. The Austrians enjoyed a comfortable numerical superiority over the French throughout the battle; on the first day, Charles disposed of 110,000 soldiers against only 31,000 commanded by Napoleon. By the second day, reinforcements had boosted French numbers up to 70,000. The battle was characterized by a vicious back-and-forth struggle for the two villages of Aspern and Essling, the focal points of the French bridgehead. By the end of the fighting, the French had lost Aspern but still controlled Essling. A sustained Austrian artillery bombardment eventually convinced Napoleon to withdraw his forces back onto Lobau Island. Both sides inflicted about 23,000 casualties on each other. It was the first defeat Napoleon suffered in a major set-piece battle, and it caused excitement throughout many parts of Europe because it proved that he could be beaten on the battlefield.\\".

Write an article based on this \\"Two Indians who were taken hostage in a cafe by a gunman in Sydney, Australia, are safe, India's foreign minister Sushma Swaraj has tweeted.\\"","completion":"Title: Indian Hostages Emerge Safely from Sydney Siege: A Triumph of International Cooperation Introduction In a harrowing incident that made international headlines, two Indian nationals found themselves in the midst of a hostile situation at a cafe in Sydney, Australia. Faced with a dangerous gunman, the tense stand-off finally concluded with a successful rescue operation, and the Indian hostages were later confirmed to have made it out unscathed. News of the hostages' safety brought a collective sigh of relief, especially from the Indian expatriate community and authorities of both countries. This event serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of global cooperation and coordination in crisis situations. The Hostage Incident On an otherwise ordinary day at the Lindt Chocolate Café in Sydney, Australia, unsuspecting patrons found themselves at the mercy of a captor armed with a gun and a vicious agenda. The armed individual claimed to have planted explosives in the café and in the surrounding area, thereby posing a significant threat to multiple lives. The hostages, including two Indian nationals among those held inside the café, were thrust into a nerve-wracking dilemma as the Australian authorities worked painstakingly to neutralize the threat and diffuse the situation. As the drama unfolded, live updates streamed across news channels and social media platforms, making it evident that the crisis had captured the world's attention. Role of the Indian Foreign Minister Upon learning about the situation, India's foreign minister, Sushma Swaraj, actively followed the event; she maintained regular communication with the Indian Consulate in Sydney to gather accurate information about the incident. The foreign minister remained available for updates around the clock, ensuring that the Indian embassy offered all necessary support to the affected Indian nationals in Sydney. Swaraj's perseverance in the matter exemplifies the proactive engagement of the foreign minister in real-time crisis management, particularly when fellow Indian citizens are at stake. International news providers and social media lauded her diligent efforts and praised her quick response to the escalating danger. Safe and Sound The hostage crisis spanned over 16 hours, finally ending with the storming of the café by heavily armed police officers. A series of gunshots and loud bangs dominated the scene, captivating the attention of onlookers and media personnel. The resulting chaos left three people dead, including the gunman, but thankfully for the Indian nationals trapped in this perilous situation, they emerged from the café safe and sound. A Triumphant Show of Global Coordination Upon the hostages' safe release, foreign minister Sushma Swaraj triumphantly took to Twitter to express her relief and gratitude, stating that both Indian hostages were \\"safe\\" and that the Indian Consulate kept her informed throughout the ordeal. Her tweet received an outpouring of appreciation from well-wishers and fellow politicians alike, setting an example of successful international cooperation during times of crisis. This incident stands as a testament to the necessity of global solidarity, particularly in distinguishing between innocent civilians and those who wish to do harm. The successful resolution – and the safety of the hostages – following this potentially catastrophic ordeal serves as a beacon of hope for the progress of international coordination in the face of uncertainty. Conclusion The ordeal of the Indian hostages and the critical role of India's foreign minister during this crisis underscore the importance of global collaboration and solidarity. In a world where the threat of violence can come from any corner, the coordinated actions of the governments and brave first responders of both India and Australia conveyed a strong message of dedication to the safety of their citizens. The safe return of the Indian nationals underlines that despite the turmoil that occasionally besets the world, there remains a steadfast commitment to making the world a safer place."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The stepfather bribes Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), an asylum orderly, into forging the signature of the asylum's psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), to have Babydoll lobotomized so she cannot inform the authorities of the true circumstances leading to her sister's death. During her admission to the institution, Babydoll takes note of four items that she would need to attempt an escape. Babydoll slips into a fantasy world in which she is newly arrived in a brothel owned by Blue, whom she envisions as a mobster, where she and the other patients are sex slaves. In this realm, she befriends four other dancersÂ â Amber (Jamie Chung), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (Jena Malone), and Rocket's sister and \\"star of the show\\", Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish).

Then, the reviewer mentions that they have tried different poachers, which shows that they have a basis for comparison and that this particular poacher is not satisfactory in comparison to others. The main complaints about the product highlight its inability to fulfill its primary function: being non-stick. The reviewer states that, even when using spray oil or butter, the poacher still sticks and is challenging to clean.

The final attempt by Sigismund and Władysław to gain the throne was a new campaign launched on 6 April 1617. Władysław was the nominal commander, but it was hetman Chodkiewicz who had actual control over the army. In October, the towns of Dorogobuzh and Vyazma surrendered quickly, recognizing Władysław as the tsar. However, the Commonwealth forces suffered defeats between Vyazma and Mozhaisk, and Chodkiewicz's plans for a counterattack and an advance to Moscow failed. Władysław did not have enough forces to advance to Moscow again, especially because the Russian support for the Poles was all but gone by that time. In response to Władysław's invasion, the burghers of Smolensk revolted against Polish rule, and the Polish troops had to fight their way back as they retreated from the city. However, in 1617 Polish forces, besieged in Smolensk by Russian forces, were relieved by Lisowczycy, when Russian forces retreated to Bely soon after receiving news that Lisowczycy, then commanded by Stanisław Czapiński, had appeared in the area. In 1618 Petro Sahaidachny's campaign against Muscovy resulted in sacking numerous forts such as Putivl, Kursk, Yelets, and others. Together with Chodkiewicz he laid siege to Moscow in September 1618.

He lives in Washington. @jamesoliphant ||||| I'm headed off to a D.C. eating and drinking establishment where I'll join supporters of Obama-Biden 2012 and watch the GOP candidates debate. My preview, with advice and sample lines for the contenders, is here. Starting at 8 p.m. ET, I'll be analyzing the goings-on in this space and tweeting as my funnier, more concise alter ego @daveweigel. John Dickerson will rule the Slate homepage after that with his own analysis. In the meantime, here's Christopher Hitchens discussing Rick Perry's old friend Al Gore. 8:04: Rick Perry's first time at bat goes... perfectly well. He was at unlike Bush as it's genetically possible for him to be, with a happy disarming rebuttal to Brian Williams's charge that Texas has mostly been creating minimum wage jobs. \\"Actually, the first part of that statement is incorrect.\\" 8:07: And it's Perry with the first jab: \\"We created more jobs in the last three months in Texas than he created in four years in Massachusetts.\\" Also true! Also the attack Democrats have been making! 8:10: Romney's attack on Romney was actually meaner than the one I suggested, even if the substance was similiar -- crediting the success of Perry's state to forces beyond his temporal control. It's... not effective. For starters, Perry had to govern through some periods where conservatives lost clout and it was tougher to get votes, like 2009-2011. And it's not a little whiny. 8:13: A little cognitive dissonance there, as the limitations of time and pre-debate research makes it sound like these Republicans are crediting themselves with their states' good job growth. 8:16: One flaw with the Huntsman grand strategy is that independents like all sorts of things. They like lobbyist-bashing and special interest bashing. Ron Paul loves doing that. I see no reason why an angry independent would be happier with Paul than he was with Huntsman. 8:19: Why won't President Obama talk to Herman Cain, as Gingrich demands? The obvious answer: Racism. 8:23: Like I said, I'm watching this from a bar full of Obama supporters. There are some candidates who reduce them to silence, and some whom they talk over. There is dead silence for Perry, mostly silence for Romney, the same level of din for Bachmann, and chatter over everyone else. 8:25: Bachmann wrestles and defeats a total strawman -- who thinks that any of these candidates would simply issue an executive order and call it a day, instead of pushing for PPACA repeal legislation? Her promise to elect 13 Republican senators is needlessly over the top, because a strong argument can be made that most of the bill, which was passed by reconciliation, can be repealed by reconciliation. 8:29: Newt takes my advice, and belittles the media -- which has been insanely charitable to him, given that he last won an election in 1998. 8:33: With Perry in the race, the rationale for Herman Cain being here has completely evaporated. The same philosophy, but less convincing answers -- with less experience to back them up. 8:38: Ah -- the long-awaited (by which I mean \\"awaited for two days\\") Perry-Paul showdown! Perry goes easier than Paul than he could have, because his letter criticized Ronald Reagan's tenure in ways no Republican would dare. 8:45: A mid-speech Ronald Reagan tribute video might actually entice Republicans to stay and sit for Barack Obama's jobs speech. 8:49: For now, Perry elides the Social Security question with a line crafted with care and baked at 400 degrees in a clay oven: \\"I'm not responsible for Karl any more.\\" But there is now video of Perry calling the promise of Social Security a \\"monstrous lie.\\" Fantastic for the GOP primary. Untested in a general election since, what, 1964? 8:52: FreedomWorks's Brendan Steinhauser likes Perry's answer, and tweets: \\"Rick Perry gave a fantastic answer on social security. It sets him apart on entitlements. Good for him.\\" That's a mighty fine noise from a very credible Tea Party group. 8:56: I think you can safely mix a drink or read a chapter of that new James Patterson novel during this Gardisil debate. 9:00: Don't stop Ron Paul, he's rolling. \\"Don't forget,\\" he says, \\"9/11 came about because there was too much government.\\" In a very short amount of time, he denounced, as far as I can tell, all government spending on anything, ever. 9:05: Does anyone else have incredible difficulty recalling what Huntsman says right after he's done saying it? His answers are Obamaesque, vaporous, which is partly a function of the fact that he's not being asked to respond to anyone. 9:09: In 2007, back when voters were actually somewhat interested in immigration, Barack Obama was very good at deflecting questions about it by blaming the Bush administration for fumbling on the border. Which is what Perry just did, on an issue that turns some Republicans into xenophobe lookalikes. Democrats should be getting cold sweats right now. 9:14: Bachmann's habit of leaning on campaign trail anecdotes gets a little strange. Her visit with Cubans at the Bay of Pigs museum tells her... what, exactly, about what an entirely different community of Hispanic voters think about immigration? 9:16: This is the banner image of the email Romney's campaign is sending out to attack Perry. 9:18: I'm suddenly worried about the border fence keeping us in. Good work, Ron Paul. 9:23: Romney's new economic plan has him endorsing cut, cap, and balance. But it was Perry who got to refill his Tea Party credit card by saying he supported it. 9:27: Huntsman regains his footing by taking a sort of lame question about whether we're safer after 9/11 and using it to summarize his (very popular!) America First foreign policy. 9:30: By contrast, Perry doesn't have a concise or credible follow-through on his \\"philosophical statement\\" about war and intervention. His first pointless, meandering answer all night. 9:35: Huntsman shies away from naming who, exactly, is anti-science. If he wanted to punt, he could have said \\"Hey, I was talking about Pawlenty.\\" 9:37: Perry wins the enmity of the liberals in this bar with the line \\"Galileo got out-voted for a spell.\\" 9:43: For an ideas man, Newt Gingrich seems to completely misunderstand the threat of inflation. That said, the reappointment of Ben Bernanke, and the lack of attention to the Fed generally, may go down as the decision that ended the Obama presidency. 9:55: So, what happened? I will assign grades based on how they did for the primary, and how they did for the general. Mitt Romney: B+ (A-). After some early grappling with Perry, he completely avoided attacks from every other candidate. Ron Paul focused on Perry. Santorum focused on Paul and Huntsman. Romney played the exact same game. Rick Perry: B+ (C-). A proud reiteration of his view that Social Security is a \\"Ponzi scheme.\\" A jarringly cold statement of support for the death penalty in Texas, one that he walked into at the beckoning of moderators. There is video here that will scare the hell out of Democrats and construct a textbook general election campaign; that same video will delight Republicans. (The economy's rotten enough that I think Perry could run far right and narrowly win anyway.) Jon Huntsman: D+ (B+). With fairly sympathetic questions, and a much tighter set of responses than he brought at the last debate, he reaffirmed that he will be all things to swing voters, the Republican that Democrats can stand. If I'm a standard Republican primary voter, I hate him with the heat of 1,000 suns. Ron Paul: B (D+). I'm still stuck on the concept of a fence that could trap Americans inside the country for... some reason. With more time to explore ideas, Paul gets to deliver the best red meat conservative lines and the weirdest discursions. The more independents learn about the latter views, the less adorable he seems. Michele Bachmann: B- (N/A). Hate to agree with the conventional wisdom, but unless something torpedoes Perry, she's no longer a factor in the race. The mannered efforts to pretend that some congressional battles have given her all the experience she needs to serve are just unbearably weak with three governors onstage. Herman Cain: C+ (N/A). Just kind of a mess, with a tax plan that he didn't have time to explain fully. Rick Santorum: B (N/A). What purpose is served when Rick Santorum walks onto this stage? I guess it's a nice comment on neoconservatives that the only guy left who runs on their agenda is an embittered stunt candidate, but it gets old after five or six seconds. Newt Gingrich: B+ (N/A). He's just fighting for a legacy and the possibility that he'll be remembered fondly by the others when he leaves. He needs to re-establish the political and economic credibility he had before getting into this. By that standard, he did fine, although nothing he said will be particularly relevant to the rest of us. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"In this news article, the author analyzes the performances of the GOP candidates during a debate. Rick Perry and Mitt Romney receive B+ grades for their primary performances, but Perry receives a lower C- grade for the general, reflecting some controversial statements on Social Security and the death penalty that might not appeal to Democratic and Independent voters. Jon Huntsman gets a D+ for the primary but a B+ for the general, while Ron Paul, Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Rick Santorum, and Newt Gingrich receive varied grades without much potential impact on the general election. The author highlights that while certain performances might please Republican primary voters, they might not necessarily translate well into a general election campaign."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Crewman Boyer begs him to wait for the captain, Commander Josh Rice, still topside, but White refuses, and Rice (his good friend) and the quartermaster are lost. When they resurface shortly afterward, they discover that the war is over. No one other than Boyer, not even the captain's widow and father, blames him.

Following her back to Africa, he and his aging, unhappy wife June (Coleen Gray) witness a secret ceremony of the Nando tribe that utilizes orchid pollen and a male victim's pineal gland secretions extracted from the back of the neck via a special ring to temporarily transform Malla once more into a young and beautiful girl (Kim Hamilton). After discovering her conniving husband only brought her along as a test subject, June has him killed as a sacrifice and becomes young herself, though she is warned that it will not last long. She steals the ring and escapes back to the United States after killing another man.

Here is a news article: Image copyright Getty Images A court in Australia has accepted an unsent, draft text message on a dead man's mobile phone as an official will. The 55-year-old man had composed a text message addressed to his brother, in which he gave \\"all that I have\\" to his brother and nephew. The message was found in the drafts folder on the man's phone after he took his own life last year . Brisbane Supreme Court ruled that the wording of the text indicated that the man intended it to act as his will. In the message, the man gave details of how to access his bank account and where he had hidden money in his house. \\"Put my ashes in the back garden,\\" he wrote. \\"A bit of cash behind TV and a bit in the bank.\\" According to ABC News, the man's wife applied to manage his assets and argued that the text message was not valid as a will because it was never sent. Typically, for a will to be valid in Queensland, it must be written and signed by two witnesses. Justice Susan Brown said the wording of the text message, which ended with the words \\"my will\\", showed that the man intended it to act as his will. \\"The reference to his house and superannuation and his specification that the applicant was to take her own things indicates he was aware of the nature and extent of his estate, which was relatively small,\\" she said. She said the \\"informal nature\\" of the message did not stop it representing the man's intentions, especially as it was \\"created on or about the time that the deceased was contemplating death, such that he even indicated where he wanted his ashes to be placed\\". Validity of wills In 2006, the law in Queensland was changed to allow less formal types of documents to be considered as a will. Another unusual will accepted in Queensland includes a DVD marked with \\"my will\\", in 2013. The UK's Law Commission is currently fielding a public consultation on the legal rules applying to wills. The proposals listed by the body includes giving courts the capacity to \\"dispense with the formalities for a will where it's clear what the deceased wanted\\". ||||| Unsent text on mobile counts as a will, Queensland court finds Updated A Queensland court has accepted a dead man's unsent, draft text message leaving his possessions to his brother and nephew instead of his wife and son, as an official will. The Supreme Court in Brisbane heard the 55-year-old took his own life in October 2016, after composing a text addressed to his brother, which indicated his brother and nephew should \\"keep all that I have\\", because he was unhappy with this wife. A friend found the text message in the drafts folder of the man's mobile phone, which was found near his body. The unsent message detailed how to access the man's bank account details and where he wanted his ashes to be buried. \\"You and [nephew] keep all that I have house and superannuation, put my ashes in the back garden … [wife] will take her stuff only she's ok gone back to her ex AGAIN I'm beaten. A bit of cash behind TV and a bit in the bank Cash card pin … My will\\" In Queensland, if a person dies without a valid will their next of kin, such as a spouse, takes on the role of managing the deceased's estate. The Queensland Government's website says for a will to be valid, it must be in writing and \\"signed by you in front of two witnesses, both of whom must be over 18 years old, cannot be visually impaired and should not be included as beneficiaries in the will.\\" The man's wife applied to the Supreme Court to manage her late husband's assets, arguing the text message was not final because it was never sent. But in her decision, Justice Susan Brown said the wording of the text, including the use of the words \\"my will\\" indicated the man knew what he was doing. \\"The reference to his house and superannuation and his specification that the applicant was to take her own things indicates he was aware of the nature and extent of his estate, which was relatively small,\\" she said. \\"Since the respondents stand to benefit if the text message is treated as a will, I have treated their evidence with caution and weighed it against all of the evidence.\\" Justice Brown also found the man had no relationship with his son and while he and his wife did have happy times, there was evidence they had a \\"rocky\\" relationship. \\"The deceased and the applicant had difficulties in their relationship and had separated on a number of occasions for short periods of time, the most recent occasion being just days before the deceased took his own life,\\" Justice Brown said. Law changed in 2006 Queensland Law Society president and succession law specialist Christine Smyth said the law was changed in 2006 to allow for less formal types of documents to be accepted as wills. \\"It used to be the case that if you did not strictly comply with the legislation as to the drawing of a will, it would not be considered a will,\\" she said. Ms Smyth said while it was accepted in this case, writing a will in a text message was \\"absolutely not\\" recommended. \\"As you read through this case, you get a sense of the amount of evidence that has to be produced to satisfy a court,\\" she said. \\"If a person hasn't drawn a formal will, there are some significant hurdles which must be overcome to establish that the document that looks like a will, is in fact, a will.\\" Topics: law-crime-and-justice, courts-and-trials, death, suicide, community-and-society, mobile-phones, qld First posted ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"An unsent text message found as a draft on a deceased man's mobile phone has been accepted as an official will by a court in Australia.

Here is a question about this article: UN aerial reconnaissance had difficulty sighting PVA units in daytime, because their march and bivouac discipline minimized aerial detection. The PVA marched \\"dark-to-dark\\" (19:00–03:00), and aerial camouflage (concealing soldiers, pack animals, and equipment) was deployed by 05:30. Meanwhile, daylight advance parties scouted for the next bivouac site. During daylight activity or marching, soldiers were to remain motionless if an aircraft appeared, until it flew away; PVA officers were under order to shoot security violators. Such battlefield discipline allowed a three-division army to march the 286 miles (460 km) from An-tung, Manchuria, to the combat zone in some 19 days. Another division night-marched a circuitous mountain route, averaging 18 miles (29 km) daily for 18 days.

Giffords is currently in intensive care after a shooting that left six dead and 14 injured. \\"Gabby did tell me that she was concerned,\\" Moran said. \\"She did say it's really bad out there, particularly in a district like [hers]. She was very much troubled that Sarah Palin put her in the crosshairs.\\" Moran said Giffords explained that, unlike in his Northern Virginia district, \\"a substantial percentage\\" of her district was \\"anti-government and pro-gun\\" --- a potentially dangerous mix. Palin's \\"Take Back the 20\\" campaign came under renewed fire after Saturday's deadly shooting. The 2010 midterm election campaign featured a map with crosshairs over Giffords' district, along with the districts of 19 other Democratic lawmakers who voted for the health-care bill. After posting the map on her Facebook page, Palin told her Twitter followers to go there with the message \\"Don't Retreat -- Instead RELOAD!\\" At the time, Palin was accused of using unnecessarily violent rhetoric. (This weekend, the map was taken offline.) \\"We never ever, ever intended it to be gun sights,\\" said Rebecca Mansour, who works for Palin's political action committee, in a interview with conservative radio host Tammy Bruce. \\"It's a surveyor's symbol,\\" Bruce suggested. Mansour agreed, adding that the graphic was contracted out to a professional and approved without much thought. \\"We never imagined, it never occurred to us that anybody would consider it violent,\\" she said. It was simply \\"crosshairs that you would see on a map.\\" There is \\"nothing irresponsible about our graphic,\\" Mansour added. Giffords herself criticized the target map when her office was vandalized last year. \\"For example, we're on Sarah Palin's targeted list, but the thing is, that the way that she has it depicted has the crosshairs of a gun sight over our district. When people do that, they have to realize that there are consequences to that action,\\" Giffords said in an interview with MSNBC. There is a surveyor's symbol that resembles the circle used on Palin's map. (You can see it on the lower right-hand side of this U.S. Geological Survey guide to topographical map symbols). However, Palin herself referred to the targets as a \\"'bullseye' icon\\" in a post-election tweet. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"This article talks about Sarah Palin's controversial campaign target map, which had circles over certain districts. Some people thought these circles looked like gun sights. However, Palin's aide said they were never meant to be gun sights. The map was criticized after a shooting happened in one of the districts on the map. Sarah Palin and her team defended the map and said they never intended for it to be seen as violent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Spain and Italy participated in a global warming global forum this year. it turns out that Spain uses lots of fossil fuel and natural gas for their economy, while Italy relies on ecological alternatives. Hint: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.

Combine like terms on the left side of the equation. We have 2208*r and 1120*r, which both have the variable r. 2208*r + 1120*r = 3328*r So, now the equation is: 3328*r - 12432 = 40816 2. Add 12432 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable (3328*r). 3328*r - 12432 + 12432 = 40816 + 12432 3328*r = 53248 3.

Options: - demonstration - concert - garage - bus stop - synagogue Answer:","completion":"A person might wear his yarmulke when going to a synagogue. A yarmulke, also known as a kippah, is a small, round skullcap worn by Jewish males to signify their devotion and reverence for God. Wearing a yarmulke is traditional and an important part of the Jewish faith, serving as a reminder of the individual's connection with their Creator. A synagogue is the most appropriate place where a person might wear his yarmulke, as it is a Jewish place of worship and community gathering. Synagogues serve many functions, such as a venue for prayer services, religious study, and lifecycle events. In a synagogue, individuals come together to express their shared faith within a setting that is both religious and communal. Wearing a yarmulke in a synagogue demonstrates a commitment to the Jewish faith and adherence to religious customs. Although some Jewish people choose to wear their yarmulkes throughout the day, it is not necessary to do so in places unrelated to religious practice, unless one follows a strict observance of Jewish law. Wearing a yarmulke to a demonstration, concert, garage, or bus stop might not be considered as significant or respectful as wearing one in the context of a religious gathering or ceremony. In summary, one might wear a yarmulke when going to a synagogue, as it is a Jewish place of worship and observance, and represents the commitment of an individual to their relationship with God within their faith."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In Qushayri's words, Moses came like thousands of men who traveled great distances, and there was nothing left to Moses of Moses. In that state of annihilation from himself, Moses was granted the unveiling of the realities. From the Sufi point of view, God is the always the beloved and the wayfarer's longing and suffering lead to realization of the truths.\\" Answer:","completion":"In the given context, it is Qushayri who said that \\"there was nothing left to Moses of Moses.\\" Al-Qushayri, a prominent Persian Sufi theologian, commented on the story of Moses in verse 7:143. He emphasized the importance of self-annihilation (fana) in the spiritual journey of a Sufi and illustrated it through the experience of Moses when he asked for a vision of God. In the story, although Moses' desire to see God was denied, he was deeply affected by God's manifestation upon the mountain. The mountain crumbled, and Moses fainted due to the intensity of this experience. Qushayri used this event to explain that Moses had to let go of his own self (ego) in order to truly experience a direct connection with God. This profound state of self-annihilation led to the unveiling of the deeper spiritual realities. From the Sufi perspective, God is always considered the ultimate Beloved, and the seeker's (wayfarer's) longing and suffering in their spiritual journey are essential for the realization of the divine truths."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This station is likely one of the Stations of the Cross depicted in the church. In the context of the Stations of the Cross, also known as the Way of the Cross or Via Crucis, these are a series of images or sculptures representing certain scenes from the Passion of Jesus Christ, particularly his journey to Calvary and his crucifixion. The Stations of the Cross are typically found in Christian churches and are used by the faithful during special liturgical seasons, such as Lent and Holy Week, to meditate and contemplate on the suffering and sacrifice of Jesus for the redemption of humanity. There are traditionally 14 stations, though some churches may have additional ones; some churches also use the Scriptural Way of the Cross introduced by Pope John Paul II in 1991, which has slightly different stations based on the Gospel accounts. The 14 traditional Stations of the Cross are as follows: 1. Jesus is condemned to death 2. Jesus carries his cross 3. Jesus falls for the first time 4. Jesus meets his mother 5. Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus carry the cross 6. Veronica wipes the face of Jesus 7. Jesus falls for the second time 8. Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem 9. Jesus falls for the third time 10. Jesus is stripped of his garments (Station X) 11. Jesus is nailed to the cross 12. Jesus dies on the cross 13. Jesus is taken down from the cross 14. Jesus is laid in the tomb Thus, according to the given information, when entering the church and navigating to the area where the Stations of the Cross are displayed, one must turn right and climb the narrow staircase to find Station X, which is where Jesus was stripped of his garments. This particular station is a poignant and powerful reminder of the humiliation and vulnerability Jesus experienced during his journey to the cross, as well as an opportunity for the faithful to reflect on their own journey of sacrificial love, self-giving, and solidarity with the suffering of others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Determine the connection of each subject to the biosphere. - The Gaia hypothesis is directly related to the biosphere as it states that the biosphere is its own living organism and tends to achieve a stable state, known as homeostasis. - Einstein's Theory of Relativity is not directly related to the biosphere as it deals with the physics of space and time, not the Earth's life-supporting systems. Step 3: Compare their subjects of study in relation to the biosphere. - Paul's subject of study (the Gaia hypothesis) focuses on the biosphere, while Dean's subject of study (Einstein's Theory of Relativity) does not have a direct connection with the biosphere. Conclusion: Based on their subjects of study, Dean studied less about the biosphere compared to Paul, who was specifically studying about it through the Gaia hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Abstract: Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by somatic cell reprogramming involves global epigenetic remodelling. Whereas several proteins are known to regulate chromatin marks associated with the distinct epigenetic states of cells before and after reprogramming, the role of specific chromatin-modifying enzymes in reprogramming remains to be determined. To address how chromatin-modifying proteins influence reprogramming, we used short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to target genes in DNA and histone methylation pathways, and identified positive and negative modulators of iPSC generation. Whereas inhibition of the core components of the polycomb repressive complex 1 and 2, including the histone 3 lysine 27 methyltransferase EZH2, reduced reprogramming efficiency, suppression of SUV39H1, YY1 and DOT1L enhanced reprogramming. Specifically, inhibition of the H3K79 histone methyltransferase DOT1L by shRNA or a small molecule accelerated reprogramming, significantly increased the yield of iPSC colonies, and substituted for KLF4 and c-Myc (also known as MYC). Inhibition of DOT1L early in the reprogramming process is associated with a marked increase in two alternative factors, NANOG and LIN28, which play essential functional roles in the enhancement of reprogramming. Genome-wide analysis of H3K79me2 distribution revealed that fibroblast-specific genes associated with the epithelial to mesenchymal transition lose H3K79me2 in the initial phases of reprogramming. DOT1L inhibition facilitates the loss of this mark from genes that are fated to be repressed in the pluripotent state. These findings implicate specific chromatin-modifying enzymes as barriers to or facilitators of reprogramming, and demonstrate how modulation of chromatin-modifying enzymes can be exploited to more efficiently generate iPSCs with fewer exogenous transcription factors.. Title: Chromatin modifying enzymes as modulators of reprogramming A:","completion":"Part 1: Identify the abstract of an article.

Context: Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, written in the early 14th century, merged a medieval world view with classical ideals. Another promoter of the Italian language was Boccaccio with his Decameron. The application of the vernacular did not entail a rejection of Latin, and both Dante and Boccaccio wrote prolifically in Latin as well as Italian, as would Petrarch later (whose Canzoniere also promoted the vernacular and whose contents are considered the first modern lyric poems). Together the three poets established the Tuscan dialect as the norm for the modern Italian language. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Dante wrote the 'Divine Comedy'.

Context: The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a 1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Before you approach your parents with your wish to move, think about what your motivation is. Not only can this help you flesh out your feelings, but also help you more convincingly make your case to your parents. Write down your reasons for wanting to move. For example, you can have things like “better educational opportunities for me and job chances for dad,” or it could be something like “the house is too big for mom to care for.” It also helps if you have relatives where you are planning to move, with something like \\"closer to grandma and grandpa.\\" Consider keeping a list of pros and cons for moving. Think about factors such as expenses, losing friends, gaining new opportunities or helping shoulder burdens. Try and not spring on your parents immediately that you want to move. Take time to plant the seed at the right moments once you’ve had a chance to write out your own motivations. Avoid being pushy. At times that are not rushed, mention that moving might make life a little better or easier. For example, you could say “mom, maybe we both wouldn't be so frantic to leave every morning if we didn't live so far from school\\" or “dad, maybe you’d have more energy if you didn’t have such a large space to care for.” Point out potential new places when you’re out. For example, say to your mom and dad when you’re headed to the grocery store, “wow, look at everything in this neighborhood: schools, stores, restaurants, and it’s so much closer to your jobs.” You can also say “wow, this assisted living facility has so many amenities and is really close to our house.” Once you’ve planted the seed that you want to move, your parents will likely start to get the message. Researching potential options before your parents start asking questions about your motivation and where you want to move can help you make a more convincing case. Go online for places you might like to live or move. Use these as a part of the hints you subtly drop hints. Keep in mind elements such as finances when you’re searching. You may not be aware of your parents’ financial situation and how your suggestions affect them emotionally and possibly financially. Research new places to live at a variety of price points. Keep notes on different places so that you can convincingly present them. For example, if you want to move to a different city, you could include things like the standard cost of housing and living, the overall health profile of the place, and the advantages it presents to you over the current place you live. The next time a parent shows stress about the house, suggest moving. Let this stimulate an open discussion about your desire to move and the practicability of it. Have the discussion when you’re less likely to be interrupted. Start the conversation with your observations and concerns about staying and the reasons you would like your parents to consider moving. Let them know you are serious, but try and keep the conversation as honest and positive as possible. For example, you can say “I’m really interested in pursuing my interest in science and the school in New York has much better opportunities for me to do this,” or “I’m being bullied at school and feel like an outcast.” Likewise, you can say “mom, I think it’s a good idea to move so that you have a built-in community and help whenever you might need it.” Suggest that your parents talk to your friends, colleagues, or teachers about your wishes. This may help them better understand that your position is serious. After you’ve had the discussion with your parents about moving, wait and let them think about moving. Remember that moving doesn’t happen overnight and may require that your parents take time to consider the pros and cons for them and your entire family. Put yourself in your parents’ shoes and be sensitive. As they consider your wishes, keep in mind how it affects your parents. Although moving might be great for you, it can put financial and emotional stress on your parents. Stay away from pushing the idea on your parents once you’ve discussed your wishes. This may annoy or stress them and could end up in them dismissing the idea altogether. No matter what your parents decide about moving, respect the decision they reach. There may be factors about which you are unaware that influence your parents’ decision and nagging them may have negative consequences for you. Offer to help your parents in any way you can if they decide to move. Keep your parents in the loop about your feelings if the motivation for wanting to move is issues at school. Talking about problems with them may help. Revisit the issue in the future if your parents said they weren’t sure or wanted some more time to think about it.

Question: Plants can grow as much as 50 percent faster in concentrations of 1,000 ppm CO2 when compared with ambient conditions, though this assumes no change in climate and no limitation on other nutrients. Elevated CO2 levels cause increased growth reflected in the harvestable yield of crops, with wheat, rice and soybean all showing increases in yield of 12–14% under elevated CO2 in FACE experiments.Increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations result in fewer stomata developing on plants which leads to reduced water usage and increased water-use efficiency. Studies using FACE have shown that CO2 enrichment leads to decreased concentrations of micronutrients in crop plants. This may have knock-on effects on other parts of ecosystems as herbivores will need to eat more food to gain the same amount of protein.The concentration of secondary metabolites such as phenylpropanoids and flavonoids Jerry and Gary each live in separate cities, but both run equally sized farms that grow the same produce.

Q:I can use this background: A dilution effect is seen when animals living in a group \\"dilute\\" their risk of attack, each individual being just one of many in the group. George C. Williams and W.D. Hamilton proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the shoaling of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual attack rate seen with group living, for example in Camargue horses in Southern France. The horse-fly often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently. Water striders are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the attack rate per individual water strider decreases as group size increases. Now, I have a new situation: Mike was visiting the African Savannah. One animal that interested him most was the African Buffalo. He noticed that the buffaloes would usually live in a large herd, often exceeding few hundreds. He noted that as case A. But sometimes the buffaloes would live in a small herd. He noted that as case B. Interestingly, there are incidents when an aggressive male buffalo would live by itself. He noted that as case C. Answer this question please: In which case the group would get less benefit as a whole, case A or case B? A:","completion":"In order to answer this question, let's consider the dilution effect and its impact on the risk faced by the African Buffaloes in case A and case B. Case A (Large Herd): In a large herd, the buffaloes will \\"dilute\\" their risk of attack, as each individual is just one out of many. The large group size will reduce the probability of any individual buffalo being targeted, hence, providing a greater benefit to each individual member. However, the group as a whole may become more conspicuous and attract more attention from predators. Case B (Small Herd): In a small herd, the dilution effect will be weaker, as the risk of attack won't be distributed among as many members. The group would be less conspicuous, but an individual buffalo's chance of being targeted by predators would be relatively higher in comparison to a larger herd. Based on the dilution effect, less benefit to a group as a whole is observed in case B (Small Herd) compared to case A (Large Herd). The reason for this is that a larger herd (case A) provides greater protection to its individual members through risk dilution, while a smaller herd (case B) offers less protection to the individual members due to the weaker dilution effect."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The smallest of the bunch have lower or higher boiling points? Text: Larger alkenes have lower boiling and melting points, so they are liquids or waxy solids at room temperature. The answer is:","completion":"Based on the given text, the smallest of the bunch of alkenes would have higher boiling points. The text states that \\"Larger alkenes have lower boiling and melting points\\", which implies that smaller alkenes would exhibit the opposite behavior, meaning they would have higher boiling points in comparison to their larger counterparts. To provide further context, alkenes are a group of organic compounds consisting of carbon and hydrogen atoms, with at least one carbon-carbon double bond. The size of the alkene refers to the number of carbon atoms in its structure. As the alkene's size, or carbon chain length, increases, the boiling and melting points decrease. This is due to the relatively weaker London dispersion forces acting between the larger molecules, which require less energy to separate from one another. Conversely, smaller alkenes have stronger intermolecular forces, so they need more energy to overcome these forces, resulting in higher boiling points. In conclusion, when Harry was sorting the alkenes, the smallest alkenes within the bunch would have higher boiling points than the larger alkenes. This contrasting behavior is due to the differences in intermolecular forces acting on the alkenes - smaller alkenes have stronger forces that require more energy to overcome, leading to higher boiling points."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Secondly, the critic uses the term \\"drama about old age and grief.\\" While this does not inherently suggest a positive or negative opinion, it gives us an idea of the movie’s thematic focus. In order to reference the themes directly, the critic likely appreciated the thoughtful or sensitive exploration of these subjects. Lastly, the critic’s mention of a \\"tour de force performance by Michel Piccoli\\" is a high praise. A \\"tour de force\\" refers to an impressive performance or achievement that has been accomplished with great skill. Saying this about Michel Piccoli means that the critic thinks highly of his acting in this film. They believe that his performance was skillfully done and remarkably powerful. Each of these positive aspects—the evocative nature of the movie, its exploration of heavy themes, and Michel Piccoli's powerful performance—contributed to the overall positive impression that the critic gathered from the film. Hence, we can confidently suggest that the critic did indeed think positively of the movie. This constructive analysis, however, does not indicate any negative perspectives. If the critic had any criticisms, they have not shared it in this truncated review. Therefore, based on the given information, it can be assumed that the critic viewed the movie very favorably."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This has sparked a debate on the impact of early exposure to violence and the potential effect on teenage minds as well as the adequacy of the criminal justice system in dealing with juvenile offenders. Background of the Case: (Step 2: Provide details about the case) The two girls, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were found guilty of torturing and murdering a vulnerable woman. The victim, a 39-year-old woman, was found dead in her home with multiple injuries inflicted by a variety of weapons, including a wooden stick and a television set. The trial revealed that the girls had subjected the woman to a prolonged and brutal assault before eventually killing her. The Motive: (Step 3: Discuss possible motives) While the specific motives behind the horrifying act remain unclear, evidence suggested that the teenagers spiraled into violence without any clear or conceivable motive. Factors such as mental health, substance abuse, and a possible history of neglect and trauma were taken into consideration during the trial, hinting at complex and interlinked reasons for their actions. The Sentencing: (Step 4: Explain the reasoning behind the sentencing) Considering the brutal nature of the crime and the age of the perpetrators, the judge handed down life sentences with a minimum term of 15 years for both girls. The judge cited that their young age was considered as a mitigating factor, while the egregiousness of their actions justified the harsh sentence. However, this decision has attracted criticism, with some arguing that the sentence is too harsh for juveniles, while others maintain that the punishment should act as a deterrent to other potential offenders. Impact on Society and Legal System: (Step 5: Discuss the implications of the case for society and the legal system) The case has raised questions about how society and the legal system handle juvenile offenders and address the root causes of violent crime among young people. Some argue that punitive measures alone will not suffice to address the problem and that greater emphasis must be placed on preventive measures such as early intervention, mental health support, and rehabilitation programs. Conclusion: (Step 6: Summarize the main points and provide a closing remark) The tragic case of these two teenage girls serves as a stark reminder of the potential dangers lurking within the minds of troubled youth and calls for a reevaluation of our approach to juvenile crime. Greater focus must be placed on understanding the complex motivations behind such heinous acts and providing appropriate support to prevent young lives from being lost to a cycle of violence. Only by addressing these underlying issues can we hope to create a safer and more compassionate society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He died two years after his museum opened to the public in January 1974 in a new building modeled on an ancient Roman luxury home. It was not until after Getty’s death in June 1976 that he returned from his estate in England to his “ranch” on the Pacific Coast: he is buried there at the edge of the property on a private plot overlooking the ocean, alongside his eldest and youngest sons, George and Timothy, both of whom predeceased him. Following a renovation and reinstallation of the galleries, the Getty Villa opens a new chapter in its history. Although Getty never set eyes on his creation, the story of how he built the Villa and assembled his collection pervades the galleries even today. A suite of revamped rooms—Galleries 105 to 108—share this history. Featuring ancient works of art Getty bought himself along with archival documents, the new displays place the objects in their cultural contexts and shed light on Getty’s personal relationship to his museum and final resting place. From a Ranch House to an Ancient Villa Getty bought the 64-acre ranch—once part of the Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, an early-nineteenth-century 6,656-acre Mexican land grant—just after the end of World War II, intending it as a weekend retreat where his fifth wife Theodora (“Teddy”) could ride horses and he could display his growing art collection. He knew the area well, for he already owned a small house on the beach in nearby Santa Monica, just steps from the sprawling complex his friend and rival collector William Randolph Hearst had built for the actress Marion Davies. (The Davies estate is now the Annenberg Community Beach House, while Getty’s beach house has been replaced by a large modern condo complex, 270 Palisades Beach Road.)

At the time of the transfer of power, the state of Jammu and Kashmir (widely called \\"Kashmir\\") was ruled by Maharaja Hari Singh, a Hindu, although the state itself had a Muslim majority. Hari Singh was equally hesitant about acceding to either India or Pakistan, as either would have provoked adverse reactions in parts of his kingdom. He signed a Standstill Agreement with Pakistan and proposed one with India as well, but announced that Kashmir intended to remain independent. However, his rule was opposed by Sheikh Abdullah, the popular leader of Kashmir's largest political party, the National Conference, who demanded his abdication.Pakistan, attempting to force the issue of Kashmir's accession, cut off supplies and transport links. The chaos in Punjab resulting from Partition had also severed transport links with India, meaning that Kashmir's only links with the two dominions was by air. Rumours about atrocities against the Muslim population of Poonch by the Maharajah's forces caused the outbreak of civil unrest. Shortly thereafter, Pathan tribesmen from the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan crossed the border and entered Kashmir. The invaders made rapid progress towards Srinagar. The Maharaja of Kashmir wrote to India, asking for military assistance. India required the signing of an Instrument of Accession and setting up an interim government headed by Sheikh Abdullah in return. The Maharaja complied, but Nehru declared that it would have to be confirmed by a plebiscite, although there was no legal requirement to seek such confirmation.Indian troops secured Jammu, Srinagar and the valley itself during the First Kashmir War, but the intense fighting flagged with the onset of winter, which made much of the state impassable.

Losman were unstoppable in the first quarter, connecting for 205 yards and two 83-yard touchdowns. Evans' first-quarter performance was a Buffalo record for a period and just shy of the NFL record for yards receiving in a quarter of 210 by Baltimore's Qadry Ismail in 1999. The first touchdown came after Nate Clements' interception on the third play of the game. Both were after Evans got in front of Texans cornerback Demarcus Faggins for the easy score. The 83-yard TDs were career highs for both Losman and Evans and marked the first time in franchise history the Bills have had two 80-yard passes in a single game. David Carr opened 1 for 3 with an interception on his first pass before completing his next 22 throws. Carr finished 25 of 30 for 223 yards and no touchdowns. Carr tied the record held by Mark Brunell, who had 22 consecutive completions in Washington's 31-15 win over the Texans at Reliant Stadium on September 24. He tied Brunell's record on a short pass to Wali Lundy for no gain with 6:19 left. The streak was broken when his pass to Andre Johnson with 5:44 remaining fell short. Lundy cut the lead to 14-7 with a 17-yard run in the first quarter. That score was set up by a 17-yard reception by Eric Moulds on third-and-8. Samkon Gado made it 17-14 on a 1-yard run in the second quarter. Moulds also had a key third-down reception on that drive. Dunta Robinson gave the Texans the lead on a 9-yard interception return midway through the third quarter. Losman was throwing out of the end zone when Robinson intercepted the pass intended for Evans to score his first career touchdown and the Texans' first defensive touchdown since 2004. But after the offense failed to put the game away in the fourth quarter the Texans gave the Bills just enough time to beat them. Losman hit a diving Peerless Price in the back of the end zone for the 15-yard touchdown with 13 seconds left, giving Buffalo the 24-21 win.

Question: Why does Jessica take off her cross? Movie plot title: The Thing That Couldn't Die Movie plot: A young woman named Jessica Burns (Carolyn Kearney), who claims to have psychic powers, lives on a remote ranch with her Aunt Flavia (Peggy Converse). She discovers an ancient box while water-witching and her Aunt takes it back to their house. Her boyfriend, Gordon (William Reynolds), goes for an archaeologist, arguing the box should be kept intact for appraisal and opening by an expert. However, the Aunt's greedy ranch foreman, anticipating treasure, secretly convinces the slow-witted handyman to break it open. Instead, the box contains the intact head of Gideon Drew (Robin Hughes), a man executed for sorcery 400 years earlier. The head awakens and telepathically takes over the mentally vulnerable handyman. After murdering the foreman, the head has the handyman conceal it while arranging to have a coffin retrieved containing Gideon's body. After the handyman helps the head take control of a young woman (Andra Martin) staying at the ranch, it drives him to approach police in a threatening manner holding the knife that killed the foreman. The police had arrived to investigate the theft of the box's remains and the blood left behind from the killing of the foreman. Failing to stop, the handyman died in a hail of police bullets. Once his head and body are joined, Gideon will be fully able to exercise his powers over all comers. The young woman is aware of the evil and is protected from the head's influence by an ancient cross she wears around her neck, but when her boyfriend removes it, to make a cast so its historical value could be appraised, the head takes control of her mind. So, ironically, though the guest under control of the head was unable to remove it, Jessica was put in harms way by her protector. Jessica then helps find the head's body, previously being against doing so since they only wished to make money out of it as well as fear that it was an evil business. The young woman joins head to body and Gideon arises from his coffin, but the boyfriend, aware of the error of his ways, catches the monster...

Day initially lived a bohemian lifestyle before gaining fame as a social activist after her conversion. She later became a key figure in the Catholic Worker Movement and earned a national reputation as a political radical, perhaps the most famous radical in American Catholic Church history. Day encountered anarchism while studying in university. She read The Bomb by Frank Harris, a fictionalized biography of one of the Haymarket anarchists. She discussed anarchy and extreme poverty with Peter Kropotkin. After moving to New York, Day studied the anarchism of Emma Goldman and attended the Anarchists Ball at Webster Hall. Day was saddened by the executions of the anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti in 1927. She wrote that when they died, \\"All the nation mourned.\\" As a Catholic, she felt a sense of solidarity with them, specifically \\"the very sense of solidarity which made me gradually understand the doctrine of the Mystical Body of Christ whereby we are all members of one another.\\" Discussing the term anarchism, she wrote: \\"We ourselves have never hesitated to use the word.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: With the exception of the opening and final scenes, which depict the 1941 suicide by drowning of Virginia Woolf in the River Ouse, the action takes place within the span of a single day in three different years and alternates between them throughout the film. In 1923, Virginia has begun writing the book Mrs Dalloway in her home in the town of Richmond outside London. In 1951, troubled Los Angeles housewife Laura Brown escapes from her conventional life by reading Mrs Dalloway. In 2001, New Yorker Clarissa Vaughan is the embodiment of the novel's title character, as she spends the day preparing for a party she is hosting in honor of her former lover and friend Richard, a poet and author living with AIDS who is to receive a major literary award. Richard tells Clarissa he has stayed alive for her sake, and the award is meaningless because he didn't get it sooner, until he was on the brink of death. She tells him she believes he would have won the award regardless of his illness. Richard often refers to Clarissa as \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" - her namesake - because she distracts herself from her own life the way the Woolf character does. Virginia, who has experienced several nervous breakdowns and suffers from bipolar disorder, feels trapped in her home. She is intimidated by servants and constantly under the eye of her husband, Leonard, who has begun a publishing business, Hogarth Press, at home to stay close to her. Virginia both welcomes and dreads an afternoon visit from her sister Vanessa and her children. After their departure, Virginia flees to the railway station, where she is awaiting a train to central London, when Leonard arrives to bring her home. He tells her how he lives in constant fear that she will take her own life. She says she fears it also but argues that if she is to live, she has the right to decide how and where.

Given those answer options, answer the question: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid. Question: Why did Barend's shadow caught the narrator's eye? === The answer to the above question is A:","completion":"The narrator found Barend's shadow to be incredibly attractive and unique, like a piece of art. The specific set of properties that made this ordinary shadow so extraordinary cannot be put into words, but it captivated the narrator, leading them to become friends with Barend."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Information: - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Local government is a form of public administration which, in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state. The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions. - A metropolitan borough is a type of local government district in England, and is a subdivision of a metropolitan county. Created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, metropolitan boroughs are defined in English law as metropolitan districts. However, all of them have been granted or regranted royal charters to give them borough status (as well as, in some cases, city status). Metropolitan boroughs have been effectively unitary authority areas since the abolition of the metropolitan county councils by the Local Government Act 1985. However, metropolitan boroughs pool much of their authority in joint boards and other arrangements that cover whole metropolitan counties, such as combined authorities. - New Guinea (or, historically, \\"\\") is a large Island in the South West Pacific region. - In computing, WinG (pronounced \\"Win Gee\\") is an application programming interface that is a port of Windows 95's Device Independent Bitmaps to provide faster graphics performance on Windows 3.x operating environments, and was initially positioned as a way to help game developers more easily port their DOS games to Microsoft Windows, although it was quickly discontinued in favor of DirectX. - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. - Sir George Hamilton Kenrick FRES ( 1850 -- 28 May 1939 ) was an English entomologist who specialised in Lepidoptera especially those of New Guinea and he was a councillor in Birmingham . - Birmingham is a major city and metropolitan borough of West Midlands, England. It is the largest and most populous British city outside London, with a population in 2014 of 1,101,360. The city is in the West Midlands Built-up Area, the third most populous urban area in the United Kingdom, with a population of 2,440,986 at the 2011 census. Birmingham's metropolitan area is the second most populous in the UK with a population of 3.8 million. This also makes Birmingham the 9th most populous metropolitan area in Europe. - Moths comprise a group of insects related to butterflies, belonging to the order Lepidoptera. Most lepidopterans are moths; and there are thought to be approximately 160,000 species of moth, many of which are yet to be described. Most species of moth are nocturnal, but there are also crepuscular and diurnal species. - The Lepidoptera is an order of insects that includes moths and butterflies (both called lepidopterans). 180,000 species of Lepidoptera are described, in 126 families and 46 superfamilies, 10% of the total described species of living organisms. It is one of the most widespread and widely recognizable insect orders in the world. The term was coined by Linnaeus in 1735 and is derived from Ancient Greek (scale) and (wing). The Lepidoptera show many variations of the basic body structure that have evolved to gain advantages in lifestyle and distribution. Recent estimates suggest the order may have more species than earlier thought, and is among the four most speciose orders, along with the Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Coleoptera. - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans. - A Councillor is a member of a local government council. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What did the company that toured the United States in 1984 produce in 1990?, using the article: Productions during the 1980s included the company's first presentations of Pelléas and Mélisande (1981), Parsifal (1986) and Billy Budd (1988). 1980s productions that remained in the repertory for many years included Xerxes directed by Hytner, and Rigoletto and The Mikado directed by Jonathan Miller. In 1984 ENO toured the United States; the travelling company, led by Elder, consisted of 360 people; they performed Gloriana, War and Peace, The Turn of the Screw, Rigoletto and Patience. This was the first British company to be invited to appear at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, where Patience received a standing ovation and Miller's production of Rigoletto, depicting the characters as mafiosi, was greeted with a mixture of enthusiasm and booing. In 1990 ENO was the first major foreign opera company to tour the Soviet Union, performing the Miller production of The Turn of the Screw, Pountney's production of Macbeth, and Hytner's much-revived Xerxes.The 'Powerhouse' era ended in 1992, when all three of the triumvirate left at the same time. The new general director was Dennis Marks, formerly head of music programmes at the BBC, and the new music director was Sian Edwards. Pountney's post of director of productions was not filled. Marks, inheriting a large financial deficit from his predecessors, worked to restore the company's finances, concentrating on restoring ticket sales to sustainable levels. A new production by Miller of Der Rosenkavalier was a critical and financial success, as was a staging of Massenet's Don Quixote, described by the critic Hugh Canning as \\"the kind of old-fashioned theatre magic which the hair-shirted Powerhouse regime despised\\".Marks was obliged to spend much time and effort in securing the funding for an essential restoration of the Coliseum, a condition on which ENO had acquired the freehold of the theatre in 1992.

By 1999, 84 millionU.S.citizens had access to the Internet at home or work. More and more Americans arc paying bills, shopping, ordering airline tickets, and purchasing stocks via computer over the Internet. Internet banking is also becoming increasingly popular. With lower overhead costs in terms of staffing and office space, Internet banks are able to offer higher interest rates on deposits and charge lower rates on loans than traditional banks. \\"Brick and mortar\\" banks are increasingly offering online banking services via some special websites to enlarge their traditional services. At present, 14 percent of Internet households conduct their banking by means of the Internet, and the figure is expected to double during the next two or three years.

Maybe it's just me thinking it, sending myself doolally after what I've done. But I swear every morning it creeps up and it's looking at me, all knowing like. And when you reckon the sun's acting like that over you there isn't a right lot you can do about it, beyond burying yourself away like a mole in the soil. That's what I've been doing more or less in the score or so years that have gone by since. But however tight I shut them curtains to stop that damn sun lighting me up, it still don't stop the inside of my head from pounding out the truth. No way it's ever going to stop harassing me neither, not unless the deaf and dumb lass was to happen right back on my doorstep and give me the chance to tell her that it wasn't never meant to work out this way. The deaf and dumb lass went by the name of Mitzi Barker. Her being deaf and dumb, she was the kind of lass you went up the lane with if you didn't want no-one shouting their gob off about it after.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: Any type of food in your garden can attract rats, especially if they are ripe or overripe. Make sure that no food falls off the tree or vine onto the ground. If they do, pick them up right away. Look for one that is completely sealed or that has a locking lid. A container that sits up off the ground is also effective. This will prevent rats from smelling or getting into the compost. If you’re worried about rats, you may want to stop adding food scraps to your compost pile. Food adds little value to compost, and it is what the rats are attracted to. You can put food waste in a worm bin, however. If you feed any dogs, cats, rabbits, or chickens outside, you need a sealed metal container, preferably one with a locking lid. When the animals are done feeding, remove the dish if possible or throw out any leftovers. If you have animals like chickens that might graze on foods, a treadle feeder can help dispense food regularly without rats getting into it. You can install a rodent-baffle on your bird feeder or buy a bird feeder that is squirrel or rodent proof. Clean up under the bird feeder whenever you notice spilled seed to keep rats from coming to eat it. Try using no-waste bird food. This type of seed is designed to reduce how much waste the bird leaves behind when they are done eating. Make sure to store your bird seed in a sealed metal container. Look for containers that are advertised as “rodent-proof.” Rats like to hide in dense vegetation and wood piles. Make sure to clear any garden debris, such as fallen branches or leaves, as soon as possible. Mow the lawn so that grass and weeds are no higher than a few inches. You can also: Stack wood on a platform at least 18 inches (46 cm) off the ground and about 12 inches (30 cm) from any structures like fences or buildings. Trim large plants that rats could climb, such as trees, ivy, vines, and shrubs. Keep them about 4 feet (1.2 m) away from your roof to stop rats from climbing over. Repair fences to cover any holes larger than a dime. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article provided would be: To prevent rats from being attracted to your garden, ensure that no ripe or overripe food is left on the ground and maintain cleanliness. Use sealed or locking containers for compost, food waste, and pet food. Opt for a treadle feeder for animals that graze and consider rodent-proof bird feeders with no-waste bird food. Keep bird seed in sealed metal containers and clear garden debris regularly. Maintain short grass and trim large plants away from structures to prevent rat hiding spots.

Truck visits his girlfriend, Annie, who is in jail and wants to leave LA when released. Truck and his partner Jerry Barnes go to collect their bounty from Nate Dinwiddie, a bail bondsman, who refers them to Fogarty, a bail bondsman after a pimp who skipped bail named Gator. The two visit Dorinda, who runs Gator's stable of prostitutes. Truck and Jerry wait for Gator to visit, and chase him, but Gator escapes. A tip from Truck's friend Duke allows them to locate Gator again, and kill Gator when he attempts to shoot Truck. Dorinda threatens Gator's former whores to keep them in line.

Q:Given the following context: Fed up with her dead-end job with a Minneapolis car rental agency, Martha quits, cashes her final paycheck, and uses the money to purchase an airline ticket to the least expensive international destination she can find - London. At the airport, she meets Daniel, a successful music label executive, who covertly arranges for her to be upgraded to First Class and seated next to him on the flight. When she sells the ticket to another passenger and Daniel finds his seatmate is an obnoxiously loud woman instead of the girl of his dreams, he moves back to the Economy section and takes the vacant seat next to Martha. Before landing in London, he offers her the use of a deluxe suite in a luxury hotel at his company's expense in exchange for a lunch date the following day. Through a series of flashbacks and flashforwards, we learn Laurence, a former bridge champion who now teaches the game to wealthy women, went to the airport to pick up Daniel but missed him because the flight landed early. Instead, he literally runs into Martha, who hits him with a luggage cart while searching for the exit. She coerces him into taking her into the city and invites him to the suite for dinner. While she is in the bathroom, a bouquet of flowers from Daniel is delivered to the suite, and when Laurence sees the attached card, he departs without explanation. The following day, Martha meets struggling actor Frank, who has fled an audition in a panic and has gone to the park to console himself with a half-bottle of whiskey. Having heard about her from Daniel, he realizes who she is and calls Laurence to boast that he is about to make her his conquest. He takes her to a nearby art gallery.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person who might have assisted with the underdrawing in Van der Weyden's workshop? The Annunciation draws heavily on van der Weyden's 1430s Louvre Annunciation, his c. 1455 Saint Columba altarpiece, and the Clugny Annunciation (c. 1465–75), which is attributed to either van der Weyden or Memling. Memling almost certainly was apprenticed to van der Weyden in Brussels until setting up his own workshop in Bruges sometime after 1465. Memling's Annunciation is more innovative, with motifs such as the attendant angels that were absent in the earlier paintings. According to Till-Holger Borchert, not only was Memling familiar with van der Weyden's motifs and compositions, but he might have assisted with the underdrawing in van der Weyden's workshop. The shutters on the right are copied from the Louvre panel, the knotted curtain appears in the Columba triptych's \\"Annunciation\\".A sense of movement is conveyed throughout. The trailing edges of Gabriel's garment fall outside the pictorial space, indicating his arrival. The Virgin's \\"serpentine\\" pose, with attendant angels supporting her, adds to the sense of flow. Memling's use of color achieves a startling effect. The traditional rays of light are replaced with light color indicators; the white clothes rendered in \\"icy\\" blue, the angel to the right in yellow patches seems \\"bleached by light\\", the left-hand angel appears to be steeped in shadow, dressed in clothes of lavender and bearing deep green wings. The effect is iridescent, according to Blum, who writes, \\"this shimmering surface gives [the figures] an unearthly quality, separating them from the more believable world of the bedchamber.\\" The effect deviates from the pure naturalism and realism which typifies Early Netherlandish art, causing a \\"startling\\" juxtaposition, an effect that is \\"unsteadying\\" and contradictory. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The person who might have assisted with the underdrawing in Van der Weyden's workshop is Hans Memling.

Write some highlights for the following article: There is a real danger of Sergio Aguero becoming the Premier League’s greatest striker of all-time if he manages to maintain a freak minutes-per-goal record which even tops Thierry Henry. The Manchester City man scored the only goal in Sunday’s derby win against rivals United – meaning he now notches once every 109 minutes. It was Aguero’s 62nd in the league for City – and 10th this season – and puts him ahead of Henry, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Alan Shearer. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero has netted 62 Premier League goals in 6783 minutes in England. Sergio Aguero converts Gael Clichy's low cross from the left to put Manchester City 1-0 ahead in the derby. Aguero (second from left) is mobbed by his team-mates after giving the hosts the lead against Man United. Thierry Henry is widely-regarded as one of the best strikers to have ever graced the Premier League. Not only that, the 26-year-old is comfortably in front of every other frontman to have lit up the top flight since 1992. Henry – Arsenal’s main man for eight years – netted 175 times in 237 Premier League games. Widely-regarded as a revolutionary in the modern era, Henry’s capability of scoring 20-a-season in double-quick time put him on a pedestal as the best there had been. Even superior to Shearer, who ended his career with more, 260, but took longer in between strikes to find the net. Van Nistelrooy’s trailblazing four campaigns at Manchester United – ignoring the injury-ravaged first – garnered 95 goals at a rate of one every 128 minutes. Robin van Persie’s strike rate is healthy at 137 minutes per goal, while the year spent in England by Samuel Eto’o had proved profitable – his 12 goals coming in 1609 minutes. Manchester United skipper Wayne Rooney, on the other hand, has taken 168 minutes for each of his 176 in the Premier League. That isn’t a record to be sniffed at. It comes in at better than a goal every other game if purely using minutes. Aguero’s 109 minutes for every strike – which is half-an-hour more impressive than Luis Suarez and Edin Dzeko – makes him the most lethal marksman to have graced English football. Henry comfortably finishes past Bolton Wanderers goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen in an FA Cup tie. Aguero has a better minutes-per-goal ratio than ex-Liverpool talisman Luis Suarez (celebrating at Norwich) Alan Shearer's goals were crucial in Blackburn winning the 1995 Premier League title (Chris Sutton right) Detractors may point to the City striker’s injury record – he always struggles to get through a full campaign without tweaking something – as reason enough to suggest he can never be named No 1. But even last year, when Aguero spent two months on the sidelines, he was up there with Suarez and Daniel Sturridge. His manager Manuel Pellegrini said last December that this season’s top scorer was a better player than the Uruguayan. ‘Suarez is a very important striker, but I think Sergio participates more in the game,’ Pellegrini claimed. ‘He has always been a top player and he has always scored goals, but I think at this moment, he has added working for the team without the ball, which is also important for him.’ Shearer scored 260 Premier League goals, most marked with his trademark celebration. The bustling centre forward often notched from the penalty spot but got plenty from open play. Wayne Rooney is in the top 25 but his record is worse than the likes of Robin van Persie and Javier Hernandez. The Chilean certainly isn’t wrong – Aguero contributes so much more – but it is for his goalscoring that he will be remembered most fondly for. There was never any danger of Gael Clichy’s centre not ending up nestled beyond David de Gea at the Etihad Stadium this weekend. It is that sort of clinical finishing that sets him apart. He rarely needs more than one chance. While Aguero offers much more across the width of a pitch and in behind defenders, there are a number of players who have merely relied on their prowess in front of goal to retain a spot in the upper echelons of this all-time Premier League list. Javier Hernandez, now at Real Madrid, was renowned for doing very little in United games before a ball broke inside the opposition penalty area, while Adam Le Fondre – whose record is only topped by Henry and Aguero – has forever been an impact substitute. Ivan Klasnic's goalscoring record while at Bolton puts him among the Premier League's elite. Tony Yeboah (pictured scoring for Leeds against Liverpool in 1995) scored picture-book goals. Reading used Adam Le Fondre as a super sub - but his minutes-per-goal ratio was exemplary. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer often saved Manchester United late on in games after being called from the bench. Shearer was chief penalty taker wherever he played, while Ivan Klasnic’s 20 Bolton goals tended to come in gluts (and often from the bench) before Owen Coyle sent him packing. Unsurprisingly, both Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Owen feature, although their records of a goal every 150 minutes might have been better if the pair didn’t spend so much time coming back from injuries. Derby’s Branko Strupar makes the list, but his four years at Pride Park from 1999 actually only brought about 15 goals, with Tony Yeboah’s record slightly more impressive. Of the current crop to surprise, Andre Schurrle and Wilfried Bony both make the top 25. Whether Aguero’s record can be beaten remains to be seen, but it looks doubtful.","completion":"This article discusses the possibility of Sergio Aguero becoming the Premier League's greatest striker of all-time if he maintains his impressive minutes-per-goal record. Some highlights from the article include: 1. Aguero's goal in the Manchester City vs. Manchester United derby put him ahead of Thierry Henry, Ruud van Nistelrooy, and Alan Shearer in terms of minutes-per-goal in the Premier League. 2. Aguero's minutes-per-goal record stands at one every 109 minutes, significantly better than other prolific strikers such as Henry, van Nistelrooy, and Rooney. 3. Despite having a higher overall goal tally, Shearer took longer between goals and Henry's own goal-per-game ratio is not as impressive as Aguero's. 4. Aguero is praised not only for his goalscoring ability but also for his contributions to the game without the ball, as highlighted by his manager, Manuel Pellegrini. 5.

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: There are two hydroelectric dams in North Dakota. Both of them has large lakes or reservoirs, reservoir A and reservoir B. Since North Dakota has one the lowest unemployment rates in the country, it's hard to find an engineer to regulate and maintain the reservoirs. This year reservoir A could hire an engineer, but reservoir B failed to find an engineer. As a result, there is no one to regulate reservoir B. The engineer for reservoir A let the water out in the fall. But there was no one to do that for reservoir B. and a hint : The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year. Please answer this question : Which reservoir would most likely not casue damaged dock, reservoir A or reservoir B? Answer:","completion":"Reservoir A would most likely not cause damaged docks. This is because the engineer at reservoir A regulates the water level by letting the water out in the fall, allowing the water level to drop by about 10 feet (3.0 m) during the winter. This helps prevent ice from damaging docks and other structures around the lake. On the other hand, reservoir B failed to find an engineer, and as a result, there is no one to regulate its water level during the fall and winter. Without proper regulation, the water level in reservoir B might not decrease in time, which could potentially lead to ice damaging docks and other structures around the lake."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Background: Klinefelter's syndrome is caused by the presence of one or more extra copies of the X chromosome in a male's cells. Extra genetic material from the X chromosome interferes with male sexual development, preventing the testicles from functioning normally and reducing the levels of testosterone. Triple X syndrome (trisomy X) results from an extra copy of the X chromosome in each of a female's cells. Females with trisomy X have a lower IQ than their siblings. Turner syndrome results when each of a female's cells has one normal X chromosome and the other sex chromosome is missing or altered. The missing genetic material affects development and causes the characteristic features of the condition, including short stature and infertility. Paragraph: David is a physician with the children's hospital. He is seeing four patients, patient A, patient B, patient C, and patient D. Patient A is a male with Klinefelter's syndrome. Patient B is female with Turner syndrome. Patient C is a male and does not have any of these illnesses. Patient D is a female and she too does not have any of these illnesses. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which patient would have lower level of testosterone, patient A or patient C? Answer:","completion":"Patient A would have a lower level of testosterone. Step 1: Identify the patients with relevant conditions. - Patient A is a male with Klinefelter's syndrome. - Patient C is a male without any of these illnesses. Step 2: Recall the information about Klinefelter's syndrome. - Klinefelter's syndrome is caused by the presence of one or more extra copies of the X chromosome in a male's cells. - This interferes with male sexual development, preventing the testicles from functioning normally and reducing the levels of testosterone. Step 3: Compare the testosterone levels of Patient A and Patient C. - Since Patient A has Klinefelter's syndrome, his testosterone levels will be reduced due to the extra X chromosome interfering with his sexual development. - Patient C, on the other hand, does not have any of these illnesses and can be assumed to have normal testosterone levels for a male without these conditions. Conclusion: Patient A would have a lower level of testosterone compared to Patient C."},{"prompt":"Facts: - finalteam: chicago cubs - finalyear: 1912 - death place: toledo , ohio - statlabel: win -- loss record earned run average strikeouts - position: pitcher - statvalue: 0 -- 1 2.92 5 - throws: left - debutteam: chicago cubs - bats: left - debutdate: august 31 - death date: 9 september 1949 - birth date: 2 july 1890 - finaldate: september 19 - name: len madden - birth place: toledo , ohio - debutyear: 1912 Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of len madden .

Please answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who played drums for the Smashing Pumpkins? Answer the above question based on the context below: The Smashing Pumpkins (or Smashing Pumpkins) are an American alternative rock band from Chicago, Illinois. Formed in 1988 by frontman Billy Corgan (lead vocals, guitar), D'arcy Wretzky (bass), James Iha (guitar), and Jimmy Chamberlin (drums), the band has undergone many line-up changes. The current lineup features Corgan, Chamberlin, Iha and guitarist Jeff Schroeder. Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries, they have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegazing, and electronica in later recordings. Corgan is the group's primary songwriter; his musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as \\"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land\\".The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. With 30 million albums sold worldwide, the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up. In 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist. After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, which encompassed the release of stand-alone singles, compilation EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project's scope—Oceania in 2012 and Monuments to an Elegy in 2014. Chamberlin and Iha officially rejoined the band in February 2018. The reunited lineup released...

Q:Information: - Old French (', ', \\"\\"; Modern French ) was the Gallo-Romance dialect continuum spoken from the 9th century to the 14th century. In the 14th century, these dialects came to be collectively known as the \\"langues d'oïl\\", contrasting with the \\"langue d'oc\\" or Occitan language in the south of France. The mid-14th century is taken as the transitional period to Middle French, the language of the French Renaissance, specifically based on the dialect of the Île-de-France region. - Emperor Seinei ( Seinei - tenn ) was the 22nd emperor of Japan , according to the traditional order of succession . No firm dates can be assigned to this emperor 's life or reign , but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 480 -- 484 . - Empress dowager (also dowager empress or empress mother) is the English language translation of the title given to the mother of a Chinese, Japanese, Korean or Vietnamese emperor. - An empire is defined as \\"an aggregate of nations or people ruled over by an emperor or other powerful sovereign or government, usually a territory of greater extent than a kingdom, as the former British Empire, French Empire, Brazilian Empire, Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, Byzantine Empire or Roman Empire.\\" An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, or of territories far remote from the homeland, such as a colonial empire. - An emperor (through Old French \\"empereor\\" from ) is a monarch, usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm. Empress, the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife (\\"empress consort\\"), mother (\\"empress dowager\\"), or a woman who rules in her own right (\\"empress regnant\\"). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings. In Europe the title of Emperor was, since the Middle Ages, considered equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope, due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of Western Europe. The Emperor of Japan is the only currently reigning monarch whose title is translated into English as \\"Emperor\\". - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Honour (also honor in American English, see spelling differences) is an abstract concept entailing a perceived quality of worthiness and respectability that affects both the social standing and the self-evaluation of an individual or corporate body such as a family, school, regiment or nation. Accordingly, individuals (or corporate bodies) are assigned worth and stature based on the harmony of their actions with a specific code of honour, and the moral code of the society at large.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Jennifer and Justin are examining the principle of chemical equilibrium in their second year organic chemistry course. They are performing a reaction that involves hydrogen gas and glucose as the starting reactants, and the products formed in the reaction are carbon dioxide and oxygen gas. Jennifer and Justin add the materials, and then wait until the reaction has reached equilibrium. Afterwards, Jennifer removes glucose from her reaction mixture, while Justin removes carbon dioxide from his reaction mixture. But I can use this background: An equilibrium can also be disrupted by the full or partial removal of a reactant or product. If the concentration of a substance is decreased, the system will respond by favoring the reaction that replaces that substance. In the industrial Haber-Bosch process, NH 3 is removed from the equilibrium system as the reaction proceeds. As a result, the forward reaction is favored so that more NH 3 will be produced. The concentrations of N 2 and H 2 decrease. Continued removal of NH 3 will eventually force the reaction to go to completion until all of the reactants are used up. If either N 2 or H 2 were removed from the equilibrium system, the reverse reaction would be favored, and the concentration of NH 3 would decrease. What is an answer for this question: Which person's reaction, Jennifer's or Justin's, will begin producing more carbon dioxide? Answer:","completion":"In the given situation, Jennifer and Justin are studying chemical equilibrium in an organic chemistry course. They are performing a reaction with hydrogen gas and glucose as the starting reactants, and carbon dioxide and oxygen gas as the products. They wait for the reaction to reach equilibrium before Jennifer removes glucose from her reaction mixture, and Justin removes carbon dioxide from his reaction mixture. To answer the question of whose reaction will begin producing more carbon dioxide, we need to consider the effect of removing a reactant or product on the equilibrium system. As mentioned in the background information, when the concentration of a substance is decreased, the system responds by favoring the reaction that replaces that substance. In Jennifer's case, she removed glucose from her reaction mixture. Glucose is one of the starting reactants in the reaction. By removing it, the system will respond by shifting the equilibrium to favor the reverse reaction that consumes the products (carbon dioxide and oxygen gas) and produces more reactants (hydrogen gas and glucose). As a result, the concentration of carbon dioxide will decrease in her reaction mixture. On the other hand, Justin removed carbon dioxide from his reaction mixture. Carbon dioxide is one of the products formed in the reaction. The removal of carbon dioxide causes the system to shift the equilibrium in the forward direction in order to replace the removed product. The forward reaction consumes hydrogen gas and glucose to produce more carbon dioxide and oxygen gas. Consequently, the concentration of carbon dioxide will increase in Justin's reaction mixture. In conclusion, Justin's reaction will begin producing more carbon dioxide after he removes it from his reaction mixture. This is because the removal of a product, like carbon dioxide, favors the forward reaction that replaces it, leading to an increase in its concentration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: I am a big fan of Skechers because they have so many different styles of shoe-they are really diverse and creative with their products.I really like this model of shoe a lot-it looks cool and it is extremely comfortable for light walking. I got the white/red/black pair.I am giving this shoe 4 stars instead of 5 because while it has good cushioning in the heel, it is pretty thin under the toes/forefront of the foot. You can feel everything if you are walking on a non-smooth surface.The straps are velcro and quick to open/close, yet secure which is a positive. I have gotten a lot of compliments on the looks of this shoe from strangers and aquaintances alike.I certainly would recommend this shoe strictly for fashion reasons, not for atheletics. Answer: A:","completion":"Overall, the tone in this review is mixed, leaning towards positive. There are more positive elements than negative ones. The reviewer initially expresses the positive attributes of the Skechers Women's Bikers-Spokes, such as the diversity and creativity of the Skechers brand, the cool looks, and the comfort of the shoes for light walking. A specific color combination of the pair that the reviewer owns is also shared, indicating a positive personal choice. In addition, the reviewer positively notes the practicality of the velcro straps and the compliments received from others. However, there are some minor negative elements present in the review. One noteworthy point is the unsatisfactory cushioning in the toe/forefront area where the reviewer mentions that it is thin and one can feel irregularities if the surface walked upon is not smooth. This is the essential factor that led the reviewer to rate the shoe with 4 stars instead of 5, representing a slight decrease in the satisfaction level of the product. Lastly, the reviewer recommends the shoe, but restricts the recommendation to fashion purposes and clearly states that they would not recommend it for athletic uses. This can be interpreted as neither wholly negative nor positive - it is simply the reviewer's advice based on their personal experience with the shoes. Despite the implicit and minor discontent expressed in the review, most of the review is positive which makes the overall tone of the review more positive than negative. So, in conclusion, while the review includes some criticisms, it generally highlights the product's strengths and the reviewer's satisfaction with the product."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Does \\"There are two types of amensalism, competition and antibiosis.\\" correctly answer the question of What kinds of amensalism are there?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"There are two types of amensalism, competition and antibiosis.\\" correctly answers the question, but to provide a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of amensalism, let's explore each type further. Amensalism is a type of ecological interaction where one species is negatively affected while the other remains unaffected. The two primary kinds of amensalism are competition and antibiosis. 1. Competition: In this type of amensalism, the two interacting species are competing for a shared, limited resource such as food, territory, or mates. This competition has a negative impact on one or both of the species, but neither species benefits from the interaction. For example, two species of birds may compete for the same source of food, and if the larger species can access the food faster and more efficiently, this would harm the smaller species. However, the larger bird's access to food is not improved by hindering the smaller bird's access as they would be consuming the same amount of resources regardless. Moreover, competition can be further divided into two types: intra-specific competition and inter-specific competition. Intra-specific competition occurs within members of the same species, while inter-specific competition occurs between individuals of different species. 2. Antibiosis: This type of amensalism is characterized by the production of substances by one organism that are harmful to another organism, while the producing organism remains unaffected. Such substances are called antimicrobial or allelopathic compounds. Some examples include antibiotics produced by microorganisms to inhibit the growth of competing species, or toxins released by plants to prevent the growth of nearby plants (allelopathy). In these cases, the producing organism does not gain an advantage from harming the affected organism; rather, it is an incidental effect of their existence. One notable example of antibiosis is the production of penicillin by the fungus Penicillium. When Penicillium produces penicillin, it inhibits the growth of nearby bacteria, but the fungus itself is not affected by the antibiotic. Similarly, certain plants, like the black walnut tree (Juglans nigra), produce a chemical called juglone, which reduces the growth of nearby plants. This doesn't necessarily benefit the black walnut tree, but it still indirectly affects other plants in the vicinity. In conclusion, the statement \\"There are two types of amensalism, competition and antibiosis\\" is accurate in summarizing the kinds of amensalism. However, understanding the details of each type of interaction and the examples associated with them provides a more comprehensive knowledge of amensalism as an ecological concept."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Step 1: Combine the terms with the variable d. -192*d + 284*d = 192d - 92 When we add these terms, we get: (284 - 192)*d = 92*d Step 2: Add 92 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with d. 92*d + 92 = 0 Step 3: Factor out d from the left side of the equation. d*(92 + 1) = d*93 Step 4: To find the value of d, divide both sides of the equation by 93. d*93 / 93 = 0 / 93 This simplifies to: d = 0 So, the solution to the equation -192*d + 284*d - 92 = 0 is d = 0."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One day, she decided to have a nice time and go eat at a restaurant. But when she came back home, she found out her baby was very sick and not feeling good at all. Baby Flynn was napping with his daddy on a comfy sofa. But suddenly, when they were both sleeping, Flynn's body stopped working, and he turned grey. This made everyone very sad and worried. A special doctor, called a coroner, looked at baby Flynn to try to find out what had happened. The coroner found out that Flynn passed away from something called Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. This is when a baby suddenly stops breathing and their heart stops beating during their sleep. It is a very sad and surprising thing, but the doctor said it was a natural cause. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome is also known as SIDS. No one knows exactly why it happens or how to stop it, and it can happen to any baby, even those that are very healthy and happy. Unfortunately, there's no way to be sure that a baby won't have SIDS. But there are some things that parents can do to help reduce the chances of it happening. They can make sure that the baby is sleeping in a safe place, like on their back, in a crib without lots of blankets or toys. Even though it's a very sad story, it is important for people to learn about SIDS so they can try to help other little babies like Flynn. By knowing the story of Leigh Arnold and baby Flynn, families can be more aware of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and try to make the best choices for their own little ones. In the end, baby Flynn's family and friends will always remember him as a happy and sweet baby. And while they can't change what happened, they can take the lessons they've learned and help others to understand the importance of being careful with sleeping babies."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Denver then answered with a 10 play drive that led to a field goal by Jason Elam, making it 7-3. In the second quarter Denver scored first with a 48-yard field goal. Bills kicker Rian Lindell then missed a 45-yard field goal. The Broncos drove deep into Bills territory at the close of the half but Cutler threw an interception to end the drive. The Bills then drove into Denver territory and tried a long field goal but failed due to a false start, then ended the half with an interception thrown to Elvis Dumervil. On the opening kickoff for the second half, a scary injury occurred to Bills TE Kevin Everett, as he suffered a cervical spine injury while making a tackle on Domenik Hixon. Everett later underwent surgery that day and is currently in intensive care. He does have feeling and partial movement in his extremities and it is believed he will walk again. The Broncos began the second half with a drive that ended with a missed 50-yard field goal. The Bills then made a nine play drive that ended with a 23-yard touchdown run by Marshawn Lynch. The Broncos responded with a drive ending with a touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall. They then attempted to tie the game with a two-point conversion but failed with an incomplete pass to Javon Walker. The fourth quarter had little scoring. Elam missed a field goal, but the Bills failed to score or run out the clock, giving Denver the ball with a little over two minutes to play. After an ill-advised lateral bounced free, (saved by rookie back Selvin Young smartly batting the loose ball out of bounds) the Bronco's faced a seemingly insurmountable 3rd and 23 to go. Cutler immediately turned in the best clutch performance of his NFL career to date, one that drew comparisons to John Elway by both sportswriters and teammates. Cutler's drive included two fourth down conversions to drive deep into Bills' territory, where, with no time outs, they rushed the field goal unit onto the field with ten seconds left and the clock ticking down. Execution by the field goal unit allowed Jason Elam to kick the game winning 42-yard field goal just as the clock ticked to 0:00. Buffalo ended up leading the game for over 51 minutes of the contest.

Whisk the ingredients until the yeast and sugar have dissolved. Place 1 cup (120 g) of flour into the bowl with the yeast, lukewarm water, and sugar. Use a whisk to combine the flour with the other ingredients. Leave the mixture resting until small bubbles appear. The amount of time that it takes for the yeast to start bubbling depends on the temperature of the environment. The cooler the environment is, the longer it will take. Transfer 1/3 cup (75 g) of butter, 1 tsp (5 g) of salt, and the remaining 2 1/2 cups (300 g) of flour into the bowl with the yeast mixture. Use your hands to knead the ingredients together. Stop kneading once the butter is evenly distributed throughout the mixture. Keep the ingredients in the bowl while you are kneading. Take the dough from the bowl and place it onto a clean work surface. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out until it looks like a thin sheet and is approximately 1⁄5 in (0.51 cm) thick. Sprinkle some flour over the work surface if the dough starts to stick. Avoid rolling the dough too thin, otherwise, it may begin to break. Crack 3 eggs into a bowl. Use a whisk to beat the eggs until the whites and the yolks have combined. Coat the dough thoroughly using a pastry brush to spread the egg mixture out.

Touch something, and your brain knows. The hand sends signals to the brain to announce contact was made. But that feeling of touch may not require making actual contact, tests on monkeys now show. Zapping brain cells can fool the animal into thinking its finger has touched something. A person who has lost a limb or become paralyzed may need an artificial limb to complete everyday tasks. But such patients may not truly feel any objects they hold. The new findings point toward one day creating a sense of touch in those who use such artificial limbs. Psychologist Sliman Bensmaia of University of Chicago worked on the new tests. His team's findings appeared on October 14 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. The sense of touch is crucial to everyday tasks: People without _ may have difficulty cracking an egg, lifting a cup or even turning a doorknob. That's why restoring it is a major goal for designers of artificial limbs. In their new study, Bensmaia and his co-workers worked with rhesus monkeys . The scientists implanted electrodes --- small devices that can detect and relay an electrical signal--into the animals' brains.

Q:Instagram is containing so many photos of food--now a pop-up diner in London is taking advantage of this new trend by letting people settle the bill for their meals simply by uploading photos of their dishes to social networks. I always thought people's taking pictures of their food was kind of silly, but at this new pop-up restaurant in the UK, I'd probably do it too. 'The Picture House' is the world's first pay-by-photo restaurant--you order, click a photo of the food, share on Instagram and eat for free! The restaurant belongs to frozen food giant Birds Eye, who came up with the idea to cash in on people's addiction with photographing food and sharing the pictures online. They conducted a survey and found out that more than half of the British population regularly took pictures of their meals. So they realized it was a better way to advertise their new dining range. The pop-up diner was open in Soho, London for three days in May, and is now moving to other major UK cities. They serve two-course meals that customers don't have to pay for, if they photo and Instagram it. The restaurant is a part of Birds Eye's 'Food for Life' campaign, a new marketing project that aims at changing the way people look at frozen food. \\"Taking photos of food enables people to show off and to share their mealtime moments--from the everyday to the special,\\" said marketing director Margaret Jobling. The reaction to The Picture House has been great so far. And the pay-by-picture concept has proven to be an effective way.

It helps the computer think and follow instructions. Now, let's answer the first question: How does the CPU actually execute something?

The CPU processes all the information, calculations, and commands needed for a computer to work. It uses a set of rules, called an instruction set, to understand what it should do. By performing billions of tiny tasks quickly, the CPU helps your computer run smoothly. Now, to answer your last question: Are these two questions asking the same thing? The answer is (b). yes.

A composer may also respond to a text by expanding a choral symphony beyond the normal bounds of the symphonic genre. This is evident in the unusual orchestration and stage directions Berlioz prepared for his Roméo et Juliette. This piece is actually in seven movements, and calls for an intermission after the fourth movement – the \\"Queen Mab Scherzo\\" – to remove the harps from the stage and bring on the chorus of Capulets for the funeral march that follows. Berlioz biographer D. Kern Holoman observed that, \\"as Berlioz saw it, the work is simply Beethovenian in design, with the narrative elements overlain. Its core approaches a five-movement symphony with the choral finale and, as in the [Symphonie] Fantastique, both a scherzo and a march.... The 'extra' movements are thus the introduction with its potpourri of subsections and the descriptive tomb scene [at the end of the work].\\"Mahler expanded the Beethovenian model for programmatic as well as symphonic reasons in his Second Symphony, the \\"Resurrection\\", the vocal fourth movement, \\"Urlicht\\", bridging the childlike faith of the third movement with the ideological tension Mahler seeks to resolve in the finale. He then abandoned this pattern for his Third Symphony, as two movements for voices and orchestra follow three purely instrumental ones before the finale returns to instruments alone. Like Mahler, Havergal Brian expanded the Beethovenian model, but on a much larger scale and with far larger orchestral and choral forces, in his Symphony No. 1 \\"The Gothic\\". Written between 1919 and 1927, the symphony was inspired by Goethe's Faust and Gothic cathedral architecture. The Brian First is in two parts.

Movie title: Wrath of the Titans Context: Ten years after he defeated the Kraken, Perseus (Sam Worthington), the demigod son of Zeus (Liam Neeson), now lives as a fisherman with his 10-year-old son, Heleus (John Bell). One night, Perseus is visited by Zeus, who tells him that the powers of the gods are fading and the walls of the underworld prison of Tartarus are breaking due to the lack of devotion from humans and states they will need the world's armies to combat the potential threat, but Perseus shows little interest and refuses to get involved. Afterwards, Zeus travels to Tartarus to meet with his brothers Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Poseidon (Danny Huston), and his son Ares (Edgar Ramirez). He tells Hades they must forget the past and unite to rebuild Tartarus, but Hades orders his minions to attack. They severely injure Poseidon, and Ares betrays Zeus over showing Perseus more affection, taking him prisoner and stealing his thunderbolt. Hades and Ares plan to drain Zeus' power to revive Kronos, the father of Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon, in exchange for the two to remain immortal. The walls of Tartarus break, unleashing monsters into the world.After slaying a Chimera that attacks his village, Perseus takes Heleus to the Mount of Idols, so they can speak to Zeus, but the dying Poseidon arrives instead. He informs Perseus that Hades and Ares are holding Zeus in Tartarus, and tells him to meet with his demigod son Agenor (Toby Kebbell) to find the fallen god Hephaestus, who knows the way into Tartarus. Poseidon then gives Perseus his trident before succumbing to his injuries and crumbling into dust. Perseus flies on Pegasus to the campsite of Queen Andromeda's army. Andromeda (Rosamund Pike) has imprisoned Agenor for stealing crown jewels, but Perseus has him released.Perseus, Andromeda, Agenor, and a group of soldiers set out at sea to find Hephaestus, with Agenor explaining that Hephaestus created the three great weapons that Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon wield: Zeus Thunderbolt, Hades' Pitchfork, and Poseidons Trident, and that together they form the...

Choices: - developed reaction - Quick reaction - toxic reaction - chemical reaction A: The answer is:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the key concept in the question In this question, the key concept is \\"matter is always conserved.\\" This means that the total amount of matter remains constant in the reaction. Step 2: Analyze the given choices We are given four choices: developed reaction, quick reaction, toxic reaction, and chemical reaction. Let's analyze each choice: - Developed reaction: This term doesn't have a specific scientific meaning, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer. - Quick reaction: Although some reactions are fast, the speed of a reaction doesn't necessarily correlate to matter conservation. So, this is not the correct answer. - Toxic reaction: Toxicity refers to how harmful a substance is, not to how matter is conserved in a reaction. Hence, this is not the correct answer. - Chemical reaction: A chemical reaction occurs when substances combine or break down to form new substances, and the total mass of the reactants equals the total mass of the products. This choice aligns with the concept of matter conservation. Step 3: Choose the appropriate answer Based on our analysis, the correct answer is \\"chemical reaction\\" because it is the only choice where matter conservation is a fundamental principle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: It seems hard to watch someone yawn and not to yawn ourselves. Even reading about yawning can make you do it. Now, a new study has found why yawning has such a powerful force. Yawning when others yawn, the study suggests, is a sign of pity and a form of social connection. Kids don't develop this deeply rooted behavior until around age four, the study found. Kids with autism are less likely to catch yawns. In the most serious cases, they never do. Yawning might help doctors to see whether the children are developing rightly. The work could also lead to a better understanding of the ways that people communicate and connect. \\"Emotional infection seems to be a born thing that connects us together,\\" said Molly Helt, a graduate student in psychology at the University of Connecticut. \\"Yawning may be part of that.\\" Inspiration for her study came when she tried to get her own autistic son to clear his ears on an airplane. She repeatedly yawned at him, hoping he would yawn back. He never did. \\"The fact that autistic kids don't do it might mean they're really missing out on that emotional connection with people around them,\\" she said. \\"The biggest thing people try to figure out after birth is how we become humans and understand that humans have minds that are different from others',\\" she added. \\"Autistic people never seem to understand that.\\" Like infectious laughter and crying, scientists have found that yawning is a shared experience that promotes social connection. Helt said it could fight stress after a period of being nervous and spread a feeling of calm through a group. Question: Which of the following is NOT true about yawning?

USA TODAY A gunman opened fire on a Republican congressional baseball team practicing on a suburban Virginia field wounding Louisiana congressman Steve Scalise and at least four others. (Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY) A gunman opened fire on a Republican congressional baseball team practicing on a suburban Virginia field Wednesday, critically wounding Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise and shooting four other people as horrified legislators and staffers scrambled for cover amid a barrage of bullets. Capitol Police, who provided security for the practice, engaged the shooter, identified by authorities as James Hodgkinson, 66, from Belleville, Ill. President Trump later said the suspect was killed in the ensuing shootout. Congressional aide Zachary Barth, Tyson Foods lobbyist Matt Mika, and Capitol Police special agents Crystal Griner and David Bailey also were wounded in the rampage. The agents were hailed as heroes. \\"Many lives would have been lost if not for the heroic actions of the two Capitol Police officers who took down the gunman despite sustaining gunshot wounds during a very, very brutal assault,\\" Trump said. \\"Melania and I are grateful for their heroism and praying for the swift recovery of all victims.\\" Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., also praised the officers. “Had they not been there it probably would have been a turkey shoot,” he said. “There were, I don’t know, 40, 50 congressmen and senators out there on an open field - very few places to hide.’’ Trump made a visit at 8:45 p.m. ET at Medstar Washington Hospital Center, where Scalise underwent surgery earlier Wednesday. The hospital said in a statement after the surgery that Scalise remained in critical condition and that the bullet that entered his hip \\"travelled across his pelvis, fracturing bones, injuring internal organs, and causing severe bleeding.\\" The statement said that Scalise will require additional operations. Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., was standing on the third base line and was about to take batting practice when he heard a loud bang behind him. He turned and saw, past a dugout, a middle-aged man pushing a rifle through the chain-link fence, firing toward second base and the outfield. “He was not saying anything,” Brooks said. “He was just blasting away with his gun, shooting rapidly.” Bedlam erupted on the field. Brooks heard someone scream “active shooter.” Someone else yelled “take cover.” In the chaos, Brooks heard a yell from Scalise standing at second base. Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, R-Tenn., said the baseball practice session was almost over when the rampage began on the field shortly after 7 a.m. “I heard a bang, and I thought it sounded like a gun. I never saw a shooter,\\" he said. \\"I got bloody running and jumping into the dugout.” Read more: Fleischmann said the practice was attended by House members, senators and their staff, among others. “A lot like me got bloody running for cover,” he said. “It is just a madhouse here,” Fleischmann added. “It’s horrible. I’ve never experienced anything like that.” St. Clair County, Ill., Sheriff Richard Watson said Hodgkinson is believed to have left his Illinois home four or five weeks ago and had been in the Alexandria area since then. Deputies last encountered Hodgkinson at his Belleville, Ill., home on March 24, when a neighbor reported gunshots fired in the area, Watson said. Deputies found Hodgkinson with a hunting rifle on his property where he was apparently engaged in target practice, Watson said. “The guy was very cordial,’’ the sheriff said. “He showed the deputy his firearms identification card. Even though he was on his own property, he told the deputy that he probably should take the rifle to a gun range, just to be safe.’’ On Wednesday morning, South Carolina Rep. Jeff Duncan said he was leaving practice early when the man he believes was the gunman asked him if the players were Democrats or Republicans. \\"I told him they were Republicans, he said 'OK, thanks,' and turned around,\\" Duncan told reporters. \\"I got in the car and left.\\" Minutes later he heard about the rampage. Read more: Tim Slater, an FBI special agent in charge of the investigation, said it was too early to say if the shooter was targeting Republicans. Hodgkinson, however, had a history of raging online against President Trump and other Republicans and once singled out Scalise. \\"Here's a Republican that should lose his job, but they gave him a raise,'' Hodgkinson allegedly wrote in a 2015 post to his Facebook account. The message was accompanied by a cartoon depiction of Scalise. In a March 22 Facebook post, Hodgkinson described Trump as a \\"traitor.'' \\"Trump Has Destroyed Our Democracy,'' he wrote. \\"It's Time to Destroy Trump & Co.\\" Former Alexandria Mayor Bill Euille said Wednesday that he remembers meeting Hodgkinson more than a month ago at the YMCA, adjacent to the baseball field where the attack occurred. Euille said that Hodgkinson referred to him as “Mr. Mayor’’ and that he would regularly see him at a table at the Y, drinking coffee and using his laptop. He said it didn't occur to him that the man was the shooter until he saw his photograph in media accounts. Sen. Bernie Sanders issued a statement saying the suspect apparently had volunteered on his presidential campaign. Sanders said he was \\"sickened by this despicable act.\\" \\"Let me be as clear as I can be. Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms,\\" Sanders said. \\"Real change can only come about through nonviolent action, and anything else runs against our most deeply held American values.\\" Scalise, the third-ranking GOP whip in the House, was shot in the hip and listed in critical condition after surgery at MedStar Washington Hospital Center. \\"Prior to entering surgery, the Whip was in good spirits and spoke to his wife by phone,\\" his office said in a statement. \\"He is grateful for the brave actions of U.S. Capitol Police, first responders, and colleagues.\\" Rep. Roger Williams, R-Texas, said his staffer Barth was among the wounded and was in stable condition. U.S. Capitol Police Chief Matthew Verderosa said the wounded officers were in good condition. Mika was shot several times and was in critical condition, his family said in a statement. The team of Republican congressman and staff members were practicing for a charity baseball game scheduled for Thursday against a Democratic team. Pennsylvania Rep. Patrick Meehan said he had been joking and talking trash to Ohio Democrat Tim Ryan since striking him out on a curveball last year. \\"He just came up and gave me a hug,\\" Meehan said. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., said his team was practicing elsewhere when they heard about the attack. \\"We're safe & with police, everyone praying for GOP colleagues, staff & Cap police,\\" Huffman tweeted. The shooting took place at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park, in the Del Ray section of Alexandria about seven miles from the Capitol. It's a quiet community made up of restaurants, small businesses and lots of families. Residents describe it as a safe neighborhood where people walk around outside until late at night. The field serves as a community hub, with games and activities at all hours. The special agents were providing security at the practice and quickly returned fire when the shooting began, Verderosa said. Alexandria Chief Michael Brown said his officers arrived three minutes after the first emergency call came in at 7:09 a.m. ET, and also joined the gunfight. Sen. Rand Paul said he was \\"shaken but unharmed\\" after the rampage. \\"Many people likely would have died this morning if not for the bravery of the Capitol Police,\\" Paul said. \\"My thanks to them are inadequate but heartfelt. They never hesitated to put their lives on the line to save everyone.\\" Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., told CNN people scattered when the shooting began. Scalise was standing in the infield and fell where he stood. \\"He was not able to move under his own power. He was dragging his body from second base,\\" Brooks said. \\"There was not a whole lot we could do.\\" \\"It's not easy when you see people around you being shot and you don't have a weapon yourself,\\" Brooks added. \\"You feel helpless.\\" Contributing: Michael Collins, Deborah Berry, Susan Miller, Eliza Collins, Heidi Przybyla, Bryan Lyman of the Montgomery (Ala.)

President Trump said Hodgkinson died from injuries sustained when he was shot by police. \\"I have just been informed that the alleged shooter at the Republican baseball practice is someone who apparently volunteered on my presidential campaign,\\" Sanders said in a statement. \\"I am sickened by this despicable act.

Mika was shot multiple times and was in critical condition, his family said in a statement. Special Agents David Bailey and Crystal Griner were both wounded in the incident. Griner was shot in the foot or leg and Bailey, who was not shot, sustained another, unspecified injury. “Congressman Scalise is a friend and a very good friend,” Trump said in the White House address. “He’s a patriot and a fighter. He will recover from this assault. And, Steve, I want you to know that you have the prayers of not only an entire city behind you, but the entire nation – and frankly the entire world.” Williams, who was injured after diving into the dugout, later told reporters on Capitol Hill about his experience. Related Image Expand / Collapse “I literally dove into that dugout—like diving into a swimming pool with no water,” said Williams. “Zack came running from the outfield and we landed in each other’s arms—he held me, I held him. “Zack was texting the whole time, letting people know we were under fire and that we needed help.” Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., told Fox News he left just before the shooting. As he walked to his car, a man asked DeSantis if it was Republicans or Democrats practicing. About 3 minutes later, at around 7:09 a.m., the shooting began, DeSantis said. He later told Fox Business he believed the man who approached him was the shooter. Related Image Expand / Collapse Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., described the chaotic scene to Fox News: \\"We were like sitting ducks.\\" \\"Without the Capitol Hill police it would have been a massacre,\\" Paul said, calling the scene \\"sort of a killing field.\\" Hodgkinson was shot by Capitol Police and Alexandria Police, apprehended and taken to the hospital, officials said. The incident occurred at Simpson Field in Alexandria, about 10 miles from Washington D.C. The FBI was taking over the investigation because a federal official -- Scalise -- was assaulted in the attack. \\"An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us,\\" House Speaker Paul Ryan said in an address from the floor of the House of Representatives. His words were greeted by a bipartisan standing ovation from the gathered legislators. Related Image Expand / Collapse Ryan added: \\"We are all one family.

The Department of Homeland Security was monitoring the episode. Williams was seen being taken from the field on a stretcher, but he was reportedly injured while jumping into the dugout as the shots rang out. \\"Finally, the shooter was shot behind home plate as he was circling around to the first base dugout where there were a number of US congressmen and other folks,\\" Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., told FMTALK1065. \\"Our security detail was able to incapacitate him at that point. I don't know if he [the shooter] was dead. He was wounded.

Jeff Flake and Reps. Mike Bishop, Jack Bergman, Chuck Fleischmann and Joe Barton were also at the field. A photographer and Bishop's aides were present, too. Alexandria schools were placed on lockdown as the incident unfolded. There was an uptick in the police presence around the Capitol, however, the building was still open. There was not expected to be any votes held on Wednesday in light of the shooting. Witnesses and residents described a shattered calm Wednesday morning in a normally peaceful neighborhood now plastered with police tape. Reba Winstead, who lives in the area, described hearing a “boom boom boom boom.\\" She said she was getting her daughter ready for school and then “all of a sudden there was gunfire in our neighborhood.” Scalise, 51, is the House majority whip. He has represented Louisiana’s 1st Congressional District since 2008 and chairs the House Republican Study Committee. He is married with two children. Scalise's district includes New Orleans. Since he's in leadership, Scalise has a security detail. Scalise, who studied computer science at Louisiana State University, worked as a systems engineer before launching his political career. Scalise endorsed President Trump during last year’s presidential campaign, and has been a vocal backer of Trump’s travel ban. As leader of the powerful study group, he has also spearheaded the effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare. The Congressional Baseball Game is scheduled for June 15 at Nationals Park. The game, which has been a tradition since 1909, pits Senate and House members of each party who sport the uniform of their home state. Congressional leaders said the game would go on as planned.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Rhapsody in Blue is a 1924 musical composition by American composer George Gershwin for solo piano and jazz band, which combines elements of classical music with jazz-influenced effects. Commissioned by bandleader Paul Whiteman, the composition was orchestrated by Ferde Grofe several times, including the original 1924 scoring, \\"theater orchestra\\" setting published in 1926, and the symphony orchestra scoring published in 1942, though completed earlier. The piece received its premiere in the concert, An Experiment in Modern Music, which was held on February 12, 1924, in Aeolian Hall, New York, by Whiteman and his band with Gershwin playing the piano. The editors of the Cambridge Music Handbooks opined that \\"The Rhapsody in Blue (1924) established Gershwin's reputation as a serious composer and has since become one of the most popular of all American concert works.\\" Two audio recordings exist of Gershwin performing an abridged version of the work with Whiteman's orchestra: an acoustic recording made for Victor on June 10, 1924, and running 8'59'' (this recording includes the original clarinetist, Ross Gorman, playing the glissando) and a Victor electrical recording made April 21, 1927, running 9'01'' (about half the length of the complete work). This 1927 version was also dubbed onto an RCA Victor 33 1/3 rpm Program Transcription in 1932. The latter version was actually conducted by Nathaniel Shilkret after an argument between Gershwin and Whiteman. A 1925 piano roll captured Gershwin's performance in a two piano version. Whiteman's orchestra also performed a shortened version of the piece in the 1930 film The King of Jazz featuring Roy Bargy on piano. Whiteman re-recorded the piece on both sides of a 12-inch Decca 78 rpm (29051) recorded on October 23, 1938. The first complete recording, with pianist Jesus Maria Sanroma and Arthur Fiedler conducting the Boston Pops Orchestra, was issued by RCA Victor in 1935. Since the mid-20th century, the 1942 version has usually been performed by classical orchestras playing the expanded arrangement. In this form, it has become a staple of the concert repertoire. It has direct popular appeal while also being regarded respectfully by classical musicians. On August 21, 1945, a recording by Oscar Levant with the Philadelphia Orchestra (conducted by Eugene Ormandy) entered at its peak position of number 23 on the Cash Box survey (Columbia Masterworks 251). In 1973, the piece was recorded by jazz-rock artist Eumir Deodato on his album Deodato 2. The single reached Billboard peak positions number 41 Pop, number 10 Easy Listening. A disco arrangement was recorded by French pianist Richard Clayderman in 1978 and is one of his signature pieces. In the late 1970s, interest in the original arrangement was revived. On February 14, 1973, it received its first performance since the 1920s: Kenneth Kiesler secured needed permissions and led with work with pianist Paul Verrette on his U. of New Hampshire campus. Reconstructions of it have been recorded by Michael Tilson Thomas and the Columbia Jazz Band in 1976, and by Maurice Peress with Ivan Davis on piano as part of a 60th-anniversary reconstruction of the entire 1924 concert. Andre Watts (1976), Marco Fumo (1974), and Sara Davis Buechner (2005) released recordings of the work for solo piano as did Eric Himy (2004) in a version that featured the uncut original short score. Meanwhile, such two-piano teams as Jose Iturbi and Amparo Iturbi, France Veri and Michael Jamanis and Katia and Marielle Labeque, also recorded the piece. Michel Camilo recorded the piece in 2006, winning a Latin Grammy award. Who put together the orchestration","completion":"Ferde Grofe put together the orchestration for Rhapsody in Blue.

Step 1: Rewrite the equation and isolate 'x' by getting rid of the constant that is with 'x'. We can achieve this by moving 2318 from the right hand side of the equation to the left. This is done by addition operation since the opposite operation to subtraction is addition. So we do: -10627 + 2318 = -1187*x Which gives: -8309 = -1187*x Step 2: Now we just have to do one more step. 'x' is multiplied by -1187 in the right hand side of the equation. We have to get rid of this -1187 by division operation as the opposite operation of multiplication is division. So we have: x = -8309 / -1187 Getting the results of the division, we obtain: x = 7 So x = 7 is the solution to the equation. Note: It can be checked by substitifying the result back into the original equation and both side of the equation will be equal, proving that the solution is correct."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By Matt Chorley, James Chapman and Tim Shipman PUBLISHED: 11:39 EST, 30 October 2012 | UPDATED: 04:52 EST, 1 November 2012 The coalition risked descending into political infighting today, after David Cameron suffered his first significant Commons defeat at the hands of Labour and Tory rebels demanding a tougher stance on the EU’s budget. Tory rebels claimed they had defied the Prime Minister to vote for the British people, while loyalists warned Conservatives must ‘get a grip’ and support Mr Cameron or face defeat at the 20-15 general election. Chancellor George Osborne refused to say a real-terms reduction in Brussels spending was impossible but Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned those demanding a cut had ‘absolutely no hope’ of achieving their goal. He also attacked Labour, claiming its tactics reminded him of the ‘unprincipled’ stances taken by Conservatives in the wake of the OPTIONS: - British landslide in 1997. - Brussels landslide in 1997. - Cameron landslide in 1997. - Commons landslide in 1997. - David Cameron landslide in 1997. - EU landslide in 1997. - George Osborne landslide in 1997. - James Chapman landslide in 1997. - Labour landslide in 1997. - Matt Chorley landslide in 1997. - Nick Clegg landslide in 1997. - Tim Shipman landslide in 1997. - Tory landslide in 1997.","completion":"Labour landslide in 1997.

You know how in our toy games, there are winners and losers, right? Well, in real life too, companies also play their own type of game - doing business. And when they earn more money, it's like they're kinda winning in their own big game. Now let's talk about this particular company, Total. They're \\"French\\", which means they're from a country in Europe called France (the same place where Disneyland Paris is!) They're an \\"oil major,\\" just like your kitchen major is where we cook our food. But instead of cooking, what they do is really big and important - they find and sell oil. Oil is super important for a lot of things like cars, which need oil to run, just like you need food to play. So, Total has been doing pretty awesome in their game recently. They've made 20% more money this past year. Now, you might be wondering, \\"what's 20%?\\" Imagine if you had 10 candies and I gave you 2 more. Those 2 extra candies are 20% of your original 10 candies. Cool, right? Now, let's look at how much money Total has made. It's a lot - 5.1 billion. A billion is a tremendously big number, bigger than a million. If we imagine each dollar as a lego block, 1 billion of them would make a tower way taller than our house, maybe even taller than the clouds! The last year, Total made 4.2 billion. Again, using our lego example, it's like they had built a super tall tower, but this year their tower got even taller by 20%. So, at the end of their annual game, Total has more money which makes them a big winner this year! Just like when you score more points than your friends in your games, you become the winner.

In this case, we can combine the constants on the right side of the equation: -89d = -112 - 244 -89d = -356 Step 2: Isolate the variable d. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable, which in this case is -89: -89d / -89 = -356 / -89 This simplifies to: d = 4 Step 3: Check the solution. Plug the value of d back into the original equation to make sure it is correct: -89(4) = -112 - 244 -356 = -112 - 244 -356 = -356 Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution d = 4 is correct.

We'll do this by adding 40364 to both sides. This would give us: 269 * q = -269 2. Now, we want to find 'q' by itself. To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 269: q = -269 / 269 3. When we divide -269 by 269, we get: q = -1 So the answer is: q = -1.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: unprepared afterwards B: as dumb C: energetic afterwards The answer is:","completion":"A: unprepared afterwards According to the context provided, Jan skips breakfast and then realizes she has to take a late lunch later in the day. Skipping breakfast can have various impacts on an individual's mood and energy levels. Breakfast is an important meal, as it provides the body with essential nutrients and energy after a long period of fasting during sleep. Skipping breakfast can lead to lower energy levels, feelings of fatigue, and difficulty concentrating. In this situation, Jan may feel unprepared afterwards because she did not provide her body with the necessary fuel to function optimally throughout the morning and early afternoon. Without the energy and nutrients obtained from breakfast, Jan might find her ability to focus, concentrate, and maintain a consistent energy level throughout the day compromised. Feeling unprepared in this context means that Jan may not feel mentally and physically equipped to handle the challenges she faces throughout the day because of her skipped breakfast and the subsequent late lunch. Between the time she skipped breakfast and the time she eventually has her late lunch, she may experience hunger pangs, lack of concentration, irritability, or fatigue. Answer B, \\"as dumb,\\" and answer C, \\"energetic afterwards,\\" do not accurately reflect the feelings that Jan might experience based on the context provided. Feeling \\"dumb\\" is not a direct result of skipping breakfast or having a late lunch, although difficulty concentrating or forgetfulness could be side effects.

Hypothesis: The union has an objective of having at least 28,000 members in the construction division by 2005. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"Yes, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. The premise states that the union has made it an objective to have at least 28,000 members in the construction division by 2005 due to the aging workforce and the anticipated demand for work at power plants. This objective represents a 5.3 percent annual growth rate. The hypothesis, which claims that the union has an objective of having at least 28,000 members in the construction division by 2005, is a restatement of the goal mentioned in the premise. Therefore, it can be inferred that the hypothesis is directly supported by the premise provided. The aging workforce and growing demand for work at power plants, as mentioned in the premise, contribute to the need for an increased number of skilled workers in the construction industry. These factors provide the basis for the union's goal of expanding its construction division membership to at least 28,000 members by 2005. To achieve this objective, the union might take various steps, including: 1. Recruitment and training: Providing training programs, apprenticeships, and mentorship opportunities to attract new members to the construction division. This could involve partnering with educational institutions, vocational schools, and working alongside existing experienced construction workers. 2. Retention of existing members: Implementation of competitive benefits packages, pension plans, adequate safety measures, and a sense of community among the members can help in retaining existing members of the union. 3. Collaboration with power plant projects: Collaborating with companies and organizations involved in power plant projects can help create more opportunities for union members, leading to increased membership. 4. Outreach and advertising: Implementing targeted marketing strategies to raise awareness of the union's objectives and the potential benefits of joining the construction division among potential members. 5. Government and policymakers' engagement: Engaging with local, state, and federal government officials, as well as policymakers, can help secure support and funding for the union's efforts to expand its construction division membership. The 5.3 percent annual growth rate mentioned in the premise indicates that the union has a clear growth goal in place. By focusing on reaching this goal through the strategies mentioned above, the union can work towards fulfilling its objective of having at least 28,000 members in the construction division by 2005 as detailed in the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Turner's attorney, Colonel Bob Moorcroft, reveals that there is evidence that Turner is involved in the murders of two soldiers in Afghanistan, but Reacher believes she is being framed. Moorcroft also reveals an old acquaintance of Reacher, Candice Dutton, has filed a paternity suit against him, claiming he is the biological father of her 15-year-old daughter, Samantha Dutton. Reacher tries to reach out to Samantha, but she rebuffs him, believing he is after her biological mother due to her past as a prostitute. Moorcroft is later killed by an unknown assassin known as the Hunter. Reacher is framed for Moorcroft's murder and arrested and transported to the prison where Turner is being detained. Two hitmen arrive to kill her, but Reacher neutralizes them, rescues her and they escape to Morgan's house, having deduced he is involved in the conspiracy, to extract information. After they leave, the Hunter, revealed to be working with Morgan, kills Morgan and frames Reacher which he learns about from a friend, Sergeant Leach, when he asks her to investigate a military contractor.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Jacob is performing a chemistry experiment using two different liquids. Before starting the experiment, Jacob is told that liquid A molecules have strong intermolecular forces, while liquid B molecules have weak intermolecular forces. Jacob now has to decide how to use this information to guide him as he develops the experimental procedures for these two liquids. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which liquid will have lower viscosity? Hint: Vapor pressure is a measure of the pressure exerted by a gas above a liquid in a sealed container. While viscosity and surface tension increase as the strength of intermolecular forces increase, vapor pressure decreases . This is because the stronger the intermolecular forces are, the harder it is for liquid molecules to escape into the gas phase. Vapor pressure a measure of how much of a substance is in the gas phase when that substance is at equilibrium; that is, the number of molecules in the gas and liquid phases are not changing. The more molecules that are able to escape into the gas phase, the higher the vapor pressure. Vapor pressure is also proportional to temperature. As temperature increases, vapor pressure also increases. Answer:","completion":"Liquid B will have lower viscosity. To understand this answer, we need to dive deeper into the concepts of intermolecular forces, viscosity, surface tension, and vapor pressure. Intermolecular forces are the forces that hold molecules together in a substance. These forces include van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding, and dipole-dipole interactions. In the given scenario, liquid A has stronger intermolecular forces compared to liquid B, which has weak intermolecular forces. Viscosity is the measure of a liquid's resistance to flow or its internal friction, which is determined primarily by the strength of intermolecular forces. When a liquid has stronger intermolecular forces, its molecules have a higher tendency to stick together, resulting in a higher resistance to flow. Conversely, a liquid with weaker intermolecular forces will have molecules that can more easily overcome the attractive forces and move past each other. This results in lower internal friction, and hence, lower viscosity. Therefore, given that liquid B has weaker intermolecular forces, it will have a lower viscosity compared to liquid A. Surface tension is a measure of the energy required to increase the surface area of a liquid by a unit area, and it is also related to the strength of the intermolecular forces in the liquid. A liquid with strong intermolecular forces will have a higher surface tension because more energy is needed to break the attractions between the molecules at the surface. Vapor pressure is a measure of the pressure exerted by a gas above a liquid in a sealed container. When for a substance, the strength of intermolecular forces increases, the vapor pressure decreases. This is because stronger intermolecular forces make it more difficult for the molecules in the liquid phase to escape into the gas phase. Since liquid A has stronger intermolecular forces, its vapor pressure will be lower as compared to liquid B with weaker intermolecular forces. In conclusion, since viscosity decreases as the strength of intermolecular forces decrease, liquid B, with weak intermolecular forces, will have lower viscosity as compared to liquid A with strong intermolecular forces."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Who negotiated more favorable terms on behalf of the UK in the Destroyers For Bases Agreement? Context: In May 1940, the US requested base rights in Bermuda from the United Kingdom, but British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was initially unwilling to accede to the American request without getting something in return. In September 1940, as part of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, the UK granted the US base rights in Bermuda. Bermuda and Newfoundland were not originally included in the agreement, but both were added to it, with no war material received by the UK in exchange. One of the terms of the agreement was that the airfield the US Army built would be used jointly by the US and the UK (which it was for the duration of the war, with RAF Transport Command relocating there from Darrell's Island in 1943).

You must generate a detailed and long answer. How are most wars started? Why do wars happen? Do those questions have the same meaning? Pick from: - no; - yes;","completion":"No, the two questions do not have the same meaning, as they address different aspects of wars. The first question focuses on the causes of wars, while the second question is more about the reasons behind them. To address the first question, how most wars are started: Wars can be initiated for various reasons, including: 1. Territorial disputes: Many wars have been fought over disputes related to land or borders. Conflicting claims about territorial sovereignty often lead to conflicts, as countries seek to assert their control over specific regions. 2. Resource control: Wars can be initiated by nations seeking to secure access to crucial resources (such as oil, minerals, or water) that may be scarce or unequally distributed. 3. Political/power rivalries: National leaders might engage in wars to assert their political power or protect their interests. For example, the power struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War led to numerous proxy wars around the globe. 4. Ideological differences: Wars can be waged because of deep ideological differences between countries or groups. For instance, the spread of communism was a major factor in several conflicts during the 20th century, such as the Korean War and the Vietnam War. 5. Ethnic or religious tensions: Wars may arise due to long-standing ethnic or religious tensions between different groups or communities. An example of this is the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia during the 1990s. 6. Revenge or retaliation: Wars can be declared in response to acts of aggression, such as terrorist attacks or other acts of violence, to avenge the event or ensure that the attacker does not pose a further threat. Now, addressing the second question, why do wars happen: Wars happen for a variety of reasons, some of which are rooted in human nature and history. Factors contributing to the occurrence of wars can include the following: 1. Human aggression: There is a long-standing debate about whether humans are inherently aggressive or if aggression is learned culturally. Either way, aggression can play a significant role in conflicts between groups or nations. 2. Fear of attack: Protection and self-preservation are fundamental human instincts. Countries might go to war due to the perceived threat from another nation and the need to defend their territory and people. 3. Economic gain: War can be a means for a nation to secure access to valuable resources or to expand its markets, leading to an improved economy. 4. Nationalism: A strong sense of national pride and unity can lead to an \\"us versus them\\" mentality, which can contribute to the outbreak of war, particularly when combined with other factors. 5. Political power: Some leaders might see war as an opportunity to increase their popularity and power. In some cases, going to war can be a way to divert attention from domestic issues or consolidate political power. 6. Miscommunication and misunderstanding: Wars can also be triggered by miscommunications, misunderstandings, or lack of diplomatic channels. In these cases, conflicts may spiral out of control unintentionally, with the situation escalating to the point of war. In conclusion, while both questions address the topic of wars, they do not have the same meaning. Understanding the specific causes of wars and the reasons behind their occurrence can help nations and global communities work towards peace and conflict resolution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if fewer embryos develop, it may lead to less or smaller nests being constructed. The effect of this perturbation on the bird nest-building process can be direct or indirect. A direct effect could be that birds, upon realizing that fewer embryos are developing, might consciously or instinctively build smaller nests. They might collect fewer materials and create a more compact nest to accommodate the reduced number of offspring. An indirect effect could be related to the availability of resources in the environment and the amount of time and energy birds must devote to collecting nest-building materials. If birds are experiencing a decrease in embryo development, they might have to focus more on survival and reproduction strategies rather than investing time and energy in building larger, more elaborate nests. This focus on resources for survival may indirectly lead to the construction of smaller or fewer nests. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that a decrease in embryo development might have an effect on nest size or number, either directly by birds consciously or instinctively adjusting their nest-building behavior to accommodate fewer offspring, or indirectly by reallocating resources and energy towards other survival and reproduction strategies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: The particles of soup have greater average kinetic energy than the particles of water in the tub, explaining why the soup has a higher temperature. However, the mass of the water in the tub is much greater than the mass of the soup in the pot. This means that there are many more particles of water than soup. All those moving particles give the water in the tub greater total kinetic energy, even though their average kinetic energy is less. Therefore, the water in the tub has greater thermal energy than the soup. To compare the thermal energy of some other materials, go to the following URL and click on the interactive animation “Temperature and Thermal Energy.” and the situation: Alexander is conducting reactions in his college chemistry class. In his first reaction, reaction A, he uses a large amount of reactants. In his second reaction, reaction B, he uses a much smaller amount of reactants compared to reaction A.

Given the context: What will Quinn want to do next? Possible answers: Get a ride home from a friend, Buy a new car, Get back in the jeep and drive away Answer:","completion":"Given the context of the situation, it seems that Quinn's primary concern is resolving the issue with his Jeep's headlights. Taking this into consideration, the most appropriate action for Quinn to do next would likely be to get a ride home from a friend. Upon taking his vehicle to the shop, Quinn is likely expecting professional assistance in diagnosing and fixing the problem with his Jeep's headlights. It's reasonable to assume that the repair might take some time to complete, as the mechanic might need to examine the wiring, fuse, bulbs, or even the headlight switch itself to determine the root cause of the problem. With the car in the shop and not knowing how long it will take to complete the repairs, Quinn would not want to be stranded without transportation. Getting a ride home from a friend would be a practical choice, enabling him to continue with his day and not feel stuck while waiting for the mechanic to finish their work on his Jeep. While buying a new car might seem like an option, it is not practical in this situation. Purchasing a new vehicle can be a significant financial decision, and it would not make sense to impulsively buy a new car simply because of a temporary, fixable issue with the headlights. It is more logical and cost-effective to repair the current problem than to invest in an entirely new vehicle. Similarly, getting back in the Jeep and driving away is not a viable choice for Quinn. With the headlights not functioning properly, driving the vehicle would be a safety risk, especially at night or during poor weather conditions when visibility is critical. Additionally, operating a car with non-functioning headlights would likely be illegal in most jurisdictions, potentially resulting in fines or penalties for Quinn. In conclusion, based on the context provided, the most reasonable course of action for Quinn would be to seek a ride home from a friend while his Jeep is being repaired at the shop. This choice would ensure his safety, maintain his responsibilities, and allow him to address the headlight issue without resorting to more extreme or risky options."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: U.S. President Donald Trump filed his annual financial disclosure form this week with the Office of Government Ethics, the U.S. government's ethics watchdog. Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million. Trump plans to travel to Scotland during his visit to Britain this summer. Question: How long did the affair, if true, between Trump and the adult film star most likely continue?

Other messages from the teenager followed, including \\"You better not text me\\" and \\"Come to my room and take whatever you want,\\" according to an FBI affidavit released Wednesday. His friend took the texts as jokes, as if Tsarnaev found humor in the mere idea that he could be responsible for such horror.

Their actions ultimately helped in piecing together the evidence needed to identify and apprehend Tsarnaev, putting an end to the chapter of fear and uncertainty that had gripped Boston and the nation.

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — During his first year in office, South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s persistent pursuit of diplomacy, often working in parallel with U.S. President Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign, played a significant role in persuading North Korea to engage in talks to end its nuclear program. “Before the extreme measures might have been chosen by the United States, he gave diplomacy another chance to succeed,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University’s Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul. A year ago this week, Moon, a former human rights lawyer and candidate for the progressive Democratic Party, won a special presidential election held after former conservative President Park Geun-hye was impeached for her involvement in a bribery and corruption scandal. This year, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison during criminal trial related to the scandal in which she was charged with abuse of power, coercion and bribery. Moon assumed power at a time of increasing tensions, not just concerning North Korea’s accelerated nuclear and ballistic missile tests, but also China’s imposing of informal economic sanctions against South Korea for deploying the U.S. THAAD missile defense system, and the Trump administration’s talk of possible military action to end the North’s efforts to develop a nuclear armed intercontinental missile that could strike the U.S. mainland. In his inaugural address in May 2017, Moon promised to engage in shuttle diplomacy with Washington, Beijing and Pyongyang to work out a peaceful solution to the growing crisis. In a July speech in Berlin, President Moon laid out his vision for inter-Korean reconciliation that called for peaceful co-existence of the two Korean governments, but also said that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is “the absolute condition for peace.” But unlike past progressive South Korean governments that provided unconditional economic assistance, the Moon administration complied with economic sanctions in place and...

The lack of sufficient shelving not only made the educational environment appear cluttered and disorganized, but it also hindered the teacher's ability to efficiently locate and access specific textbooks when needed, ultimately causing considerable delays and disruptions in the overall teaching process. Moreover, many of the textbooks represented a considerable financial investment by the school, and they needed to be well-preserved in order to maximize their shelf life and minimize the need for frequent replacements, which could strain the already limited school budget. The current overcrowding of the existing shelves did not afford each textbook the space and ventilation required to prevent them from becoming damaged or compromised, which could potentially lead to an increased risk of deterioration over time. Furthermore, the insufficient shelving units prevented the teacher from adequately displaying various manuals, atlases, dictionaries, workbooks, and supplementary materials that were essential complements to the main textbooks, which would have otherwise facilitated the learning process and sparked students' curiosity while promoting independent exploration and discovery. Additionally, such a lack of organized storage spaces also reduced the overall aesthetic appeal of the classroom environment, which can significantly impact the students' motivation and engagement level, as research has demonstrated that an organized, comfortable, and visually appealing learning space can contribute to enhanced student learning outcomes and overall classroom satisfaction. It became increasingly evident that providing additional shelves to hold the textbooks would not only ensure that these valuable resources were properly stored, maintained, and displayed, but it would also play a crucial role in creating a more inviting, organized, and conducive learning environment, with positive repercussions on both the efficiency of the teacher and the performance and well-being of the students.

Minutes from the Fed's meeting on 28-29 July show one policymaker was ready to vote for a rate rise at the meeting. However, other policymakers remained concerned that inflation would remain weak because of the strong dollar and falling commodity prices. The Fed's key interest rate has been kept near zero since December 2008. There has been speculation that the Fed will raise rates at its meeting in September, and last month Fed chair Janet Yellen said she thought a rate rise this year was likely. In assessing the strength of the US economy, the Fed has been keeping an eye on the US jobs market - which has seen the unemployment rate fall to 5.3%. However, inflation is still below the Fed's target of 2%. The minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) July meeting said: \\"Most judged that the conditions for policy firming had not yet been achieved, but they noted that conditions were approaching that point.\\" The committee noted that the labour market \\"had continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment\\". However, when assessing inflation, it said that \\"some members continued to see downside risks to inflation from the possibility of further dollar appreciation and declines in commodity prices\\". The FOMC said it would continue to monitor inflation \\"closely, with almost all members indicating that they would need to see more evidence that economic growth was sufficiently strong and labour market conditions had firmed enough for them to feel reasonably confident that inflation would return to the committee's longer-run objective over the medium term\\". Inflation figures released earlier on Wednesday showed that consumer prices rose by 0.1% in July, and were 0.2% higher from a year ago. So-called core inflation, which ignores changes in food and energy prices, also rose 0.1% last month, but was up 1.8% over the year. The committee also cited China as a potential problem, saying that a \\"material slowdown\\" in the Chinese economy could affect the US economic outlook. The FOMC's meeting came before last week's action by China to weaken its currency. Following the release of the Fed's minutes, US stocks rallied briefly but then fell back, while the dollar weakened on the currency markets. \\"The Fed minutes don't rule out a September rate hike but they are certainly saying they want more evidence on the data,\\" Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital, told Reuters.","completion":"The people who help decide when to change the interest rates in America had a meeting, and most of them think they should wait a little longer, but one person wanted to increase the rate now."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Translate this to English?","completion":"Turkey continues to negotiate with the EU on the details of the Nabucco pipeline project. The Nabucco pipeline project, which is named after Giuseppe Verdi's opera \\"Nabucco,\\" is a regional natural gas pipeline system that was designed to transport natural gas from the resource-rich Eastern regions, like the Caspian and Middle East, to the energy-hungry European markets. The project aimed to diversify energy resources, enhance energy security, and reduce the dependence on Russian gas supplies. The proposed pipeline route passes through various countries such as Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary, eventually reaching Austria. The negotiations between Turkey and the European Union (EU) revolve around several aspects of the pipeline project. These aspects include the legal framework, financing, management, technical specifications, and even political matters considering the strategic importance of the pipeline in the region. It is crucial for Turkey and EU countries to agree upon fair and balanced terms in order to make the most of the pipeline project and ensure the stability and security of the natural gas supply in the long term. While the Nabucco project has faced obstacles such as cost overruns, delays, and competition from other pipeline projects, it remains a crucial topic for both the EU and Turkey. The negotiations highlight the importance of such a project in diversifying the sources of energy imports, ensuring the availability of competitive natural gas prices, and enhancing regional cooperation for a more sustainable and secure energy future. Both parties are expected to continue their discussions to reach a mutually beneficial outcome, as the success of the Nabucco project would greatly benefit all parties involved. The project has the potential to strengthen Turkey's role as an energy hub and could provide the EU member countries with a secure, reliable, and diverse source of natural gas, contributing significantly to the EU's energy security strategy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Stossel was born on March 6, 1947, in Chicago Heights, Illinois, the younger of two sons, to Jewish parents who left Germany before Hitler rose to power. They joined a Congregationalist church in the U.S., and Stossel was raised Protestant. He grew up on Chicago's affluent North Shore and graduated from New Trier High School. Stossel characterizes his older brother, Tom, as \\"the superstar of the family\\", commenting, \\"While I partied and played poker, he studied hard, got top grades, and went to Harvard Medical School.\\" Progressive organizations such as Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) and Media Matters for America (MMfA) have criticized Stossel's work, for what they perceived as a lack of balance of coverage and distortion of facts. For example, Stossel was criticized for a segment on his October 11, 1999, show during which he argued that AIDS research has received too much funding, \\"25 times more than on Parkinson's, which kills more people.\\" FAIR responded that AIDS had killed more people in the United States in 1999, but Stossel was speaking in more broad terms than a single country over a single year. In a February 2000 Salon.com feature on Stossel entitled \\"Prime-time propagandist\\", David Mastio wrote that Stossel has a conflict of interest in donating profits from his public speaking engagements to, among others, a non-profit called \\"Stossel in the Classroom\\" which includes material for use in schools, some of which uses material made by Stossel. University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith has alleged that Stossel, in his September 1999 special Is America #1?, used an out-of-context clip of Galbraith to convey the notion that Galbraith advocated the adoption by Europe of the free market economics practiced by the United States, when in fact Galbraith actually advocated that Europe adopt some of the United States' social benefit transfer mechanisms such as Social Security, which is the economically opposite view. Stossel denied any misrepresentation of Galbraith's views and stated that it was not his intention to convey that Galbraith agreed with all of the special's ideas. However, he re-edited that portion of the program for its September 2000 repeat, in which Stossel paraphrased, \\"Even economists who like Europe's policies, like James Galbraith, now acknowledge America's success.\\" Entity:","completion":"The text is about John F.

Context: The Quran most likely existed in scattered written form during Muhammad's lifetime. Several sources indicate that during Muhammad's lifetime a large number of his companions had memorized the revelations. Early commentaries and Islamic historical sources support the above-mentioned understanding of the Quran's early development. The Quran in its present form is generally considered by academic scholars to record the words spoken by Muhammad because the search for variants has not yielded any differences of great significance.[page needed] University of Chicago professor Fred Donner states that \\"...there was a very early attempt to establish a uniform consonantal text of the Qurʾān from what was probably a wider and more varied group of related texts in early transmission. [...] After the creation of this standardized canonical text, earlier authoritative texts were suppressed, and all extant manuscripts—despite their numerous variants—seem to date to a time after this standard consonantal text was established.\\" Although most variant readings of the text of the Quran have ceased to be transmitted, some still are. There has been no critical text produced on which a scholarly reconstruction of the Quranic text could be based. Historically, controversy over the Quran's content has rarely become an issue, although debates continue on the subject.","completion":"The text the professor is discussing is the Quran, and it is generally considered by academic scholars to record the words spoken by Muhammad."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As a child, he owned a bull's pizzle, which was given to him to use as a cattle whip. He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.The organs of farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while fishermen supplied those of pinnipeds and the smaller whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was able to continue to collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.Sigurður was assisted by his family, though not without some occasional embarrassment. His daughter Þorgerður recalls that she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen but arrived just as the workers were taking a lunch break: \\"Someone asked, 'What's in the basket?' I had to say, 'I'm collecting a frozen goat penis.' After that I said, 'I will never collect for you again.'\\" According to Sigurður, \\"Collecting penises is like collecting anything.

Options are: [-] No. [-] Yes. Answer:","completion":"No, \\"The title is a play on surgical scrubs and a term for a low-ranking person because at the beginning of the series, most of the main characters were medical interns.\\" would not be a reasonable answer to the question: \\"How did Scrubs end?\\" This statement explains the meaning behind the title of the show, but does not provide any information about the show's ending. A more detailed and long answer to the question would be: Scrubs, a popular medical comedy-drama series that aired from 2001 to 2010, follows the lives of medical interns and residents at the fictional Sacred Heart Hospital. The show concluded at the end of its ninth season. However, the de facto main ending of the series is considered to be the season 8 finale, titled \\"My Finale,\\" as season 9 acted more as a spinoff focusing on new characters and a different setting. The season 8 finale revolves around the protagonist, John \\"J.D.\\" Dorian (played by Zach Braff), as he bids farewell to Sacred Heart Hospital. Throughout the episode, J.D. reflects on his relationships with the various characters he has encountered during the series, including his best friend Christopher Turk (played by Donald Faison), love interest Elliot Reid (played by Sarah Chalke), mentor Perry Cox (played by John C. McGinley), and hospital chief Bob Kelso (played by Ken Jenkins). J.D.'s departure from Sacred Heart is marked by emotional goodbyes with his friends, coworkers, and even the enigmatic janitor, who reveals his true name. As J.D. walks down the hallway for the last time, he envisions his future with Elliot as they celebrate significant milestones, such as their wedding, having children, and growing old together. A fitting end to the series, J.D.'s exit parallels his entrance into the hospital at the start of the show. As he leaves, he unfolds a screen displaying a personal message from the janitor, revealing that J.D. has made a lasting impact on the hospital and those around him. Consequently, the season 8 finale of Scrubs offers a sense of closure for the show's main cast, but it also leaves some open-ended possibilities in the lives of the characters. Season 9, though it received mixed reviews, continued with a primarily new cast and shifted its setting to med school. The new series protagonist, Lucy Bennett (played by Kerry Bishé), studies under the mentorship of Dr. Cox and Dr. Turk, who return as series regulars. Despite the altered focus, the series retained its signature blend of humor, drama, and medical education until its ultimate conclusion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"no they haven't\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"We need to prepare for the possibility of them doing it in the future.\\"?","completion":"The premise \\"No, they haven't\\" suggests that, in the context of the conversation, a certain action or event has not yet occurred. This suggests that the subjects 'they' have not yet performed an expected or suggested activity. However, the inferred implications about the hypothesis \\"We need to prepare for the possibility of them doing it in the future\\" are not definitively settled by this particular premise. The premise itself isn't directly linked to a predictive action of those being referenced. It's purely factual and represents a state of things at the present moment or in the past. The hypothesis, on the other hand, is forward-looking and anticipatory in nature. The hypothesis suggests a need for preparedness based on a possible future action by the subjects referred to as 'they.' Whether the premise implies this hypothesis depends highly on the context of what the aforementioned \\"it\\" actually is and the likelihood of 'them' pursuing this action in the future. For instance, if 'they' are a group of scientists who have not yet tried a particular experiment, and there is reason to believe they will in the future, then the premise could suggest the relevance of the hypothesis. However, if 'they' are a group of people that have historically shown no interest or intent in the action (let's say, climbing Mount Everest), then although the premise is true, the anticipation of them doing 'it' in the future based on the premise might be less probable. So, in essence, \\"No, they haven't\\" and \\"We need to prepare for the possibility of them doing it in the future\\" could be related if context and logical progression indicate that the particular action not yet done is likely or even possible in the future. But the premise itself doesn't inherently entail the hypothesis. To determine if the premise supports the hypothesis, we would need additional contextual information about the specifics of 'it', the capability or intentions of 'they', and their relationship to 'it'. Moreover, in a logical or argumentative structure, additional premises may be required to firmly ground the hypothesis, such as \\"They are considering doing it\\", or \\"There is a likelihood that they will do it in the future\\", or \\"There is a precedent of others in similar situations doing it later\\". So, the statement \\"No, they haven't\\" can provide useful information about past or present state, but additional support would be necessary to robustly imply the forward-looking hypothesis \\"We need to prepare for the possibility of them doing it in the future\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On 21 January 1818, Friedrich married Caroline Bommer, the twenty-five-year-old daughter of a dyer from Dresden. The couple had three children, with their first, Emma, arriving in 1820. Physiologist and painter Carl Gustav Carus notes in his biographical essays that marriage did not impact significantly on either Friedrich's life or personality, yet his canvasses from this period, including Chalk Cliffs on Rügen—painted after his honeymoon—display a new sense of levity, while his palette is brighter and less austere. Human figures appear with increasing frequency in the paintings of this period, which Siegel interprets as a reflection that \\"the importance of human life, particularly his family, now occupies his thoughts more and more, and his friends, his wife, and his townspeople appear as frequent subjects in his art.\\"Around this time, he found support from two sources in Russia. In 1820, the Grand Duke Nikolai Pavlovich, at the behest of his wife Alexandra Feodorovna, visited Friedrich's studio and returned to Saint Petersburg with a number of his paintings, an exchange that began a patronage that continued for many years. Not long thereafter, the poet Vasily Zhukovsky, tutor to Alexander II, met Friedrich in 1821 and found in him a kindred spirit. For decades Zhukovsky helped Friedrich both by purchasing his work himself and by recommending his art to the royal family; his assistance toward the end of Friedrich's career proved invaluable to the ailing and impoverished artist.

According to the Knox County Sheriff David Shaffer, Officer Thomas Cottrell was killed in the line of duty late Sunday night. Sheriff Shaffer said around 11:20 p.m. Sunday, the Knox County dispatch center received a call stating that police officers in Danville were in danger. The woman told dispatchers that her ex-boyfriend, Herschel Ray Jones had left with weapons and was looking to kill an officer. Dispatchers then tried to contact the Danville officer on duty, but were unsuccessful. Deputies from the Sheriff’s Office then searched the village. Shortly before midnight, deputies found the body of Officer Thomas Cottrell on the ground behind the municipal building. His gun had been taken and his cruiser was missing. Investigators say Jones was seen running from a residence on East Washington Street around 1:36 a.m. Monday. After a foot chase, Jones was taken into custody. The suspect’s brother, John Jones, told NBC4 he spoke to Herschel Jones minutes before he was taken into custody. He said Herschel had taken a quantity of an anti-anxiety drug called Klonopin. “He was out of his mind on drugs,” Jones said. “He already had done what he done. He still didn’t admit it to me though – that’s how far out of his mind he was. He completely went over the edge.” John Jones says family members called Herschel’s parole officer last week to report that he had guns and drugs and was at risk of doing something bad. John Jones says nothing was done. Jones says his brother had asked judges on several occasions to send him to a mental institution rather than to prison. He says those requests were denied. A woman who was outside of the residence was also taken into custody and later released. The Knox County Sheriff’s Office is investigating the incident with the help of the Ohio Bureau of Investigation. Danville is a village in Knox County with a population of just over 1,000 people. The police department employs six people and Chief Daniel J. Weckesser was appointed to the job on January 4. A GoFundMe page has been set up for Cottrell’s family.

Police say dispatchers received a call from a woman in Danville around 11:20 p.m. on Sunday, saying police were in danger because her ex-boyfriend, 32-year-old Herschel Jones, was armed and “looking to kill an officer.” Danville is a small village about 60 miles northeast of Columbus. In response, dispatchers tried to make contact with Danville Officer Thomas Cottrell who was on patrol, but were unsuccessful. A statewide alert was issued, and deputies from the Knox County Sheriff’s Office also searched the village, but couldn’t locate the officer. Only Cottrell's hat, which had been covered in blood, was located during the search. Around 20 minutes later, Cottrell’s body was found shot to death behind the Danville Municipal Building. His service weapon and cruiser had been stolen. Just after 1:30 a.m., the alleged killer was spotted running from a home on East Washington Street.

Cottrell’s death marks the first for an officer in the line of duty in Ohio in 2016. ||||| Chief of Police Daniel J. Weckesser Letter From the Chief The Danville Police Department experienced many changes during 2016. Upon the retirement of Chief Monte Vance, I was appointed Chief of Police January 04th, 2016. Then on January 17th, 2016 our Department was dramatically affected by the tragic shooting death of Officer Thomas Cottrell Jr. Our small Department could have easily dissolved but through the support and prayers of everyone we continue to slowly recover. The Department has a strengthened commitment to provide the best police protection to our community. We are a dedicated force to all we serve and will continue to do our best to earn your respect and honor. This yearly report is to inform you of statistics and enlighten you as to notable changes in 2016. In 2016, K-9 Officer Lasko was officially retired after 10 plus years of service. K-9 Officer TC joined the Department with the certification of K-9 handler Sgt. Lishness. K-9 Officer Diesel was sworn to serve with myself as his handler. Officers Mark Perkins and Joshua Abshire joined the Department and with the certification of Officer Perkins, K-9 Officer Rezza joined as his partner. With the assistance of the Columbus Police Dept. Mounted Unit and the Ohio State University Mounted Unit, Corporal Lisa Lyons helped to form our first Mounted Police Unit which consists of Corporal Lyons, Officer Kevin Henthorn and the two horses “Casino” and “Levi”. The Mounted Patrol will be used for parades, special events, and community outreach. Additionally we intend to initiate a Mounted Search and Rescue Team. We purchased a new police cruiser equipped with fresh graphics that are now displayed on all three cruisers. Our Department replaced the outdated computers and the phone system in our office. The new phone system allows the public to make direct contact with an officer or leave a message to any officer as needed. In addition, we managed to update and replace our uniforms. All units received additional training and/or “specialized” training which enhances the officer(s) with additional skills and knowledge in the performance of their duties. Looking forward to 2017 and beyond, I would like to assure the Community that the Danville Police Department will continue to provide the best service possible. We work for you, the people. We will strive to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America, the laws of the State of Ohio and the Village of Danville. We will not be influenced by anything, anyone, any agencies or organizations who attempt to hinder the performance of our duties as your Police Department. We plan to continue educating and equipping the department in order to provide the best possible service to our community. Continued dialogue with our citizens will help to educate and inform each one of you to the many dangers and types of crime that could possibly affect our community. It is our goal to establish a program that will allow officers more one- on- one time with our youth in the schools and in our churches. This program will be created in the memory of our fallen brother, Officer Cottrell. Danville is not immune to the impact of illegal drug use. Many people in our community have been affected in some way by the increased drug abuse issues. In 2017, a top priority of our Police Department will be combating the illegal drugs infiltrating our community. Many additional crimes can be alleviated with the eradication of the illegal drugs. We will continue to build community relations by educating the public on protecting themselves and their property from criminal acts. Our police department’s office is extremely small, which creates many issues. We are investigating different options for expanding our departmental offices. The goal is to remodel or possibly build a new structure in the future. Danville Police Department Front L-R Cpl. Kevin Henthorn - Sgt. Lisa Lyons - Ofc. Josh Abshire Rear L-R Lt.

Jones has a lengthy criminal record and has tried to claim he was legally insane in one case. According to Knox County court records, he was charged in several cases with breaking and entering, burglary, receiving stolen property and carrying a concealed weapon. He pleaded not guilty to a 2011 case by reason of insanity, but later changed his plea to guilty.

Danville Officer Thomas Cottrell was gunned down shortly before midnight behind the Danville Municipal Building, Knox County Sheriff David Shaffer said. His service weapon and cruiser were missing. Cottrell's cruiser was later found approximately half a mile from his body. The suspected gunman, Herschel Ray Jones III, was taken into custody around 1:30 a.m. after he briefly ran from officers. Knox County Prosecutor Chip McConville says he expects Jones to face a murder charge, but it's not clear how soon it would be filed. Court records show Jones, 32, has multiple convictions dating back to 2001 for breaking and entering, burglary, receiving stolen property and carrying a concealed weapon. In a 2011 case, he pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity before changing his plea to guilty. Ohio prison records show he served nearly four years for the 2011 convictions of receiving stolen property and possession of chemicals for manufacture of drugs. He was released last April. Shaffer said authorities received a call at approximately 11:20 p.m. from a woman saying police officers in Danville were in danger, and her ex-boyfriend, Jones, had weapons and was looking to kill an officer. Shaffer said dispatchers tried to make contact with Cottrell, but were unable to do so. That prompted the Knox County Sheriff's Office to search the village. Franklin County Sheriff Chief Deputy Jim Gilbert confirmed the officer's death on social media.

At 1.17am, before the unruly remnants of the Flushing Meadows crowd, he finally succumbed to the barrage of Novak Djokovic in their US Open quarter final, going down 7-6 6-7 6-2, 6-4 in three hours and 31 minutes. By the end Murray's spirit was willing but the legs had weakened, as he paid the price for taking three and a half hours longer to get to this match than his opponent.

Verbal volley: Andy Murray lets out his frustration as Novak Djokovic starts to assume control of the match. Down and out: Andy Murray appeared to be feeling the pace as the quarter-final wore on. Departing: Andy Murray salutes the crowd as he leaves the Arthur Ashe stadium. This result was not unexpected, but for sustained periods he stood toe-to-toe with the world’s best player, whose standards he must aspire to if he is to re-attain the success of 2012-13. Murray said afterwards: 'He was definitely physically fresher, the pace of my serve slowed down towards the end. My back towards the end stiffened up, it is physically extremely demanding to play him. I tried to hang in at the end but was a little bit disappointed how my body reacted, I have trained hard. 'There was some good stuff in the first two sets, I was down in them but I fought back, I just didn’t play a good first tiebreak.' Djokovic added: 'We both gave our best. At times the tennis was not that nice, we made a lot of unforced errors, but it was due to the very physical battle in the opening two and a half sets. 'I didn't expect any less knowing I was going to face Andy. The last five times we played, it was always over three or four hours. I'm very glad to get through to another semi-final.' Neither player was flawless but there were plenty of magnificent exchanges which frequently pushed the Serb to his limits. Djokovic, who now plays Kei Nishikori, will surely win this event now. There were ample unforced errors and both players went through sporadic lapses and, especially in Murray’s case, the return much outshone the serve. There was also much to admire. The Scot’s forehand was particularly potent, and he will contemplate what might have happened if he had avoided one of those lapses in the opening tiebreak. Murray fought hard into the early hours. Ultimately, however, Djokovic with his seven breaks of serve bossed proceedings and from the second tiebreak never looked like losing. Murray at least knows he has created something to build on. Shock and awe: Andy Murray was appeared to be having trouble with his eyes during the game. Tunnel vision: Andy Murray was seen struggling with his sight during the game.

Unstoppable: Andy Murray reacts after Novak Djokovic slams down another serve. Gracious: Andy Murray congratulates Novak Djokovic on his win after the match had finished. Two years after their epic final in 2012, the former junior rivals were reunited on the same court at the Arthur Ashes Stadium, this time with one of them ranked as the world’s top player and the other the No 8 seed. Murray's lower than normal seed being the reason why they were now meeting in the last eight. That is not by accident, Murray is taking small steps on his way back from surgery while Djokovic has rediscovered the art of winning Grand Slams after a period of near misses. On a balmy night, the Arthur Ashe Stadium was packed to the gunwales and the 27-year-old Scot made the perfect start when his piercing returns resulted in an opening break. He was always likely to make inroads on the Djokovic serve but protecting his own was going to be the problem. He had dropped it thirteen times coming into this match and the fourteenth was not far behind as Djokovic immediately levelled. The inability to gain free points against someone who returns even better than he does saw him go 1-4 down - but the damage was swiftly repaired. The Serb, ever the rolled up ball of Balkan anger, started ranting at himself in the seventh game and was pressured into several errors to allow Murray back in. The Scot’s big chance came when be forced a break point at 4-4, but a finely angled serve meant he could only just lay a racket on it. Breather: Andy Murray looked to be feeling the pace during parts of the match on Wednesday. Plenty to ponder: Daniel Vallverdu and Amelie Mauresmo watch on as Andy Murray crashes out. Support: Andy Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears was in attendance and roaring her man on. By the time the tiebreak came around they had won 45 points each, but Murray could not recover from a dismal start - he hit a double fault followed by a pedestrian 77 mph second serve that got the full treatment. The tiebreak was over in a blink of an eye, with the Serb taking it 7-1, and Djokovic looked to be in full control when a run of 12 out of 14 points saw him go 3-1 up, with Murray's net play notably more hesitant than in previous rounds. But again Murray’s superb returns meant he was not finished and after breaking back for 4-4 - the top seed rightly being given a time violation - he forced a set point at 6-5. But he could not get enough on the return, was forced back and his attempted lob was put away. The tiebreak was the inverse of the first, Murray far more purposeful and Djokovic ended up slapping errors in frustration by the end as he went down 7-1. Eyes on the prize: but Andy Murray ultimately fell short and crashed out of the tournament. Hand it to him: Novak Djokovic gestures to the umpire as a point goes against him. Full crowd: The Arthur Ashe stadium was nearly full as spectators stayed up for the main game. While there were frequent mistakes on both sides, Djokovic stayed strong to stem any momentum and broke for 3-1 in the third before holding off two break points when his opponent pulled the trigger too early in draining exchanges. There was a devil-may-care attitude about Murray for the rest of the set as he focussed on energy conservation. Murray began this tournament cramping against Robin Haase and ended it in a similar state, his body creaking at the end as he sought to hold in the fourth. He had a break point at the start but the body language sagged and he could not seriously threaten after that. The break of serve to seal it came entirely on cue. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"The article discusses a tennis match between Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray at the US Open. Here are some important points from the article: 1. Andy Murray lost to Novak Djokovic in the US Open quarter final. The match was a physical one and took three hours and 31 minutes, with Djokovic winning 7-6 6-7 6-2, 6-4. 2. Even though he lost, the way he played reminded everyone of why he was a Grand Slam winner in the past, and gives hope for his possible future wins. However, Murray's physical strain was evident as he had spent three and a half hours more than Djokovic getting to this match resulting in weaker legs by the end. 3. Murray expressed disappointment with his body's reaction at the end of the match, even though he claimed to have trained hard. His serve speed also slowed, and his back stiffened up towards the end of the match. 4. Novak Djokovic admitted that both players gave their best even though there were many unforced errors due to the physical struggle in the opening two and a half sets. 5. Djokovic, who now faces Kei Nishikori, is expected to win the tournament. Even though he made many unforced errors, he managed to seize control in seven service games. He was not threatened after winning the second tie break. 6. The article suggests that Andy Murray can however feel, that he has created something to build upon. His forehand was particularly potent and he managed to stay in the match against the world's top-seeded player, which could hold potential for his future games. 7. In 2012, Murray and Djokovic faced each other in the final of the same tournament, but this time, they met in the last eight due to Murray's lower seed. This lower seeding is attributable to his slow comeback from surgery. 8. Lastly, the crowd at the Arthur Ashes Stadium witnessed a physically demanding match where both players had their moments of excellence and flaws, ultimately Djokovic emerged little stronger and seized the victory."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Attach the yarn to your hook using a slip knot, then work a foundation of chain stitches in multiples of 10. In other words, the foundation chain can consist of 10 chains, 20 chains, 30 chains, 40 chains, 50 chains, etc. The length of your foundation chain will be the final length of your project. At the end of your foundation chain, work two more chain stitches to serve as a turning chain for your next row. Half double crochet once into the second chain from your hook. When counting chains, do not count the loop currently on your hook. To create the first shell of your first official row, you will need to work a series of treble crochets and half double crochets. Skip four chains in your foundation. Work nine treble crochets into the fifth chain. Skip another four chains in your foundation. Half double crochet once into the next chain. Repeat the previous step across the full length of your foundation, stopping only once you reach the end of the row. This completes the first official row. If desired, you can change yarn colors after the end of your first row. Doing so is not necessary, though. Chain three, then work one treble crochet into the front posts of each of the next four stitches. Keep the last loop of each treble crochet on the hook. After the last treble crochet, yarn over the hook and pull the yarn-over through all the loops on the hook. Chain four again. Work one half double crochet into the next stitch in the previous row. Work a series of treble clusters, chains, and half double crochets across the entire second row, stopping before you work the last five stitches. For each group: Chain four. Work a front post treble crochet into each of the next four stitches, leaving the last loop on the hook after each one. Half double crochet once, then work another four treble crochets across the next four stitches. Leave the last loop on the hook after each stitch, then yarn over and pull it through the all the loops on your hook after the final stitch. This counts as a nine-stitch shell cluster. Chain four. Work one half double crochet into the front post of the next stitch. Chain four, then work a treble crochet into the front posts of each of the final five stitches in the row, keeping the last loop on the hook for each one. Yarn over and pull through all the loops after completing the last one. This completes the row. Chain four, then turn the work over. Work four treble crochets into the top of the first cluster, then half double crochet once into the next half double crochet. Create connecting shells across the entire row, stopping just before the last cluster. For each connecting shell: Work nine treble crochets into the center of the next cluster. Half double crochet into the next half double crochet. For the final cluster of the row, work five treble crochets into the top of the cluster. You can change colors at the end of this row or keep going with the color you currently have. At the end of this row, you should also chain one and turn the work over. Work one half double crochet into the first stitch, then work a series of nine-stitch cluster shells across the rest of the row until you reach the end and finish the row. For each group: Chain four. Work a nine-stitch shell cluster over the next nine stitches, following the same procedure used to make the nine-stitch shell clusters in your second row. Chain four. Work one half double crochet into the next stitch. At the very end of the row, chain one and turn the work over. At the start of the fifth row, half double crochet into the first half double crochet stitch. Work across the rest of the row using a series of treble crochets and half double crochets. For each connecting shell: Work nine treble crochets into the center of the first cluster. Half double crochet into the next half double crochet. Continue until you reach the end of the row. If desired, change colors at the end of this row. You've completed a full set of Bavarian crochet at this point. Repeat rows two, three, four, and five until the project reaches your desired width. If you're changing colors, do so at the end of each odd numbered row. When your project is finished, cut the yarn, leaving a tail 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) long. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten off and finish the work. Weave the secured tail into the back of the work to hide it. Summary:","completion":"To create a Bavarian crochet project, start with a foundation chain in multiples of 10 and add two chains for the turning chain.

It is three days until the celebration of the year 3000. A Square, attorney at law, struggles to instruct his grand daughter, A Hexagon, in the art of sight recognition. The lesson is interrupted by his brother B Squares arrival. As clerk to President Circle, B Square wants to warn his big brother to stay home that afternoon while there is a meeting at the Senate of the Great Southern Republic of Flatland.The Senate session has been called to discuss the increasing hostilities between the Chromatist movement and the government. Senator Chromatistes is the irregular polygon who leads this rebellious movement that wants to legalize the right of Flatlanders to color their sides as they see fit. Traditionally a taboo practice, the laws were previously relaxed somewhat which emboldened the Chromatists to demand legalization against the will of the majority. The Great Southern Republic distinguishes itself from its enemy, the Northern Kingdom, by its stances on Chromatism and Irregulars along with a democratic government. Relaxing the laws has already been perceived as weakness by the Northern Kingdom who are massing on the borders.Unable to heed his brothers advice, A Square meets with his new client, the first female charged as a Chromatist and on his way home finds himself embroiled in the melee issuing forth from the Senate. President Circles soldiers have assassinated Senator Chromatistes along with his supporters thus sparking a riot that has spilled into the streets of the city.

Washington (CNN) -- The Pacific island nation of Palau has agreed to take in 17 Chinese Muslims held at the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the country's ambassador to the United States said Wednesday. The map shows the Pacific island nation of Palau in relation to China. Details of the transfer are still being worked out, Ambassador Hersey Kyota told CNN. But Kyota said his country, a former U.S. Pacific trust territory, has agreed to take in the ethnic Uighur detainees \\"for humanitarian reasons\\" and because of the \\"special relationship\\" between Palau and the United States. U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly would not comment on the announcement, telling reporters, \\"We're still involved in ongoing discussions.\\" The agreement includes some U.S. aid for Palau, Kyota said, but he said those details remained to be worked out as well. The country, with a population of about 20,000, is about 1,000 miles southeast of Manila, Philippines, and about 4,600 miles west of Hawaii.

This family was known as the Longxi Li lineage (Li lineage; 隴西李氏), which includes the Tang poet Li Bai. The Tang Emperors also had Xianbei maternal ancestry, from Emperor Gaozu of Tang's Xianbei mother, Duchess Dugu. Li Yuan was Duke of Tang and governor of Taiyuan, modern Shanxi, during the Sui dynasty's collapse, which was caused in part by the Sui failure to conquer the northern part of the Korean peninsula during the Goguryeo–Sui War. He had prestige and military experience, and was a first cousin of Emperor Yang of Sui (their mothers were sisters). Li Yuan rose in rebellion in 617, along with his son and his equally militant daughter Princess Pingyang (d. 623), who raised and commanded her own troops. In winter 617, Li Yuan occupied Chang'an, relegated Emperor Yang to the position of Taishang Huang or retired emperor, and acted as regent to the puppet child-emperor, Yang You. On the news of Emperor Yang's murder by General Yuwen Huaji on June 18, 618, Li Yuan declared himself the emperor of a new dynasty, the Tang.Li Yuan, known as Emperor Gaozu of Tang, ruled until 626, when he was forcefully deposed by his son Li Shimin, the Prince of Qin.

Here is a question about this article: The popularization of the Jewish chant may be found in the writings of the Jewish philosopher Philo, born 20 BCE. Weaving together Jewish and Greek thought, Philo promoted praise without instruments, and taught that \\"silent singing\\" (without even vocal chords) was better still. This view parted with the Jewish scriptures, where Israel offered praise with instruments by God's own command (2 Chronicles 29:25). The shofar is the only temple instrument still being used today in the synagogue, and it is only used from Rosh Chodesh Elul through the end of Yom Kippur. The shofar is used by itself, without any vocal accompaniment, and is limited to a very strictly defined set of sounds and specific places in the synagogue service.

Premise: \\"Annual investment is the full cost of the investment.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Annual investment is not equivalent to the cost of the investment.\\" true?","completion":"Based on the provided premise, \\"Annual investment is the full cost of the investment,\\" the hypothesis \\"Annual investment is not equivalent to the cost of the investment\\" appears to be false. Before explaining further, it is crucial to define and understand the terms 'annual investment' and 'cost of investment.' Annual investment refers to the total amount of money an investor puts into a particular investment or investment portfolio over a one-year period. This could include contributions to retirement accounts, selecting individual stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, or more broadly towards any investment that the investor has committed to grow and develop with their funds over time. On the other hand, the cost of investment refers to the overall financial outlay required in acquiring an asset or taking part in a specific investment endeavor. This could include, but is not limited to, the purchase price, transaction charges, taxes, and any additional expenses incurred while acquiring the asset or managing the investment. Based on the premise, which equates annual investment to the full cost of the investment, there is a direct correlation between the two terms. This means that when we refer to one, we are essentially speaking about the other, as they are indicated to share an identical value. Therefore, if we accept the premise as true, the hypothesis \\"annual investment is not equivalent to the cost of the investment\\" would be false. The premise suggests that, at least within the context provided, annual investment and cost of investment are considered equal, so any hypothesis stating otherwise would contradict the original statement. However, it is important to note that, in practice, the cost of an investment and the money an investor contributes annually to their investments may not always be equivalent. Investments can have varying upfront costs or ongoing expenses that might not be included in the annual investment but will impact the overall cost of the investment. In such cases, it could be argued that the hypothesis holds some truth. That said, the conclusion we draw within the context of this specific premise remains unchanged: the hypothesis \\"annual investment is not equivalent to the cost of the investment\\" is considered to be false when based on the provided statement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Heat supplies the energy that causes motion. The deeper you go into toward the Earths core, the hotter it gets. At the core it is really hot. All that heat tries to rise toward the surface. In the Mantle, the rock is partially melted and is able to move. As it is heated, the material in the mantle moves toward the surface. As the mantle material rises, it cools. When it reaches the Earths crust, it is mostly stopped. A little of the material can break through the surface, but not all. Instead, it begins to move horizontally. The mantle material moves horizontally away from a mid-ocean ridge crest. Toward the surface, the mantle material starts to cool. As it cools it sinks back down into the mantle.

News article: About New York - James Webb Telescope Takes Baby Pictures of Universe - NYTimes.com Richard Perry/The New York Times A model of the James Webb Space Telescope, on display at Battery Park; the actual telescope will allow us to see much closer to the beginning of time. Here was a model for the next great time machine, just over John Grunsfeld’s shoulder in a field in Battery Park: a giant telescope that will be launched in 2014 and sent one million miles from Earth. By looking deep into space, it will collect light and images that have been traveling since nearly the beginning of the universe, and send them back here. Dr. Grunsfeld, trim and compact at 51, has floated in space for hours at a time, miles above the Earth, fixing the Hubble Space Telescope. At one time, the mirrors on the Hubble were not working properly, and it was thought to be the world’s highest and most expensive lemon. Instead, when Dr. Grunsfeld and his colleagues finished their repairs, it was able to take pictures from billions of years ago. Scientific theories about the dawn of the universe and early galaxies had to give way to actual data from the Hubble. Its successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, will be 80 feet long, 37 feet wide and 40 feet high. The designers say it will be powerful enough to reveal the details on a penny at a distance of 24 miles. Light from the moon takes less than two seconds to reach Earth, 8.5 minutes from the sun and 55,000 years from close galaxies. “Instead of looking at toddler pictures of the universe, we will be able to look at baby pictures,” Dr. Grunsfeld said. “The Hubble has seen back 13 billion years, into galaxies 600 or 700 million years after the Big Bang. Hopefully, the Webb will get us back to 200 million years after the Bang.” The Webb model will be on view in Battery Park until Sunday, as part of the city’s World Science Festival. Other than throwing ticker-tape parades for astronauts and graduating smart kids from schools that specialize in science, the city rarely has much direct contact with the American space program. On Friday night, Dr. Grunsfeld, who retired as NASA’s chief scientist at the beginning of the year, and other astronomers will set up 100 telescopes in Battery Park for star gazing. “Saturn should be up” then, he said. “Saturn is a huge favorite of mine.” In its current state, the Webb model is not an especially graceful-looking structure, and it is hard to imagine how it will be able to travel a million miles. The bottom of it consists of a sun shade, an umbrella about the size of a tennis court. “The umbrella will be closed up until it’s finished traveling,” Dr. Grunsfeld said. “Then it will open up like origami.” The purpose of the sun shield is to keep the telescope cool; it will operate at 40 degrees Kelvin, or nearly minus 400 degrees Fahrenheit, Dr. Grunsfeld said. By way of comparison to suntan lotion, the umbrella will provide a sun protection factor of 1.2 million. “All the instruments together will use about the same amount of electricity as a hair dryer, and that will come from solar power,” said Blake Bullock, a manager at Northrop Grumman, the principal contractor building the telescope for NASA. “Once it is out there, you will have these photons that have been traveling for 12 billion years without hitting anything until they run into” the Webb telescope. Stars formed out of helium and hydrogen; nuclear fusion got turned on and created carbon and other elements; many explosions later, organic chemistry, life and humans came along. “We have zinc in our vitamins,” Dr. Grunsfeld said. “Why zinc? It comes from the supernova explosions. To account for what we’re made of, you have to have three supernova explosions.” THE power of the telescope is that it can answer the deepest questions about how things came to be. “We don’t know why the Big Bang happened,” Dr. Grunsfeld said. “In my job, I think about what happened right after that. But look at this: furry mammals on Earth can build a telescope that can look back to the beginning of time.” A couple of hundred students gathered to look at the Webb model on Tuesday morning. Brian Greene, a physicist and author who is one of the organizers of the festival, asked those in the audience how many of them believed that there was life out there, beyond the Earth. A good majority of the crowd, students, teachers, scientists, raised their hands. Then Dr. Grunsfeld stood. How many, he wanted to know, believed that aliens from out there were walking the Earth. This time, only a few raised their hands. “If there are aliens, they’ll be here in New York,” Dr. Grunsfeld said.

Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: Pokémon: The First Movie (Pocket Monsters the Movie: Mewtwo's Counterattack) is the first Pokémon anime film directed by Kunihiko Yuyama, the chief director of the Pokémon television series. It is the first theatrical release in the Pokémon franchise.It was released in Japan on July 18, 1998. The English-language adaptation, produced by 4Kids Entertainment and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures (under its Kids' WB banner), was released in North America on November 12, 1999.The film primarily consists of three segments: Pikachu's Vacation, a 21-minute feature focusing on the series mascot Pikachu; Origin of Mewtwo, a 10-minute featurette that functions as a prologue to the main feature; and Mewtwo Strikes Back, the main 75 minute film feature. The North American version omitted Origin of Mewtwo from the package before its U.S. theatrical run due to its dark nature, as the target MPAA rating was G; the first two minutes were restored in the film's release on VHS and DVD as The Story of Mewtwo's Origin. The featurette was eventually dubbed and restored as a special feature in the U.S. release of the direct-to-video follow-up film sequel Pokémon: Mewtwo Returns as The Uncut Story of Mewtwo's Origin.As Pokémon was extremely popular when the film was released, it was a box office success worldwide. The First Movie topped the box office charts in its opening weekend, and eventually grossed US163.6 million worldwide, despite negative reviews from film critics.

A: John's preferred plan was to use Poitou as a base of operations, advance up the Loire valley to threaten Paris, pin down the French forces and break Philip's internal lines of communication before landing a maritime force in the Duchy itself. Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"A: John's preferred plan involved using Poitou as a base of operations for his strategic movements. With this starting point, he aimed to advance up the Loire valley toward Paris, which would force the French forces to confront him, disrupting their coordinated efforts. By doing so, John hoped to break Philip Augustus's internal lines of communication, undermining the unity and effectiveness of the French forces. Additionally, John planned to deploy a maritime force to the Duchy - an area under his control - to provide further pressure on the French forces from another direction. This multi-pronged approach was John's preferred strategy, as it would create multiple threats for the French to deal with simultaneously, making it more difficult for Philip Augustus to maintain control over his forces and territory. In summary, John's preferred plan aimed to create a powerful offensive strategy by threatening Paris from the Loire valley, disrupting internal French communication, and establishing a maritime force in the Duchy. This plan was designed to weaken Philip Augustus's hold on his territories and force him to confront John's forces on multiple fronts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In the years following its release, many reviewers considered To Kill a Mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations. Claudia Durst Johnson considers it \\"reasonable to believe\\" that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama: Rosa Parks' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person, which sparked the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott, and the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted (Myers eventually withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled, but reinstated in 1980).

Article: There are various aspects that go into making a successful school, and success can be measured in various ways. Often, the teachers are praised for a school's success and blamed for its failure. Yet, in order for a school to be effective, it must be a place where teaching and learning can easily take place, and that requires the hard work of more than just educators. Students must take learning into their own hands and feel as if what they are doing is as important as it actually is. This can only be done with the cooperation of every adult that is involved in the students' life. Some of these individuals often go unnoticed, yet the role they play in the students' lives is immeasurable. In the school, administrative assistants greet students at the start of the day and answer a large quantity of questions. When an assistant remembers a student's name or even something special about that student, it communicates to him that he is cared for. The assistant can also give that extra encouragement for a student to make better choices, especially when they are visiting the principal's office. Meanwhile, though cafeteria workers have a short space of time to interact with students, they can make a big difference as well. Beyond meeting nutritional needs, cafeteria workers may also on occasion meet the emotional needs of the students they serve. Students benefit from positive interaction with adults, and cafeteria workers may give that extra bit of encouragement that a child needs. Custodians are usually underappreciated for what they offer to schools. They have to be knowledgeable about everything from cleaning to fixing the most intricate tools. They get to school early in the morning before teachers arrive and lock up late at night after the last student has left from the after-school event. They also make sure teachers are equipped with the necessary items and prepare the rooms so that they are ready for learning. A great custodian also gives that kind word or extra smile to that student who needs it most. Question: Which of the following is TRUE about cafeteria workers? Options: A: It's enough for them to cook for the students. B: It's hard for them to interact with the students. C: They have the most interaction with students at school. D: They can also meet the emotional needs of the students. Answer:","completion":"D: They can also meet the emotional needs of the students."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Analyzing the question: We need to find out which option can be used to write with a steel pen. 2. Eliminating irrelevant options: Here, we will eliminate options that have no direct connection to writing with a steel pen: - Warehouse: A storage space, not related to the writing process. - Desk drawer: A storage area in the desk, not involved in actual writing. - Veterinary office: A medical facility for animals, unrelated to writing with a steel pen. 3. Comparing the remaining options: We are left with \\"arm\\" and \\"hand\\". While both arm and hand are parts of the human body, let's analyze their roles: - Arm: Functions to support and provide a wide range of motion, helps in holding writing instruments, but doesn't have the fine motor skills needed for writing. - Hand: Contains fingers which provide the necessary precision and control for holding and maneuvering a steel pen while writing. 4. Finalizing the answer: Considering the analysis, the most logical option would be the \\"hand\\" as it possesses the motor skills and dexterity needed to write with a steel pen.

During one loop, he discovers that a scientist named Nathan Rosenbluth has predicted an event that matches his experience. Castleman calls him and explains what is going on, however, Rosenbluth is highly skeptical of his claims. Over the next loops, Myron struggles to get into contact with Rosenbluth again, and in the process becomes frustrated to the point of screaming at his secretary and throwing his suitcase into traffic. Eventually, he does manage to talk to Rosenbluth, who initially dismisses Myron as crazy until Myron describes the transition as the scientist had predicted (including the phrase \\"Consciousness is an independent variable,\\" which is central to Rosenbluth's theories). The professor sadly informs Castleman that there is nothing that can be done, causing Myron to become hysterical and shoot himself.

Students are often overwhelmed by the vast amount of information available, leading to decreased retention and poor academic performance. By harnessing the power of active learning, one can elevate their learning experience, leading to increased confidence, profound subject knowledge, and better academic outcomes. In this article, we outline key steps that can transform your learning by fostering active engagement with classroom material and incorporating alternative learning methods in and out of the school environment. 1. Listen Attentively and Clear Your Mind The first step towards effective learning is honing your listening skills. Begin by clearing your mind and focusing solely on the teacher. Distracting thoughts and background noises can impede comprehension, making it challenging to absorb the material being presented. Actively engage in the learning process, maintaining an open and receptive mind as the teacher delivers information. By concentrating on the content, you will create a more attentive learning environment and experience deeper understanding of the subject matter. 2. Ask Questions Proactively The quest to obtain knowledge is fueled by curiosity. Ask questions when you have them, and do not hesitate to request clarification when you feel confused or unsure. By engaging with the teacher in this manner, you not only demonstrate your eagerness to learn, but you also form connections that aid in retention and understanding of the material. In addition, asking questions can facilitate a more collaborative learning environment, inviting others to share insights and fostering a collective growth mindset. 3. Dedicate Time to Learning Outside of the Classroom Although school plays a pivotal role in the acquisition of knowledge, it is essential to put in the hours outside of the classroom to truly grasp the concepts being taught. Allocate ample time each day to studying the subject matter, revisiting difficult concepts, and practicing skills that may require additional attention. By doing so, you reinforce the information acquired in school, allowing it to become more deeply ingrained in your memory. 4. Read Extensively and Diversify Your Reading Material Reading is a cornerstone of learning, as it enhances comprehension, expands vocabulary, and improves critical thinking skills. Delve into a variety of reading materials, ranging from textbooks and academic journals to novels and news articles. This practice will broaden your intellectual horizons and stimulate a myriad of ideas that can be applied to your studies. In addition, exposing yourself to new concepts and different perspectives will enrich your understanding of various subject matters and help you make interdisciplinary connections. 5. Speak Up with Confidence Voicing your opinion, asking questions, and engaging in discussions during class benefit both you and your peers. By speaking up, you show confidence in your knowledge and create a more dynamic learning environment. Articulating your thoughts allows you to better comprehend the material, receive valuable feedback, and identify areas that may require further exploration. Moreover, engaging in discussions with others often leads to collaborative insights and the exploration of new ideas. 6. Enhance Your Thinking Skills by Problem-Solving Developing your problem-solving skills is essential for effective learning, as it allows you to confront challenges and adapt to new situations with confidence. Actively seek out opportunities outside of school to practice your problem-solving abilities, such as participating in extracurricular activities, joining clubs, or pursuing personal interests. These experiences will not only hone your critical thinking skills but also ignite your creativity and curiosity, making you a more well-rounded and adaptive learner. Conclusion Active learning is a powerful tool that can dramatically transform your educational experience. By incorporating the strategies outlined in this article, you can deepen your understanding of various subjects, boost your confidence, and improve your academic performance. Remember, learning is a life-long journey, and by taking the initiative to engage actively with your education, you empower yourself to achieve personal growth and academic success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not. - Continental Europe, also referred to as mainland Europe, or, by Europeans, simply the Continent, is the continuous continent of Europe, excluding surrounding islands. - The Isle of Wight is a county and the largest and second-most populous island in England. It is located in the English Channel, about 4 miles (6 km) off the coast of Hampshire, separated by the Solent. The island has resorts that have been holiday destinations since Victorian times, and is known for its mild climate, coastal scenery, and verdant landscape of fields, downland and chines. - Northampton is the county town of Northamptonshire in the East Midlands of England. It lies on the River Nene, about north-west of London and south-east of Birmingham. One of the largest towns in the UK, Northampton had a population of 212,100 in the 2011 census. - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate. - Derbyshire (or ; abbreviated Derbys. or Derbs.) is a county in the East Midlands of England. A substantial portion of the Peak District National Park lies within Derbyshire, containing the southern extremity of the Pennine range of hills which extend into the north of the county. The county contains part of the National Forest, and borders on Greater Manchester to the northwest, West Yorkshire to the north, South Yorkshire to the northeast, Nottinghamshire to the east, Leicestershire to the southeast, Staffordshire to the west and southwest and Cheshire also to the west. Kinder Scout, at 636 metres (2,087 ft), is the highest point in the county, whilst Trent Meadows, where the River Trent leaves Derbyshire, is its lowest point at 27 metres (89 ft). The River Derwent is the county's longest river at 66 miles (106 km), and runs roughly north to south through the county. In 2003 the Ordnance Survey placed Church Flatts Farm at Coton in the Elms (near Swadlincote) as the furthest point from the sea in Great Britain. - The regions (formerly known as the Government Office Regions; GORs) are the highest tier of sub-national division in England. Between 1994 and 2011, nine regions had officially devolved functions within Government. While they no longer fulfil this role, they continue to be used for statistical and some administrative purposes. They define areas (constituencies) for the purposes of elections to the European Parliament. Eurostat also uses them to demarcate first level Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) regions (\\"NUTS 1 regions\\") within the European Union. The regions generally follow the boundaries of the former standard regions, established in the 1940s for statistical purposes.

Q: Austin gave candy to people around him at school because he got too much at his birthday. Given the context: How would Others feel as a result? Available options: - appreciated his generosity; - offended and disgusted; - mad at Austin; A:","completion":"When considering the situation that Austin has too much candy from his birthday and decides to give some to people around him at school, the most likely reaction of others would be to appreciate his generosity. Step 1: Understanding the context In this situation, Austin has received an excess of candy at his birthday and wants to share it with others at school. Sharing something with others, especially treats like candy, is usually seen as a kind gesture. Step 2: Evaluating each option Option 1: appreciated his generosity This option is highly plausible, as sharing and giving away something one has in abundance is often seen as a generous act. People would likely be thankful for Austin's willingness to share his candy with them. Option 2: offended and disgusted Offense and disgust are strong negative reactions. Given the context, there is limited reason for people to feel this way. Austin is giving away candy – which is a treat that most people enjoy – and sharing it with others. There doesn't appear to be any reason for people to feel offended or disgusted in this case. Option 3: mad at Austin Considering the context, there is no obvious reason for people to be mad at Austin for sharing his candy. He received too much candy as a gift for his birthday and decided to share it with others. It is a kind and generous act that should not trigger anger in others. Step 3: Select the most plausible option Based on the context and evaluating each option, the most likely reaction others would have to Austin's actions is to appreciate his generosity. Sharing treats like candy is generally seen as a kind and considerate act, and people around him would likely feel grateful for his thoughtfulness."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the album on which Glyn Johns was given \\"free rein,\\" as the band had \\"all but washed their hands of the entire project\\"? from the following article ? Although Let It Be was the Beatles' final album release, it was largely recorded before Abbey Road. The project's impetus came from an idea Martin attributes to McCartney, who suggested they \\"record an album of new material and rehearse it, then perform it before a live audience for the very first time – on record and on film\\". Originally intended for a one-hour television programme to be called Beatles at Work, in the event much of the album's content came from studio work beginning in January 1969, many hours of which were captured on film by director Michael Lindsay-Hogg. Martin has said that the project was \\"not at all a happy recording experience. It was a time when relations between the Beatles were at their lowest ebb.\\" Lennon described the largely impromptu sessions as \\"hell ... the most miserable ... on Earth\\", and Harrison, \\"the low of all-time\\". Irritated by both McCartney and Lennon, Harrison walked out for five days. Upon returning, he threatened to leave the band unless they \\"abandon[ed] all talk of live performance\\" and instead focused on finishing a new album, initially titled Get Back, using songs recorded for the TV special. He also demanded they cease work at Twickenham Film Studios, where the sessions had begun, and relocate to the newly finished Apple Studio. The other band members agreed, and the idea came about to salvage the footage shot for the TV production for use in a feature film. In an effort to alleviate tensions within the band and improve the quality of their live sound, Harrison invited keyboardist Billy Preston to participate in the last nine days of sessions. Preston received label billing on the \\"Get Back\\" single – the only musician ever to receive that acknowledgment on an official Beatles release.

Article: Bill Javis took over our village news-agency at a time of life when most of us only want to relax. He just thought he would like something but not too much to do, and the news-agency was ready-made. The business produced little enough for him, but Bill was a man who only wanted the simplicity and order and regularity of the job. He had been a long-serving sailor, and all his life had done everything by the clock. Every day he opened his shop at six a.m. to catch the early trade; the papers arrived on his door-step before that. Many of Bill's customers were city workers, and the shop was convenient for the station. Business was _ by 10 o'clock, so at eleven sharp Bill closed for lunch. It was hard luck on anybody who wanted a paper or magazine in the afternoon, for most likely Bill would be down on the river bank, fishing, and his nearest competitor was five kilometers away. Sometime in the afternoon, the evening paper landed on the doormat, and at 4 o'clock Bill reopened. The evening rush lasted till seven, and it was worthwhile. He lived in a flat above the shop, alone. Except in the very bad weather, you always knew where to find him in the afternoon, as I have said. Once, on a sunny afternoon, I walked home along the river bank from a shopping trip to the village. By my watch it was three minutes past four, so I was astonished to see Bill sitting there on his little chair with a line in the water. He had had no luck, I could see, but he was making no effort to move. \\"What's wrong, Bill?\\" I called out from the path. For answer, he put a hand in his jacket and took out a big, golden object. For a moment I had no idea what it could be, and then it suddenly went off with a noise like a fire engine. Stopping the bell, Bill held the thing up and called back, \\"Ten to four, you see, and this is dead right.\\" I had never known anyone carrying a brass alarm clock round with him before.

He wants to improve the terrible traffic problems in the city. At first, 40 to 60 bikes will be available only to city workers. People will give their old bikes to the city to use in the program. If this program is successful, one day more than 1000 bicycles will be available. Everyone, not just city workers, will be able to use these bicycles. People in Fresno,Californiaalready have a free bicycle program. In fact, this idea began inAmsterdamover 40 years ago. These programs encourage citizens to get out of their cars and onto pollution-free bikes. Fresno's Yellow Bike Program puts about fast bicycles around the city. The bikes are painted bright yellow so people know they can take them. When people take a yellow bike, they can ride to work or to shopping areas, and then leave the bike for the next rider. Some people worry that the free bikes will be stolen. However, theft hasn't been a problem in other free-bike cities.

Teaching children to read is not passing reading on to them. It is certainly not endless hours spent in activities about reading. Douglas insists that \\"reading cannot be taught directly and schools should stop trying to do the impossible.\\" Teaching and learning are two entirely different processes. They differ in kind and function. The function of teaching is to create the conditions and the climate that will make it possible for children to devise the most efficient system for teaching themselves to read. Teaching is also a public activity. It can be seen and observed. Learning to read involves all that each individual does to make sense of the world of printed language. Almost all of it is private, for learning is an occupation of the mind, and that process is not open to public scrutiny. If teacher and learner roles are not interchangeable, what then can be done through teaching that will aid the child in the quest for knowledge? Smith has one principal rule for all teaching instructions. \\"Make learning to read easy, which means making reading a meaningful, enjoyable and frequent experience for children.\\" When the roles of teacher and learner are seen for what they are, and when both teachers and learners fulfill them appropriately, then much of the pressure and feeling of failure for both is eliminated. Learning to read is made easier when teachers create an environment where children are given the opportunity to solve the problem of leaning to read by reading Question: According to the passage, learning to read will no longer be a difficult task when _ . - children become highly motivated - teacher and learner roles are interchangeable - teaching helps children in the search for knowledge - reading enriches children's experience Answer:","completion":"learning to read will no longer be a difficult task when teaching helps children in the search for knowledge."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

McCain wants review on defense work by retired brass By Ken Dilanian and Tom Vanden Brook, USA TODAY WASHINGTON  The Pentagon should rewrite ethics rules for retired generals who work as advisers for the military while representing defense contractors, Arizona Sen. and other lawmakers said Wednesday. \\"The important thing is that they avoid the appearance of conflict,\\" McCain, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in an interview. McCain was among several members of Congress who called for changes in the wake of a USA TODAY investigation published Wednesday. The newspaper found that many retired officers collect their annual pensions, work for defense firms and draw government consulting fees as \\"senior mentors\\" to the military services. Of the 158 retired generals and admirals identified as senior mentors, 80% had financial ties to defense contractors, including 29 who were full-time executives of defense companies. Hired as independent contractors, the retired officers working as mentors are not subject to the ethics rules that would apply if they were brought in as part-time federal employees. Nor do they have to disclose, to the military or the public, their ties to defense contractors. A spokesman for Marine Corps Commandant James Conway said in a statement that the program offers a high return for a modest investment. \\"We are comfortable that a clear line separates the work our mentors do for us and any outside corporate interests they might have, and to assume otherwise is unfair,\\" Maj. David Nevers said. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and the Air Force, Army and Navy declined to comment on USA TODAY's findings or the reaction from Congress. Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., who chairs the House subcommittee that writes the defense budget, called for Pentagon officials to explain the mentor programs. \\"The committee was not aware of this program, and we have told the Defense Department to immediately provide us with the justification and criteria for this kind of work,\\" Murtha said in a statement. McCain said he would prohibit officers from mentoring at war games that deal with weapons systems or other issues of interest to the defense companies that pay them. Mentors should also have to disclose their financial ties to defense contractors, McCain said. \\"I'm sure most of them would have no problem with that,\\" he said. Two Democrats on the same panel, Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Jim Webb of Virginia, agreed. \\"There have to be some disclosure rules about potential conflict,\\" said Reed, a former Army Ranger. The \\"interplay between high-level military leaders and the defense industry ... threatens the integrity of the defense acquisition system,\\" Webb, a Marine veteran and former secretary of the Navy, said in a statement.

These retired officers work as independent contractors, which means they are not subject to the same ethics rules as part-time federal employees and are not required to disclose their ties to defense contractors. McCain, Reed, and Webb suggested restricting the roles of these officers in war games relating to weapons systems and other defense company interests.

Question: suppose the star has less hydrogen happens, how will it affect the star is larger. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, let's break down the steps and consider how the amount of hydrogen might affect the star's size. 1. A star burns in space - A star with less hydrogen will have less fuel to burn, which can have an impact on its overall size. 2. Eventually, it burns all its hydrogen - If the star has less hydrogen, it will burn through its fuel more quickly, potentially shortening its overall lifespan. 3. Becomes a red giant - A red giant forms due to the fusion of helium in the core, causing the outer layers to expand. If a star has less hydrogen, it may have a smaller core and thus may expand less when it becomes a red giant, making it smaller. 4. Once the red giant burns itself out - The outer layers will eventually disperse, but a star with less hydrogen may burn itself out more quickly, again affecting its overall size. 5. The core of the star collapses - A star's core is primarily composed of the remaining hydrogen and other elements. With less hydrogen, the core may be less massive and thus collapse to a smaller size. 6. The gasses will start to disperse - With less hydrogen to feed the red giant phase, there may be less gas to disperse when the star's core collapses. 7. Only the core is left - A white dwarf has been formed. A white dwarf forms from the remaining core of a star after it has dispersed its outer layers. With less hydrogen and a smaller core, the resulting white dwarf will likely be smaller than if the star had started with more hydrogen. Taking all these steps into account, the answer is: B: Less"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

What is the answer to this question? when did the viking age start and end?","completion":"The Viking Age, a captivating period in European history, started in the late 8th century and ended in the late 11th century. Although it's challenging to pinpoint exact dates due to the gradual nature of cultural shifts and historical events, most historians agree that the Viking Age began around 793 AD with the raid on the Lindisfarne monastery in northern England and concluded around 1066 AD with the Battle of Stamford Bridge in England and the Norman Conquest led by William the Conqueror. The Vikings, hailing predominantly from present-day Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, were renowned for their expertise in seafaring and navigation. This skill allowed them to travel, explore, and establish settlements throughout numerous regions, including the British Isles, Iceland, Greenland, Russia, and parts of the European mainland. Their advances in shipbuilding and their iconic longships contributed significantly to their success as conquerors, traders, and explorers. Throughout the Viking Age, these fierce warriors engaged in various activities, including raids, conquests, and trade with other cultures. The Vikings were known for their proficiency in battle, employing both superior tactics and advanced weapons and armor. Their aggressive approach and fearsome reputation led to widespread influence, as they significantly impacted the political and cultural landscape of the territories they encountered, and their influence can still be felt today. In addition to their warrior reputation, the Vikings were also skilled traders. Their trade networks spanned as far east as the Byzantine Empire, the Islamic Caliphate, and even reached North America (where they established a short-lived settlement in present-day Newfoundland). Their trade activities fostered cultural exchange and the sharing of ideas, which played a vital role in shaping medieval Europe. The gradual end of the Viking Age was due to several factors. Firstly, their sheer success led to Viking communities becoming more settled and less focused on raiding and conquest, as they became integrated into the societies they had once attacked. Secondly, Christianity played a significant role in shifting the Viking's traditional cultural values and motivations. Christian conversion from their native pagan beliefs contributed significantly to a more unified and pacified society, leading to the decline of their warrior culture. Moreover, military and political pressure from neighboring states grew as they began to organize themselves and develop defensive measures against Viking attacks, making it increasingly challenging for the Vikings to continue their raids and conquests. Finally, the Norman Conquest of England in 1066 by William the Conqueror, a descendant of Viking ancestors, marked the end of an era and marked the transition into the next phase of European history. In conclusion, the Viking Age started around 793 AD with the raid on Lindisfarne and lasted until around 1066 AD, ending with the Battle of Stamford Bridge and the Norman Conquest. This remarkable period in history is characterized by the Vikings' incredible feats in exploration, conquests, and cultural influences that continue to shape and inspire modern society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This Burke did in April 1791 when he published A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly. Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed \\"a considerable insight into human nature\\" he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766–7 Burke was a friend of David Hume, with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau \\"entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but vanity\\"—which he \\"was possessed to a degree little short of madness\\". He also cited Rousseau's Confessions as evidence that Rousseau had a life of \\"obscure and vulgar vices\\" that was not \\"chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action\\".

Nelson smelled much cleaner and fresher than Samuel did although Choices: [a]. Nelson had taken a better shower.; [b]. Samuel had taken a better shower.;","completion":"[b]. Samuel had taken a better shower. In the quaint little town of Oaksworth, best friends Nelson and Samuel lived side by side. Despite being close friends, they had several different habits and interests that made their friendship unique. One such difference was their daily showers. Nelson smelled much cleaner and fresher than Samuel did, although Samuel had taken a better shower. Samuel never missed his morning and evening showers, and on some days, even had an additional one right after playing soccer with his friends. He used fragrant soaps and shampoos to ensure he smelled absolutely fresh and clean. His mother had instilled this habit in him from a young age, and now, as a teenager, Samuel took pride in his hygiene routine. Nelson, on the other hand, wasn't so fond of long showers. A bit more laid back in his demeanor, he was content with a quick wash in the morning. His showers barely lasted five minutes, compared to Samuel's 20-minute extravaganzas. Nelson did not see the point of elaborate shower routines and considered them a waste of time, much to Samuel's dismay. But as fate would have it, Nelson had a naturally subtle and fresh scent that people liked. His family lineage might have been the reason — genetics blessed him with fewer problems related to sweating and body odor. So, even after an intense workout, Nelson's sweat would evaporate quickly, leaving behind a subtle scent that people found somewhat comforting. Samuel, however, had no such luck in the olfactory department. Despite his immaculate showering habits, he struggled with perspiration throughout the day. He had tried different antiperspirants and deodorants but to no avail — his body swiftly broke them down, leaving behind only a faint trace of the earlier fragrant spray. It puzzled Samuel how Nelson managed to smell better than him, seemingly without any effort. It also frustrated Samuel, who thought it unfair that he invested so much time and effort into maintaining his hygiene, only to have Nelson waltz through life without a care and still smell fresher. One day, after playing soccer in the local park, Samuel finally decided to confront Nelson about it. As they sat down on a park bench, their faces both flushed from the vigorous game, Samuel tentatively broached the subject. \\"Nelson, don't think I'm being weird or anything,\\" Samuel started uncomfortably, \\"but you always smell surprisingly fresh, even after working up a sweat like now. Do you have any secrets I should know about?\\" Nelson chuckled and revealed the truth about his lack of extensive hygiene routine and how luck seemed to side with him. Both friends laughed over the absurdity of the situation. Nelson then empathetically lent Samuel his unconditional support to find a more tailored solution to help maintain Samuel's fresh scent all day long. The two began researching extensively about skin types, fragrances, and other factors that influence body odor. They spent countless hours on online forums and speaking to dermatologists, ultimately leading to Samuel's discovery of a milder but more effective antiperspirant. The pair learned that it was not just about shower lengths or soap brands, but the understanding of one's individual body chemistry and finding the most suitable products and routines accordingly. In the end, both Nelson and Samuel embraced their differences and continued cherishing their friendship. With the help of his friend, Samuel ultimately found the balance that worked best for him. The whole endeavor served as a testament to their bond — a friendship that celebrated their differences and flourished through understanding and support."},{"prompt":"Two neighboring dairy farms produced milk for half the state.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person who was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001? is inside the article: Social tensions were exacerbated by the revival of the Ku Klux Klan after 1915. The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, 1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people. By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.During the 1930s, parts of the state began suffering the consequences of poor farming practice. This period was known as the Dust Bowl, throughout which areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall, strong winds, and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl. Soil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the state and led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams; they built hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. By the 1960s, Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes, the most in the nation.In 1995, Oklahoma City was the site of one of the most destructive acts of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude explosive device outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killed 168 people, including 19 children. For his crime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001.

In the other container, container B, he dissolves the nitrogen gas under low pressure. Which container will have lower solubility of the nitrogen gas? Hint: Higher pressures increase the solubility of gases. You are probably familiar with this concept as it relates to carbonated beverages. Before opening the container, the inside is pressurized, so a large amount of CO 2 is dissolved in the liquid. After opening, the pressure decreases (to the ambient pressure), so the solubility of CO 2 drops, causing it to bubble out of solution.

Write a summary based on this article: Andrew Foster reportedly planned US trip with wife Lucy, who was injured in the accident, as part of their wedding anniversary celebrations A British climber crushed to death in a rock fall at Yosemite national park which left his wife seriously injured was an experienced climber and outdoor adventurer on a dream holiday. Andrew Foster, 32, and his wife Lucy, 28, were hit by more than 1,000 tons of rock as they prepared for a climb at the end of a three-week trip to the Californian park. The couple, from Cardiff, are believed to have been scouting the route on the El Capitan rock face when a “sheet” of granite measuring 40m by 20m fell from a height of about 200m on Wednesday. Andrew was killed instantly while his wife was rescued and airlifted to hospital where she is understood to be in a critical condition. The couple, who met at Cardiff University, shared a passion for outdoor adventures, and had climbed some of the most difficult rock faces in the UK. They had told friends it was their “big dream” to test themselves in the Yosemite national park. The trip was, reportedly, planned as part of their first wedding anniversary celebrations. They flew to the US on 11 September with friends who were also experienced climbers, and had blogged about their preparations and training for the adventure. Andrew, originally from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, who worked as a sales rep for the outdoor clothing and gear company Patagonia, was pictured on Instagram in the national park looking exhausted but smiling on the day before the tragedy. He and his wife, originally from Market Drayton, Shropshire, were also keen skiers, and he proposed in the French Alps in March 2015. They married in a yurt in August 2016. On their blog, Cam and Bear, they wrote: “We are a young married couple who enjoy nothing more than getting out and having adventures in the mountains together. We are not extreme athletes and describe ourselves simply as passionate weekend warriors. We hope to inspire other people to get out and experience the natural world.” Alex Beasley, Patagonia’s country manager for UK and Ireland, said: “It is with much sadness that we mourn the loss of our dear friend and colleague Andrew Foster, who was killed in a tragic accident in Yosemite. “He was a much-loved member of our team and a passionate climber, mountaineer and skier who loved being in the outdoors. “Our thoughts and condolences are with his wife, Lucy, and their families. We offer them our deepest sympathies.” Andrew often worked out of the Up and Under climbing store in Cardiff. The couple had practised for their trip to Yosemite by climbing cliffs in Cornwall and Pembrokeshire and Lucy told friends they were both “Yosemite virgins”. On their return from America they planned to travel around the Alps for a year “skiing, climbing and being extreme” and had bought a van for the journey. Fellow workers at Up and Under later put a statement on their website describing former worker Andy as “inspirational”. It said: “Andy Foster was an inspirational member of the Up and Under family. He was a highly regarded member of staff for five years, before he took a job with Patagonia. He remained a dedicated friend of Up and Under, and was regularly to be found in the store. “His passion for the outdoors, and mountains in particular, was enormous and infectious. Andy and Lucy’s intentions upon returning from Yosemite were, with the help of Andy’s father, to covert a van into a motorhome to enable them to explore the European Alps for the next twelve months “It was then our hope that Andy would return to Up and Under in a part time consultative role, whilst he also chased other ambitions. Andy was highly respected, loved and his loss will be sorely felt by us all. Our thoughts are with Lucy and his family.” In a Facebook tribute, friend Jess Spate described him as “always cheerful” and everyone who had climbed with him would remember “his good humour and unrivalled sense of adventure”. “There’s nobody I’d rather climb a rapidly thawing frozen waterfall with at 2am on a work night. Nobody better to play hangman with at midnight in Cardiff City Hall, waiting to impersonate beautiful female ninjas. Nobody better to be topping out of a mountain route with when the weather turned”. He added: “Go hard my friend. May the skies always be clear for you and the thermometer stay below -5.” Scott Gediman, from Yosemite national park, speaking, on Thursday said: “With all the craziness I don’t exactly know where they were going but chances are they were going up. From what I understand the were buried under rock… they were crushed by falling rocks.” They were the only known casualties despite being with a group of other climbers when the series of collapses struck. One witness, Mike Kane, tweeted that the collapse was “very loud”, adding it was a “miracle more [were] not hurt”. A second rockfall at the site on Thursday left one person injured. A Foreign Office spokesman said: “We are in contact with the local authorities and providing assistance to both families at this very difficult time.” ||||| The British couple hit by a 1,300-ton “sheet” of granite at Yosemite National Park on Thursday were on a dream holiday to celebrate their first wedding anniversary. Experienced climbers Andrew Foster, 32, and wife Lucy, 28, from Cardiff, Wales, were at the end of a three-week vacation at the national park when disaster struck at the foot of El Capitan. The U.S. National Park Service described seven rockfalls happening over a four-hour period from the southeast face of El Capitan, releasing approximately 1,300 tons of rock. Andrew was later found dead at the foot of the monolith by Yosemite park rangers and a search and rescue unit, while Lucy was airlifted to a local hospital with a fractured skull, according to KSEE24 News. Tom Evans/National Park Service /AP In a haunting social media record of their trip to Yosemite, the Fosters describe themselves as “a young married couple that enjoy nothing more than getting out and having adventures in the mountains together” on a blog titled The Adventures and Thoughts of Andrew & Lucy Foster. The couple wrote, “We are not extreme athletes and describe ourselves simply as passionate weekend warriors. While our blog is just a log of what we have done we do hope that it will inspire other people to get out and experience the natural world.” Facebook and Instagram pages linked to the blog also show the couple happily scaling Yellowstone’s Washington Column and Serenity Crack in the days before tragedy struck. In one post, Andy is shown with a damaged hand after he “took a wiper off serenity crack.” He bravely added, “Pride was more damaged than my hands or shoes.” Another post reveals they attempted to climb up the Washington Column but decided to turn back at the “half way ledge” because the face was overloaded with other climbers. “There [were] loads of other teams so decide to bail rather than spend hours waiting in line,” reads the post. Tragically, the feeds end with a picture of a tired but happy Andrew Foster at the foot of a climb, alongside the chilling words “Yosemite has broken Andy. Time for a rest.” While Yosemite records about 80 rockfalls per year, Foster’s death is the first rockfall-related fatality in the park for 18 years. Overall, there have now been 16 fatalities and more than 100 injuries from rockfalls since park records began in 1857. “It is with much sadness that we mourn the loss of our dear friend and colleague Andrew Foster, who was killed in a tragic accident in Yosemite,” reads a statement from Alex Beasley, U.K. manager for clothing company Patagonia. “Andy was a sales representative working in our UK team and had been with the business for five years.

Information: - Mexican muralism was the promotion of mural painting starting in the 1920s, generally with social and political messages as part of efforts to reunify the country under the post Mexican Revolution government. It was headed by the big three painters, Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros. From the 1920s to about 1970s a large number of murals with nationalistic, social and political messages were created on public buildings, starting a tradition which continues to this day in Mexico and has had impact in other parts of the Americas, including the United States where it served as inspiration for the Chicano art movement. - The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army (: RKKA, frequently shortened in Russian to ; KA, in English: Red Army also in critical literature and folklore of that epoch - Red Horde, Army of Work) was the army and the air force of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and after 1922 the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The army was established immediately after the 1917 October Revolution (Red October or Bolshevik Revolution). The Bolsheviks raised an army to oppose the military confederations (especially the various groups collectively known as the White Army) of their adversaries during the Russian Civil War. Beginning in February 1946, the Red Army, along with the Soviet Navy, embodied the main component of the Soviet Armed Forces; taking the official name of \\"Soviet Army\\", until its dissolution in December 1991. - Leon Trotsky (; born Lev Davidovich Bronstein; 21 August 1940) was a Marxist revolutionary and theorist, a Soviet politician who engineered the transfer of all political power to the Soviets with the October Revolution of 1917, and the founding leader of the Red Army. - Lázaro Cárdenas del Río (May 21, 1895 October 19, 1970) was a general in the Mexican Revolution and a statesman who served as President of Mexico between 1934 and 1940. He is best known for nationalization of the oil industry in 1938 and the creation of Pemex, the government oil company. - The Mexican Communist Party (PCM) was a communist party in Mexico. It was founded in 1911 as the Socialist Workers' Party (PSO) by Manabendra Nath Roy, a left-wing Indian Bengali intellectual. The PSO changed its name to the Mexican Communist Party in November 1919, following the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. It was outlawed in 1925 and remained illegal until 1935, during the presidency of the leftist Lázaro Cárdenas. The PCM later lost its registration in 1946 because it did not meet the new requirements of at least 30,000 registered members in at least 21 of Mexico's 31 states and the Federal District. It is not clear whether the party was unable to recruit enough members or whether, fearing repression, it refused to turn membership rolls over to the Secretary of the Interior, then in charge of elections. - David Alfaro Siqueiros ( born José de Jesús Alfaro Siqueiros , December 29 , 1896 , in Chihuahua - January 6 , 1974 , in Cuernavaca , Morelos ) was a Mexican social realist painter , better known for his large murals in fresco . Along with Diego Rivera and José Clemente Orozco , he established \`\` Mexican Muralism . '' He was a Marxist - Leninist in support of Stalin and a member of the Mexican Communist Party who participated in an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Leon Trotsky in May 1940 . His surname would normally be Alfaro by Spanish naming customs ; like Picasso ( Pablo Ruiz y Picasso ) and Lorca ( Federico García Lorca ) , Siqueiros used his mother 's surname . It was long believed that he was born in Camargo in Chihuahua state , but in 2003 it was proven that he had actually been born in the city of Chihuahua , but grew up in Irapuato , Guanajuato , at least from the age of six . The discovery of his birth certificate in 2003 by a Mexican art curator was announced the following year by art critic Raquel Tibol , who was renowned as the leading authority on Mexican Muralism and who had been a close acquaintance of Siqueiros . Siqueiros changed his given name to \`\` David '' after his first wife called him by it in allusion to Michelangelo 's David . Another factual confusion is the year of his birth : he was born in 1896 , but many sources state 1898 or 1899 . - The Mexican Revolution was a major armed struggle that radically transformed Mexican culture and government. Although recent research has focused on local and regional aspects of the Revolution, it was a \\"genuinely national revolution.\\" Its outbreak in 1910 resulted from the failure of the 35-year long regime of Porfirio Díaz to find a managed solution to the presidential succession. This meant there was a political crisis among competing elites and the opportunity for agrarian insurrection. Wealthy landowner Francisco I. Madero challenged Díaz in 1910 presidential election, and following the rigged results revolted under the Plan of San Luis Potosí. Armed conflict ousted Díaz from power and a new election was held in 1911, bringing Madero to the presidency.

He also wounded five others before fleeing the post with his rifle and ammo, an army spokesperson tells AFP. Authorities haven't speculated about a motive, but so far there's no indication that North Korea played a role in the rampage. It took place in Gangwon, specifically in Goseong County, described by Reuters as a mountainous region that borders the North on the eastern end of the Korean peninsula. Expand this summary.","completion":"A South Korean soldier, stationed at a remote border outpost in Goseong County, Gangwon province, has reportedly shot and killed five of his fellow soldiers, according to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). The tragic incident, which unfolded in the mountainous region bordering North Korea on the eastern side of the Korean peninsula, also left five other soldiers severely injured. The unidentified soldier, who later fled the scene, was armed with his service rifle and ammunition. An army spokesperson told Agence France-Presse (AFP) that the fugitive soldier has not been apprehended yet, highlighting the ongoing efforts by military and police forces to locate and capture the suspect. Despite the proximity to the North Korean border, authorities have not yet speculated on a potential motive behind the soldier's rampage. At the time of the report, there was no indication suggesting that North Korea had any role in the shooting incident. The South Korean military is expected to carry out a thorough investigation to determine the possible reasons for the soldier's actions and to evaluate existing preventive measures in hopes of preventing similar future occurrences. It is worth mentioning that this is not the first time such an incident has occurred within the South Korean military. In the past, there have been cases of soldiers opening fire on their colleagues, often stemming from issues surrounding stress, mental illness, or difficulties adjusting to the strict military environment. In 2014, a similar situation occurred when a South Korean Army sergeant went on a shooting spree, killing five and wounding seven others after a dispute with his colleagues. The incident raises concerns over the mental health and well-being of soldiers stationed in these remote and high-pressure border areas, and it is likely that calls will be made for increased psychological monitoring and support for these servicemen, given the possibility of their exposure to immense stress and potential risk of engaging with hostile forces across the border. Additionally, this tragic event underlines the significance of reviewing and refining military procedures and policies to ensure that incidents like these can be avoided in the future."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let's learn some ways to make the most out of our reading experience. First, just like it's hard to build a puzzle with a lot of noise around, it's also challenging to read a book when there are distractions around you. So, find a quiet, cosy corner or put on your favourite pair of headphones to block out the noise, and dive into your book. While reading, it's essential to play detective and answer some basic questions about the story before trying to understand the bigger things, kind of like learning to walk before you can run. Who are the characters? What's happening in the story? Where and when does it take place? In some books, the one telling the story, the narrator, is a character in the story itself. If this is the case, take some time to ponder about their role in the story, sort of like how you think about why the gingerbread man decided to run away. Also, pay attention to the style of the book - the flavour of the cake, if you will. Is it funny? Sad? Scary? Fast-paced like a race car or slow and dreamy like a cloud? This makes each book unique! Remember, your mind is like a magic bag that stores all details about the adventure the book takes you on. After finishing each chapter or part, jot down a nutshell version of the main events or happenings. This will make remembering easier, like how a treasure map helps a pirate remember where the gold is buried. Reading together with friends, siblings, or parents can make the journey more fun and exciting, like going to an amusement park together. Stories often have special surprises like gifts hidden within them. Look out for patterns, things that repeat, unexpected events, and seeming coincidences - all these can enrich our understanding of the story and make it more enjoyable. Once you've finished the book, go back to the start and rethink the beginning. It's like when you've finished a treasure hunt, looking back at the first clue gives you a different perspective! Finally, after the journey of reading the book comes the part of sharing. Don't hesitate to form your opinion on the book, it can be your special treasure from the reading journey. But remember, your thoughts and feelings about the book should be supported with the facts from the book, like a tree standing tall with its roots firmly in the ground. Reading a book is a wonderful adventure. Prepare well, explore with curiosity, and share your unique discoveries, and you'll enjoy every part of it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

China’s Defense Ministry said Thursday that a U.S. decision to disinvite China from a major international maritime exercise is “unconstructive.” A ministry statement said despite the decision, China will continue playing a role in “maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.” The United States announced its move Wednesday, saying Beijing’s “destabilizing behavior” in the South China Sea is inconsistent with the principles of the U.S.-led drill. “China’s continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea only serve to raise tensions and destabilize the region,” read a statement from Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. The statement said that disinviting China from the 2018 RIMPAC is an “initial” response to Beijing’s South China Sea activities. It did not specify what other steps may be taken. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s activity in the South China Sea was for self-defense and that it was a “much smaller scale” than what the United States had done in Hawaii and Guam. “We hope that the U.S. will change such a negative mindset,” he said at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

Last year the two leaders traded insults, with Trump calling Kim “rocket man,” and the North Korean leader calling the U.S. president a “dotard,” and they both threatened military action as tension rose over the North’s accelerated weapons testing to develop an operational nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile capability. But after North Korea successfully test-fired missiles it claimed could carry nuclear warheads capable of reaching the United States, Pyongyang pivoted to diplomacy by suspending further provocations and indicating a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. Trump surprised allies and adversaries alike by immediately agreeing to meet with Kim, long before the specifics of a nuclear deal could be negotiated. Tuesday’s first meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader produced a broad declaration to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and develop a peace treaty to end the long standing hostiles between the U.S. and North Korea. Trump called the agreement “very comprehensive,” but it will be left to negotiators to later resolve differences between Washington’s call for complete and verifiable nuclear dismantlement before any sanctions relief is provided, and Pyongyang’s demand that concessions be linked to incremental progress.

Answer the question...who did we fight in the war of 1812??","completion":"The War of 1812 was a military conflict fought between the United States of America and the British Empire, specifically, the British North American colonies, which later became modern-day Canada. The conflict took place between June 1812 and February 1815, and although it originated due to trade issues and political tensions, it significantly impacted the nations involved, their territories, and the indigenous populations in the region. The primary parties involved in the War of 1812 include: 1. United States of America: The U.S. was a young and growing nation at the beginning of the 19th century, seeking to assert its sovereignty, protect its international trade rights, and possibly expand its territories. It declared war on Britain because of various grievances, including Britain's attempts to restrict U.S. trade, the impressment of American sailors into the British Royal Navy, and Britain's support of Native American tribes against American expansion. 2. British Empire (Britain and British North American Colonies): Britain was, at that time, engaged in the Napoleonic Wars with France, and its primary concern was its ongoing conflict on the European continent. However, it maintained a presence in North America, especially in the British North American colonies, which later became Canada. The colonies included Upper Canada (now Ontario), Lower Canada (now Quebec), Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, among others. British forces in North America had to defend their territories from the Americans and maintain control over the lucrative fur trade, which required the support of indigenous tribes in the region. 3. Native American Tribes: Several Native American tribes sided with the British during the War of 1812. They did so primarily because they hoped to create a Native American buffer state between the United States and Canada, which would protect their lands from American expansion. Key tribes that fought alongside the British included the Shawnee, led by Tecumseh, the Creek, the Ojibwa, the Ottawa, and the Wyandot. Throughout the war, they engaged in several battles against American forces. The War of 1812 included various theaters of conflict, such as land battles on the U.S.-Canada border, naval battles on the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean, and military engagements in the American South. Notable battles include the Battle of Queenston Heights, the Burning of Washington, the Battle of Baltimore, the Battle of New Orleans, and the Battle of Lake Erie. The war concluded with the signing of the Treaty of Ghent in December 1814, which essentially restored the status quo ante bellum (the state of affairs before the war). Neither the British nor the Americans gained or lost significant territories, and many of the issues that led to the war, such as trade restrictions and impressment, were resolved or faded away as the global context changed with the end of the Napoleonic Wars. In summary, in the War of 1812, the United States of America fought against the British Empire (Britain and its North American colonies, including present-day Canada) and various Native American tribes. The conflict stemmed from unresolved tensions over trade, territorial disputes, and perceived British support for Native American resistance against American expansion."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which should the student most likely do to check the accuracy of the results? Options are: i. complete the experiment in one day; ii. test multiple brands of soap; iii. record data in metric units; iv. repeat the experiment;","completion":"Option IV: Repeat the experiment. In order to check the accuracy of the results obtained from determining the density of different bars of soap, the student should most likely choose to repeat the experiment. Here is a detailed explanation for each option, explaining why option IV is the most appropriate choice to ensure accuracy: i. Complete the experiment in one day While completing the experiment in one day might help maintain consistent conditions, such as temperature and humidity, it is not the most effective way to ensure the accuracy of the results. Repeating the experiment on different days may also help capture any potential environmental variations that could impact the results. Therefore, completing the experiment in one day is not the best way to check the accuracy of the results. ii. Test multiple brands of soap Testing multiple brands of soap might provide a broader understanding of the different soap densities, but it won't necessarily ensure the accuracy of the results. This is because the student's main objective is to check the accuracy of density measurements for the soap bars they have already tested, and not to make comparisons between different brands. Adding additional soap brands to the experiment would only increase the breadth of data rather than directly addressing the accuracy of the initial measurements. iii. Record data in metric units Recording data in metric units is an important aspect of scientific experiments, as it ensures that the data is easily communicated and understood by others. However, simply using metric units in data recording doesn't automatically guarantee accurate results. The main issue to address when checking the accuracy of results is whether the appropriate measuring techniques and equipment have been used, in conjunction with a consistent and reliable experimental procedure, which leads us to the most appropriate option. iv. Repeat the experiment Repeating the experiment is the best way to check the accuracy of the results. This is because repeating the experiment helps to verify that the measurements obtained are consistent, reliable, and not influenced by experimental errors, random fluctuations, or other external factors. By conducting the experiment multiple times, the student can obtain additional data points, which can be used to calculate an average density for each soap bar and assess the variability of the results. Additionally, repeating the experiment allows the student to refine their techniques and correct any potential procedural errors, ultimately increasing the confidence in their findings. In conclusion, to check the accuracy of the results from determining the density of different bars of soap, the student should choose option IV: Repeat the experiment. This will ensure greater reliability and consistency of the measurements, decrease the impact of any potential experimental errors, and provide a more accurate representation of the true density values for the soap bars."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Nola acknowledges that, but she knows that the Hewett parents are keen on Chris, especially because some time ago, Chloe was about to run away with a young squatter, so they think that Chris is a safe option. In a conversation after Nola has auditioned for a theatre part - albeit disastrously, once again - Nola says that the only problem which could prevent Chris marrying into the Hewetts' money is if he made a pass at her.In spite of the fact that Chris knows it's true, he can't resist Nola.

's a smart , funny look at an arcane area of popular culture","completion":"The sentiment of the given sentence, \\"It's a smart, funny look at an arcane area of popular culture,\\" can be classified as positive. In order to provide a detailed analysis, let's break down the sentence into its individual components. \\"It's a smart, funny look\\" indicates a favorable point of view towards the subject. The usage of 'smart' suggests that the work or object in question is intelligent or well-thought-out. Along with that, the addition of 'funny' reveals an element of humor or amusement. Both of these adjectives express positive sentiments, as they imply a clever and enjoyable aspect to the subject. \\"at an arcane area of popular culture\\" refers to a less known or understood aspect of popular culture. The word 'arcane' can carry a neutral or slightly negative tone, as it can suggest obscurity or mystery. However, in this context, the word 'arcane' seems to pique interest, making the subject more intriguing rather than negative. It positions the subject matter as unique, focusing on an under-explored facet of popular culture. When we combine the two parts of the sentence, we can conclude that the overall sentiment is positive. The phrase indicates that the subject is an intelligent, humorous, and engaging exploration of a lesser-known area of popular culture. By emphasizing the smart and funny qualities of the work or object, the sentence conveys a pleasant and appealing perspective, drawing in audiences who are curious to learn more about this arcane aspect."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Forging a Healthy Relationship with Money: Quid Pro Quo Years ago I started relating to my finances in a new way that helped me feel more in control and more confident with money. I was able to get out of credit card debt and grow my business. The key was intimacy. Instead of avoiding and fearing my money situation, I had to face it head on and get intimate. I actively brought myself closer to money and all I had been neglecting. To do this required a huge shift in the way I was used to thinking about money. I started personalizing it. I called it my money, not just “money.” After all, I’ll only know money that is my own—the money I physically earn, hold, exchange, save, and invest. “Money” was just money out there that I had no connection to. Then, I started personifying my money; I referred to it as a partner that would help me fund my dreams. Eager to tend to this new relationship, I wondered, “What does my money need from me?” My money was thrilled to be asked. It said, “I need a vision, your attention, and clear directives.” (My money is very articulate and opinionated.) Vision: Just like me, my money needs something to aspire to besides paying the bills and whatever “retirement” means. I had to think about what I really wanted in the short-, mid-, and long-term. Attention: To stop the pattern of neglect and avoidance, I had to actively tend to my money. That meant knowing exactly how much I owed and what my monthly expenses were. It also meant paying attention to—and managing—my fears. Directives: Instead of “action steps,” the term “directives” put me in the driver’s seat with my money. A directive is an instruction issued by a central authority about how to fulfill a goal. Laying out clear directives connected to my overall vision allowed me to move forward one step at a time with more confidence and purpose. Quid pro quo. Just like other healthy relationships in your life, your relationship with money must also be grounded in mutuality and respect. If you want something, you must be prepared to give. The more you give, the more you receive. Translating this quid pro quo approach to tangible results wasn’t easy, but it felt much better than the way I was behaving with money before. By getting more intimate with my money, my fears became manageable and most importantly, I had a plan. My relationship with money is ongoing. When I have a setback financially, I ask myself where I dropped the ball and inevitably, it has to do with lacking a clear vision, not paying attention, or failing to follow through on directives. It’s easier to get back on track now. I spend less time worrying and more time figuring out how to regroup. I can truly say I’ve made peace with money. It’s not a perfect relationship, but it’s healthy and growing. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"This text is about building a healthy relationship with money by treating it like a partner who helps you achieve your dreams.

Asking what your money needs from you: Your money needs a vision, your attention, and clear directives. 3. Creating a vision: Decide what you want in the short-, mid-, and long-term. 4.

He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School. Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster Jeremy Suter and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a \\"stunning building among those extraordinary voices\\". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \\"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral. By the time of his participation in Britain's Got Talent, Johnston was head chorister.In September 2008, after his appearance on Britain's Got Talent but before the release of his first album, Johnston embarked on a tour of Norway with the choir, performing at Stavanger Cathedral and Utstein Abbey, among other places. The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir. Johnston features as head chorister on one of the choir's albums, The Choral Music of F.W Wadely, released in November 2008. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was 8 months old when his parents separated?, what is it ?

Vick studied more about the troposphere, while Frank studied more about the Greenhouse Effect. Which friend studied more about carbon dioxide? Hint: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Frank studied more about carbon dioxide. Step 1: Identifying the subjects of study for each friend Vick studied the troposphere, which is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. Frank studied the Greenhouse Effect, which is a phenomenon related to the trapping of heat by certain gases in the atmosphere. Step 2: Relating the subjects to carbon dioxide The troposphere is indeed where the majority of carbon dioxide resides, but Vick's focus was on the entire troposphere and not specifically on carbon dioxide, considering other atmospheric aspects as well. Frank studied the Greenhouse Effect, and the hint provided a clear indication that carbon dioxide is one of the key greenhouse gases responsible for this effect. While studying the Greenhouse Effect, Frank would have needed to learn about carbon dioxide and its role in the process. Step 3: Determining who studied carbon dioxide more Since Frank's studies were directly related to the Greenhouse Effect and the role of carbon dioxide, it's reasonable to conclude that he studied more about carbon dioxide than Vick did."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:My parents lived through the Great Depression of the 1930s and I heard stories from both of them about how their lives changed because of it. The same was true of my in-laws whose lives were also affected negatively. For example, my husband's grandfather owned a factory.

Somehow, my husband and I never dreamed that we would live through anything similar. However, as they say, history often repeats itself. In 1929, the stock market crashed in the month of October.

The OBR had described the March Budget plans as a rollercoaster rise because of the cuts in the first two years of the parliament and increased spending in the last two years. The plans have now been smoothed, with more borrowing in each of the three years following 2015-16. International organisations such as the OECD had suggested that the government's plans should be smoothed. In 2016-17, the predicted deficit is up from £39.4bn to £43.1bn, while in 2017-18 it has gone up from £12.8bn to £24.3bn. Mr Osborne told the House of Commons that his economic aims could be \\"achieved without a rollercoaster ride\\", describing his new plans as a \\"smoother rise to the same destination\\". The forecast for the deficit in the current financial year has been cut from £75.3bn to £69.5bn. Mr Osborne had already cut back the pace of his deficit-cutting in the March Budget, when the surplus in 2019-20 was revised down from £23.1bn to £7.0bn. In its commentary on the Budget, the OBR said: \\"The new government has used its first Budget to loosen significantly the impending squeeze on public services spending that had been pencilled in by the coalition in March.\\" \\"This is being financed by welfare cuts, net tax increases and three years of higher government borrowing.\\" There were only moderate changes to the OBR's forecasts of economic growth, which has gone down from 2.5% to 2.4% this year. It is unchanged at 2.3% in 2016, rising from 2.3% to 2.4% in the following two years.

It comes in a bottle and you can squeeze it onto things like sandwiches, burgers, or hot dogs. 2. Included: When something is included, it means that it is added or part of something else. Like when you add extra stickers to a picture you drew, those stickers are included in the picture. 3. Bacon sandwich: A bacon sandwich is a yummy snack made with bread and bacon. You put some bacon in between two slices of bread and then you can eat it like a sandwich. 4. BLT: A BLT is a type of sandwich that has bacon, lettuce, and tomato in it. It is called a BLT because those are the first letters of bacon, lettuce, and tomato. 5. Referred to: When something is referred to as something else, it means that people sometimes call it by another name. Like if your name is Samantha, but people sometimes call you Sam, they are referring to you as Sam. So, in the sentence, we have: - Ketchup (yummy red sauce) - Included (added or part of something else) - Bacon sandwich (snack with bread and bacon) - BLT (sandwich with bacon, lettuce, and tomato) - Referred to (called by another name)"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Process: - Food is put into mouth - Food is chewed and mixed with saliva (spit) - Food travels down the esophagus (throat) - Food travels into the stomach - Acid in the stomach breaks the food down further - Food travels into the small intestine - Nutrients from food are absorbed into the blood stream - Food travels into the large intestine - Most of the remaining material is now waste - The waste is eventually removed from the body. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more food is put into the mouth happens, how will it affect LESS food being digested. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the perturbation of putting more food into the mouth can potentially have a direct or indirect effect on the process of digestion, leading to less food being effectively digested. The digestive system is a complex and finely-tuned process that relies on a balance of mechanical and chemical actions to break down food and absorb nutrients. When more food is ingested than the body is accustomed to or able to handle efficiently, this balance can be disrupted, affecting the overall digestion process. There are several ways in which this perturbation may impact digestion: 1. Chewing and saliva production: Introducing more food into the mouth may lead to inadequate chewing and insufficient saliva production. Chewing is essential for breaking down food into smaller, more manageable particles, facilitating digestion by increasing the surface area available for enzymatic action. Saliva contains enzymes like amylase that initiate the breakdown of carbohydrates. If the amount of food overwhelms the mouth's capacity to effectively chew and produce the necessary saliva, the food may not be adequately prepared for subsequent stages of digestion. 2. Esophageal transit: When large quantities of food are ingested, the food bolus may be too large to effectively pass through the esophagus. This can lead to longer transit times, improper mixing with stomach secretions, and discomfort or difficulty swallowing. 3. Stomach capacity and gastric acid production: The stomach has a limited capacity to hold and process food. Overloading it with an excessive amount of food can lead to slower gastric emptying, as the stomach walls may not contract as efficiently, hampering the churning and mixing of ingested food with gastric acids. Moreover, a large amount of food may dilute the acid concentration in the stomach, affecting its ability to sufficiently break down proteins and other food components. 4. Nutrient absorption: If the small intestine is overwhelmed with partially digested food, the rate of absorption of nutrients may be impaired. Since the small intestine is responsible for the majority of nutrient absorption, a decreased efficiency in this stage can lead to less overall absorption of essential nutrients. 5. Impact on large intestine function: The large intestine is responsible for absorbing water and electrolytes from the remaining indigestible food matter and forming feces. Overloading the large intestine with undigested food components could result in an altered transit time, potentially leading to constipation or diarrhea due to improper water absorption. As a result, the perturbation of putting more food into the mouth can impact the entire digestion process, potentially leading to less food being effectively digested. It is essential for individuals to maintain a balanced diet and control portion sizes to ensure optimal digestion and nutrient absorption."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: - Your town or a private company collect and transport the aluminum to a recycling facility - The aluminum is sorted and cleaned at the central recycling facility - The aluminum is melted down to remove coatings and inks - The melted aluminum is formed into large formations called ingots - The ingots are transported to another facility and rolled out to make them easier to manipulate - The ingots can now be turned into new aluminum products.

Said hill was once considered to be an abomination of the first water. The Tabusintac, like all hills, had an up and a down. In this case, the up and down were distinguished from each other by a sharp curve at the bottom. The main North/South New Brunswick highway slavishly followed the hill's contours. If you were heading north, the road led you into a ravine and you were faced with a steep uphill incline that, in winter presented a challenge to at least half the vehicles trying to climb it. In true snow country fashion, steep, icy hills were conquered by getting a running start, building up a lot of speed and praying that Mr. Newton's rules concerning inertia would work in your favour.

Now I'm not the only one stressed, a customer lines up during lunch, they're hungry and wish that Euclidean laws would suspend themselves so that they did not have to deal with the fact that I can't deal with a customer at the speed of light.

Process: - Air is taken into the body via the nose or mouth - The air travels into the windpipe - The windpipe divides the air to the two lungs via the bronchial tubes - The lungs oxygenate the blood in the body - Carbon dioxide is filtered out by every cell in the body - The carbon dioxide is carried back to the lungs via the bloodstream - The carbon dioxide is exhaled. suppose the air not cleared through the lungs happens, how will it affect LESS oxygen being brought to the body. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"The proposed situation, in which the air is not properly cleared through the lungs, can lead to less oxygen being brought to the body. This falls under an instance of directly impacting a step of the process. The process by which oxygen is transferred from the air to the cells of the body and carbon dioxide removed is known as respiration. This process involves several steps, starting with inhalation through the nose or mouth, where air enters the windpipe and proceeds to the lungs via the bronchial tubes. Within the lungs, there exist numerous small, balloon-like capillaries called alveoli which function as the main site for gas exchange. The walls of these alveoli are thin and permeable, allowing oxygen to diffuse into the tiny blood vessels, or capillaries, enveloping the alveoli. The oxygen binds to red blood cells where it's then carried to the rest of the body for vital cellular processes. Concurrently, carbon dioxide, which is a byproduct of cellular metabolism, is carried back to the lungs via the bloodstream where it diffuses from the capillaries back into the alveoli. This carbon dioxide is then exhaled from the body when we breathe out. If the air is not sufficiently cleared through the lungs, it could indicate potential issues with the alveoli. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as blockages in the airways, a build-up of mucus, infections, or diseases like emphysema or bronchitis which lead to damage of the alveoli. As a result, the body's ability to intake oxygen and expel carbon dioxide may be compromised which adversely affects the entire process of respiration. When less air is cleared, it directly impacts the oxygenation process and gas exchange in the alveoli. Because the primary function of the lungs is to replenish the body's oxygen supply and eliminate carbon dioxide, failure to clear or fully exhale air results in less available oxygen for transfer into the bloodstream with each breath. This, in turn, leads to less oxygen being available for delivery to cells in the body, which can potentially disrupt normal cellular functions and overall metabolism. In conclusion, any perturbation or failure in completely clearing air from the lungs directly interferes with the essential process of respiration, leading to less oxygen being carried to cells in the body. The impacts can be serious and wide-ranging, affecting everything from energy levels to organ function."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Remember that the grass isn’t always greener. Set boundaries. Give yourself time.\\"","completion":"Title: Managing Emotions and Setting Boundaries: A Journey Towards Self-Growth Introduction In today's fast-paced world, it is increasingly important to learn how to separate fantasy from reality and make informed decisions. This involves understanding that emotions are not always an accurate reflection of the situation and that sometimes, it is necessary to take a step back, evaluate, and set boundaries for oneself. As individuals, we must give ourselves time to process our emotions and become more grounded, preventing impulsive decisions that may result in unfavorable consequences. In this article, we will explore strategies for separating fantasy from reality, putting feelings into perspective, remembering that the grass isn't always greener, setting boundaries, and giving ourselves time. 1. Separate Fantasy from Reality The first step towards emotional regulation is learning to separate fantasy from reality. Often, our thoughts and perceptions are colored by emotions, which can result in a distorted view of a situation. To counter this, try examining the objective facts. Write them down if necessary, as this can help create a more accurate picture of the situation. Additionally, talking to trusted friends or professionals about your thoughts and feelings can provide helpful insights, as they may offer a more grounded perspective. 2. Realize that You Don't Always Have to Act on Your Feelings Our feelings can significantly affect our decisions, sometimes leading us to act impulsively. While it is essential to acknowledge and validate our emotions, it is equally important to recognize that they are not always the best guide for decision-making. Pause and consider if your feelings are truly representative of the situation or are possibly magnified by other factors, such as stress or fatigue. If necessary, take deep breaths and engage in calming activities, such as meditation or the practice of mindfulness. 3. Remember that the Grass Isn't Always Greener The common saying \\"the grass is always greener on the other side\\" reminds us not to compare our lives to others', as we never truly know their struggles and challenges. Social media makes it easy to fall into the trap of comparing ourselves to others and feeling unsatisfied with our lives as a result. Recognize that others may only show their best moments on social media, and their lives may not be perfect behind the scenes. Instead, focus on cultivating gratitude for what you have in your life and look for areas where you could take action to improve your situation. 4. Set Boundaries Boundaries are crucial in maintaining mental and emotional well-being. They involve setting limits with others to protect your energy, time, and emotions. Boundaries can consist of stating how much time you are willing to spend with someone, not engaging in conversations that are emotionally draining, or setting expectations in relationships. Communicate your boundaries to those around you and be open about your needs and limits. Remember that setting boundaries is a form of self-care and self-respect and that they may need occasional readjustment. 5. Give Yourself Time In a world where instant gratification is often the norm, giving ourselves the necessary time to process and understand our emotions can be challenging. However, investing time in introspection allows for a clearer understanding of our emotional landscape and promotes healthier decision-making. Engage in self-reflection regularly through activities such as journaling, meditation, or therapy. Take time to process emotions and formulate a thoughtful response rather than reacting impulsively. This approach encourages self-awareness and fosters personal growth. Conclusion In conclusion, managing emotions and setting boundaries are integral aspects of self-growth. By separating fantasy from reality, acknowledging but not necessarily acting on our feelings, appreciating what we have, setting boundaries, and granting ourselves time for introspection, we can lead more balanced and fulfilling lives. As with most things in life, this journey involves continuous growth and learning. Embrace these strategies and adapt them as needed, knowing that your emotional and mental well-being is vital to your overall happiness and success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After Unusual Stumbles, Rafael Nadal’s Year Ends in Hope LONDON — On the eve of the year-end ATP World Tour Finals, Rafael Nadal mused, “In the work, always there is a solution, no?” Several days later and true to his words, Nadal was plugging away on the practice courts. He finished a 90-minute practice session Thursday afternoon with Richard Gasquet, then relocated to another bubbled court inside O2 Arena and logged another 45 minutes, mostly hitting serves. Nadal’s coach, his uncle Toni, and his longtime physical therapist, Rafael Maymo, were at his side. When they were done, Nadal helped pick up his own balls, too. His lunch-pail work ethic has been a bedrock of his appeal and success. It seems central to a late-season resurgence after a lackluster year for him. The surest evidence that Nadal, a 14-time Grand Slam champion and a former No. 1 who is now ranked fifth, is finding solutions in sweat is his 5-2 record against the top 10 players since the Shanghai Masters last month. He was 2-8 against them this year before that point. That includes straight-set wins this week in the round-robin portion of the finals against No. 2 Andy Murray and No. 4 Stan Wawrinka. On Friday afternoon, Nadal improved to 3-0 with a grinding 6-7 (2), 6-3, 6-4 defeat of seventh-ranked David Ferrer. On Saturday, Nadal faces No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the first of two semifinals. The two have met an ATP record 45 times, with Nadal holding a 23-22 edge, although he has only one victory in their last eight matches. Later Saturday, No. 3 Roger Federer plays Wawrinka, who beat Murray, 7-6 (4), 6-4, to secure the final semifinal berth. This remains the biggest title that Nadal, 29, has yet to claim. A two-time finalist in the event, Nadal has missed large portions of previous seasons with injuries. He has missed the World Tour Finals four times in the last decade. Last year, Nadal withdrew to have surgery for appendicitis. Since winning a record ninth French Open in 2014, Nadal has looked diminished. The viciously spinning forehands, the irrepressible fight, the groans and the grimace on his face are still there, but the menace is his game has gone. “This year, I have been losing much more than usual,” Nadal conceded this week. For the first time since 2005, he failed to add to his Grand Slam total; he is tied with Pete Sampras for second to Federer’s 17. In June, Nadal dropped to No. 10 in the rankings, his lowest since April 2005, one month before his first French Open title. His 19 losses are his most in a season during his 14-year career. A few have been stunners, including a season-opening loss to No. 127 Michael Berrer and a second-round loss at Wimbledon to No. 102 Dustin Brown. Nadal, the undisputed king of clay, also came up short against Murray in Madrid, against Wawrinka in Rome and against Djokovic at the French Open. He lost three times to Fabio Fognini — twice on clay and then in the third round of the U.S. Open, after holding a two-set lead. There have been no apparent injuries, or excuses. Nadal has been transparent about his woes — the “fixes” he needs to his game, the “nerves,” the lack of confidence. “If you are able to compete the whole year, as I did, as Novak did, as Andy did, as Roger did, as Wawrinka did, then the ranking is fair,” Nadal said Wednesday after beating Murray, 6-4, 6-1, for his best win since defeating Djokovic in the 2014 French Open final. But Nadal scoffed at the idea that there was anything shameful about a No. 5 finish, although it is his poorest since finishing No. 51 as a teenager in 2004. “After a tough season, if you arrive to this tournament with this number, that says the level is still there,” he said. Some have suggested a coaching change. Nadal has said repeatedly that he believes in his team. Any dip in performance is his to bear alone. Toni Nadal said he had not discussed revamping the team. “It’s true — sometimes, someone needs new words,” Toni Nadal said Thursday, adding that it was “not my responsibility” to make any substitutions. He also rejected the idea that 2015 was a lost season. Rafael Nadal’s improving form on his least favorite surface — indoor hardcourts — at a time of year when he has often hobbled to the finish line is a building block for better things to come. “For us, I think it is very important,” Toni Nadal said of a post-U.S. Open period in which Nadal has recorded career highs in matches (21) and victories (17-4). “I think we can have a possibility to make a good 2016. We have played in a part of the year where normally we have more problems.” Rafael Nadal’s strong results this autumn include runner-up finishes at Beijing and in Basel, Switzerland, a semifinal at the Shanghai Masters and a quarterfinal at the Paris Masters this month. Nadal also has an eye on next season. “If I am able to play well here, I think that’s great news, because that can be a good chance to start next year again with positive feelings,” he said. The growing self-belief has been evident in Nadal’s aggressive tactics. He is serving more effectively. His whipping left-handed forehand is finding the corners and allowing him to control rallies and move forward on the court. In beating Murray, Nadal used a variety of angles and spins and depth to exploit the entire geometry of the court. He even found his way to the net, winning 11 of 13 points. “I go to the net when I am confident,” he said. The key, Nadal said, is that he is no longer pressing. He is not thinking too much. He is allowing himself to flow. “This year I have been more worried about myself than the opponents for a lot of matches,” he said, adding, “Today I feel free.” Whether Nadal can return to take his place alongside Djokovic, Murray and Federer on the Mount Rushmore of men’s tennis is for many the only question that counts. No rival in London doubted he could. Federer said he considered Nadal a threat to win anywhere he plays. The road back to No. 1 gets more difficult each passing year, Toni Nadal said. Rafael Nadal finished No. 1 in 2008, 2010 and 2013, the last two after significant injury setbacks. “We can improve,” Toni said. A win over Djokovic would send a strong message. These days, that is tall order, no matter how much perspiration one spills. With 10 titles, including the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, Djokovic has been nearly untouchable in 2015. He has lost only six of 86 matches — three of them to Federer, who ended Djokovic’s 23-match unbeaten streak this week. Djokovic is seeking his fifth year-end title and his fourth in a row. Nadal did not take a set off Djokovic in three matches this year, including a quarterfinal loss at the French Open. Last month, Djokovic thumped Nadal, 6-2, 6-2, in the final at Beijing on outdoor hardcourts. “The best tactic possible is play very, very well,” Nadal said. “Let’s see tomorrow if I am able to win more games.” If he cannot solve Djokovic, Nadal will return to the practice court for answers. He is not allowing himself much downtime during the off-season. “I don’t deserve vacation this year,” he said with a grin.

James' mother died when he was very young and he had difficulty getting along with his stepmother. Black ran away from home to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at age 8 and was apprenticed to a silversmith. At age 18 he migrated westward and took jobs on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. In 1830, Black made the famous Bowie knife for Jim Bowie who was already famous for knife-fighting from his 1827 sandbar duel. Bowie's killing of three assassins in Texas and his death at the Battle of the Alamo made him, and Black's knife, legends. After Bowie's death in 1836, Black did a brisk business selling his knives to pioneers bound for Texas. Everyone seemed to want \\"Jim Bowie's knife.\\" Black forged his knives behind a leather curtain and kept his process a secret. Black's knives were known to be exceedingly tough yet flexible. Many claimed that Black had rediscovered the process to make Damascus steel. James Black's wife Anne died in 1838; and in 1839, while Black was in bed from an illness, his father-in-law Shaw broke into Black's house and brutally attacked him with a club. Black's life was saved by the family dog; he survived, but his eyes were severely damaged by the attack. He went north to seek medical advice, where his eyes were further damaged by the inept ministrations of a Cincinnati, Ohio, physician. When Black returned to Arkansas he discovered that his father-in-law had sold his business and property, illegally, and disappeared with the cash. Black lived on a local plantation for a couple of years until Dr. Isaac Newton Jones took him into his home. Black lived with the Jones family for the next 30 years. He attempted to pass on his knife-making secrets to Daniel Webster Jones, but unfortunately he could not remember the technique. Jones would later become Governor of Arkansas. James Black died on 22 June 1872 in Washington, Arkansas. More skeptically, \\"...[T]here is no direct contemporary evidence to establish that James Black made a knife for James Bowie... The story rests solely on Black's claims made well after he had been adjudged mentally incompetent...\\" \\"...[T]he only time that [James Bowie] verifiably used a knife in a personal encounter was on the Sandbar in 1827...\\" \\"...[T]o this day there is no known knife bearing his name that is proven authentic, nor positively identified as the work of James Black. Neither is it proven beyond doubt that he even made a knife of any type!\\" Shifting the question (and the burden of proof) from people to knives, \\"...[T]he Black explanation remains the most logical way to understand this part of the Bowies' history.\\" Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What did he do next?","completion":"After James Black's mother died and he had difficulty getting along with his stepmother, he \\"ran away from home to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at age 8 and was apprenticed to a silversmith.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These days, unfortunately, my spa trips are few and far between. I blame the damn kids for that one! So, as you can imagine, I was pretty damn excited when the in-laws presented me with an Urban Spa voucher for the Urban Indulgence package: one hour hot stone Lomi Lomi massage followed by a Heavenly Spa Facial - two hours on indulgent bliss, for Christmas. I had never had a hot stone massage before so was very much looking forward to this, if nothing else out of curiosity about what is involved. Whenever you see pictures advertising a hot stone massage, the beautiful model always has a bunch of largish stones on her back so I wasn't sure whether it was more an acupressure experience where they left the stones strategically placed on the back to work their magic or whether it was an actual massage. Turns out that it is an actual massage. I requested a firm massage as my back has really been giving me issues. Carrying 15kgs of Crazy Kid or 9kgs of Kiki (or 26kgs of double babies) really isn't too good for the back so it had been causing me problems for a couple of months. My therapist (the lovely Kristy) gave me an expertly firm massage and used a small, smooth hot stone, along with her hands, to perform the massage. It was quite a unique experience as one minute I could sense that she was using her hands to do the massage then then next I'd get a sweep of hotness as the stone was run over me. It really was a delightful sensory experience. As my back was a problem area, Kristy spent 30 minutes just on that then the other 30 minutes was spent on the rest of my body. I could feel myself drifting in and out of consciousness throughout the massage. One really special thing about this massage was that the massage table was heated. Such a small touch, but one that was greatly appreciated (although it was a great contributor to my lack of consciousness!). Question: Why did the therapist work mainly on the author's back? Answer:","completion":"The therapist worked mainly on the author's back because the author mentioned that their back had been causing them issues due to carrying their children, who weighed 15kgs (Crazy Kid) and 9kgs (Kiki) respectively. The author requested a firm massage to address the problems their back had been experiencing for a couple of months. Thus, the therapist, Kristy, tailored her treatment to focus on the problem area by spending 30 minutes of the one-hour hot stone Lomi Lomi massage exclusively on the author's back to provide relief and work on the area that needed the most attention."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Pick your answer from: * negative. * positive. What would be an example of an negative review?","completion":"A negative review is a type of feedback that expresses dissatisfaction or disapproval of a product, service, or experience. It usually highlights the shortcomings or issues that the reviewer faced, with the objective of informing others about the drawbacks and potentially influencing their decision-making process. Below is an example of a negative review for a smartphone: Title: Disappointing performance and poor battery life Rating: 1.5/5 stars I recently purchased the XY100 smartphone, and unfortunately, I have been far from impressed with the device. I had high expectations based on the company's reputation, but I want to share my experience with potential buyers to give an honest view of some of the drawbacks that I have encountered with this smartphone. Firstly, the overall performance of the XY100 is subpar for a device in its price range. With its advertised specifications, a smoother experience was expected, but even with minimal apps running, the phone feels sluggish and unresponsive at times. Multitasking can be a chore, as app switching can cause notable lags. This can be particularly frustrating when trying to complete important work on the go that requires a more responsive device. Additionally, the battery life of the XY100 is extremely disappointing. Contrary to the claim of \\"all-day battery life\\" by the manufacturer, I noticed my battery percentage dropping alarmingly quickly, even during periods of light use. With moderate to heavy usage, I often found myself scrambling for a charger before the day was over. A smartphone with a more reliable battery life would be better suited for those with busy schedules and limited access to charging facilities throughout the day. Another problem worth mentioning is the camera performance. The XY100's camera delivers mediocre photo quality, especially in low-light environments. Indoor photos often appear dark, grainy, and lack fine detail. This poses a significant challenge for individuals who rely on their smartphone camera for photography, or for capturing important memories during special events. On a positive note, the build quality of the smartphone is decent, and the screen display is quite vibrant. However, these features do not compensate for the phone's shortcomings in terms of performance, battery life, and camera quality. In conclusion, as someone who values a responsive, reliable, and good-quality smartphone that delivers a satisfying user experience, I cannot recommend the XY100. Potential buyers may want to explore other options and consider smartphones that better meet their expectations and requirements. The substandard user experience from the XY100 has left me feeling frustrated and disappointed, leaving me to question the credibility of the manufacturer's claims and ultimately making me reconsider my future purchasing decisions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"What did Lyell suggest to Darwin as a solution to the issue of Darwin and Wallace both coming up with similar ideas?\\" is in \\"Darwin was hard at work on his \\"big book\\" on Natural Selection, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace, who stayed on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \\"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\\" and he would \\"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\\" that Wallace chose, adding that \\"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\\". Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together Wallace's pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society, and on 1 July 1858, the papers entitled On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection, by Wallace and Darwin respectively, were read out but drew little reaction. While Darwin considered Wallace's idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection, historians have pointed out differences. Darwin described natural selection as being analogous to the artificial selection practised by animal breeders, and emphasised competition between individuals; Wallace drew no comparison to selective breeding, and focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions. Some historians have suggested that Wallace was actually discussing group selection rather than selection acting on individual variation.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","completion":"In response to the issue of Darwin and Wallace coming up with similar ideas on evolution and natural selection, Charles Lyell, a close friend of Darwin, offered a solution to ensure that both the scientists would receive credit for their work. Lyell, alongside Sir Joseph Hooker, suggested that a joint publication should be put together, combining Wallace's received pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Asa Gray. This joint publication was presented at the Linnean Society on 1 July 1858. The papers were titled \\"On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection\\" with respective contributions by Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Darwin. Despite the joint publication, the presentation drew little reaction at that time, and historians have since pointed out some differences in how each of them described natural selection. While Darwin focused on competition between individuals and drew comparisons to artificial selection, Wallace emphasized ecological pressures and local adaptation, without referring to selective breeding. Some historians even suggest that Wallace's idea was closer to group selection rather than individual variation.

We have five beautiful children together and they remain our top priority. We ask for your privacy during this time.” The president’s daughter-in-law filed for an uncontested proceeding, meaning she’s not likely to fight her ex for custody of the couple’s five children or over their assets. Legal experts say the former couple likely has a prenuptial agreement. “Prenuptial agreements and confidentiality agreements are in the Trump dynasty DNA so I would be surprised if Donald Jr. went into the marriage completely naked,” said divorce lawyer Michael Stutman, of the firm Stutman Stutman & Lichtenstein LLP. He is not involved in the case. Vanessa and Don Jr., ​both ​40, were married in 2005. Page Six first reported that they were struggling with marital problems related to Don Jr.’s travels and controversial tweets. The filing comes the same day as special counsel Robert Mueller subpoenaed President Trump’s family business, demanding that the Trump Organization release information related to Russia. Don Jr. and his younger brother Eric Trump have been running their father’s company while he’s in office. Nancy Chemtob, another family law expert who is not representing either party, said Vanessa could invoke spousal immunity to avoid testifying against her husband while their divorce is still pending. Chemtob speculated that Vanessa may be filing for the split now to secure a financial settlement before the Mueller probe potentially puts her husband’s assets at risk. ||||| \\"After 12 years of marriage, we have decided to go our separate ways.

Background: Liuzzo was born Viola Fauver Gregg on April 1, 1925, in the small town of California, Pennsylvania, the elder daughter of Eva Wilson, a teacher, and Heber Ernest Gregg, a coal miner and World War I veteran. He left school in the eighth grade but taught himself to read. Her mother, Eva Wilson Gregg, had a teaching certificate from the University of Pittsburgh. Context: The next phase of the lengthy process began when a federal trial charged the defendants with conspiracy to intimidate African Americans under the 1871 Ku Klux Klan Act, a Reconstruction civil rights statute. The charges did not specifically refer to Liuzzo's murder. On December 3, the trio were found guilty by an all-white, all-male jury, and were sentenced to ten years in prison, a landmark in southern legal history. While out on appeal, Wilkins and Thomas were each found guilty of firearms violations and sent to jail for those crimes. During this period, the January 15, 1966, edition of the Birmingham News published an ad offering Liuzzo's bullet-ridden car for sale. Asking 3,500, the ad read, \\"Do you need a crowd-getter? I have a 1963 Oldsmobile two-door in which Mrs. Viola Liuzzo was killed. Bullet holes and everything intact. Ideal to bring in crowds.\\" After all three defendants were convicted of the federal charges, state murder cases proceeded against Eaton and Thomas. Eaton, the only defendant who remained out of jail, died of a heart attack on March 9. Thomas's state murder trial - the final trial - got under way on September 26, 1966. The prosecution built a strong circumstantial case in the trial that included an FBI ballistics expert testifying that the bullet removed from the woman's brain was fired from a revolver owned by Thomas. Two witnesses testified they had seen Wilkins drinking beer at a VFW Hall near Birmingham, 125 miles from the murder scene, an hour or less after Liuzzo was shot. Despite the presence of eight African Americans on the jury, Thomas was acquitted of the state murder charge the following day after just 90 minutes of deliberations. State attorney general Richmond Flowers, Sr. criticized the verdict, deriding the black members of the panel, who had been carefully screened, as \\"Uncle Toms.\\" On April 27, 1967, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans upheld the federal convictions of the surviving defendants. Thomas served six years in prison for the crime. Due to threats from the Klan, both before and after his testimony, Gary Thomas Rowe went into the federal witness protection program. Rowe died in 1998 in Savannah, Georgia, after having lived several decades under several assumed identities. Question: What were the results of the trial?. Whats the answer?","completion":"The results of the trial were that three men were found guilty of conspiracy to intimidate African Americans under the 1871 Ku Klux Klan Act.

When the state murder trial happened, one defendant died before it started, and the other, Thomas, was found not guilty.

That will get your feet warm.\\" Now, I was just a little girl at the time but I remember thinking, \\"How in the world will walking around in the snow make my feet warm? Dad must be out of mind. But he was my father, after all. I made circles in the snow. I made squares. Pretty soon I was having so much fun making patterns in the snow. I forgot about my feet being cold. Now, all these years later, I know, too, from personal experience how my father was able to take his coat off and work outside in the winter wearing just a shirt, a cap and gloves. Because I do it, too. \\"Aren't you cold?\\" my husband asked one winter day. \\"No,\\" I replied. \\"I'm not cold--working too hard to be cold.\\" I hope my husband has decided I'm both tough and smart.

The University of Florida’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said Tuesday they are working together on the project as well as one that involves using detector dogs to help remove pythons. UF/IFAS wildlife biologist, Frank Mazzotti, and his team are working with the Irula tribe, and on Jan. 17, four pythons were removed from the Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge. “It is outstanding that they have been able to remove pythons from Key Largo,” said Mazzotti. “And to get four pythons, including a 16-foot female, is just incredible.” Traditionally, the main occupation of the Irula tribe has been catching snakes. They have successfully hunted and captured Indian pythons in their home province of Tamil Nadu. Two tribesmen and two translators arrived in early January and will be in South Florida through February. The FWC is funding the 68,888 project. Efforts by UF/IFAS researcher, Christina Romagosa, and her team involve working with Auburn University’s Canine Performance Sciences Program. Work by the Auburn/UF detection dog team has focused on searches performed in Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge, and has helped the Irula tribe find the location of and ultimately capture the snakes. Detection dogs, trained by Auburn University, use scent profiles of pythons to help target search areas. The FWC and UF/IFAS continue to work with other partners on additional projects aimed at removing pythons and other nonnative species in Florida. People can help with efforts to manage Burmese pythons and other nonnative species by reporting sightings to the FWC’s Exotic Species Reporting Hotline at 888-Ive-Got1 (888-483-4681), online at IveGot1.org , or by downloading the free “IveGot1” smartphone app. For more information, visit MyFWC.com/Nonnative. ||||| Florida wildlife officials have recruited tribesmen from India in the state's ongoing hunt for Burmese pythons.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Ukrainian Skier and Coach Withdraw to Protest Kiev Violence KRASNAYA POLYANA, Russia — Two members of Ukraine’s Olympic team withdrew from the Sochi Games on Thursday in a show of solidarity with protesters who are locked in a violent conflict with their government in the capital city of Kiev. Bogdana Matsotska, an Alpine skier, and her father and coach, Oleg Matsotskyy, announced on Matsotskyy’s Facebook page that they would be leaving Sochi before Matsotska had finished competing. Matsotska, 24, will not take part in the women’s slalom, which is scheduled for Friday. Other Ukrainian athletes have left the Games to return to their homeland, though reports have indicated that most of them had completed their events. Others, like the figure skater Natalia Popova, have remained in Sochi. After finishing her figure skating short program on Wednesday night, Popova said that she had not tracked the protests on television because she did not have a TV in her room here, “but my friends and family have been telling me that it’s getting worse.” She added: “That’s very unfortunate because you just want peace everywhere. But all I can do is just focus on my performance and, hopefully, my skating can inspire the people back in Ukraine to be more peaceful with each other.” In explaining the decision to leave early, Matsotskyy wrote in his Facebook post that “as a protest against lawless actions made towards protesters, the lack of responsibility from the side of the president and his lackey government, we refuse further performance at the 2014 Sochi Olympic Games.” It is believed that at least 25 people have died and hundreds more were injured in a confrontation in Kiev this week. Along with his message, Matsotskyy posted a picture that appeared to be of him and Matsotska, standing in front of the Olympic rings and holding a Ukrainian flag. He wrote that he and his daughter had come to Sochi hoping that President Viktor F. Yanukovych and his government would negotiate peacefully with the opposition during the Olympics. They added that they believed the violence that erupted against protesters was a “violation of the old principle of the Games — the Olympic Truce.” The situation in Kiev has lingered over the Ukrainians’ participation in Sochi from the beginning of the Games. The Ukrainian Olympic Committee petitioned Olympic officials for permission to give their athletes black armbands to wear during competition, as a way to honor those who were killed during the violence. That request was rejected, as Olympic rules are strict when it comes to the uniformity of equipment and apparel. In the Olympic Village, Ukrainian athletes on Thursday added black mourning bands to the blue and yellow Ukrainian flags hanging from the balconies of the rooms where they are staying. In a statement on Wednesday, the Ukrainian team had expressed condolences for the dead and appealed for peace. “We are thinking about our families and loved ones back home in Ukraine, and we are doing our best to honor them on the fields of play here in Sochi,” the team said. “We appeal for peace and mutual understanding to find a positive way forward for Ukraine.” Sergei Bubka, a former pole vault champion and president of the Ukrainian Olympic Committee, issued a separate statement, in which he called for dialogue. “For the sake of the future of our kids let’s do everything possible to get back to negotiations and make a compromise,” he wrote on his blog. Sochi’s local government did approve a request for a demonstration related to the Ukrainian protest. The approved protest zone is in the city of Khosta, on the road between the city of Sochi and the Olympic Park, roughly eight miles from the Olympic venues in the coastal cluster. “One of the topics that has been approved is the events in Ukraine, which is the hot potato right now,” Anton Gusev, an official with Russia’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, said Thursday. Top Ukrainian officials have also been in Sochi as part of Lviv’s’s bid to host the 2022 Olympics. Bubka said he did not see why the current conflict should stand in the way of the bid. “It is eight years before the Games start,” he said. “I think it will be settled. We are building our future and democracy. People have the possibility to express their views. Many issues in this moment will be solved shortly. Politicians are working very hard to make change and improve the situation in our country.” An earlier version of this article misidentified the Ukrainian city that is bidding for the 2022 Olympic Games.

Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday that North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il is using his claims of a successful rocket launch to shore up his political strength within his country. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright discusses North Korea on CNN's \\"American Morning\\" on Tuesday. Albright, who was secretary of state in the Clinton administration, told CNN's \\"American Morning\\" that \\"it was a huge mistake for the United States to stop talking to North Korea\\" when the Bush administration took over. The communist nation launched the rocket over the weekend in defiance of international opposition. Satellite images released Monday appear to show the rocket in flight, according to a nonprofit institution that focuses on stopping the spread of nuclear weapons. The following is a transcript of Albright's conversation with CNN's Carol Costello. Carol Costello, CNN: We do have this video from North Korea of this rocket taking off. What do you make of that? Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright: Well, I think that the North Korean leadership is living in a parallel universe of acting as if the launch was a success, when tracking and everything has shown that in fact, it is a failure. And I think it proves a point, which is that the North Koreans, Kim Jong-Il is doing this for his own internal reasons -- because on Thursday, tomorrow, there will be a rubber stamp by the parliament of his leadership -- and the problems that he's generally had since he had his stroke. So this is part of their kind of Orwellian approach of saying that \\"This is what happened, and wasn't it a success,\\" when we know it wasn't. Costello: The U.N. Security Council hasn't been able to come up with any sort of resolution because apparently that body is split. President Obama made a really big deal of this and said this was like a clear violation. It sort of seems like the United States is stuck, and it can't do anything about North Korea. Albright: Well, I don't think that's true, because what has happened is there have been individual condemnations by leaders of various countries. And I have to say from my own experience of the United Nations, it does take a while to get the 15 members [of the Security Council] together. But the saddest for me is the fact that the U.N. passed a resolution, 1718, which said that this was not acceptable. So the truth is that the U.N. has to live up to its own resolutions. And Ambassador Rice, I think, is working very hard up there in order to get some action, but there have been condemnations already throughout the world. And the bottom line here is that President Obama's speech, for instance, in Prague, when he talked about the importance of cooperation generally on a whole nonproliferation regime -- it's very clear that there's going to have to be a lot of work on that and that President Obama laid out a very, very important set of goals. amFIX: Your thoughts on the rocket launch. Costello: And, you know, there has been some criticism that President Obama turned to the U.N. to try to solve this crisis. I want to read you a quote from Politico. It interviewed Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House. I want to read you his quote. Newt Gingrich said, \\"The embarrassing repudiation of the United States appeal to the United Nations Security Council Sunday afternoon is a vivid demonstration of weakness. This is beginning to resemble the Carter administration's weakness in foreign policy.\\" How would you respond to that? Albright: Well, I think that it's just kind of typical of Newt Gingrich, frankly. But the bottom line here is, I think the United States and President Obama has made very clear the leadership of the United States, his concern about, generally, proliferation issues. I think his trip, for instance, laid out a whole set of issues that prove that American leadership is essential, the respect that he gained for American leadership. And I think you're going to see additional ways that we all work together, because the issues that are out there that have to be dealt with require cooperation, and they will require international organizations and cooperation through NATO and a number of activities. So I'm very confident that President Obama is going to be able to prove American leadership. Costello: Well, I guess many Americans look at it this way, you know: You talk about sanctions, but sanctions have been instituted against North Korea before, and it hasn't really worked. North Korea just seems to kind of do what it wants. You've met Kim Jong-Il. I mean, what does he want? Albright: Well, what he wants is respect. And I have to say that part of the problem here is -- and as you mentioned, I met Kim Jong-Il. We were in the middle of negotiations with him. In fact, we had a missile moratorium. And President Bush came in and canceled those talks. It was confusing to everybody. And I do think that what is important now is to get the North Koreans back into the six-party talks, to make it clear to them that the only way that they are going to have respect is to abide by international regulations and to try to deal with the fact that they would be better off if, in fact, they allowed their people to be fed and an economy that functions, rather than be living in this way where poverty is rampant, and hunger, in every way in North Korea, and a leadership that is shaky. But the bottom line is, I think it was a huge mistake for the United States to stop talking to North Korea. And in the interim period, they were able to develop material in order to create nuclear weapons, and so I hope very much that the six-party talks continue. Costello: We'll see.

Albright commented on North Korea's rocket launch, suggesting the North Korean leadership is deluded and living in a parallel universe by claiming the launch as a success despite tracking evidence showing the contrary. She believed Kim Jong-Il is using the launch to firm up his political strength within his country. 2. Albright dismissed notions that the U.S. is stuck and unable to do anything about North Korea, pointing to individual condemnations from leaders worldwide and stressing the need for the United Nations to live up to its own resolutions. 3. On the criticism of President Obama turning to the United Nations for crisis resolution, Albright defended Obama's focus on American leadership and the importance of international cooperation on nonproliferation and other security matters. 4. Discussing Kim Jong-Il's motivation, Albright remarked that he seeks respect and argued that the United States made a huge mistake by stopping talks with North Korea during the Bush administration. She emphasized the importance of bringing North Korea back to the six-party talks and abiding by international regulations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Lauer says he will get revenge on comedienne for her prank.","completion":"Title: NBC Host In Leather Harness And Chains Prank: Ellen DeGeneres Invokes Hilarious Mischief The world of television often brings us surprising moments, but sometimes those surprises are unexpected even to the viewers themselves. A recent clip that left audiences both baffled and amused involved a popular television personality clad in a leather harness and chains, hosting an interview with actors. As shocking as this may appear, this visual gag was cooked up by none other than legendary television host and comedienne, Ellen DeGeneres. In an impeccable demonstration of her practical joke prowess, Ellen DeGeneres and her team recently created a computer-generated clip featuring NBC host Matt Lauer in a rather… unconventional wardrobe. The digital prank depicted Lauer wearing a leather harness, complete with chains as he interviewed Hollywood celebrities on national television. Of course, the internet went wild with reactions, ranging from confusion and hilarity to sheer disbelief. The clip quickly gained a sizeable social media following, generating numerous shares, memes, and comments. Many were initially unsure if the video was genuine, with some even speculating about the reason behind Lauer choosing such an outfit for his interviews. However, the possibility of it being real was doused by the revelation that the entire scene was nothing more than the comedic genius of the one and only Ellen DeGeneres. Displaying their skill in digital manipulation, Ellen's team carefully crafted the video incorporating Lauer into a situation that treads the line between reality and fiction. It was done so convincingly that even long-time fans of the NBC host found it difficult to discern whether or not the clip was an authentic blooper. Upon being informed about this creative and hilarious act of mischief, Lauer couldn't help but chuckle at the joke he found himself in the center of. However, there was also a sense of playful defiance in his reaction. Lauer, being no stranger to practical jokes on television, embraced the humor while acknowledging that this amusing act of visual trickery deserved an equally memorable response. The NBC host was quick to assure all the fans who were puzzled by the peculiar clip that there was no need to doubt the fashion choices of their favorite television personalities. At the same time, Lauer announced his intention to settle the score, vowing to seek revenge on the comedienne for the unexpected prank in a light-hearted challenge. As of now, only time can tell what Lauer has in store for DeGeneres, but this episode has surely heightened anticipation among fans of both the hosts. The world of television is no stranger to pranks and gags, but when the comedienne extraordinaire Ellen DeGeneres meets the formidable charisma of Matt Lauer, you can only expect the unexpected."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I was sent to school in the morning but came home at noon on the first day. I said I didn't enjoy it and hadn't learned anything. My parents thought that school was unsuitable for me. They agreed with me, so I never went back to school. Then my mother taught me and my two sisters at home, in the way of an English lady who had good education. We learned languages and reading more than sciences and maths. Sometimes she taught us herself, but we also had other teachers. They asked us to take lessons every day.

Question: What addition was covered in gold? Context: The last major building work took place during the reign of King George V when, in 1913, Sir Aston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room. This room, 69 feet (21 metres) long, previously known as the South Drawing Room, has a ceiling designed specially by Nash, coffered with huge gilt console brackets.

He arrives suddenly, bedraggled and exhausted, and begins describing the strange experiences he has had since they last met. At their earlier dinner on New Year's Eve, George said that time was \\"the fourth dimension\\". He shows David Filby, Dr. Philip Hillyer, Anthony Bridewell, and Walter Kemp a small model time machine and asks one of them to press a tiny lever on the model. The device disappears, validating his claim, but his friends remain unconvinced; their reactions vary from curiosity to frank dismissal. George bids his guests a good evening, then heads downstairs where his full-size time machine awaits. He presses a lever and moves forward through time 17 years into the future to September 15, 1917. He meets Filby's son, James, who tells him of Filby's death in a war. Saddened, he resumes his journey, stopping on June 19, 1940 during The Blitz, finding himself in the midst of \\"a new war\\"; George resumes his journey and his house is hit by a bomb and is destroyed. George stops on August 19, 1966 finding his neighborhood now part of a futuristic metropolis. People hurry into a nearby fallout shelter amid the blare of air raid sirens. An elderly James Filby urges George to immediately take cover. Moments later, a nuclear explosion destroys London, causing a volcanic eruption around him. George narrowly makes it back to his machine and continues his journey forward as the lava rapidly rises, cools, and hardens, trapping him inside.

He was brought up at Long White Cloud house on the right bank of the River Thames. His father was an amateur racing driver who had placed 16th at the 1924 Indianapolis 500. Stirling was a gifted horse rider as was his younger sister, Pat Moss, who became a successful rally driver and married Erik Carlsson. Although ostensibly retired from racing since 1962, Moss did make a number of one-off appearances in professional motorsport events in the following two decades. He also competed in the 1974 London-Sahara-Munich World Cup Rally in a Mercedes-Benz, but retired from the event in the Algerian Sahara. The Holden Torana he shared with Jack Brabham in the 1976 Bathurst 1000 was hit from behind on the grid and eventually retired with engine failure. Moss, at the wheel of the Torana when the V8 engine let go, was criticised by other drivers for staying on the racing line for over 2/3 of the 6.172 km long circuit while returning to the pits as the car was dropping large amounts of oil onto the road. He also shared a Volkswagen Golf GTI with Denny Hulme in the 1979 Benson & Hedges 500 at Pukekohe Park Raceway in New Zealand. In 1980 he made a comeback to regular competition, in the British Saloon Car Championship with the works-backed GTi Engineering Audi team. For the 1980 season Moss was the team's number two driver to team co-owner Richard Lloyd. For the 1981 season Moss stayed with Audi, as the team moved to Tom Walkinshaw Racing management, driving alongside Martin Brundle. Throughout his retirement he raced in events for historic cars, driving on behalf of and at the invitation of others, as well as campaigning his own OSCA FS 372 and other vehicles. On 9 June 2011 during qualifying for the Le Mans Legends race, Moss announced on Radio Le Mans that he had finally retired from racing, saying that he had scared himself that afternoon. He was 81.

She confides in her friend Luba that she has not told Leo about her past or her desperate need for money. After Stuart, a rowdy customer, sexually harasses Naadirah, Leo assaults him. Naadirah talks Leo down by telling him that she needs to keep her job. Naadirah shows up at Leo's apartment and attempts to tell him about something important. Leo shows her an elaborate bed he has been carving as a present for her. Naadirah is overcome with emotion and they have sex. Elsewhere, Maksim's mobsters meet two American surgeons, Cactus Bill and Duck, who run a black-market clinic. Bill desperately wants to leave Berlin and has pressed Maksim to provide forged documents for him and his young daughter, Josie. Duck, however, enjoys living in Berlin and runs a side business where he installs implants and performs cybernetic surgery. Stuart returns to the strip club and taunts Leo, leading to a fight and Maksim firing Leo. When he's unable to contact Naadirah, Leo asks Luba for help, but Luba refuses. An anonymous text message leads Leo to a black-market bazaar run by Stuart. Bill and Josie are there, and Bill takes Josie away as Stuart confronts Leo.

Not hearing any financial terms yet, except that the spin was financed by several high-net-worth individuals.Forbes Private Capital Group was formed in 2010 as part of the creation of G2 Investment Group by ex-Guggenheim Partners co-founder Todd Morley (most of the fund placement team previously had been with Guggenheim). The idea was to market third-party fund offerings to wealthy families and individuals with existing relationships to Forbes, although it also solicited capital commitments from traditional limited partners (endowments, pension funds, etc.). As of last check, Forbes Capital Group had 18 investment professionals in New York and another five in London. It is expected to retain the Forbes brand name, although it’s unclear if the spinout has any relationship to the ongoing sale process for Forbes Media.

Answer: The Kingdom of Bithynia managed to maintain its independence and significance among the minor monarchies of Anatolia through the strong leadership of its kings and strategic decisions. The native king Bas successfully defeated Calas, a general of Alexander the Great, and secured the independence of Bithynia after the region came under threat following Alexander's conquests. Zipoetes I, Bas' son, further maintained this autonomy against powerful figures like Lysimachus and Seleucus I and assumed the title of king in 297 BCE. During the reign of Nicomedes I and his successors, the kingdom held a considerable place in Anatolia due to the founding of Nicomedia and the city's subsequent prosperity. Nicomedes I also strategically invited the Celtic Galatians into Anatolia as mercenaries; however, they later turned on his son Prusias I, who managed to defeat them in battle. The kingdom's incorporation into the Roman Republic occurred after its last king, Nicomedes IV, struggled to maintain power against Mithridates VI of Pontus.

As they finished, I asked them to get into groups of three to four students and took photographs of them holding their name cards. After school, I developed the film and printed two sets of photos. That evening, I started to match the names with the faces. I kept one set of pictures at home for about a week so that I could review their names each night. On the second day of school, I put up the other set of photos as a bulletin board , with a title such as \\"Presenting Room 108, ...\\" The kids loved it! After I had learned all of their names I brought the second set back to school and stuck them onto an 8 x11 sheet of paper. I placed it in the classroom for other teachers.

Tocqueville thought the conquest of Algeria was important for two reasons: first, his understanding of the international situation and France's position in the world, and, second, changes in French society. Tocqueville believed that war and colonization would \\"restore national pride, threatened\\", he believed, by \\"The gradual softening of social mores\\" in the middle classes. Their taste for \\"material pleasures\\" was spreading to the whole of society, giving it \\"an example of weakness and egotism\\". Applauding the methods of General Bugeaud, Tocqueville went so far to claim that \\"war in Africa is a science. Everyone is familiar with its rules and everyone can apply those rules with almost complete certainty of success. One of the greatest services that Field Marshal Bugeaud has rendered his country is to have spread, perfected and made everyone aware of this new science.\\" Tocqueville advocated racial segregation in Algeria with two distinct legislations, one for European colonists and one for the Arab population. Such a two-tier arrangement would be fully realised with the 1870 Cremieux decree and the Indigenousness Code, which extended French citizenship to European settlers and Algerian Jews, whereas Muslim Algerians would be governed by Muslim law and restricted to a second-class citizenship.

He said the court had already seen \\"there is not trace of Amanda Knox in the room where murder took place.\\" Knox and her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito are fighting to overturn their 2009 convictions for the murder of Meredith Kercher, Knox's British housemate who was found with her throat slashed two years earlier. The judge said there will be no ruling in the case until after defendant statements on Monday. The second of Knox's lawyers to speak, Luciano Ghirga, said Knox was \\"very afraid but her heart is full of hope and she hopes to return to freedom.\\" Her \\"image was massacred\\" by the media and the attacks on her character started before the trial, he said, adding that he considered her as a daughter. Concluding an emotional appearance, he appealed to the jury to put themselves in the shoes of Knox's family -- a counterpoise to the words of appeals court prosecutor Giancarlo Costagliola, who asked the jury to put themselves in the shoes of Kercher's family at the start of the closing arguments a week ago. 1.

Start with a genuine compliment or a question that shows your interest in their opinions, experiences, or thoughts. This will provide a comfortable environment for the both of you to begin interacting. As the conversation progresses, let your body language convey your intentions subtly by mirroring their gestures, maintaining eye contact, and leaning slightly towards them, which emphasizes your engagement in the conversation. Give them your full attention, actively listen, and respond thoughtfully to ensure that the interaction remains enjoyable and meaningful for both parties. Look for an opportune moment to bring up a common interest or a specific event, such as a movie, a new restaurant, or an art exhibit, that you would like to share with them. You can then casually suggest that the two of you engage in this activity together. For example, say something like, \\"Have you heard about the new Italian restaurant that just opened downtown? It looks really amazing, and I've been wanting to give it a try. Would you be interested in joining me for dinner there sometime?\\" Keep the tone light and playful to avoid putting too much pressure on the other person. Remember that they may need some time to think, so don't rush them in their decision-making. If they accept your offer, exchange contact information, and agree on a date and time for the proposed activity. Be sure to follow up with a message or a phone call as the date approaches to confirm the details and express your enthusiasm to spend time together. If they decline or are unable to commit to a specific date, don't be discouraged. They may genuinely have prior commitments, or they may simply need more time to get to know you better before agreeing to a one-on-one outing. In this case, maintain a positive attitude, express your understanding, and consider inviting them to a group event instead, where they might feel more at ease and can still enjoy your company. Building a connection based on mutual interests, respect, and trust takes time and effort from both parties involved. Remember to stay patient, authentic, and open-minded throughout the process. By creating a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere, showcasing your genuine interest in the other person, and being open to giving and receiving feedback, you increase your chances of turning a casual conversation into a memorable date experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Oral Rehydration Solution is a vital tool in treating mild to moderate dehydration, particularly in cases of diarrhea and vomiting. The main aim of ORS is to prevent or treat dehydration by replenishing lost fluids and electrolytes, rather than stopping diarrhea. It does this by providing an optimal mix of water, sugar, and salt, which facilitates the absorption of fluids and electrolytes in the intestines. The WHO's recipe for ORS consists of the following ingredients: 1. One liter of clean drinking water. 2. One teaspoon (approx. 3 grams) of salt. 3. Two tablespoons (approx. 18 grams) of sugar. These ingredients should be combined and mixed well until both the sugar and salt are dissolved. The resulting solution should have a taste similar to tears. It is important to note that ORS does not provide essential nutrients or calories and should not replace regular meals for those who can tolerate it. Moreover, severe dehydration or persistent illness should always be treated by a healthcare professional, as they might need further evaluation and intravenous (IV) rehydration. In summary, the WHO's recipe for homemade ORS consists of one liter of water with one teaspoon of salt and two tablespoons of sugar added. This mixture is designed to rehydrate the body effectively and efficiently by replenishing lost fluids and electrolytes in cases of dehydration due to diarrhea or vomiting."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For committed fans of retro photography apps such as Instagram, it could be the ultimate way to continue the retro theme. A London firm has created a £10 (15) micro-sized projector that can display instagram pictures on a nearby wall. The Projecteo project has become a huge hit online - reaching its funding target on the Kickstarter site in less than 24 hours. Scroll down for video. The projecto is a tiny replica of a slide projector that can display instagram pictures printed onto film. 'Projecteo is a tiny Instagram projector,' the site says. 'It uses wheels of 35mm slide film you make online and each one holds nine photos. 'Whether they're of your best friends, that holiday last summer or good old pictures of cats, just pop them into Projecteo, focus by twisting the lens barrel and sit back to enjoy your slideshow.' Benjamin Redford of London Agency Mint, which created the product, said he was amazed by the response. 'It's been wicked,' he said. 'We hit our funding target in under 24 hours, and the response has been incredible.' The projector is a fully working system that uses pictures printed onto Kodak film instead of traditional slides. Inside the projector is a single LED light which projects the image when focused. The firm says the projector works exactly like a normal sized one. 'Like all projectors, Projecteo works best in the dark,' they say. 'We've had great looking images up to two and a half feet wide in a pitch black room. 'Unlike screens, slide film doesn't have pixels. 'This means you get beautiful looking images from a device the size of a matchbox.' The projector is designed to look like a retro slide proctor, complete with slide carousel. The images are first chosen on an app, which send the order to Mint. The pictures are printed on Kodak film, with each frame being a mini slide carousel. Each carousel is then cut and placed in a special tiny holder which is placed in the projector.

As the number of small SUVs on the road has increased over the years, consumers are becoming more concerned about safety features and the ability of these vehicles to protect their occupants. The 2005 Honda CRV and the 2005 Ford Escape have emerged as top contenders in their category, both earning a \\"good\\" rating – the highest ranking available – from the IIHS. In this article, we explore the significance of these recent test results, delve into the small SUV market, and examine the safety features of both the 2005 Honda CRV and the 2005 Ford Escape, providing a comprehensive overview and comparison of these models. 1. The Importance of Side-Impact Crash Tests Side-impact collisions are among the most common and dangerous types of car accidents. According to the IIHS, they account for roughly one-quarter of passenger vehicle crash-related deaths in the United States. With this in mind, the recent results released by the IIHS carry significant weight for consumers looking to invest in small SUVs. Automakers are constantly working to improve the overall safety of their vehicles, especially in the realm of side-impact protection. 2. Small SUV Market: Why Safety Matters In recent years, the market for small SUVs has expanded rapidly, as consumers increasingly opt for these versatile vehicles that provide a comfortable driving experience, fuel efficiency, and the convenience of additional cargo space. With more families and individuals gravitating towards small SUVs, safety has become a more important factor than ever before. 3. A Look at the 2005 Honda CRV: Safety Features and Crash Test Ratings Boasting a unibody construction, the 2005 Honda CRV was specifically designed to help absorb and distribute the force of a collision, thus improving occupant protection. Some standout safety features of the 2005 Honda CRV include front side airbags, side curtain airbags with rollover sensors, and vehicle stability assist with traction control. The \\"good\\" side-impact crash test rating from the IIHS solidifies the 2005 CRV's reputation as a safe option within the small SUV category. 4. A Look at the 2005 Ford Escape: Safety Features and Crash Test Ratings The 2005 Ford Escape also utilises a unibody construction to enhance crash protection. Among the notable safety features of the 2005 Escape are dual-stage front airbags, side-impact airbags, and the vehicle's Safety Canopy™ System, which combines side-curtain airbags and a rollover sensor. The Escape's \\"good\\" side-impact crash test rating demonstrates that it, too, is a well-rounded choice regarding safety. 5. Comparison: 2005 Honda CRV vs 2005 Ford Escape In examining the IIHS' side-impact crash test results, it becomes evident that the 2005 Honda CRV and 2005 Ford Escape stand out as leaders in small SUV safety. Although different in design and branding, both vehicles offer a similar set of safety features and structural integrity that have resulted in their shared \\"good\\" rating from the IIHS. Consequently, consumers interested in purchasing a small SUV should consider adding these models to their list of potential options. In conclusion, the 2005 Honda CRV and 2005 Ford Escape's \\"good\\" rating from the IIHS underscores the priority that these automakers have placed on passenger safety. Their side-impact crash test performances set a high standard for other small SUVs to meet, and ultimately contribute to the heightened awareness around vehicle safety within this burgeoning market."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Whether it's due to budget constraints, time shortages, or the desire to learn a new skill, many people opt for DIY haircuts. In this article, we will provide expert guidance on how to properly cut your hair at home. Follow the steps below to achieve a salon-worthy outcome. Step 1: Prepare Your Hair and Tools Before beginning the haircut, it's crucial to have your tools ready and your hair in optimal condition. You will need a sharp pair of hairdressing scissors, a wide-toothed comb, a fine-toothed comb, a spray bottle filled with water, and a few hair clips to section your hair. Ensure that your scissors are specifically designed for hair-cutting; using any other type of scissors may lead to uneven and damaged hair. Step 2: Wet the Hair and Comb Out Any Tangles To achieve a more accurate and even cut, it's essential to wet your hair before cutting. Wet hair is easier to handle and allows the scissors to glide more smoothly, preventing any snags or inadvertent tears. Use a spray bottle to dampen your hair evenly, making sure not to drench it too much as this could weigh it down and lead to an uneven cut. Once your hair is damp, use a wide-toothed comb to gently work through any tangles or knots. Removing these will help in achieving a precise haircut and prevent any pulling or pain during the process. Don't forget to pay special attention to the ends, as they tend to have the most tangles. Step 3: Section Your Hair Dividing your hair into sections will help you maintain control while cutting and ensure a more even outcome. Start by using the fine-toothed comb to create a center parting from the front of your hair to the nape of your neck. Then, divide each half into smaller sections, using hair clips to keep them separate. Aim for approximately 2-inch-wide sections depending on the thickness of your hair. For curly or wavy hair, this may require smaller sections, while those with fine hair could manage slightly wider ones. Step 4: Begin Cutting Your Hair Now, it's time to start cutting. Hold the comb in your non-dominant hand and use it to lift a thin, 2-inch-long section of hair away from your scalp, pinching it between your index and middle fingers. Ensure that your fingers are perpendicular to the scalp, and be mindful not to pull the hair too taut, as this could result in an uneven cut. Hold the scissors in your dominant hand and angle them straight down, parallel to the section of hair held between your fingers. Carefully snip the ends, starting at the bottom and gradually working your way up to the top of the section. For a more natural look or to add soft layers, bevel the scissors at a slight angle as you trim upwards. Always cut slightly less than you initially intended, as it's easier to make further adjustments later if needed. Step 5: Continue with the Remaining Sections After cutting the first section, release another section from your clips and repeat the process, using the previously cut section as a guide. Work your way around your head, being mindful to keep the sections thin, so that you maintain control and precision. Continuously check for symmetry as you cut, adjusting as needed. In Conclusion Cutting your hair at home can be a daunting task, but with patience and the right technique, it's possible to achieve professional-quality results. Remember to be patient, go slow, and don't hesitate to ask for help if needed. Use these expert tips to trim and maintain your hair in between salon visits or to experiment with a new look in the comfort of your home."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer. Given the task definition and input, reply with output. In this task, you are given a short passage that may convey stereotype, anti-stereotype, or is unrelated. A stereotype is an over-generalized belief about a particular group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against a common stereotype. The passage is unrelated if it does not convey a stereotype or anti-stereotype. You are expected to classify the passage into three classes: stereotype, anti-stereotype, and unrelated. Passage: Norweigan people are mostly white, ethnically.","completion":"To come up with the answer, I first need to understand what a stereotype, anti-stereotype, and unrelated passage is. A stereotype is an over-generalized belief about a particular group of people, often without considering individual differences. An anti-stereotype goes against conventional stereotypes, debunking or contradicting them. An unrelated passage does not involve any stereotype or anti-stereotype. In the given passage, \\"Norwegian people are mostly white, ethnically,\\" the statement refers to a general belief about the ethnicity of Norwegian people, where it implies that most people from Norway have white skin. This statement is a stereotype because it is an over-generalized belief about the ethnicity of a group of people."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},Y={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],q={key:0},R={key:1};function N(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",Y,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
