It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - Geneva (, , , ) is the second most populous city in Switzerland (after Zürich) and is the most populous city of Romandy, the French-speaking part of Switzerland. Situated where the Rhône exits Lake Geneva, it is the capital of the Republic and Canton of Geneva. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - The Swiss Plateau or Central Plateau constitutes one of the three major landscapes in Switzerland alongside the Jura Mountains and the Swiss Alps. It covers about 30% of the Swiss surface. It comprises the regions between the Jura and the Alps, partly flat but mostly hilly, and lies at an average height between 400 and 700 m AMSL. It is by far the most densely populated region of Switzerland, and the most important with respect to economy and transportation. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - Central Europe lies between Eastern Europe and Western Europe. The concept of Central Europe is based on a common historical, social and cultural identity. Central Europe is going through a phase of \\"strategic awakening\\", with initiatives such as the CEI, Centrope or V4. While the region's economy shows high disparities with regard to income, all Central European countries are listed by the Human Development Index as very highly developed. - Liechtenstein , officially the Principality of Liechtenstein, is a doubly landlocked German-speaking microstate in Central Europe. It is a constitutional monarchy with the rank of principality, headed by the Prince of Liechtenstein. - TechnoMarine watches reflect the exciting history of a new but already firmly - established watch - making company .

The research and development of the colored ceramic bracelets took two years to be completed as ceramic is quite difficult to work with that results in a higher rejection rate . TechnoMarine creations are embellishing the wrists of their loyal fans , among which there are such diverse... - A chronograph is a specific type of watch that is used as a stopwatch combined with a display watch. A basic chronograph has an independent sweep second hand; it can be started, stopped, and returned to zero by successive pressure on the stem. Less simple chronographs use additional complications and can have multiple independent hands to measure seconds, minutes, hours and even tenths of a second. In addition, many modern chronographs use moveable bezels as tachymeters for rapid calculations of speed or distance. Louis Moinet invented the chronograph in 1816 for use in tracking astronomical objects. Chronographs were also used heavily in artillery fire in the mid to late 1800s. More modern uses of chronographs involve piloting airplanes, car racing, diving and submarine maneuvering. - The city of Bern or Berne (; Bernese German: \\"Bärn\\" ) is the de facto capital of Switzerland, referred to by the Swiss as their (e.g. in German) \\"Bundesstadt,\\" or \\"federal city\\". With a population of 141,762 (November 2016), Bern is the fourth most populous city in Switzerland. The Bern agglomeration, which includes 36 municipalities, had a population of 406,900 in 2014. The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000. Bern is also the capital of the canton of Bern, the second most populous of Switzerland's cantons. - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities. The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva. - The Alps are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately across eight Alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 metres (just over 13,000 feet). - Louis Moinet (1768 - 1853), inventor of the chronograph, was born into a prosperous family of farmers in Bourges, France, was a French horologist, sculptor and painter. - Artillery is a class of large military weapons built to fire munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry's small arms. Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach fortifications, and led to heavy, fairly immobile siege engines. As technology improved, lighter, more mobile field artillery developed for battlefield use. This development continues today; modern self-propelled artillery vehicles are highly mobile weapons of great versatility providing the largest share of an army's total firepower.

Article: One potential problem with allowances is that children's responsible behavior can become about earning the allowance rather than the intrinsic value of their family responsibilities. For example, if you pay your children for taking out the rubbish, they see this chore as a job that they should be rewarded for instead of a responsibility they must fulfill as part of the family. But giving children an allowance for weekly chores is not necessarily bad. You are rewarding them for fulfilling their family responsibilities, but it is not for a specific act. It is an appreciation of their commitment to your family values. You are also conveying another important message that their actions have consequences: if they do good things, good things happen. They also learn a lesson about the market economy, namely that work is rewarded. Allowances can also be used as punishment and to teach children lessons about family values. For example, if your children join a group of kids smashing pumpkins on Halloween, a part of a reasonable punishment might be to require them to pay the families out of their allowance to replace the pumpkins. Thus, your children learn that bad behavior has financial consequences. Meanwhile, by relating the punishment to the misdeed, you ensure that your children see the connection and learn the value lesson. How much allowance should you pay your children? The precise amount depends on your family's financial situation, the cost of living and your children's needs. Children can start to earn a weekly allowance as early as 5 years of age. An increase of 1 per week for each year of your children's lives is realistic until they reach their mid-teens. When they begin to drive and date, you can calculate their expenses and establish a reasonable allowance that covers their needs. Question: It can be inferred from the passage that _ .

Demonic growls are heard. Leaves and other street trash suddenly come flying into the church as a crucifix comes to life. It then cuts to Lieutenant William F. Kinderman at a crime scene, where a 12-year-old boy named Thomas Kintry has been murdered. Kinderman takes his friend, a priest named Father Dyer, out to see their mutually favorite film It's a Wonderful Life. Kinderman later relates the gruesome details of the murder of the young boy he was investigating that morning, including his crucifixion. Another murder soon takes placeâa priest is found decapitated in a church. Dyer is shortly hospitalizedâand found murdered the next dayâwith the words \\"IT'S A WONDERFULL LIFE\\" [sic] written on a wall in Dyer's blood. The fingerprints at the crime scenes do not match, indicating a different person was responsible for each.

To understand why, let's break down the information provided by the premise and analyze the relationship between the premise and hypothesis. The premise is a conditional statement, presenting information in an \\"if-then\\" format. It consists of two parts: the antecedent and the consequent. 1. Antecedent: \\"she's not paid\\" 2. Consequent: \\"she's an intern\\" The premise informs us that if a condition is met (i.e., not being paid), then a particular outcome will follow (i.e., becoming an intern). In other words, the premise is stating that not being paid is a sufficient condition for someone to be considered an intern. However, it does not offer any information on the opposite situation - whether an intern can also be paid or if a paid individual can be considered an intern. Now let's examine the hypothesis, which states that \\"she is paid.\\" This information is not directly addressed by the premise. It's important to note that the premise doesn't claim that \\"if she's paid, she's not an intern\\" or provide any information about what it means when someone is paid. Therefore, based on the provided premise alone, we cannot draw any concrete conclusions about the hypothesis.

After the Revolution of 1688, and the accession of William of Orange as King, he was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers, and he refused to take up his seat in Parliament. As a staunch Episcopalian, Bruce was considered a potential Jacobite threat. In 1693 he was briefly imprisoned in Stirling Castle for refusing to appear before the Privy Council. He was incarcerated again at Stirling in 1694, and from 1696 in Edinburgh Castle. Bruce was expelled from parliament in 1702, his seat passing to his son John Bruce. Despite these imprisonments, he continued his architectural work, indeed the 1690s and 1700s were his most prolific years.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who served as Thomaskantor? ? Johann Sebastian Bach composed the church cantata Erschallet, ihr Lieder, erklinget, ihr Saiten! (Ring out, you songs; sound, you strings!), BWV 172, in Weimar for Pentecost Sunday in 1714. Bach led the first performance on 20 May 1714 in the Schlosskirche, the court chapel in the ducal Schloss. Erschallet, ihr Lieder is an early work in a genre to which he later contributed complete cantata cycles for all occasions of the liturgical year. Bach was appointed Konzertmeister in Weimar in the spring of 1714, a position that called for the performance of a church cantata each month. He composed Erschallet, ihr Lieder as the third cantata in the series, to a text probably written by court poet Salomon Franck. The text reflects different aspects of the Holy Spirit. The librettist included a quotation from the day's prescribed Gospel reading in the only recitative, and for the closing chorale he used a stanza from Philipp Nicolai's hymn \\"Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern\\" (1599). The work is in six movements, and scored for four vocal soloists, four-part choir, three trumpets, timpani, oboe, bassoon and a string orchestra of two violins, two violas, and basso continuo. The orchestra for the holiday occasion is festive compared to the two works previously composed in Weimar. The cantata opens with a chorus, followed by the recitative, in which words spoken by Jesus are sung by the bass as the vox Christi (voice of Christ). A bass aria with trumpets addresses the Trinity, and a tenor aria then describes the Spirit that was present at the Creation. This is followed by an intimate duet of the Soul (soprano) and the Spirit (alto), to which an oboe plays the ornamented melody of Martin Luther's hymn \\"Komm, Heiliger Geist, Herre Gott\\" and a solo cello provides the bass line. The theme of intimacy between God and Man is developed further in the following chorale, after which Bach specified an unusual repeat of the opening chorus.

The Luftwaffe dropped around 45,000 short tons (41,000 t) of bombs during the Blitz disrupting production and transport, reducing food supplies and shaking the British morale. It also helped to support the U-Boat blockade by sinking some 58,000 long tons (59,000 t) of shipping destroyed and 450,000 long tons (460,000 t) damaged. Yet, overall the British production rose steadily throughout this period although there were significant falls during April 1941, probably influenced by the departure of workers of Easter Holidays according to the British official history. The British official history on war production noted the great impact was upon the supply of components rather than complete equipment. In aircraft production, the British were denied the opportunity to reach the planned target of 2,500 aircraft in a month, arguably the greatest achievement of the bombing, as it forced the dispersal of industry. In April 1941, when the targets were British ports, rifle production fell by 25%, filled-shell production by 4.6%, and in smallarms production 4.5% overall. The strategic impact on industrial cities was varied; most took from 10–15 days to recover from heavy raids, although Belfast and Liverpool took longer.

Sentence 1: Ca'daan spent most of the afternoon thinking about what the Kal had said. Sentence 2: The Kal had said something to Ca'daan. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"Yes, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence is true as well. Let's break down the sentences to better understand the reasoning behind this conclusion. Sentence 1: \\"Ca'daan spent most of the afternoon thinking about what the Kal had said.\\" This sentence is telling us that there was a period of time (most of the afternoon) during which Ca'daan was occupied with reflecting on something that the Kal had said. The key information here is that the Kal had spoken and communicated some information, thought, or idea, and Ca'daan was pondering it. The main focus of this sentence is on Ca'daan's mental activity and the duration of it; however, it is directly reliant on the fact that the Kal had said something. Sentence 2: \\"The Kal had said something to Ca'daan.\\" This sentence is more direct in addressing the fact that the Kal had communicated something to Ca'daan. The main focus of this sentence is the act of the Kal saying something, which is the basis for the first sentence. When we compare these two sentences, it is clear that the truth of the first sentence depends on the truth of the second sentence. Both sentences establish that the Kal had said something to Ca'daan, but they emphasize different aspects of the situation. Sentence 1 conveys the effect of the Kal's words on Ca'daan—that is, how Ca'daan spends the afternoon in response to what was said. Sentence 2 directly states the fact that the Kal had said something to Ca'daan. In conclusion, if we assume that the first sentence is true, then we have to accept that the Kal had said something to Ca'daan, which is the core information in the second sentence. Therefore, the second sentence is true as well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

During the concert, the cello sounded better than the violin because the OPTIONS: a). cello was out of tune.. b). violin was out of tune..","completion":"During the concert, the cello sounded better than the violin because the violin was out of tune. The difference in the sound quality between the two instruments was apparent to the audience, creating an uneasy atmosphere. Meanwhile, the discordant notes from the violin detracted from the overall harmonious ambience that the musical ensemble was attempting to create. The cello, on the other hand, maintained a rich and resonant tone throughout the performance. The deep, sonorous notes produced by the cello seemed to envelop the room, captivating those in attendance and showcasing the impressive acoustics of the concert hall. The violinist, upon realizing that their instrument was out of tune, tried to compensate by adjusting their playing technique and attempting to blend in with the rest of the ensemble. However, this only highlighted the issue further, drawing more attention to the out-of-tune tones and creating an imbalance within the group. As the concert continued, it became clear that the violin's tuning problem was affecting the overall audio experience for the audience. A few people in the crowd started to whisper and murmur, discussing the issue among themselves. Some even began to look around to see if anyone else was noticing the discordant sounds that stood out against the otherwise harmonious backdrop of the music. The violinist's struggle and frustration with their instrument were palpable. Sweat was visible on their brow, and their facial expressions conveyed the stress of trying to salvage the performance. The rest of the musicians, aware of the glaring issue, tried their best to support their colleague and carry the music forward despite the imperfections. Unfortunately, as the concert progressed, the diversion from the ideal sound landscape became too glaring to overlook. The feeling of discomfort rippled through the audience, and the silent judgment began to emerge through the glances exchanged between attendees. Though the other musicians in the ensemble were masterfully delivering their respective parts, it was not enough to fully divert the focus from the out of tune violin. During the intermission, the violinist was seen backstage hurriedly attempting to correct the issue. Fellow musicians and stagehands lent their support, offering guidance and assisting with the tuning process. The anxiety was visible, as everyone knew the collective performance and impression of the ensemble was on the line. When the performance resumed, the violin had been tuned more accurately, and it was now in harmony with the rest of the ensemble. The musicians' synchronized efforts began to produce the intended audio experience, and the audience's focus returned to the skill and passion embodied in the performance. The cello continued to maintain its rich and profound tone, complementing the now melodic violin. As the concert came to a close, the initial discord had been mostly forgotten, and the powerful music swept the listeners away with its beauty and intensity. However, the memory of the out-of-tune violin during the first half of the concert lingered as a reminder of the delicate balance within a musical ensemble and the potentially disruptive consequences that can result from even a single instrument falling out of sync."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The user is seemingly sharing their own status or experience by saying, \\"i am in island girl.\\" The term \\"gosh\\" is often used to express surprise, enthusiasm, or disbelief. The lack of negative language or expressions in the tweet suggests that the sentiment is not negative. Considering the tweet's content, we can assume that it has a positive sentiment. The use of \\"gosh\\" would most likely indicate excitement or amazement. The phrase \\"i am in island girl\\" leads us to believe that the user is having a positive experience, perhaps describing themselves as being in a great or interesting location.

L'Enquête de Santé Familiale Palestinienne est une étude statistique menée annuellement pour recueillir des informations sur l'état de santé de la population palestinienne. En 2006, les résultats de cette enquête ont montré qu'une proportion importante d'enfants de moins de cinq ans en Palestine souffre de retard de croissance. C'est un problème de santé sérieux qui peut avoir des conséquences à long terme sur le développement physique et mental de l'enfant. Le retard de croissance est une condition qui résulte d'une malnutrition chronique, généralement en raison d'une alimentation insuffisante ou d'une mauvaise absorption des aliments. C'est une mesure de la santé et du bien-être de la population infantile et peut être un indicateur de l'état nutritionnel général d'une communauté ou d'un pays. En ce qui concerne le chiffre spécifique mentionné, 10 sur 100, cela signifie que 10% des enfants de moins de cinq ans en Palestine souffrent de ce problème.

Berlin-born in 1942 Margarethe von Trotta was an actress and now she is a very important director and writer. She has been described, perhaps even unfairly caricatured, as a director whose commitment to bringing a woman's sensibility to the screen outweighs her artistic strengths. \\"Rosenstrasse,\\" which has garnered mixed and even strange reviews (the New York Times article was one of the most negatively aggressive reviews I've ever read in that paper) is not a perfect film. It is a fine movie and a testament to a rare coalescing of successful opposition to the genocidal Nazi regime by, of all peoples, generically powerless Germans demonstrating in a Berlin street. Co-writer von Trotta uses the actual Rosenstrasse incident in the context of a young woman's search for information about her mother's never disclosed life as a child in the German capital during World War II. The husband of Ruth Weinstein (Jutta Lampe) has died and in a surprising reversion to an orthodox Jewish lifestyle apparently hitherto in long abeyance, Ruth not only \\"sits shivah\\" (the Jews' week-long mourning ritual) but she insists on following the strict proscriptions of her faith. Her apartment in New York City reflects the affluence secured by her deceased spouse's labors. Her American-born daughter, Hannah (Maria Schrader) and her brother are a bit put-off by mom's assumption of restrictive orthodox Jewish practices but they pitch in. The mother coldly rejects the presence of Hannah's fiance, a non-Jew named Luis (Fedja van Huet). A domestic crisis might well erupt as Ruth warns that she'll disown Hannah if she doesn't give up doting, handsome Luis. Stay tuned. A cousin arrives to pay her respects and also drops clues to an interested Hannah about a wartime mystery about mom's childhood in Berlin. Hannah is intrigued - she queries her mom who resolutely refuses to discuss that part of her life. This is very, very realistic. I grew up with parents who fled Nazi Germany just in time and I knew many children whose families, in whole but usually in part, escaped the Holocaust. Those days were simply not discussed. So Hannah, having learned that a German gentile woman saved Ruth's life, traipses off to Berlin hoping to find the savior still breathing. Were she not, this would have been a very short film. But Ruth, pretending to be a historian, locates 90 year-old Lena Fischer (Doris Schade), now a widow. As the happy-to-be-interviewed but shaken up by repressed memories Lena tells her story, the scenes shift fairly seamlessly between present day Berlin and the war-time capital. The young Lena of 1943 (Katja Riemann) was a fine pianist married to a Jewish violinist, Fabian Fischer (Martin Feifel). With the advent of the Nazi regime he was required to use \\"Israel\\" as a middle name just as Jewish women had to add \\"Sarah\\" to their names(incidentally I wish IMDb had not given Fabian's name on its characters list with the false \\"Israel\\" included-it simply perpetuates a name applied by Nazis as a mark of classification and degradation). While Germany deported most of its Jewish population to concentration camps, those married to \\"Aryans\\" were exempted. For a time. Until 1943 when the regime decided to take them too (most were men; a minority were Jewish women married to non-Jews). The roundup is shown here in all its frightening intensity. The young Lena tries to locate her husband. All she and many other women know is that they're confined in a building on Rosenstrasse. The crowd of anxious women builds up, some piteously seeking help from German officers who predictably refuse aid and also verbally abuse them (\\"Jew-loving whore\\" being one appellation). As a subplot Lena more or less adopts eight-year-old Ruth who hid when her mother was seized (remember, Ruth is now sitting shiva in Manhattan). The child Ruth is fetchingly portrayed by Svea Lohde. Through increasingly angry protestations the women finally prevail. The men, and a handful of women, are released. As in the real story the Nazis gave in, one of the rare, almost unprecedented times when the madmen acknowledged defeat in their homicidal agenda (another was the termination of the euthanasia campaign to rid the Reich of mental defectives and chronic invalids but that's another story). Von Trotta builds up the tension and each woman's story is both personal and universal. Hannah continues to prod the aging Lena who slowly, one gathers, begins to suspect she's not dealing with an ordinary historian but rather someone with a need to learn about the girl she rescued, the child whose mother was murdered. The contrasts between Rosenstrasse of 1943, a set, and the street today in a bustling, rebuilt, unified Berlin provide a recurring thematic element. Today's Berlin bears the heritage but not the scars of a monstrous past. Von Trotta makes that point very well. The main actors are uniformly impressive. Lena's husband while strong is also shown as totally helpless in the snare of confinement with a likely outlook of deportation (which is shown to have been clearly understood by all characters - including the local police and military - as a one-way trip to oblivion). The older Ruth is catalytically forced to confront demons long suppressed in her happy New York life. Hannah is very believable as a young woman whose father's death triggers a need to discover her family's past. These things happen (although the Times's critic appears not to know that). Von Trotta's hand is sure but not perfect. A scene with Goebbels at a soiree enjoying Lena's violin playing is unnecessary and distractive. The suggestion that she may have gone to bed with the propaganda minister, the most fanatical top-level Hitler worshiper, to save her husband detracts from the wondrous accomplishment of the demonstrating spouses and relatives. Most of the German officers come from central casting and are molded by the Erich von Stroheim \\"copy and paste\\" school of Teutonic nastiness. But that's understandable. The Rosenstrasse story has been the subject of books and articles and some claim it's a paradigm case for arguing that many more Jews could have been saved had more Germans protested. Unfortunately that argument is nonsense. The German women who occupied Rosenstrasse were deeply and understandably self-interested. Most Germans were located on a line somewhere between passive and virulent anti-Semitism. THAT'S why the Rosenstrasse protest was virtually singular. Whether one buys or rejects the Goldenhagen thesis that most Germans were willing accomplices of the actual murderers it just can not be denied that pre-Nazi endemic anti-Semitism erupted into a virulent strain from 1933 on. The elderly Lena remarks that what was accomplished by the women was \\"a ray of light\\" in an evil time. Most of the men and women sprung from a near death trip survived the war. So \\"a ray of light\\" it was and von Trotta's movie is a beacon of illumination showing that some were saved by the courage of largely ordinary women and for every life saved an occasion for celebration exists.

At this point the narrator (Harry) introduces himself and apologizes, somewhat defensively, for not being very good. \\"Do you see any other narrators?\\" he asks. (The movie repeatedly revisits the idea that the narrator isn't a trustworthy source. The symbolism is that the pool represents the Hollywood lifestyle and he's trying to decide whether to jump in or not).

The interesting aspect about its location is that it is notably positioned near another popular eatery known as The Rice Boat. Regardless of its low customer rating, Loch Fyne continues to contribute to the diversity of food culture in the city due to its distinctive offering of Japanese dishes. Its proximity to The Rice Boat might also suggest a compelling competitive dynamics or varied choices for foodies who are exploring the city centre for some culinary adventures. Despite its present low customer rating, there can be many factors at play - it could be due to a poor dining experience, average food quality, less variety in their menu, or the absence of quintessential Japanese flavours. Often, low ratings are significant indicators for the restaurant owners to work ahead with improvements, elevating the dining experience and revamping their menus to align with customer expectations. It's apparent that despite its prime location in the bustling city centre, Loch Fyne needs to strengthen its position by improving its customer service and the quality of Japanese food they serve, to attract more patrons and compete effectively with nearest competitors like The Rice Boat.

The swearing-in took place in a tightly guarded ceremony at the Colonial-era presidential mansion in New Delhi. For the first time, leaders of an entire South Asian region attended, including Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister of India's traditional archrival, Pakistan. But it's not just the guest list that makes this inauguration historic. Never in the past three decades has a political party taken up the reins of the world's largest democracy with an absolute majority. And never before has a provincial chief with no federal experience become head of a national government. Unprecedented invitation. In attendance on the sprawling forecourt of the sandstone palace were the premiers of Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal and Mauritius; the presidents of Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives; and the speaker of Bangladesh, officials say. \\"A promising gesture,\\" read the headline of an editorial in the Indian Express on Friday about India's unprecedented invitation to the leaders of the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation bloc. Until his election to Parliament this month, Modi, a chief minister of the prosperous northwestern state of Gujarat, has been seen as hawkish by some political watchers, especially over relations with nuclear archrival Pakistan. His Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has often accused the administration of outgoing Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of being soft on its western neighbor, which New Delhi blames for a number of terror attacks in India, including the deadly 2008 assault in Mumbai. Both countries have fought three wars, two of them over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which both claim as their own in its entirety. An editorial in the Indian Express said Modi's \\"terrific\\" move to invite regional leaders \\"should help generate a more realistic appreciation of India's foreign-policy trajectory in the coming years.\\" \\"What matters in the end, however, is the prospect of a more self-assured government in Delhi that is ready to engage the neighbors without standing on protocol and precedent,\\" it added. Economic hope. Credited for his pro-business approach as the chief of Gujarat, India's new leader has also raised expectations that his government will succeed in turning around India's slowing economy, generate more jobs and rein in soaring prices and deeply entrenched corruption, issues that are widely believed to have brought about the fall of Singh's government. Modi's party won 282 seats of the 543-seat lower house of Parliament on its own, the first independent win by any single political party in three decades. India has since been ruled by coalitions of national and regional groupings with varied political and economic philosophies. \\"The BJP's single-handed majority in the new parliament ensures at least one thing: no more excuses of fractured coalition politics compromising policies and reforms,\\" said Jahangir Aziz, J.P. Morgan's chief Asia economist, in a column in the Indian Express. \\"More growth, more employment, more infrastructure, lower inflation is just motherhood and apple pie. Identifying and articulating the binding constraints holding these back is the heart of the problem,\\" he wrote. Political analysts also describe the debacle of Singh's Congress Party government as a vote against crushing prices. \\"Moderation in prices of essential commodities is a potential challenge for Modi's government in a market-driven economy,\\" political commentator K.G. Suresh said. \\"The honeymoon period will not last longer if measures are not taken in the next 100 days to bring costs down,\\" he added. Modi's Cabinet, observers say, will signify his government's model and course. \\"It has to be a dream team that balances demands and side effects of growth with promises of low prices to millions of poverty-stricken Indians. It has to be a smart mix of youth and experience with a cohesive approach. With pressures of coalition politics no longer there, the last thing India would expect the new prime minister's core team to be is a chariot pulled by horses running in different directions,\\" Suresh said.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases. Q: Higher temperatures increase the rate of reaction in a lot of chemical reactions because they increase the frequency of what interaction between reactant particles? A: Available choices: [1]. electric; [2]. explosions; [3]. waves; [4]. collisions; The answer is:","completion":"[4]. collisions; Higher temperatures increase the rate of reaction in a lot of chemical reactions because they increase the frequency of collisions between reactant particles.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Recep Tayyip Erdogan (Turkish pronunciation: [re'dZep taj'jip 'aerdo(W)an] ( listen); born 26 February 1954) is a Turkish politician serving as the current President of Turkey, holding the position since 2014. He previously served as Prime Minister from 2003 to 2014 and as Mayor of Istanbul from 1994 to 1998. He founded the Justice and Development Party (AKP) in 2001, leading it to general election victories in 2002, 2007 and 2011 before standing down upon his election as President in 2014. In 2001, Erdogan established the Justice and Development Party (AKP). The elections of 2002 were the first elections in which Erdogan participated as a party leader. All parties previously elected to parliament failed to win enough votes to re-enter the parliament. The AKP won 34.3% of the national vote and formed the new government. Turkish stocks rose more than 7% on Monday morning. Politicians of the previous generation, such as Ecevit, Bahceli, Yilmaz and Ciller, resigned. The second largest party, the CHP, received 19.4% of the votes. The AKP won a landslide victory in the parliament, taking nearly two-thirds of the seats. Erdogan could not become Prime Minister as he was still banned from politics by the judiciary for his speech in Siirt. Gul became the Prime Minister instead. In December 2002, the Supreme Election Board canceled the general election results from Siirt due to voting irregularities and scheduled a new election for 9 February 2003. By this time, party leader Erdogan was able to run for parliament due to a legal change made possible by the opposition Republican People's Party. The AKP duly listed Erdogan as a candidate for the rescheduled election, which he won, becoming Prime Minister after Gul handed over the post. On 14 April 2007, an estimated 300,000 people marched in Ankara to protest against the possible candidacy of Erdogan in the 2007 presidential election, afraid that if elected as President, he would alter the secular nature of the Turkish state. Erdogan announced on 24 April 2007 that the party had nominated Abdullah Gul as the AKP candidate in the presidential election. The protests continued over the next several weeks, with over one million people reported to have turned out at a 29 April rally in Istanbul, tens of thousands at separate protests on 4 May in Manisa and Canakkale, and one million in Izmir on 13 May. The stage of the elections of 2007 was set for a fight for legitimacy in the eyes of voters between his government and the CHP. Erdogan used the event that took place during the ill-fated Presidential elections a few months earlier as a part of the general election campaign of his party. On 22 July 2007, the AKP won an important victory over the opposition, garnering 46.7% of the popular vote. 22 July elections marked only the second time in the Republic of Turkey's history whereby an incumbent governing party won an election by increasing its share of popular support. On 14 March 2008, Turkey's Chief Prosecutor asked the country's Constitutional Court to ban Erdogan's governing party. The party escaped a ban on 30 July 2008, a year after winning 46.7% of the vote in national elections, although judges did cut the party's public funding by 50%. In the June 2011 elections, Erdogan's governing party won 327 seats (49.83% of the popular vote) making Erdogan the only prime minister in Turkey's history to win three consecutive general elections, each time receiving more votes than the previous election. The second party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), received 135 seats (25.94%), the nationalist MHP received 53 seats (13.01%), and the Independents received 35 seats (6.58%). did he have any other major influences?","completion":"Recep Tayyip Erdogan is a Turkish politician who, in 2001, created a political party called the Justice and Development Party (AKP).

Is the premise \\"Two children read in bed.\\" true if \\"The children are reading at school.\\"?","completion":"The statements \\"Two children read in bed.\\" and \\"The children are reading at school.\\" describe different situations, so we cannot definitively say that the first premise is true based on the information given in the second. To clarify the distinction between these two statements, let us first analyze each statement individually: 1. \\"Two children read in bed.\\" In this statement, the focus is on the two children who are participating in the act of reading while lying in bed. This context suggests that this activity is happening in an environment associated with rest and relaxation, most likely at home or any other place where the children have access to a bed. The statement emphasizes the location of where the reading is happening - in bed. This can indicate that the children are either reading for leisure or possibly as part of a bedtime routine. 2. \\"The children are reading at school.\\" This statement, on the other hand, focuses on the fact that the children are actively engaged in reading within a school setting. This context often implies that the reading activity is carried out as part of their education, such as in a classroom or a school library. The statement emphasizes the location of where the reading is happening - at school, which indicates that this kind of reading may be guided by a teacher or related to a learning objective. Now, when we compare these two statements, we can see that they are not mutually exclusive per se. The two children engaged in reading may do so in different settings – both while in bed and at school – but these two situations do not necessarily occur simultaneously. One scenario could occur at home, outside school hours or during weekends or holidays, while the other could be happening at school. Consequently, assuming the two situations involve the same children, one cannot be used as evidence to support the validity or truth of the other. Therefore, based on the information we have from the statement \\"The children are reading at school,\\" we cannot confidently confirm the truth of the premise \\"Two children read in bed.\\" To verify the first premise, we would require additional information or context about when and where these two children read in bed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: People do not analyze every problem they meet. Sometimes they try to remember a solution from the last time they had a similar problem. They often accept the opinions or ideas of other people. Other times they begin to act without thinking. They try to find a solution by trial and error. However, when all these methods fail, the person with a problem has to start analyzing. There are six stages in analyzing a problem. First the person must recognize that there is a problem. For example, Sam's bicycle is broken, and he cannot read it to class as he usually does. Sam must see that there is a problem with his bicycle. Next the thinker must define the problem. Before Sam can repair his bicycle, he must find out the reason why it does not work. For instance, he must determine if the problem is with the gears, the brakes, or the frame. He must make his problem more specific. Now the person must look for information that will make the problem clearer and lead to possible solutions. For instance, suppose Sam decided that his bike does not work because there is something wrong with the gear wheels. At this time, he can look in his bicycle repair book and read about gears. He can talk to his friends at the bike shop. He can look at his gears carefully. After studying the problem, the person should have several suggestions for a possible solution. Take Sam as an illustration. His suggestions might be: put oil on the gear wheels; buy new gear wheels and replace the old ones; tighten or loosen the gear wheels. Eventually one suggestion seems to be the solution to the problem. Sometimes the final idea comes very suddenly because the thinker suddenly sees something new or sees something in a new way. Sam, for example, suddenly sees that there is a piece of chewing gum between the gear wheels. He immediately realizes the solution to his problem: he must clean the gear wheels. Finally the solution is tested. Sam cleans the gear wheels and finds that afterwards his bicycle works perfectly. he has solved the problem.

Close the lid and give your grill about 10 to 15 minutes to get hot. Scrape the hot grill rack clean with a wire brush. Brush the hot rack of your grill with oil to prevent sticking (optional). Place your patties into the grill and sear on one side for about 3 minutes. Avoid pressing down on your burgers while they are grilling. You may see flare-ups during cooking. Flare-ups are caused by the burger fat dripping into the flames below. Carefully move your patties to a higher rack or cooler side of the grill until the flames subside. On a gas grill, you will find the cooler areas on higher racks, or along the edges of your grill, away from the flame. Using a metal spatula with a long handle, flip your patties and sear them on the other side to lock in the juices. Continue grilling until you have reached your desired doneness.

Cry in private: If close friends or family members are aware of Lee's emotional state and understand that he might need to process his emotions privately, they might suggest that he takes a short break by stepping out of the event briefly. This option allows Lee to express his feelings openly and comfortably, without being in the public eye. Moreover, allowing Lee to compose himself before rejoining the event could ensure that he can enjoy the remainder of the occasion with ease. 2. Hug his wife: If Lee's wife is present and cognizant of her husband's emotional turmoil, she might instinctively reach out to offer physical and emotional support. A hug, in such a situation, can be a soothing gesture, providing comfort and reassurance to Lee. It demonstrates empathy and understanding and could also serve as a means of sharing the emotional weight that Lee feels compelled to suppress. Furthermore, a hug from his wife could grant Lee a fleeting moment of privacy and vulnerability, even amidst the event. 3. Keep watching the event: For some people, remaining engaged in a pleasurable event can help them cope with their emotions and derive comfort and support from a shared, positive experience. If, in this context, the individuals close to Lee think it is best to remain focused on the event for the sake of distraction or comfort, they might encourage him to keep watching. By doing so, they could be providing an unspoken emotional support and allowing Lee to process his emotions at his own pace, without drawing attention to his struggle. Given these possible actions, it is essential to consider the dynamics of the situation and the relationships between Lee and the people present. The best course of action would be to choose a response that is most suited to Lee's preferences and emotional needs, ensuring that he finds the support and understanding necessary to process his emotions in a healthy and comfortable manner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the dad who said, \\"What's this?\\" to which Julian replied, \\"it's Lucy in the sky with diamonds\\"? During his marriage to Cynthia, Lennon's first son Julian was born at the same time that his commitments with the Beatles were intensifying at the height of Beatlemania. Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in Weybridge some four years later, \\"I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'\\" Lennon used it as the title of a Beatles song, and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials LSD, Lennon insisted, \\"It's not an acid song.\\" Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, \\"Hey Jules\\", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song \\"Hey Jude\\". Lennon later said, \\"That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian ... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'. I always thought it was about me and Yoko but he said it wasn't.\\"Lennon's relationship with Julian was already strained, and after Lennon and Ono moved to New York in 1971, Julian did not see his father again until 1973. With Pang's encouragement, arrangements were made for Julian and his mother to visit Lennon in Los Angeles, where they went to Disneyland. Julian started to see his father regularly, and Lennon gave him a drumming part on a Walls and Bridges track. He bought Julian a Gibson Les Paul guitar and other instruments, and encouraged his interest in music by demonstrating guitar chord techniques. Julian recalls that he and his father \\"got on a great deal better\\" during the time he spent in New York: \\"We had a lot of fun, laughed... Answer:","completion":"The name of the dad who said, \\"What's this?\\" to which Julian replied, \\"it's Lucy in the sky with diamonds\\" is John Lennon. John Lennon was a member of the Beatles, and Julian is his first son with his then-wife Cynthia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Washington (CNN) -- A new poll Tuesday showed voters are willing to give Mitt Romney a fresh look now that he is the certain Republican presidential nominee, and the former Massachusetts governor picked up public backing from the top GOP leaders in the House and Senate. The good news came as Romney's campaign offered a mild rebuke to right-wing rocker Ted Nugent's for his latest inflammatory rhetoric against President Barack Obama, seeking a middle ground between condoning divisive language and alienating conservatives who like Nugent's firebrand politics. Obama, meanwhile, unveiled a new plan to limit oil market speculation as a way to address high gas prices angering Americans as the campaign for the November election heats up. The survey indicates Romney's popularity still lags well behind Obama's: 56% have a favorable view of the president, with 42% saying they see","completion":"him in an unfavorable light, while only 44% of respondents hold a favorable view of Romney, compared to 43% who view him unfavorably – a mainly even split that demonstrates the daunting challenge ahead for Romney to strengthen his image in the minds of the electorate as he pivots towards the general election. As both candidates intensify their campaign efforts, the battleground states' voters will play a crucial role in shaping the outcome, thereby causing both campaigns to focus on critical issues such as the economy, healthcare, and energy policies, all of which have the potential to sway undecided voters and influence the election's direction.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Richard Allen Posner (; born January 11, 1939) is an American jurist and economist who was a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago from 1981 until 2017, and is a Senior Lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School. He is a leading figure in the field of law and economics, and was identified by The Journal of Legal Studies as the most cited legal scholar of the 20th century. Posner is known for his scholarly range and for writing on topics outside of his primary field, law. Posner rejects the concept of animal rights. He recognizes the philosophical force of arguments for animal rights, but maintains that human intuition about the paramount value of human life makes it impossible to accommodate an ethic of animal rights. Posner engaged in a debate with the philosopher Peter Singer in 2001 at Slate magazine, in which Posner argued against restricting the use of animals for food and in scientific experimentation. He agreed that gratuitous cruelty to animals should be avoided, but contends that animal welfare should only be advanced where doing so provides a marginal benefit to society. Posner argues that animal rights conflict with the moral relevance of humanity and that empathy for pain and suffering of animals does not supersede advancing society. He further argues that he trusts his moral intuition until it is shown to be wrong and that his moral intuition says that \\"it is wrong to give as much weight to a dog's pain as to an infant's pain.\\" He further states that people whose opinions were changed by consideration of the ethics presented in Singer's book Animal Liberation failed to see the \\"radicalism of the ethical vision that powers [their] view on animals, an ethical vision that finds greater value in a healthy pig than in a profoundly retarded child, that commands inflicting a lesser pain on a human being to avert a greater pain to a dog, and that, provided only that a chimpanzee has 1 percent of the mental ability of a normal human being, would require the sacrifice of the human being to save 101 chimpanzees.\\" In a 2002 Yale Law Journal article, Posner again criticized animal rights. He also dismissed Gandhi's view that animal rights is consonant with a empathetic and moral society. He supported this conclusion by arguing that Hitler was a vegetarian and Nazi Germany had the most stringent animal-rights laws in history.

Q: Passage: The gas centrifuge process, where gaseous uranium hexafluoride (UF 6) is separated by the difference in molecular weight between 235UF6 and 238UF6 using high-speed centrifuges, is the cheapest and leading enrichment process. The gaseous diffusion process had been the leading method for enrichment and was used in the Manhattan Project. In this process, uranium hexafluoride is repeatedly diffused through a silver-zinc membrane, and the different isotopes of uranium are separated by diffusion rate (since uranium 238 is heavier it diffuses slightly slower than uranium-235). The molecular laser isotope separation method employs a laser beam of precise energy to sever the bond between uranium-235 and fluorine. This leaves uranium-238 bonded to fluorine and allows uranium-235 metal to precipitate from the solution. An alternative laser method of enrichment is known as atomic vapor laser isotope separation (AVLIS) and employs visible tunable lasers such as dye lasers. Another method used is liquid thermal diffusion.

This artistic theme represents the idea that no matter one's station in life, death is the great equalizer that connects everyone. The Dance of Death originated in Basel, a city located in present-day Switzerland, in the form of a mural painted on the walls of the city's Dominican Cemetery during the 15th century. Death from Basel represents the personification of death, as a skeleton or other macabre figure, who leads people of different societal statuses – such as royalty, clergy, merchants, and peasants – in a dance to their graves. The origin of the Dance of Death theme can be traced back to earlier traditions, such as the biblical concept of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, where death is one of the central figures. It gained popularity during the time of social, political, and religious turmoil that characterized the Late Middle Ages, as well as the massive demographic impact caused by the outbreak of the Black Death pandemic in the 14th century, which killed millions of people across Europe. The Dance of Death grew as a common motif in art, literature, and music during the Late Medieval and Renaissance periods. Artists like Holbein the Younger, Albrecht Dürer, and Michael Wolgemut incorporated this theme into their works, creating woodcuts, frescoes, and illuminated manuscript illustrations that featured Death as an active participant. Performances called \\"dances macabre\\" would also be enacted in churchyards or graveyards, where actors dressed as skeletons, musicians, and other characters would perform lively dances that mimicked the process of life and death. One of the most famous examples of Dance of Death artwork is the series of woodcuts called \\"Dance of Death Alphabet,\\" created by Renaissance artist Hans Holbein the Younger. The series features 41 designs, with each portraying different social classes or professions encountered by Death. This collection showcases the idea that regardless of wealth, status, or power, every individual will eventually face their inevitable demise. In summary, \\"Basel's dance of death\\" and \\"Death from Basel\\" refer to the same artistic concept born in Basel, Switzerland, during the Late Middle Ages, where death is personified and acts as an equalizer among people from various social strata. This theme served as a reminder of the inevitable end that awaits every individual and as a representation of the fragility and temporality of human life. Its profound impact can still be found in contemporary artistic and cultural expressions today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Alona's persistent knocking at the door of room 412 went unanswered for three minutes as she nervously shuffled her feet. Her book bag was super-saturated with textbooks, notebooks, schedules, rough drafts, and various other forms of academic paraphernalia. It was getting heavier. She continued to knock, even though there had as yet been no answer, because the note card tacked to the right of the door indicated that these indeed were Prof. Turgy K. Sigger's office hours.

In this statement, the criticism points out that the Schaffner report shows a serious contempt for the democratic processes and sovereignty of individual nations. By proposing that the Council implement Article 7(a) with minimal consideration for national laws, it undermines the authority and autonomy of the countries involved in decision-making processes. This may lead to tensions and conflicts, both on political and societal levels, as it disregards the unique legal frameworks and principles of each nation. The emphasis on removing internal borders and strengthening control at external borders, as laid out in Article 7(a), could also give rise to issues concerning immigration and border security. While this objective aims to promote cooperation and ease of movement within the participating countries, it could inadvertently create problems. These may include a lack of resources and infrastructure for controlling the influx of people, as well as potential social and cultural clashes resulting from an increase in migration. Furthermore, this approach might exacerbate inequality and feelings of injustice among affected countries, as those with more flexible legal systems or aligned with the Council's goals may perceive it as unfair that they had to adapt their laws significantly, while others did not. Moreover, it could contribute to a general sentiment of resentment towards regional or global organizations, fueling anti-establishment and nationalist movements. To avoid such consequences, it is crucial that international decisions, such as those proposed in the Schaffner report, are made with a high degree of respect for national legislations and democratic principles. This can be achieved by actively involving all relevant parties, conducting thorough assessments of each nation's laws, and promoting a meaningful dialogue between the Member States. By doing so, it is possible to create a more equitable and efficient framework for cooperation without undermining national sovereignty and democratic processes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: Germany has warned Russia against politicising a case involving the alleged rape of a German-Russian girl.","completion":"Title: Germany Cautions Russia Not to Politicize Alleged Rape Case Involving German-Russian Girl Introduction: In a recent development, Germany has issued a warning to Russia not to politicize the case of an alleged rape involving a German-Russian girl. The case has caught the attention of both German and Russian authorities, drawing considerable public interest and sparking concerns about interfering in the legal proceedings. Background: The case began with a young German-Russian girl reportedly claiming to be the victim of rape. While the details surrounding the incident remain unclear, there has been a surge in opinions and reactions, especially from Russian officials and media outlets. German authorities are concerned that the sensitive nature of the case is being manipulated for political gains by Russia, potentially jeopardizing the ongoing legal processes and investigation. Germany's Warning: Germany has been vocal in its displeasure about the potential interference from Russia. The German government has warned Russia to refrain from using the case as a platform for political agendas, with the intention of upholding the integrity of the ongoing legal proceedings. German officials have emphasized the importance of allowing the investigation to continue without hindrance or outside influence to ensure a fair and accurate outcome. Russia's Response: Although Russia has not explicitly addressed Germany's warning, it has continued to express interest in the case and support the alleged victim. Russian officials have stressed the importance of justice and the need to investigate the situation thoroughly. They have not, however, acknowledged any political motivation behind their actions, maintaining that their primary concern is the welfare of the girl involved. The Importance of Protecting Legal Integrity: The potential politicization of legal cases, particularly those of a sensitive nature, can have serious consequences. It is crucial that authorities remain transparent, fair, and focused on the pursuit of justice without being influenced by external political agendas. Legal processes should also remain independent from any political or social pressures to ensure that all parties involved – victims, suspects, and witnesses – are able to present their case and seek justice without fear of bias or interference. Conclusion: Germany's warning to Russia signifies the importance of maintaining an objective perspective in such sensitive cases.

Context: As academic work is becoming arguably more precarious and competitive, shorter contracts are becoming the norm, and the number of people completing PhDs in the UK is increasing, the risks associated with researching academia are high. This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women’s lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher. My PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) – a weighty force in UK academia – the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda. There is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world. Before embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants.

Movie title: You Donât Get Life a Second Time Movie plot: The film opens with Kabir (Abhay Deol) proposing to Natasha (Kalki Koechlin). Their families meet at the engagement party where Natasha learns that Kabir is planning a three-week bachelor road trip to Spain with his school friends Imran (Farhan Akhtar) and Arjun (Hrithik Roshan). Kabir explains that the three have a long-standing pact, and that during the road trip, each of them will have to pick an adventure sport which all three will try together. Initially, Arjun is reluctant to take trip as he does not want to lose his pay for missing work. It is later revealed that Arjun's former girlfriend left him due to his workaholism and his obsession with money. Imran has an additional personal agenda on the trip, to find his biological father Salman Habib (Naseeruddin Shah), an artist in Spain. They fly to Spain separately, where they plan to visit Costa Brava, Seville, and Pamplona. On the way to Costa Brava, Imran and Kabir find it annoying that Arjun works even during the trip. Imran nonchalantly throws Arjun's mobile phone out of their car while he is in the middle of an official call. This leads to a heated argument. Arjun, in a fit of rage, accuses Imran of having an affair, four years prior, with Arjun's previous girlfriend Sonali (a topic which was very sensitive both to Arjun and Imraan). After being pacified by Kabir and reaching their destination, they meet an Anglo Indian named Laila (Katrina Kaif) on a beach. Imran flirts with her and makes Arjun jealous. Kabir reveals that he has chosen deep sea diving as their first sport, and they later find that Laila is their diving instructor. Arjun, who cannot swim and is aquaphobic, receives assistance from Laila. She helps him overcome his fears and finish the sport successfully. Upon a request by Laila, they attend the La Tomatina festival with her in BuÃ±ol and meet Nuria (Ariadna Cabrol), who falls in love with Imraan.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Small businesses see revenue gains, hire workers NEW YORK — The long-awaited surge in hiring at small businesses appears to be underway. Owners who resisted hiring after the recession are taking on workers to keep up with rising demand for products and services. Companies began stepping up their hiring pace in the spring. Faulkner Hyundai in Harrisburg, Pa., is adding seven people to its staff of 92 because new cars are selling at their fastest rate in eight years. The market for used cars is also strong. ‘‘Managers are actually getting involved in selling cars because we don’t have enough salespeople,’’ says Paul Selvaggi, president of the dealership and service center. Faulkner has hired a sales manager, its first new employee since the third quarter of last year. Up next: salespeople, workers to service cars, and employees who develop new sources of revenue. Small businesses held off hiring until they had enough business to justify taking more risks. As recently as March, an American Express survey found 76 percent of owners planned to hire only when their revenue rose. The ripple effect from growth in construction and consumer spending is feeding the increase, says Susan Woodward, an economist who helps software maker Intuit compile its hiring surveys. Liliana Aranda’s business began picking up in March. Her four-year-old company, Faces By Liliana, gives facials, massages, and other spa treatments in homes or offices in the San Francisco area. Her business has done well since its start, but she never needed to hire. When clients held spa parties for their friends, she looked for freelancers to help. In early spring, Aranda suddenly started getting more appointments. She attributes the bump in business to people splurging again after the recession and its aftermath. ‘‘They make a point of saying, I’ve earned this, I’m going to treat myself, and I’m not afraid to spend a little more,’’ she says. The size of Aranda’s spa parties was larger than in the past — 11 to 14 people compared to six to eight. Revenue is up 20 percent so far this year. The increase in business made hiring three part-time employees who she could always rely on a necessity. The recovery in South Florida’s real estate market and economy has allowed Tadd Schwartz’s public relations firm to step up its hiring. Schwartz Media Strategies usually hired one or two employees annually the past six years, but in the last three months, he has added three full-time staffers and two interns, putting his payroll at 17. That’s up from 12 staffers a year ago. Schwartz has been confident enough to hire before sealing a deal with new clients. He wants to have enough people on staff to hit the ground running when a contract is signed. ‘‘We want to position our firm so we’re not only able to service our clients, but be in a position where we don’t have to say no to the right client,’’ he says. Schwartz Media’s revenue is up about 16 percent so far in 2014. If Schwartz lands two or three more big accounts, he says, he will start recruiting again. Publicity the last few months about Brad Barrett’s product Grill Grate sent orders for the backyard grill accessory soaring. Barrett, who was cautious while building his seven-year-old company, had six employees including himself and his wife. He expected that to be enough. But orders flooded in faster than expected, and over the Independence Day weekend, the Barretts had to fill orders themselves for their product, which creates a raised grilling surface for backyard grills. ‘‘We were inside the entire weekend,’’ he says. Barrett is now looking for two workers for the Cartersville, Ga., company — one to help fill orders and the other to handle administrative and marketing tasks. ‘‘We’ve waited perhaps a bit too long. Business is up substantially and the six of us are scrambling,’’ Barrett says. Barrett expected his revenue to grow 40 percent in 2014, but sales of Grill Grate are already up 55 percent from this time last year. ‘‘We’ve only made a small dent in the amount of replacements that need to be done,’’ says Marcus, whose company has 18 employees in Tempe, Ariz., and five in Woodland Hills, Calif. The economy is also a factor in Marcus’s 29 percent revenue surge this year. Small business clients are hiring workers who need computers. And companies that delayed replacing XP systems because of cash flow problems have more money. ‘‘They’re saying, ‘We’ve held out for so long, now we just have to do this,’ ’’ he says.

Write highlights for this article: A coastal cafe is bringing back good manners just one coffee at a time. Owners of Seven Mile Beach Kiosk in Gerroa, on the New South Wales' south coast, have put up a sign which is not only encouraging customers to be more polite, but it is putting a smile on their faces. For about two months, the sign which reads 'A coffee: 5, A coffee please: 4.50, Good morning, a coffee please: 4' has been greeting coffee drinkers. Cafe owners Kev Chilver and wife, Kylie Pickett, own the Seven Mile Beach Kiosk on the NSW south coast. Owner Kev Chilver said he and his wife, Kylie Pickett, wanted to bring back good manners after one of their employees saw a similar sign elsewhere. 'Common courtesy is ... becoming less and less common, and we're trying to bring it back,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'We are in service industry but we’re not servants. We deserve as much respect as anyone else. 'Please and thank you go a long way.' Mr Chilver (pictured here with chef Megan Jones) said he and his wife wanted to bring back common courtesy with the sign. Chef Megan Jones said the sign's purpose has been fulfilled, saying customers having been noticeably more polite to staff. Mr Chilver - who has owned the kiosk with Ms Pickett for four years - said reactions to the sign had been good. 'It gives people a smile and starts their day off,' he said. 'We have some people who try it on and say \\"please\\", thank you\\" and \\"have a nice day\\" and then \\"Can I have it [coffee] for three dollars?\\".' And the sign's desired effect has been panning out. Chef Megan Jones said people were going out of their way to be nicer. 'People have been saying keep the change and they've been a lot nicer and we saw a change in the customers,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'People tended to come in and say \\"Coffee thanks\\" and there was no \\"Hi, how are you?\\"' Mr Chilver and Kylie Pickett have owned the kiosk for about four years, penning the sign about two months ago. Mr Chilver said the sign was a gimmick and the kiosk did not enforce it but it put a smile on people's faces. But Mr Chilver said they did not go as far as enforcing the sign. 'It’s just put up there as a gimmick to cheer people up. We never enforce it,' he said. 'We couldn't take it that far.' This campaign to bring back 'good manners' comes after a Newcastle business owner told parents with noisy children to steer clear of her cafe and a Brazilian-born Australian barista was denied work because he was black at Darlinghurst premises earlier this year. The Little French Cafe owner Jodie Morris in Broadmeadow, near Newcastle, north of Sydney, asked customers to refrain from bringing their unruly offspring into her establishment in a Facebook post. The post, which was made about a week ago, sparked such a backlash from people that it has since been removed. But Ms Morris said business had never been better despite the negative comments. Two months before that, Nilson Dos Santos was rejected from a job at Forbes and Burton café in Darlinghurst - in Sydney's inner-city - with owner Steven Hu citing he 'had not seen African baristas' before. Mr Hu has apologised to Mr Dos Santos but said he stood by his decision to not hire the 39-year-old.","completion":"A café in Gerroa, New South Wales, is encouraging politeness by offering discounts on coffee based on how customers order.

Would the complications be more severe for Patty or for John if it is found they have chlamydia? At a doctor's office, two people come in to get STD tests. John comes in and reports the only symptom he has is a rash on his thighs. Patty says she has seen something leaking out of her vagina, and she's not sure what it is. The doctor takes a urine sample from each and will give them the results in a day or two. Hint: Chlamydia may cause a burning feeling during urination. It may also cause a discharge (leaking of fluids) from the vagina or penis. But in many cases it causes no symptoms. As a result, people do not know they are infected, so they don’t go to the doctor for help. If chlamydia goes untreated, it may cause more serious problems in females. It may cause infections of the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries. These infections may leave a woman unable to have children.","completion":"Based on the given information, if either Patty or John were found to have chlamydia, the complications would likely be more severe for Patty. This is primarily because the potential long-term consequences of a chlamydia infection can be more serious for females. If left untreated, chlamydia in women can develop into pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can lead to infections of the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries. These types of infections can subsequently lead to fertility problems, increasing the likelihood that the woman becomes unable to have children. Chronic pelvic pain, and an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy (a potentially life-threatening pregnancy occurring outside of the uterus) are also associated with untreated or recurrent chlamydia infections in females. In contrast, while men could also have complications from chlamydia, such as urethral infection, epididymitis (inflamed testicles), or rare cases of infertility, the potential complications are generally less severe than in women. Moreover, based on the symptoms provided, it seems more plausible that Patty may be infected with chlamydia. Patty reports an abnormal vaginal discharge, which is a common symptom of chlamydia in women. John, on the other hand, only reports a rash on his thighs, which is not typically associated with chlamydia in men. However, as the text suggests, many people with chlamydia do not know they are infected as it often causes no symptoms. Hence, both of them would need to wait for the test results to confirm any possible infection. Nevertheless, it's important to remember that parties, regardless of gender, should seek medical assistance once they notice any symptoms or suspect that they might have contracted an STI like chlamydia, as early detection and treatment can significantly prevent or reduce any potential complications."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, HOST: It took 24 hours but at long last, the White House has issued a response to the shocking remarks that were delivered by the Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa, who urged an amped-up union crowd to quote, \\"Take those Tea Party sons of bitches out.\\" Now \\"The Anointed One\\" has been calling on you and me to tone down the heated rhetoric since January. But as usual, he and his team, they don't practice what they preach. Now here's what the White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer told WMAL radio earlier today. DAN PFEIFFER, WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: I think that this is a bit of a parlor game in Washington which is, let's try to take anything that anyone who supports politicians, or the president or -- candidates says, and pin it on them and make the, you know, the president have to serve as the speech police for the Democratic Party and someone in the Republican... UNIDENTIFIED MAN: But Dan, he said that he has an army ready to do the president's bidding. And it was time to take the SOBs out. That's a sort of a harsh thing that you should say before the president of the United States speaks. The president has called for, you know, a greater and higher political discourse in this country. This doesn't seem to meet the standard. PFEIFFER: Well, look, that's a judgment for you guys to make. It is a judgment for others to make. HANNITY: Now, I have a judgment. The president is more than happy to serve as the chief of the speech police that's for conservatives, for Republicans, for me, for you, of course, members of the Tea Party Movement, just not for members of his own party. Maxine Waters, \\"you can go straight to hell.\\" Frederica Wilson, thinks you are the real enemy. His own vice president who referred to the Tea Party members as terrorists. And joining me now with reaction, the author of the terrific brand new book called, it's called \\"A Point in Time: The Search for Redemption in This Life and the Next,\\" David Horowitz. The co-host of \\"The Five,\\" always getting in trouble, always having to be defended is our own Bob Beckel. Bob, good to see you. BOB BECKEL, CO-HOST, \\"THE FIVE\\": Good to see you. HANNITY: David, good to see you, too. DAVID HOROWITZ, AUTHOR, \\"A POINT IN TIME\\": Hey. HANNITY: Congrats on the book. This was -- the guy who wrote the art of political war, this is it. This is what we are talking about here. And this is a far more reflective book and a lot of your wisdom. Let me ask you this. Bob Beckel, when Hoffa says, you know, we are at war with them, we are going to take those sons of bitches out, we need jobs. Most Americans are not union members. He's talking about unions, not talking about the American people, the 15 million Americans that are out of work, the other Americans that are under employed, is he? BECKEL: Listen. I really can't quite get what the big deal is here. I mean, I know Jimmy Hoffa and he is not a guy who is a soft spoken guy. Now, would I have used those words now that I have finished calling the Tea Party all the names I could call them, I now call a truce. And I don't call them that. I say they are Tea people and that is fine. Now, but what Hoffa was talking about was, what I said, is let's stop calling them names and let's get to win the war with them, and that war is in the elections because that's where we are going to beat them. And by the way, the Tea Party doesn't represent much in America. Right now, they had a poll out today, among Republicans, they're half, what, positive and negative about the Tea Party. HANNITY: All right. Let's go to a montage of the president, David. I'll get your reaction about -- the issue here is the double standard, the hypocrisy.

JIMMY HOFFA, PRESIDENT, TEAMSTERS, SEPT. 5: Let's take these son of a (bleep) out. OBAMA, JAN. 12: We can question each other's ideas without questioning each other's love of country. REP. FREDERICA WILSON, D-FLA., AUG. 23: Let's all remember who the real enemy is. OBAMA, AUG. 11, 2009: I do hope that we will talk with each other and not over each other. WILSON, AUG. 23: The real enemy is the Tea Party. OBAMA, AUG. 11, 2009: Where we do disagree, let's disagree over things that are real. Not these wild misrepresentations. REP. MAXINE WATERS, D-CALIF., AUG. 23: The Tea Party can go straight to hell. OBAMA, AUG. 11, 2009: People who want to keep things the way they are will try to scare the heck out of folks. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN, SEPT. 5: You are the only folks keeping the barbarians in the gate. OBAMA, AUG. 11, 2009: Create bogeyman out there that just aren't real. HOROWITZ: Well, when it comes Sean, to bold-face lying to the American people, Barack Obama makes Bill Clinton look like a boy scout. I've never seen a president lie with such aplomb and so consistently over so long a time as Barack Obama. It is totally hypocritical. And you know, Bob put a kind of nice spin on the Hoffa speech. This is the language of warfare. This is so destructive to a democracy. Our politics has become unbelievably ugly. And the Democrats for reasons actually, I don't refer to Democrats, but I explain in my book, people on the left are basically in a religious movement. They want to see a redemption in this life. And they see conservatives like us, we are the party of Satan for them. And that's the way they treat us.

Article: Harry Houdini was a man who astonished and attracted many people during his life. Whether he was escaping from a locked box or making things disappear and reappear, he surely was entertaining. People thought that he must truly have some supernatural powers, but in fact, what Harry really had was drive. Harry was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1874. His real name was Ehrich Weiss, the third of five children. His family moved to Wisconsin not long after his birth and when he was nine, he was tying ropes all over his backyard and learning amazing tricks to show his friends and neighbors. He visited the local locksmith, and when he had reached his teens he could pick almost any lock that was made. He also learned how to do card tricks. He and his brother, Theo, would often entertain at local parties and clubs for extra money. When Ehrich was 16, he came across a book that would actually change his life: the biography of France's greatest magician, Jean Eugene Robert-Houdin. It showed Ehrich that his hobby of magic and tricks could also be a career. Immediately, he changed his name to Harry Houdini. He and Theo headed out to make a living as magicians. In 1893, they performed at the Chicago World's Fair, and after that they traveled around giving magic shows for anyone willing to listen and pay. Theo grew restless, however, as the jobs became scarce, so he left. His timing was perfect since Harry had just fallen in love with a lovely woman named Bess who was just the right size for slipping in and out of the trunk they used in their magic tricks. They married immediately and then off they went, traveling with circuses and other road shows. Harry learned more and more tricks and spent much of his time reading and studying all kinds of locks, especially handcuffs. However, no matter what tricks they did or how hard they tried, Bess and Harry were not doing well. They tried to sell their shows for seven years and finally, in desperation, they went to Europe. It was the right move. Harry's persistence and...

Eröffnung der Sitzung Translate this to English?","completion":"Opening of the session The German phrase \\"Eröffnung der Sitzung\\" translates to \\"Opening of the session\\" in English. The term \\"Eröffnung\\" means \\"opening\\" or \\"inauguration,\\" while \\"der Sitzung\\" refers to \\"the session\\" or \\"the meeting.\\" Often used in professional contexts such as conferences, seminars, or governmental meetings, the term indicates the beginning or commencement of a formal event, meeting, or discussion. The purpose of such gatherings is to engage in meaningful discussions, share information, or make decisions, and the opening of the session serves as the starting point for achieving these objectives. At the opening of the session, a designated chairperson or moderator usually welcomes and greets the attendees, sets the tone for the meeting, and lays out the agenda for the discussion. The chairperson might also introduce key speakers, participants, or even the general purpose of the event itself. Depending on the nature and formality of the gathering, this could be followed by opening statements or presentations by participants or members of the audience, who may be experts in their respective fields or individuals with vested interests in the topic under discussion. In addition to setting the tone and objectives for the session, the opening also serves as an opportunity for participants or attendees to liaise with one another, establish rapport, and engage in informal networking. Such interactions often serve to forge connections, identify potential areas of collaboration, and facilitate a freer and more open exchange of ideas. The progression of the session will typically involve a series of presentations, panel discussions, or interactive workshops aimed at furthering the understanding of the subject matter and fostering collaboration. Depending on the nature of the event, there may be multiple sessions, each focusing on a specific topic or theme, running simultaneously or sequentially over the course of several days. The event may also include informal networking opportunities, such as receptions, dinners, or other social activities, designed to encourage participants to continue discussions and exchange information outside of the formal session setting. In conclusion, the phrase \\"Eröffnung der Sitzung\\" signifies the beginning of an important process that involves knowledge sharing, collaboration, and decision-making among a group of individuals gathered in a formal setting. The opening of the session plays a crucial role in setting the stage for productive and meaningful discussions while creating an environment conducive to learning and networking among participants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"No, \\"keep water bad as it is\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"Why did Austin do this?\\" Instead, a more a detailed and accurate answer is as follows: Austin treated Jan's water well for the bad mineral rock deposits because these deposits can negatively impact the quality of the water, making it unsuitable or unsafe for consumption, and might even lead to potential health issues. Mineral deposits can come in various forms, such as calcium, lime, or magnesium, and can alter the taste, odor, and appearance of the water. By treating the well water, Austin's goal was to improve the water quality, optimize its safety for everyday use, and potentially extend the life of the well system. Treating for mineral deposits can also help protect plumbing systems, water heaters, and appliances that use the well water, as these deposits may cause scaling and buildup in pipes and heating elements, leading to device malfunction and costly repairs. In summary, Austin treated Jan's water well to remove the bad mineral deposits in order to enhance the water quality, ensure its safety for consumption, and protect the well system and household appliances from potential damage caused by mineral buildup.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Consider this. On December 17, 2010, Mohamed Bouazizi, a young Tunisian street vendor, set himself on fire and started a dramatic remaking of the political landscape. The striking of a match brought change not only in Tunisia, but also in Egypt and Libya, and even what is happening in Syria. On the other hand, as of August this year, about 48 Tibetans, mostly Buddhist monks and nuns, have self-immolated in Tibetan parts of China. In March 2012 alone, seven people self-immolated, and Tibetan exiles in India have been setting themselves on fire. The political result? Nothing. So why does the self-immolation of one man accomplish so much, but the same gesture performed by so many others accomplishes nothing? Perhaps the question should be phrased differently, because a closer look at Bouazizi's deed and the Tibetan cases reveals that it is something other than the sheer number of self-immolations that makes them a catalyst for change. Two more Tibetans self-immolate in China protest. Tunisians could easily identify with Bouazizi's extreme predicament. His actions spoke to the community's shared frustration and despair. But the demands of Tibetan self-immolators are varied. Some want a \\"free Tibet,\\" as do all Tibetan exiles, but others only want freedom of religion, or political autonomy, or the opportunity to study in Tibetan as opposed to Chinese, or the return of the Dalai Lama to Tibet. When a self-immolator like Bouazizi is perceived as taking upon himself the humiliations and shameful submissions, the collective cowardice and voluntary servitude of his people, he burns off, along with his body, the diffuse sense of shame and guilt that has been paralyzing his community. The burning body thus becomes a site of cleansing, catharsis and regeneration. The community is going -- vicariously, but no less effectively -- through a \\"purification by fire.\\" And in the process an important thing takes place: That society reinvents itself, it is transformed from a shattered community into a political community. As the body is being devoured by flames, the promise (if only the promise) of a new beginning takes shape. The self-immolations of Thích Quàng Đúc in Saigon in 1963 and Jan Palach in Prague in 1969 were not very different from that of Bouazizi. The former was a Buddhist monk who self-immolated to draw attention to the persecution of Buddhists in Vietnam under the Ngô Đình Diem's regime; the latter was a philosophy student who did the same thing in Prague as a response to the Soviet Union's crush of the Prague Spring. Self-immolations that prompt political change are extraordinary and rare events. The ancient Greeks had two different words for time: chronos for ordinary time and kairos for time of special quality -- a particularly propitious time for which our \\"right time\\" is a rather weak translation. For self-immolations to be politically successful, they have to happen in kairos. Bouazizi, Đúc and Palach had many imitators, but none since have achieved so much. That's why the high number of self-immolations among Tibetans lately could be read as an implicit admission of failure. Even though the first self-immolation by a former Tibetan monk, Thupten Ngodup, on April 27, 1998, in New Delhi, had some public impact, it failed to cause the political commotion that Bouazizi triggered in the Arab world. Nor have any of the other Tibetan self-immolators since. Yet, this should not surprise us. There is a strong rejection of violence in Buddhism. Even through self-immolations took place in medieval China and 20th-century Vietnam, even though the Lotus Sutra praises \\"burning for Buddha\\" as the supreme self-sacrifice, Buddhists are very reluctant to condone violence. Tibetan Buddhism, in particular, is centered on compassion toward all sentient beings and prohibition of murder, suicide included. Such a religious and cultural viewpoint must prevent ordinary Tibetans from identifying with the self-immolators. Accommodating this radical form of violence within a culture that has for centuries fed on cosmic compassion and political non-violence is not an easy process. That is why the recent string of self-immolations in Tibetan parts of China is a sign that this could be changing. Most self-immolators are young -- some are teens -- which indicates that the new generation of politically aware Tibetans might have lost patience with the Dalai Lama's nonviolent political philosophy and want to respond differently to the Chinese's aggressive methods. What we see now is possibly the beginning of a new type of political engagement in Tibet, a new pattern very different from Bouazizi's and Palach's, who emerged from communities that had been brought to their knees. Tibetans, instead, over the last 60 years have considered their nation as occupied, but not defeated. Since 1959 they have with some regularity risen against the Chinese authorities. It's very disturbing to watch these self-immolations, but that is part of the intent. The Tibetans want the Chinese and the world to look. The meaning of their gesture lies in its total passivity. It is no accident that after every self-immolation the Chinese authorities scramble to confiscate and destroy any pictures taken; they are only too aware of the iconic status such images can acquire. In essence, these self-immolations are an extreme form of political self-expression. They are performed as part of a struggle for recognition, as an autonomous political community. It confirms what Thích Nhất Hạnh was saying in 1967: \\"To burn oneself by fire is to prove that what one is saying is of the utmost importance. There is nothing more painful than burning oneself. To say something while experiencing this kind of pain is to say it with utmost courage, frankness, determination and sincerity.\\" For many Tibetan monks and nuns of today the burning body has become a tool for the most resounding of self-assertions; when you are in flames your presence cannot be ignored anymore. It is a shouting game of sorts, except that no party shouts. The Tibetans express themselves by burning; the Chinese authorities do the same by shooting Tibetans. Then, another monk or nun engages in self-expression and everything starts anew. Palden Gyatso, a Tibetan monk who spent more than 30 years in Chinese prisons and labor camps, once said: \\"For those who use brute force, there is nothing more insulting than a victim's refusal to acknowledge their power.\\" Rarely has the desire for recognition been so desperate and moving. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Costica Bradatan. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1. In contrast to Bouazizi's self-immolation, which sparked the Arab Spring, the self-immolations by Tibetans have not catalyzed significant political change. 2. Bouazizi's act resonated with a shared sense of frustration and despair among Tunisians, while the demands of Tibetan self-immolators are varied and less unified. 3. Successful self-immolations happen in 'kairos,' or a particularly opportune moment, which has not yet occurred for the Tibetans. 4. Tibetan Buddhism's emphasis on non-violence and compassion may prevent ordinary Tibetans from identifying with self-immolators. 5. The new generation of Tibetans may be losing patience with the Dalai Lama's nonviolent political philosophy and looking for a different response to Chinese aggression. 6. Self-immolations can serve as an extreme form of political self-expression in the struggle for recognition. 7.

The Order of the Phoenix is a group of wizards and witches committed to fighting against the dark forces led by the evil Lord Voldemort and his followers, known as Death Eaters. The organization was initially formed during the First Wizarding War to counteract the rising threats of Voldemort and his dark agenda. Albus Dumbledore, the esteemed and powerful wizard, was a professor and later the headmaster at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was widely regarded as one of the most skilled and wise wizards of his time, playing a crucial role in the fight against Lord Voldemort and his followers in both the First and Second Wizarding Wars. Severus Snape, a former Death Eater, switched sides and became a double-agent working for Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix. His decision to become a double-agent was primarily driven by his love for a fellow Hogwarts student, Lily Evans. After hearing a prophecy involving the possible downfall of Lord Voldemort at the hands of Lily's son, Harry Potter, Snape regretfully realized the danger he had inadvertently put Lily in by sharing the prophecy with Voldemort. When he sought Dumbledore's help to protect Lily and her family, Dumbledore agreed but only if Snape would work as a double-agent within the Death Eaters, providing valuable information to the Order and aiding in the fight against dark forces. Throughout the series, Snape's true loyalties remained clouded, and it was only revealed in the final book, \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\\" that Snape had indeed been working on Dumbledore's side the whole time. Throughout his time as a double-agent, Snape faced considerable challenges, including protecting Harry Potter, whom he disliked due to past animosity with Harry's father, James Potter, and maintaining Voldemort's trust without revealing his true allegiance.

Plot title: Dear Frankie Movie plot: Lizzie Morrison (Emily Mortimer) and nine-year-old deaf son Frankie (Jack McElhone) frequently relocate to keep one step ahead of her abusive ex-husband and his family. They are accompanied by her opinionated, chain-smoking mother Nell. Newly relocated in the Scottish town of Greenock, Lizzie accepts a job at the local fish and chips shop owned by a friendly woman named Marie, and enrolls Frankie in school. Through a Glasgow post office box, Frankie maintains a regular correspondence with someone he believes to be his father, Davey, who allegedly is a merchant seaman working on the HMS Accra. In reality, the letters he receives are written by his mother, who prefers maintaining this charade instead of telling the boy the reason she fled her marriage. When she learns that the Accra will soon be arriving at the docks at Greenock, Lizzie in a panic concocts a scheme to hire a man to impersonate Davey. When her effort to find someone at the local pub fails, she enlists Marie's assistance. Marie arranges for her to meet an acquaintance who coincidentally is passing through town at the same time the Accra will be in port. When Lizzie and the stranger (Gerard Butler) meet, he doesn't tell her his name. Lizzie explains the situation and gives him the letters to provide some background. He agrees to spend a day with Frankie in exchange for the meager payment Lizzie can offer him. When the stranger arrives at their home to pick up the boy, he brings with him a book about marine life (to Lizzie's surprise), one of Frankie's passions, and a bond is forged immediately. The two spend a day together (with Lizzie secretly following them), collecting on Frankie's bet at a soccer match from a school mate, ordering chips, and later in the evening setting up another half day visit. The second day is magical, ending with a nice evening at a dance, as Frankie wins another bet by getting Lizzie and the stranger to dance together.

Summarize this article: Leigh Corfman, who claimed that former Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore molested her when she was 14 years old, has filed a defamation lawsuit against him. The lawsuit, filed Thursday in Montgomery County Circuit Court, also names Moore's campaign as a defendant. Moore and his campaign committee \\"have defamed Ms. Corfman, repeatedly and in all forms of media, calling her a liar and questioning her motivation for publicly disclosing that Mr. Moore sexually abused her in 1979 when she was a 14-year-old high school freshman and he was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney.\\" The allegations by Corfman, first reported Nov. 9 by The Washington Post, were the centerpiece of a scandal that plagued Moore's campaign over the final month, which ended with a narrow loss to Democrat Doug Jones. Moore has repeatedly denied the allegations made by Corfman and other women of unwanted romantic or sexual advances. Corfman has confirmed the Post's account to AL.com. \\"The decision to sue Mr. Moore and his campaign committee was difficult, but they need to be held responsible for their actions,\\" Corfman said in a written statement to AL.com. \\"Mr. Moore sexually abused me when I was only 14 years old. Then he and his campaign called me a liar and immoral when I publicly disclosed his misconduct. They ignored my requests to stop attacking me and to acknowledge the truth. Just last week, after the election, they filed a lawsuit in which they once again called me a liar. By this lawsuit, I seek to do what I could not do as a 14-year-old--hold Mr. Moore and those who enable him accountable.\\" A phone message left by AL.com at the office of Moore attorney Trent Garmon was not immediately returned Thursday. The 29-page lawsuit seeks for the defendants to retract all defamatory statements made against Corfman, to publicly apologize for those statements and to refrain from further defamatory statements as well as to pay the costs and expenses of the lawsuit. The suit also asks for \\"further relief as permitted by law and as the court deems appropriate.\\" The lawsuit also pointed to the legal filing by Moore and his campaign on Dec. 27, 2017 that was an effort to stop the election results from being certified by the state of Alabama. In that document, Corfman's allegations were described as \\"false and malicious.\\" Corfman's lawsuit also raised the issue of a Nov. 28 open letter from her to Moore provided to AL.com that \\"asked him to stop denying his sexual abuse of her in 1979, to acknowledge his misconduct, and to apologize.\\" \\"Instead, the lawsuit said, \\"Moore continued his attacks, accusing Ms. Corfman of lying and having improper purposes. He made these statements at campaign rallies, in interviews, on the internet, on the radio, on television, and in newspapers. Mr. Moore has claimed, among other assertions, that Ms. Corfman's account is 'completely false,' 'malicious,' 'politically motivated,' that it reflects 'the immorality of our time,' and that 'there is not one ounce of truth in her accusations.'\\" The lawsuit said that as a result of the statements made by Moore and his campaign, Corfman took a temporary leave of absence from her job without compensation. Corfman said she has not received any compensation from The Post or any other source for disclosing her encounter with Moore. \\"Ms. Corfman is a private citizen whose only motivation is to clear her name and to stop Mr. Moore and the Moore Campaign Committee from continuing their defamatory attacks on her,\\" the lawsuit said. \\"Ms. Corfman wishes that defendants had heeded her requests to cease their defamation of her and seeks judicial intervention as a last resort to hold Defendants accountable for their misconduct, including a declaration that defendants' denials of Mr. Moore's sexual abuse of her and their characterization of her account of this abuse as 'false,' 'malicious,' and 'immoral,' among other untrue statements, are defamatory, as well as injunctive relief against these statements. Mr. Moore and the Moore Campaign Committee will likely continue their defamation of Ms. Corfman unless this Court orders them to stop.\\" The lawsuit outlines 11 instances in which Moore publicly denied Corfman's allegations or denied knowing her altogether. \\"All these statements by Mr. Moore are defamatory,\\" the lawsuit said. \\"Mr. Moore sexually abused Ms. Corfman in 1979, when she was 14 years old and he was in his early 30s, and Mr. Moore's denials of these facts are false and his characterizations of Ms. Corfman and her motivations are untrue. Mr. Moore knew or should have known that Ms. Corfman's account is truthful because he was the perpetrator in the events she described. At a minimum, Mr. Moore was reckless in making these statements.\\" Regarding the Moore campaign committee, the lawsuit identified five people \\"have repeated Mr. Moore's false denials of sexually abusing Ms. Corfman when she was 14 years old and Mr. Moore's reckless accusations of improper motivations.\\" Those five individuals associated with the campaign: Manager Rich Hobson, Chairman Bill Armistead, attorney Benjamin Dupre, spokeswoman Janet Porter and strategist Dean Young.

Jones was sworn in on Wednesday. ADVERTISEMENT The Washington Post first published Corfman’s account in November, about a month before the special election. The newspaper also spoke with two other women who said Moore made advances toward them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. In the following weeks, multiple other women came forward to accuse Moore of sexual misconduct, including one woman who alleged Moore sexually assaulted her when she was 16. Moore repeatedly denied the allegations, calling them a conspiracy by establishment Republicans and the media to get him to drop out of the race. He also denied knowing Corfman, saying, \\"I never talked to her, never had any contact with her.\\" His supporters and campaign representatives said in interviews that they did not believe the women and called them liars. Moore has still not conceded following his Dec. 12 electoral loss. He filed a court complaint in an attempt to stop the results from being certified, but a court rejected Moore’s protest and declared Jones the winner. In his filing, Moore said he took a polygraph test after the election to confirm that the allegations against him were false. ||||| Senate candidate Roy Moore, with his wife Kayla Moore, talk to the media after voting and arriving by horse at the Gallant Volunteer Fire Department in Gallant, Ala. on Tuesday, Dec. 12, 2017. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) In a lawsuit that echoes a civil case against President Trump, an Alabama woman on Thursday sued failed U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore and his campaign for defamation, citing harsh personal attacks she faced after coming forward with allegations that he touched her sexually when she was 14 years old. Leigh Corfman is not seeking financial compensation beyond legal costs, said her attorney, Neil Roman. She is asking for a declaratory judgment of defamation, a public apology from Moore, and a court-enforced ban on him or his campaign publicly attacking her again. Corfman said in a statement that the suit seeks “to do what I could not do as a 14-year-old — hold Mr. Moore and those who enable him accountable.” A representative of Moore’s campaign, Brett Doster, said, “We look forward to transparently discussing these matters in a court of law.” Corfman told The Washington Post in November that when Moore was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney in 1979, he took her to his house, undressed her, touched her over her underpants and bra and guided her hand to touch his genitals over his underwear. The allegations upended the race. On Election Day, exit polls showed 52 percent of voters in Alabama believed the allegations against Moore were probably or definitely true, and 7 percent said those allegations were the most important factor in deciding their vote. Doug Jones’s victory marked the first time in 25 years that a Democrat in Alabama won a U.S. Senate race. Roy Moore accuser Leigh Corfman spoke to the “Today” show Nov. 20, following allegations she made in The Washington Post that U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore seduced and molested her when she was 14. (Taylor Turner/The Washington Post) Among Moore’s statements that the suit claims are defamatory: He called Corfman’s allegations of abuse “politically motivated,” “completely false” and “malicious.” On Nov. 10, the day after The Post published its story, Moore told Sean Hannity of Fox News he had never met Corfman. Weeks later, in a complaint that unsuccessfully sought to disqualify the election results, Moore said a polygraph examination confirmed that he did not know her. Corfman was among five women who told The Post that Moore pursued them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. Doug Jones is sworn in, shrinking GOP Senate majority Corfman’s suit — filed in Montgomery County, Ala., one day after Jones took the oath of office — represents a fledgling legal strategy where people who say they were victimized long ago are litigating their claims through defamation lawsuits. The strategy allows them to proceed even after the statute of limitations has run out for criminal charges or for lawsuits seeking damages for sexual abuse, as it has in Corfman’s case. The defamation suit against Trump was brought by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on the reality show “The Apprentice” who says he kissed and groped her in 2007. During the 2016 campaign, Trump called the claims by multiple women that he had touched them improperly “big lies,” and he called the women “liars.” A judge in New York State Supreme Court is weighing Trump’s motion to dismiss the case. Zervos’s attorney, Gloria Allred, has said that a defamation case she and attorney Mariann Meier Wang settled in New York in 2015 is “an important precedent.” In that case, two former ballboys accused a Syracuse University basketball coach of defaming them after they spoke up about alleged sexual abuse. Allred also represents a woman who accused Moore of kissing and groping her when she was 16 years old. At a news conference, Beverly Young Nelson produced her high school yearbook containing an inscription she said was written by Moore to prove that he knew her, though she later acknowledged adding the location, date and initials “D.A.” after the signature. Comedian Bill Cosby has also been sued for defamation in cases that involve allegations of abuse years ago. A federal judge in Pennsylvania last year tossed out a suit filed by a woman who said Cosby defamed her in the media after she accused him of drugging and sexually assaulting her. A separate defamation lawsuit, filed in 2014 by several women who say Cosby sexually assaulted them, is pending in Massachusetts. Yet another defamation case, filed against Cosby in 2015 by former supermodel Janice Dickinson, is pending in the California courts. Under a landmark Supreme Court ruling, the legal standard for defamation of a public figure is that the statements were known to be false or showed a “reckless disregard for the truth,” experts say. The standard is lower for defaming a private individual — negligence toward the truth — though Corfman’s suit claims Moore’s comments meet the higher standard. Corfman’s lawsuit cites numerous negative comments made by Moore and five top campaign allies, including campaign manager Rich Hobson, who announced Wednesday that he is running for Congress.

Ever since Jimmy Carter won his way to the White House in 1976 by assuring voters that they could trust him in contrast to the more experienced opponents he faced, both Republican and Democratic candidates have tended to boast about every part of their resume that can distinguish themselves from the Washington status quo. In 2008, then-Sen. Barack Obama undercut the \\"inevitable\\" Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by running as the candidate who was the least corrupted by the bargaining ways of Capitol Hill. Through its portrayal of Sen. John McCain's selection of Sarah Palin, the HBO film \\"Game Change\\" effectively captures just how far political candidates are willing to go to have this appeal. This year, the story is the same. Although President Obama is boasting of his accomplishments in the White House as the nation's leader, he is also using Congress as a foil to lambaste the way that the \\"real\\" insiders in the capital do their business. Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum have tried to transform themselves from pillars of the congressional Republican establishment into conservative mavericks, while front-runner Mitt Romney talks frequently about how he would bring the skills of a CEO to Washington. The problem is that doing well in Washington requires a very different kind of skill set than the ones that business executives or mavericks bring to the table. Each of these claims is flawed -- as Obama himself discovered -- given the world in which presidents must operate. Presidents govern in a porous world that makes every move and decision visible to the public within a relatively short time span. Constant scrutiny from the media means the president essentially works inside glass walls. Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1. When was Carter elected? 2. What did he tell voters about himself? 3. Are presidents constantly being evaluated by the media? 4. Obama claimed to be less corrupted than who? 5. When was that? 6. Was Hillary the Republican nominee? 7. What was the political movie about Palin? 8. What are both party's candidates tried to be different from? 9. What was Obama's job in 2008? 10.

Help as much as you can. Given the question: For active people, regular training is as important part of maintaining and increasing fitness. About the only real downside to regular exercise is the transient toll it takes on the body after a hard training session. The pain and soreness after training needs sufficient time to recover from before another hard session can be performed. A very plausible theory pushed for many years is that the post-exercise oxidative stress in the body is the primary cause of the muscle damage and fatigue experienced. If you could reduce this oxidative stress, then it would allow quicker recovery, and then more time spent training. What this theory ignores though is that oxidative damage is a natural part of how the body adapts to stressful exercise, allowing the body to repair and grow stronger to allow higher levels of performance in the future. A small scale study has previously found that trained and untrained individuals who dose up on antioxidant supplements impair important exercise training adaptations such as improved insulin sensitivity and production of oxidative stress defence proteins. Now researchers have extended this study by looking at the effect of antioxidants in trained female runners, and published their findings in the European Journal of Sports Science. Twenty-three well trained female runners took part in three separate 3-week training blocks where they took either 1 gram of vitamin C, blackcurrant juice, or a placebo drink for each of the training blocks. Each of the dietary interventions involved drinking a similar volume of fruit drink of a total of half a litre per day split over the morning and evening. The training performance of each runner was carefully measured at the beginning and end of each 3-week treatment period. The runners stuck to a set training schedule which allowed a more accurate assessment of any changes in performance over the training period. Question: Why was a set training schedule used in a study of training performance of runners? Options: A. not enough information B. the runners had a regimen to begin with C. it was easier to study D. it allowed for a more accurate assessment of any changes === The correct answer is The answer is:","completion":"D. it allowed for a more accurate assessment of any changes"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. what style of art did van gogh do??","completion":"Vincent van Gogh, a renowned Dutch painter, was a leading artist in the development of the Post-Impressionism movement during the late 19th century. This style of art emerged as a reaction against the established Impressionist movement, and sought to delve deeper into the emotional and intellectual aspects of art. Van Gogh’s work distinctly showcased his personal experiences and emotions through an innovative blend of color, form, and texture. Van Gogh's art is characterized by several unique features that set it apart from the works of his contemporaries: 1. Bold use of color: Deviating from the traditional palette, Van Gogh employed bright, vivid, and high-contrast colors in his paintings. This choice reflected his desire to use colors both symbolically and emotionally, aiming to elicit deep feelings in the viewer. For instance, the vibrant yellows in \\"Sunflowers\\" exude warmth and optimism, while the darker blues in \\"The Starry Night\\" evoke a sense of mystery and vastness. 2. Expressive brushwork: Van Gogh's paintings are widely recognized for their dynamic and energetic brushstrokes. These intense strokes convey a sense of movement and tension in his work. Often using thick, impasto layers of paint, Van Gogh further emphasized the emotional qualities of his paintings through tactile and three-dimensional effects. In \\"Wheatfield with Crows,\\" the violence of the brushwork adds a sense of turbulence and unease to the landscape. 3. Evolution of subject matter: Throughout his artistic career, Van Gogh explored various themes, including still life, portraiture, landscapes, and scenes from everyday life. His subject matter evolved from dark and somber works like \\"The Potato Eaters\\" to more colorful and emotionally charged pieces such as \\"Irises\\" and \\"Café Terrace at Night.\\" Van Gogh's art reveals his fascination with the natural world, his fellow humans, and his personal search for meaning and solace. 4. Symbolic representations: Van Gogh was deeply invested in incorporating symbolism into his work, often infusing objects and scenes with greater meaning. He used various elements to provide a deeper understanding of his thoughts and emotions, such as the swirling stars in \\"The Starry Night\\" to depict the turbulent nature of the universe or the organic shapes in \\"Almond Blossoms\\" to represent life, hope, and renewal. 5. Emotional intensity: One of the critical aspects of Van Gogh's art is its strong emotional charge. His paintings capture the artist's emotional state at the time of creation, resulting in deeply personal and often haunting works. The intensity of the colors, the vigorous brushstrokes, and the unconventional compositions all combine to create a style that conveys raw emotion and intensity. In conclusion, Van Gogh played a vital role in the evolution of modern art through his innovative and distinctive approach to Post-Impressionism. His bold use of color, expressive brushwork, diverse subject matter, symbolic representations, and emotional intensity remains a significant influence on generations of artists and continues to captivate the imagination of art enthusiasts worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is Bugs Bunny's final destination? Movie title: Ali Baba Bunny Movie plot: In the middle of the Arabian Desert, a rich Sultan has stored all his treasure in a cave and is leaving his guard Hassan to watch the cave. As the Sultan leaves, the trail of a burrowing rabbit crosses the desert towards the cave. Hassan spots the burrow tunneling under the entrance of the cave and attempts to chase out the intruders, but has trouble remembering the command to open the door. Inside the cave, Bugs Bunny and his traveling companion Daffy Duck emerge from the burrow, believing they have arrived at Pismo Beach. Daffy's complaints about travelling underground (\\"What a way for a duck to travel; underground!\\") and that they're at the wrong place are silenced when he spots the riches. Determined to keep it all for himself, he stomps repeatedly on Bugs to force him back into the burrow. Meanwhile, Hassan finally says the correct command to open the door and marches in. He is met by Daffy, who is wheeling a cart full of loot. Mistaking Hassan for a \\"redcap\\" (porter), Daffy asks him to call a cab. In response, Hassan brings his sword down on Daffy's head, splitting in half both the diamond-adorned hat he is wearing and a single feather underneath. Daffy chuckles nervously before he flees in terror and uses a large gem to try bribing Bugs into saving him, but Bugs is only concerned with dusting himself off from the earlier abuse from Daffy. Hassan rushes towards them both, sword raised. Daffy hides and tells Hassan to chop the rabbit, but Bugs has disguised himself to be a genie in a bottle and fools Hassan with a rich offer for releasing him. Hassan does, taking no notice of Daffy's attempt to expose Bugs. Bugs tells Hassan the treasure is his to claim. Daffy sardonically mocks Bugs for allowing Hassan access to the treasure he wanted for himself. Outside the cave, Bugs surveys the desert and concludes he is in the wrong place. Suddenly, Daffy runs out of the cave carrying a large gem. Hassan is in hot pursuit, enraged over the duck's efforts to lay claim to the treasure. Daffy begs Bugs to save him,... The answer is:","completion":"The final destination for Bugs Bunny in the movie \\"Ali Baba Bunny\\" is Pismo Beach.

Article: More students than ever before are taking a gap-year before going to university.It used to be called the \\"year off\\" between school and university.The gap-year phenomenon originated with the months left over to Oxbridge applicants between entrance exams in November and the start of the next academic year. This year, 25,310 students who have accepted places in higher education institutions have put off their entry until next year, according to statistics on university entrance provided by University and College Admissions Serbice(UCAS). That is a record 14.7% increase in the number of students taking a gap year. Tony Higgins from UCAS said that the statistics are good news for everyone in higher education. \\"Students who take a well-planned year out are more likely to be stisfied with, and complete, their chosen course. Students who take a gap year are often more mature and responsible,\\" he said. But not everyone is happy.

Options: - closet - hallway - hot room - home - office The answer is \\"office\\" because Answer:","completion":"The answer is \\"office\\" because the electric fan being too loud and bothersome to others directly pertains to the workplace environment. In an office setting, it is crucial to maintain a comfortable and peaceful atmosphere for everyone to be able to focus and work efficiently. Allowing too much noise or disturbance from personal items, such as an electric fan, can distract coworkers and ultimately affect productivity. In this scenario, the electric fan is being used by an individual at their desk within the office, and it is creating excessive noise that is bothering others. It is important to respect the professional setting and the comfort of each employee. Hence, the individual is required to turn off the fan, despite the allowance of personal items on their desk. Turning the fan off within the office would effectively resolve the noise issue and maintain a comfortable environment for all. Comparatively, other options such as the closet, hallway, hot room, or home do not directly address the issue of noise and disturbance within the workplace. Turning off the fan in a closet or hallway would not be practical, as it would not benefit the individual who requires the fan for their comfort. In addition, a hot room is most likely not a part of a typical office environment, and therefore, it would not be a suitable place to turn off the fan. Lastly, turning the fan off at home would not resolve the problem either, as the issue takes place within the office. In conclusion, the best option to address the problem of the electric fan generating excessive noise and distracting others is to turn it off within the office. This action respects the professional environment and ensures a comfortable and peaceful atmosphere for all employees. Other options like the closet, hallway, hot room, and home do not adequately address the disturbance caused by the fan in the office, making \\"office\\" the most suitable answer."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The [i] root canal would hurt more.. [ii] filling would hurt more..","completion":"I needed to get a cavity worked on. Should I get a root canal or a filling? The root canal would hurt more, while the filling would hurt less. Before making a decision, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons of each treatment option. Step 1: Understand the problem A cavity is the result of tooth decay, which causes damage to the tooth's structure. If left untreated, the decay can progress and potentially lead to more severe dental issues such as abscesses or tooth loss. Step 2: Conduct thorough research To make an informed decision, it's crucial to learn about both root canals and fillings. Consulting a dentist and researching reliable sources can provide valuable insight. Step 3: Evaluate the severity of the cavity Consider the extent of the cavity and its potential impact on overall dental health. Dentists can recommend the most appropriate treatment based on the severity of the problem. Step 4: Compare the treatments Now that we know more about root canals and fillings, let's compare them: - Root Canals: These procedures can save severely damaged teeth. The dentist removes the affected tissue, cleans and disinfects the canals, and seals the tooth. Root canals can be more painful and time-consuming than fillings. They are usually more expensive but can prevent tooth loss. - Fillings: Fillings are a common treatment for minor to moderate cavities. The dentist removes the decayed portion of the tooth and fills the cavity with a material such as composite resin or silver amalgam.

Write a \\"[1].\\" movie review (Select from: [1]. negative. [2]. positive.).","completion":"I will write a negative movie review for \\"Extraterrestrial Beings: The Attack\\" (a fictional movie). Title: Extraterrestrial Beings: The Attack - A Lackluster Invasion 1. Introduction: \\"Extraterrestrial Beings: The Attack\\" had the potential to be a thrilling sci-fi action film about a battle between humanity and alien invaders. Unfortunately, it falls short of expectations due to poor character development, lackluster action sequences, and an unoriginal plot. 2. Poor Character Development: The film's characters feel shallow and one-dimensional. The audience is never given enough time to truly understand the protagonist's motivations or care about the people fighting for their lives. This lack of connection weakens the impact of the story. 3. Lackluster Action Sequences: For a movie centered around an alien invasion, the action scenes are surprisingly dull. The CGI is unconvincing, and the fight choreography leaves much to be desired. Many moments meant to be awe-inspiring or thrilling simply fall flat, failing to elicit any excitement or tension from the audience. 4. Unoriginal Plot: \\"Extraterrestrial Beings: The Attack\\" relies heavily on clichés and tired tropes that have been seen in countless other invasion films. The result is a predictable and uninspiring story that offers little in the way of innovation or surprise. 5. Conclusion: While \\"Extraterrestrial Beings: The Attack\\" had the potential to breathe new life into the alien invasion genre, its shortcomings ultimately result in a lackluster and forgettable moviegoing experience. Fans of science fiction and action films are better off looking elsewhere for their fix of thrilling battles and well-developed characters."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

FORT WORTH — Early this month, Wendy Davis, the unknown Texas state senator who rocketed to fame this summer with her 11-hour filibuster to block an anti-abortion bill, met with strategists of the Democratic Governors Association at their K Street offices in Washington. They were urging her to run for governor next year, even though Texas is not among their realistic targets for flipping a Republican-held executive mansion. All around Ms. Davis, people are encouraging her to get in the governor’s race. Whether she can win seems beside the point. Liberal groups in Texas are hungry for her star power to energize the moribund state Democratic Party. Political operatives smell the money that a richly financed Democratic campaign, which early estimates put at 40 million, would direct their way. And national Democrats know a Davis campaign would force the Republican Governors Association to divert millions from more competitive races in Ohio, Florida and Michigan to the Lone Star State. “The R.G.A. would probably have to waste resources there, which is compelling to us,” said an official of the Democratic group, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly. Ms. Davis, tuning out the self-interested chorus, has spent August engaging in a private inquiry into the viability of a race for which independent analysts put the chances of her success somewhere between a long shot and a pipe dream. On Thursday she said she would announce her decision in a few weeks — a decision she postponed because she is caring for her father, who is hospitalized with complications from surgery, she said in a statement. What trusted advisers, pollsters, fund-raisers and friends are telling her, they said in interviews, is that there is a path to victory, even in Texas, where no Democrat has won statewide office in nearly two decades. “My impression was she was very interested,” said Martin Frost, a Washington lobbyist and former Texas congressman whose counsel Ms. Davis sought. “You don’t get these opportunities very often. She’s 50 years old. This is the right time for her.” In her most recent public appearance, she sounded very much like a candidate on the verge. She was “very, very seriously considering” a campaign, she told an audience in San Francisco two weeks ago. She added, “I really think hard things are worth fighting for.” That sentiment echoed what aides have identified as the best way for Ms. Davis to position herself — as a fighter for her beliefs — and deflect Republican efforts to narrowly define her as a defender of late-term abortion. Researchers presented Ms. Davis with private polling that showed she was better known for her personality than for her positions. They also prepared an analysis of the nearly 900,000 Twitter messages in the 24 hours around her filibuster in June, which temporarily halted a bill to ban abortion in Texas after 20 weeks. A high percentage of those messages focused on her physical ordeal. “Probably the biggest benefit of this filibuster is Wendy is known statewide and she’s known as a fighter, and that plays very well in Texas,” said Matt Angle, an adviser to Ms. Davis. Republicans are moving swiftly to peg Ms. Davis, whose celebrity was confirmed this month by a Vogue magazine spread, as someone out of step with the state’s conservative electorate. “God, I hope she runs, it’ll be great,” said Dave Carney, a consultant to Attorney General Greg Abbott, the most likely Republican nominee. “I don’t see her brand of populism, which is beautifully accepted on the Left Coast and the Acela Corridor, being a selling job in Texas.” Ms. Davis has sought to broaden her identity, emphasizing a life story that few members of the coastal elites would identify with. Raised by a mother with a sixth-grade education after her father left, she became a single mother herself, living in a mobile home. She worked her way through community college, won a scholarship to Texas Christian University and eventually graduated from Harvard Law School. She served nine years on the Fort Worth City Council before defeating a Republican incumbent for the State Senate in 2008. In Austin, her shoulder-length blond mane inspired jokes that she was the only politician with better hair than Gov. Rick Perry. Much of Ms. Davis’s due diligence in eyeing a run has involved sifting the results of past statewide Texas races. The numbers are daunting: President Obama lost the state by 16 points in November. The 2010 Democratic nominee for governor pulled only 42 percent. But Ms. Davis’s number crunchers are telling her, in essence, that if she can win her Senate district — much of Fort Worth and its suburbs — she can win statewide. It is the only district out of 31 in the state that is a true battleground, not drawn to protect one of the parties. ||||| Rising Democratic star Wendy Davis continues to be a major grassroots fundraising force. According to campaign finance reports filed this week, the Texas state senator netted 1.2 million in the six weeks following her June filibuster against an abortion bill being considered by the Texas legislature. Text Size - + reset Wendy Davis's filibuster The 13-hour marathon filibuster and its aftermath — which drew national media attention — immediately catapulted the 50 year-old lawmaker into the spotlight and prompted calls from supporters for a statewide run. (QUIZ: Do you know Wendy Davis?) According to a POLITICO analysis of her campaign finance report, Davis raised most of her funds from small donors. She reported almost 24,000 individual donors — with an average donation to her campaign of about 52. About 60 percent of her funds came from inside the Lone Star State. Her largest individual donor was Fort Worth investor and businessman Sid Bass, who gave 100,000. The Texas-based group Annie’s List also contributed 50,000 to her state senate campaign. The group launched a grassroots effort earlier this month to encourage Davis to run for the governorship. (PHOTOS: Wendy Davis’s filibuster) Most of her largest donors are in-state. Of the 10 individual donors who gave more than 10,000 to her campaign, only one was out of state. Other big donors to her campaign include Houston attorney Laura Arnold, oil executive Lee Fikes and Marguerite Hoffman, wife of the businessman and National Lampoon co-founder Robert Hoffman. All gave 10,000 to her efforts. Davis has done some out-of-state fundraising as well, with a late July swing into Washington, D.C., for a small donor event. Davis said she will decide whether she wants to run for the open Texas governship next month, where Texas attorney general Greg Abbott has amassed more than 20 million. If she passes on the governor’s race, she has vowed to run for reelection as a state senator. News of Davis’ fundraising numbers was first reported by several Texas media outlets. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Wendy Davis, a Texas state senator who gained fame for her 11-hour filibuster to block an anti-abortion bill, has been receiving encouragement from various groups to run for governor.

He could see that she was frightened, standing out there in the cold. He knew how she felt. He said, \\"I am here to help you, ma'am. Why don't you wait in the car where it's warm? By the way, my name is Bryan Anderson.\\" Well, all she had was a flat tire, but for an old lady, that was bad enough. Bryan crawled under the car looking for a place to put the jack, skinning his knuckles a time or two. Soon he was able to change the tire. But he had to get dirty and his hands hurt. As he was tightening up the lug nuts, she rolled down the window and began to talk to him. She told him that she was from St. Louis and was just passing through. She couldn't thank him enough for coming to her aid. Bryan just smiled as he closed her trunk. The lady asked how much she owed him. Any amount would have been all right with her. She already imagined all the awful things that could have happened, had he not stopped. Bryan never thought twice about being paid. This was not a job to him. This was helping someone in need, and God knows there were many people who had given him a hand in the past. He had lived his whole life that way, and it never occurred to him to act any other way.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: The greatest recent social changes have been in the lives of women. During the twentieth century there has been a remarkable shortening of the proportion of a woman's life spent in caring for the children. A woman marrying at the end of the nineteenth century would probably have been in her middle twenties, and would be likely to have seven or eight children, four or five of whom lived till they were five years old. By the time the youngest was fifteen, the mother would have been in her early fifties and would expect to live a further twenty years, during which health made it unusual for her to get paid work. Today women marry younger and have fewer children. Usually a woman's youngest child will be fifteen when she is forty-five years and can be expected to live another thirty-five years and is likely to take paid work until retirement at sixty. Even while she has to take care of children, her work is lightened by modern living conditions. This important change in women's life-patterns has only recently begun to have its full effect on women's economic position. Even a few years ago most girls took a full-time job after they left school. However, when they married, they usually left work at once and never returned to it. Today the school- leaving age is sixteen; many girls stay at school after that age, and though women usually marry older, more married women stay at work at least until shortly before their first child is born. Many more afterwards return to full-or-part-time work. Such changes have led to a new relationship in marriage, with the husband accepting a greater share of the duties and satisfactions of family life, and with both husband and wife sharing more equally in providing the money, and running the home, according to the abilities and interests of each of them. Question: When she was over fifty, a late nineteenth-century mother _ .

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Who voted Solti's recording of Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen the greatest recording ever made in 2011? Solti recorded throughout his career for the Decca Record Company. He made more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. During the 1950s and 1960s Decca had an alliance with RCA Victor, and some of Solti's recordings were first issued on the RCA label.Solti was one of the first conductors who came to international fame as a recording artist before being widely known in the concert hall or opera house. Gordon Parry, the Decca engineer who worked with Solti and Culshaw on the Ring recordings, observed, \\"Many people have said 'Oh well, of course John Culshaw made Solti.' This is not true. He gave him the opportunity to show what he could do.\\"Solti's first recordings were as a piano accompanist, playing at sessions in Zurich for the violinist Georg Kulenkampff in 1947. Decca's senior producer, Victor Olof did not much admire Solti as a conductor (nor did Walter Legge, Olof's opposite number at EMI's Columbia Records), but Olof's younger colleague and successor, Culshaw, held Solti in high regard. As Culshaw, and later James Walker, produced his recordings, Solti's career as a recording artist flourished from the mid-1950s. Among the orchestras with whom Solti recorded were the Berlin Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, London Philharmonic, London Symphony and Vienna Philharmonic orchestras. Soloists in his operatic recordings included Birgit Nilsson, Joan Sutherland, Régine Crespin, Plácido Domingo, Gottlob Frick, Carlo Bergonzi, Kiri Te Kanawa and José van Dam. In concerto recordings, Solti conducted for, among others, András Schiff, Julius Katchen, Clifford Curzon, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Kyung-wha Chung.Solti's most celebrated recording was Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen made in Vienna, produced by Culshaw, between 1958 and 1965. It has twice been voted the greatest recording ever made, the first poll being among readers of Gramophone magazine in 1999, and the second of professional music critics in 2011, for the BBC's Music Magazine.

Use the following format: Part # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. A ploynomial equation is a sum of terms. Here each term is either a constant number, or consists of the variable x raised to a certain power and multiplied by a number. These numbers are called weights. For example, in the polynomial: 2x^2+3x+4, the weights are: 2,3,4. You can present a polynomial with the list of its weights, for example, equation weights = [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4 and equation weights = [1, 3, 4] represent the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4.

Equation weights are given as a list. x = 6, equation weights = [6, 8, 4] Output:","completion":"Part #1: Identify the polynomial equation from the given weights. Usage: equation weights = [6, 8, 4] would represent the equation 6x^2 + 8x + 4. The weights list shows the different coefficients of each term, in descending order of powers of x. This means 6 is the weight of x^2, 8 is the weight of x, and 4 is the constant term. Part #2: Substituting the given value of x in the polynomial equation. Usage: x = 6, equation weights = [6, 8, 4] represents the equation 6x^2 + 8x + 4. Substitute the value x = 6 into the equation to get 6*(6^2) + 8*(6) + 4. Part #3: Compute the result of the polynomial expression Usage: For the equation 6x^2 + 8x + 4 and x = 6; 6*(6^2) + 8*(6) + 4 = 6*(36) + 48 + 4 = 216 + 48 + 4 = 268.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: He was born James Lablache Stewart in Old Brompton Road, Kensington, West London, the only son of Major James Stewart, OBE and his wife Frederica Eliza (nee Lablache). Granger was educated at Epsom College and the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art. He was the great-great-grandson of the opera singer Luigi Lablache and the grandson of the actor Luigi Lablache. When he became an actor, he was advised to change his name in order to avoid being confused with the American actor James Stewart. Granger's first starring film role was as the acid-tongued Rokeby in the Gainsborough Pictures period melodrama, The Man in Grey (1943), a film that helped to make him and his three co-stars - James Mason, Phyllis Calvert and Margaret Lockwood - into box office names in Britain. Granger followed it with The Lamp Still Burns (1943) playing the love interest of nurse Rosamund John. More popular was another for Gainsborough Pictures, Fanny by Gaslight (1944), which reunited him with Calvert and Mason, and added Jean Kent. The New York Times reported that Granger \\"is a young man worth watching. The customers... like his dark looks and his dash; he puts them in mind, they say of Cary Grant.\\" It was the second most popular film at the British box office in 1944.

This film was popular too, and it is one of Granger's favourites. Madonna of the Seven Moons (1945), with Calvert and Roc, was more Gainsborough melodrama, another hit. Also popular was Caesar and Cleopatra, supporting Claude Rains and Vivien Leigh; this film lost money because of its high production cost but was widely seen, and was the first of Granger's films to be a hit in the USA. At the end of 1945 British exhibitors voted Granger the second-most popular British film star, and the ninth-most popular overall. The Times reported that \\"this six-foot black-visaged ex-soldier from the Black Watch is England's Number One pin up boy.

Question: WHAT FILM IS SHOWING AT THE DRIVE-IN WHEN THE F4 TORNADO HITS? Movie title: Twister Movie plot: In June 1969, 5-year-old Jo Thornton (Alexa Vega), her parents, and the family dog Toby seek shelter in their family storm cellar as a powerful F5 tornado hits their farm in Oklahoma. This tornado is so strong that the storm cellar door is ripped off, causing Jo's father (Richard Lineback) to be pulled into the storm to his death. Jo, her mother (Rusty Schwimmer), and Toby survive. 27 years later in 1996, 32-year-old Jo (Helen Hunt), now a meteorologist, is reunited with her estranged husband, Bill \\"The Extreme\\" Harding (Bill Paxton), a former weather researcher and storm chaser, who has since become a weather reporter. He is planning to marry reproductive therapist Melissa Reeves (Jami Gertz). They need Jo's signature on the divorce papers and have tracked her down during an active bout of stormy weather. Jo has built four identical tornado research devices called DOROTHY, based on Bill's designs. The device is designed to release hundreds of sensors into the center of a tornado to study its structure from the inside, with the purpose of creating a more advanced storm warning system. Bill and Melissa join Jo and her team of storm chasers, and the team encounters Dr. Jonas Miller (Cary Elwes), a smug, corporate-funded meteorologist and storm chaser. When Bill discovers that Jonas has created a device based on DOROTHY, called DOT-3, he vows to help Jo deploy DOROTHY before Miller can claim credit for the idea. During the first tornado, Jo's truck and DOROTHY I are both destroyed (the truck is picked up and lands upside-down). They continue storm chasing in Bill's truck, with Melissa in the back seat. They find a second tornado, a confirmed F2, and head off on a back road when the twister shifts its track. They soon find themselves driving through heavy rain, and instead collide with a cluster of two violent waterspouts, one of which splits, spinning them around on the highway until the waterspouts dissipate.

It is a battery eater even it is off. Every few days batteries have to be replaced even it hasn't been used if I don't take the batteries outta it. So far my battery cost more than this camera. The answer is:","completion":"The given review would decrease the chances of buying the product for several reasons. First and foremost, the reviewer mentions that the product in question consumes batteries rapidly, even when it is turned off. This is a significant concern for potential buyers, as excessive battery consumption can lead to increased costs in the long run, as the reviewer states that the cost of batteries has exceeded the cost of the camera itself. This indicates that the product may not be energy-efficient and could potentially lead to more frequent battery replacements than expected, which can be both inconvenient and less cost-effective for the user. Secondly, the reviewer suggests that the product's design or the specific unit they purchased might have a problem with the circuitry. This remark brings up concerns about the product's overall quality and reliability, as well as the potential for manufacturing defects that could affect the product's performance and longevity. A potential buyer might be hesitant to buy the product, given that there may be issues with its internal components, leading to possible malfunctions or even a shorter lifespan than expected. Lastly, while the reviewer's experience may or may not be representative of the product as a whole, such negative reviews can still create a sense of doubt and uncertainty in the minds of potential buyers. If numerous other reviews echo similar sentiments, this particular review could further deter buyers from purchasing the product, as they may perceive it as a less reliable, lower quality option when compared to other products available in the same category. In conclusion, the given review would decrease the chances of buying the product due to concerns regarding excessive battery consumption, potential problems with the product's design or manufacturing, and doubts about the product's overall quality and reliability. It is essential for potential buyers to thoroughly review both positive and negative reviews to gain a comprehensive understanding of the product and its performance before making an informed decision on whether or not to buy it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After recording the A Fire Inside EP (1998), Stopholese left the band and was replaced by Jade Puget, former member of Influence 13 and vocalist Havok's close friend. The band then recorded Black Sails in the Sunset (1999), a musical turning point which introduced AFI fans to a much darker sound, mixing the band's original hardcore roots with dark romantic influences (a poem by Charles Baudelaire, \\"De profundis clamavi,\\" is present in the hidden track \\"Midnight Sun\\") and an emphasis on a more somber atmosphere and lyrics. The New York Times later referred to this as the point where Havok \\"developed into a singer and songwriter of substance\\". The influence of the deathrock and goth rock scenes was also apparent. During this period, AFI's style was considered the band's gothic punk rock style. Offspring frontman Dexter Holland was featured as a backing vocalist on two tracks: \\"Clove Smoke Catharsis\\" and \\"The Prayer Position\\". The All Hallow's E.P. (October 5, 1999) further explored the horror punk genre, featuring artwork and lyrics containing Halloween themes. The EP spawned the single \\"Totalimmortal\\", a track later covered by The Offspring for the Me, Myself and Irene soundtrack. It received a fair amount of radio play and exposed AFI to larger audiences. \\"The Boy Who Destroyed the World\\" from the All Hallows EP was featured in the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 video game. All Hallow's also featured a cover of the Misfits song \\"Halloween\\". On September 19, 2000, AFI released The Art of Drowning, which debuted on the Billboard Charts at number 174, and peaked at number 9 on the Heatseekers chart. It continued to touch base with the horror punk genre, but expanded into styles that were a departure from previous works. The album featured slower, more melodic songs that were more reminiscent of alternative rock, such as \\"Ever and a Day\\" and \\"6 to 8\\". Still, the presence of hardcore influences was imminent in most of the album, flaunted most on tracks like \\"Smile\\", \\"The Lost Souls\\", and \\"Catch a Hot One\\". The album brought the band unprecedented success in the underground scene, selling in excess of 100,000 copies. \\"The Days of the Phoenix\\" was released as a single and video and, like \\"Totalimmortal,\\" had some moderate mainstream success, garnering the band more TV and radio airplay. The song even managed to reach the UK Singles Chart with its titular EP in 2001, peaking at number 152.

When thirty-two-year-old tennis player Andre Agassi made to the final of the U.S. Clay Court Championship in April 2003, he set a new world record: he became the oldest player ever to be number one in the world's tennis rankings.

His first attempt to win this tournament had been in 1987, but he lost his opening game. He then refused to take part in Wimbledon for the next three years. He said his reason for not playing was that the officials refused to allow him to wear his colorful shirts, but some people said it was because he was afraid to lose. After several more championship victories, Agassi's luck began to run out. By 1997, the year of his marriage to a movie actress--- Brooke Shields, Agassi's ranking had dropped to 141stin the world. Many people thought his career was over. Agassi and Shields divorced two years later, and Agassi made a comeback with a new trainer, a new hairstyle, and new determination. In 1999, he won both the French Open and the U.S. Open and ended the year back as the world's number one. By 2003, he had earned more than 27 million in prize money, making him one of the most successful tennis players of all times. Which statement is right about Agassi? A) He was always lucky to win the championship. B) He was the youngest player ever to be number one in the world's tennis rankings. C) He took part in Wimbledon in 1987. D) His wife is a dancer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What is not prominent? Context: Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the exception of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration. The answer is:","completion":"The prominent feature that is not present in most birds, particularly in Neoaves, is a penis.

In that very moment, while staring at his reflection he found in his eyes that mad look he had last seen thirty years ago in a photograph taken at a tethered flying model competition. The photo was taken by Henryk the servant, when his little charge decided he wanted a red biplane model Curtiss Consolidated Skyhawk Cruisader 3A \\"Bingo Star\\". This new look was also noticed by his co-workers, who for the most part, considered him to be an infantile spoiled brat. It fit with their idea of a boss. And Benedykt was indeed the boss, even though he himself couldn't quite believe it. He was the head of a foundation for the self-promotion of the Ossolinsky family, well-known descendants of Polish-American aristocrats, engaged in business ventures there, and charity work here. The position was highly honorable and very prestigious. Just as the employees didn't like Benedykt, in equal measure Benedykt didn't like his job. He considered it extremely stressful and felt it forced him to super-human sacrifices. Everything was arranged by the family as a penance for avoiding work. He had to go to the office at least three times a week for two full hours and entertain various smiling journalists, drink coffee with them and listen. He had to sign letters and open gifts from various companies hoping to win favors. And he had to play golf and attend social functions, movie premiers, shows and art exhibits. The family had only planned for three months of vacation time a year. Scandal! As a sign of protest he took to coming to the office wearing a t-shirt with the slogan \\"Attention, Baby!\\" on it. Is Benedykt popular among his employees? A. Yes, they like him because he can play golf B. No, they hate him C. not enough information D. Yes, they love him because he's a good leader Answer:","completion":"B. No, they hate him"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The two main tertiary institutions are the Australian National University (ANU) in Acton and the University of Canberra (UC) in Bruce, with over 10,500 and 8,000 full-time-equivalent students respectively. Established in 1946, the ANU has always had a strong research focus and is ranked among the leading universities in the world and the best in Australia by The Times Higher Education Supplement and the Shanghai Jiao Tong World University Rankings. There are two religious university campuses in Canberra: Signadou in the northern suburb of Watson is a campus of the Australian Catholic University; St Mark's Theological College in Barton is part of the secular Charles Sturt University.The Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) and the Royal Military College, Duntroon are located in the inner-northern suburb of Campbell. ADFA teaches military undergraduates and postgraduates and includes UNSW@ADFA, a campus of the University of New South Wales; Duntroon provides Australian Army officer training. Tertiary level vocational education is also available through the multi-campus Canberra Institute of Technology.In 2016 there were 132 schools in Canberra; 87 were operated by the government and 45 were private. During 2006, the ACT Government announced closures of up to 39 schools, to take effect from the end of the school year, and after a series of consultations unveiled its Towards 2020: Renewing Our Schools policy. As a result, some schools closed during the 2006–08 period, while others were merged; the creation of combined primary and secondary government schools will proceed over the next decade. The new policy has provoked significant opposition. Most suburbs are planned to include a primary and a nearby preschool; these are usually located near open areas where recreational and sporting activities are easily available. Canberra also has the highest percentage of non-government (private) school students in Australia, accounting for 40.6 per cent of ACT enrollments. The answer is:","completion":"Signadou and St Mark's Theological College."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: What is an idiom? An idiom is a group of words which, when used together, has a different meaning from the one which the individual words have. For example, \\"---How do you know that Sid and Nancy have separated ?\\" \\"---I heard it on the grapevine \\". Of course, the second speaker does not mean he heard the news about John by putting his ear to a grapevine! He is conveying the idea visually of information spreading around a widespread network, similar to a grapevine. We use idioms to express something that other words do not express as clearly or as cleverly. We often use an image or symbol to describe something as clearly as possible and thus make our point as effectively as possible. For example, \\"in a nutshell\\" suggests the idea of having all the information contained within very few words. Idioms tend to be informal and are best used in spoken rather than written English. One of the best ways to learn an idiom is by looking at the context in which it is used. This can be done by concentrating on the rest of the sentence and try to guess the meaning. Many idioms are not that difficult to understand when considered in their context. For example: We are going to have a surprise party for Tom tomorrow. It's a secret so please don't let the cat out of the bag. 'Let the cat out of the bag' is an idiom. Imagine you don't know what this idiom means; by looking at the words preceding, it should be easy to guess that the speaker does not want you to tell Tom about the surprise party. Therefore, 'let the cat out of the bag' must mean something like' reveal a secret' or 'tell a secret'. Answer:","completion":"What is an idiom? a) A group of words with a different meaning when used together than the individual words b) A single word that functions as a metaphor c) An informal way of speaking in the English language d) A secret code used among friends"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"what language do they speak in thai?\\" The answer to this question is:","completion":"The primary language spoken in Thailand is Thai, also known as Siamese or Phasa Thai. Thai is the official language and is the native language of the majority of the population. It belongs to the Tai-Kadai language family and is a member of the Chiang Saeng branch of the Southwestern group of Tai languages. Thai is a tonal language with five distinct tones, which are used to convey different meanings for the same word. The Thai script, which is derived from the ancient Khmer script, consists of 44 consonants, 15 vowel symbols, and four tone marks, making it an abugida system. There are four main dialects of Thai, which are as follows: 1. Central Thai: This is the standard Thai dialect and is spoken by the majority of the population. It is used in official settings, education, and media, and is based on the speech of the educated classes in Bangkok, the capital city. 2. Northern Thai (Lanna): Spoken primarily in the northern region of Thailand, Northern Thai has its own script, which is a derivative of the ancient Mon script. The dialect has some similarities to the standard Thai language but also displays influences from the local languages of the region. 3. Northeastern Thai (Isan): Spoken by the inhabitants of the Isan region, this dialect is closely related to the Lao language spoken in Laos. Isan has its own script, which is a combination of the Thai and Lao scripts. While Isan speakers can understand standard Thai, there are distinct differences in grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. 4. Southern Thai (Pak Tai): Spoken in the southern provinces of Thailand, Southern Thai is characterized by its distinctive vocabulary, which has absorbed influences from the Malay and Mon languages. Southern Thai has its own unique pronunciation and stress patterns. In addition to the Thai language, there are several other minority languages spoken in Thailand. Many ethnic groups, such as the Chines, Malays, and various hill tribes, maintain their distinct languages and dialects. Some of these languages include Chinese (particularly the Teochew and Hakka dialects), Malay, Khmer, Hmong, Karen, Lisu, and Lahu. English is also widely spoken among educated Thais, particularly in urban areas, and it is taught as a second language in schools. English is commonly used in the tourism industry, and many Thais who work in the tourism sector have a good grasp of the language. In summary, the primary language spoken in Thailand is Thai, with several dialects and minority languages coexisting alongside the official language. English is frequently spoken as a second language, especially in larger cities and tourist destinations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: Sarah Pierce (Kate Winslet) is a hapless, stay-at-home mother in a small suburban Boston community. She had been working on a doctorate in English, but set aside her work to marry Richard (Gregg Edelman) and raise their 3-year-old daughter, Lucy (Sadie Goldstein). Her marriage falls apart when she discovers that Richard is addicted to online pornography. She meets Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson), a law student who brings his 4-year-old son, Aaron (Ty Simpkins), to the park. Although Brad's marriage to Katherine (Jennifer Connelly) is loving and amicable, it has been lacking intimacy.When he is supposed to be studying for the bar exam, Brad instead plays on a local football team or sits and watches teenagers skateboard outside his house, fantasizing about being young and carefree again. Brad and Sarah become friendly and, on a dare, kiss in the park, scandalizing the other park parents. They are instantly attracted to each other, but resolve to keep their relationship platonic. One day, several parents panic when they see Ronald \\"Ronnie\\" McGorvey (Jackie Earle Haley), a sex offender who was recently released from prison, swimming in the pool with the children. After Ronnie is escorted away by two police officers, it begins to rain.Sarah and Brad take Lucy and Aaron back to her house and put the kids to bed. Brad looks at one of Sarah's books and finds a photo of him in it. While Sarah is drying towels in her basement, Brad kisses her and they have sex. Brad's friend Larry (Noah Emmerich) is a former police officer who was forced to retire when he accidentally shot a teenager at a local shopping mall. Now he is estranged from his wife and spends much of his time harassing Ronnie. Ronnie lives with his mother, May (Phyllis Somerville), who believes that meeting a woman his own age would cure him of his pedophilia. Ronnie knows this is futile, but agrees to on a date May has arranged for him with a woman named Sheila (Jane Adams).During dinner, Ronnie tells Sheila about his criminal record, and Sheila in return tells him that she has had a series of nervous breakdowns. They seem to get on well, but the date ends badly when he has her drive by an elementary school playground so he can masturbate next to her in the car. When Brad skips taking the bar exam again, Kathy grows suspicious and tells Brad to invite Sarah, Richard, and Lucy over for dinner. The intimacy evident between Brad and Sarah confirms her suspicions, and Kathy arranges for her mother to come for an extended visit so Brad and Sarah can't see one another anymore. When Brad's football team plays its final game, Sarah attends and cheers as Brad scores the winning touchdown.Afterwards, while Larry waits for Brad at a nearby bar to celebrate their victory, Brad and Sarah make out on the field. He admits that this is the happiest moment of his life, and convinces Sarah to run away with him. Larry goes to Ronnie's house and wakes the neighborhood up by using a bullhorn to taunt him. May comes out to confront him and has a heart attack. Larry is arrested and May taken to the hospital. While Ronnie sleeps in the waiting room, May dies. When Ronnie goes home, he finds an envelope containing a letter written by his mother saying: \\"Please be a good boy.\\" Distraught, Ronnie destroys much of his mother's collection of Hummel figurines, then takes a butcher knife from the kitchen.That same night, Sarah and Brad agree to rendezvous through the park to run away together. Brad tells Aaron he loves him before putting him to bed, writes Kathy a note explaining why he is leaving her, then sneaks out while she and her mother finish the dishes. Before he can get to the park, he is distracted by skateboarding teenagers, who convince him to try a jump himself. Brad does so, but falls and knocks himself out. When he regains consciousness, he asks the paramedics to call his wife and to meet him at the hospital. It turns out that he never left the note for her and tells one of the skateboarders to dispose of it for him.When Sarah takes Lucy to the park, she sees Ronnie stagger by, and briefly feels afraid. When she sees him crying about his mother's death, however, she feels sorry for him. When Lucy disappears, Sarah panics and rushes to find her, forgetting about Brad. After Sarah finds Lucy and puts her in the car, Sarah starts crying, realizing her getaway with Brad is just a fantasy. Larry is upset about having indirectly caused May's death. He genuinely wants to apologize to Ronnie, but when he finds Ronnie in the park, he discovers that he has castrated himself and is bleeding to death. Larry races him to the hospital, and they arrive just as Kathy meets Brad at the emergency room doors. Output:","completion":"Question: Who plays the role of Sarah Pierce?

Pretending to be on his deathbed, Fox invites three former lovers to his Venetian palazzo for a final visit: penniless Princess Dominique (Capucine), fading movie star Merle McGill (Edie Adams), and Texas millionairess Mrs. Lone Star Crockett Sheridan (Susan Hayward). Accompanying Mrs. Sheridan is her spinster nurse, Sarah Watkins (Maggie Smith). By chance, each of the women brings Fox a timepiece as a present. The three women warily size each other up. Mrs. Sheridan boldly announces that the others might as well go home, as she is Fox's common-law wife, and they can expect to inherit nothing. However, when Sarah returns from a late-night date with McFly, she finds her employer dead of an overdose of sleeping pills, an apparent suicide. Police Inspector Rizzi (Adolfo Celi) investigates. Sarah knows that the pills Mrs. Sheridan had been taking are harmless fakes. McFly has already revealed to Sarah that Fox is perpetrating a charade, and that the final joke is to be the reading of the will, empowering McFly to choose the heir. She therefore suspects him not only of being the murderer, but also plotting to kill Fox. When she confronts McFly, he locks her in her room, telling her it is for her own safety. She manages to escape via a dumbwaiter and warns Fox. However, his displeased reaction puzzles her. He sends her back to her room. The next morning, Fox is found dead. McFly reveals that Fox was the killer of Sarah's employer. He was broke and wanted Mrs. Sheridan's fortune. Once McFly had figured it out (and more importantly, told Sarah), Fox realized it was all up and committed suicide. Sarah asks McFly to write her name down in the will as the heir of Fox's worthless estate as a souvenir, with Rizzi signing as a witness.

Their beneficial properties have been applied to mask unpleasant odors, attract the attention of other people, add flavor and aroma properties to prepared dishes, perfumes, and cosmetics, etc. Herbs and essential oils (EOs) have also been used in medicine because of their biological properties, such as larvicidal action, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties, antioxidant, fungicide, and antitumor activities, and many more. Many EOs exhibit antimicrobial properties, which is extremely important in fields of science and industry, such as medicine, agriculture, or cosmetology. Among the 250 EOs which are commercially available, about a dozen possess high antimicrobial potential.

Roddick thinks about his opponents and their tendencies and tries to counteract them. Tomic, not so much. Roddick has lost six sets at love in his career, including two against Roger Federer and one against Rafael Nadal. Tomic, a former No. 1 junior and one of the game’s top young talents, had already lost three this year. Make that four. Still, Roddick said he had no idea how he would react to a familiar setting (he has played 27 night matches in Ashe, a stadium record) mixed with the unfamiliar circumstances of his looming retirement. Before the match, he caught a glimpse of a television montage of his career—likely set to “an 80s ballad,” he told the crowd afterward—and had to get away. “I had no idea what was going to happen out there honestly, even before the match,” he said. “That was a different kind of nerves than I’ve had before.” And then it was all too easy, this mini-celebration for Roddick and 24,000 supporters. The crowd cheered, Tomic barely resisted and those who dared to leave their seats for an undercooked pizza missed most of the match. Roddick said he took a few moments to look around the stadium. “When they’re doing the dancing and stuff on the switch overs I was just watching,” he said. “That was fun.” Tomic was listless. When told that John McEnroe thought he was “borderline not trying” in the third set, Tomic said, “Well, I think he’s probably right.” But when a reporter persisted with questions about tanking, Tomic asked for the reporter’s name and outlet (Reuters) and then said, “I’ll remember you.” Something Tomic would be better off remembering: He won five points in the third set. Total. Roddick won’t have such an easy time in the third round, but he could very well win the match. (The Journal’s Tennis Tracker likes his odds, anyway.) His opponent will be Fabio Fognini, the Italian known for his flashy strokes and frequent outbursts. After that, Roddick will need vintage performances to survive: He could meet Juan Martin del Potro in the fourth round. If he somehow wins that match, he’d likely face Novak Djokovic, the defending champion, in the quarterfinals. One thing Roddick has going for him, beyond the overwhelming support of fans: He’s not concerned about sore shoulders, achy knees or tired legs. When there’s no tomorrow, there are no consequences to overdoing it. His serve had more life Friday night than it has had in a long time – it was clocked as fast as 139 mph. “I haven’t hit these numbers in two years, what I’ve gotten in the last two matches,” Roddick said. “It didn’t feel very good after my first round, so we’ll see how it pulls up tomorrow. Come watch practice tomorrow. You’ll be equally unimpressed.” Undoubtedly, many people will do just that.","completion":"The news article discusses the ongoing farewell tournament for Andy Roddick at the U.S. Open following his announcement of retiring from professional tennis. Roddick began his series of last performances with a robust win of 6-3, 6-4, 6-0 against Bernard Tomic under the stadium lights of the Arthur Ashe Stadium. Despite the 10-year age difference between Roddick and Tomic, Tomic, had a stark contrast in approach and performance compared to Roddick, which appeared to make the match favorable for Andy Roddick. Roddick's track record suggested a more driven and calculated game plan, while Tomic, despite his youth and past rankings, was showing more losses and less determination, a fact even acknowledged himself. The fact that this was a farewell tournament for Roddick brought a peculiar mix of familiarity and novelty. Roddick noted that the anticipation of the match came with a novel set of nerves. However, once the match started, Roddick and his supporters, found themselves effortlessly swept up in a mini celebration of Roddick’s illustrious career. Tomic’s listless performance made the match a comfortable win for Roddick. Roddick admitted to taking a moment to soak in the stadium ambiance amid the cheering crowd, which he found to be a fun experience. Meanwhile, despite Tomic’s less than stellar performance, he became defensive when a reporter from Reuters questioned his commitment during the match. Looking forward, Roddick's next opponent would be Fabio Fognini, known for his flashy playing style and frequent emotional outbursts. Despite the celebration of Roddick’s career, he acknowledged that the successful transmission to the next rounds will require him to perform at his peak. Potential obstacles include Juan Martin del Potro in the fourth round and possibly Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals. However, Roddick seemed undeterred by physical challenges like aching limbs or exhaustion. He seemed determined to give his all in the tournament, given that he saw no consequences to overexerting himself, which was evident in his lively and high-speed serves. Regardless of the outcome, it was clear that his adoring fans would continue to support and cheer for him throughout his farewell tournament."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Nuclear radiation has a certain mystery, partly because it cannot be detected by human senses. It can't be seen or heard, or touched or tasted, even though it may be all around us. There are other things like that. For example, radio waves are all around but we can't detect them or sense them without a radio receiver. Similarly, we can't sense radioactivity without a radiation detector. But unlike common radio waves, nuclear radiation is not harmless to human beings and other living things. At very high levels, radiation can kill an animal or human being outright by killing masses of cells in important organs. Even the lowest levels can do serious damage. There is no level of radiation that is completely safe. If the radiation does not hit anything important, the damage may not be serious. This is the case when only a few cells are hit, and when they are killed outright. Your body will replace the dead cells with healthy ones. But if the few cells are only damaged, and if they reproduce themselves, you may be in trouble. They reproduce themselves in an unusual way. They can grow into cancer. Sometimes this does not show up for many years. This is another reason for some of the mystery about nuclear radiation. Serious damage can be done without the knowledge of the person at the time that damage has occurred. A person can be irradiated and feel fine, then die of cancer five, ten, or twenty years later as a result. A child can be born weak or easy to get serious illness as a result of radiation absorbed by its grandparents. Question: Radiation can hurt us so much that it can _ .

Coming off their win over the Bears, the Broncos returned home for an AFC duel with the New England Patriots on NBC's Sunday Night Football, on a snowy night in Denver. The Patriots, who entered the game with a 10-0 record, jumped out to a 14-0 lead, with quarterback Tom Brady tossing two touchdown passes &#8212; a 23-yarder to tight end Rob Gronkowski, followed in the second quarter by a 10-yarder to tight end Scott Chandler. The latter score occurred after Broncos' quarterback Brock Osweiler had a pass deflected and intercepted deep in Broncos' territory. The Broncos got on the scoreboard just before the two-minute warning, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 19-yard touchdown. The Broncos had a chance to cut into the Patriots' lead on their first possession of the second half, however, placekicker Brandon McManus missed wide-right on a 47-yard field goal attempt. Each team proceeded to trade punts on their next two offensive possessions, until Brady connected with wide receiver Brandon Bolden on a 63-yard touchdown pass at the beginning of the fourth quarter to give the Patriots a 21-7 lead. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out, and were forced to punt. However, Patriots' return specialist Chris Harper muffed the punt, which was recovered by Shaquil Barrett at the Patriots' 36-yard line, giving the Broncos new life. Four plays later, the Broncos pulled to within a one-touchdown deficit, with a 15-yard touchdown run by running back C. J. Anderson. The Broncos' defense forced a punt on the Patriots' next possession, which was aided by an offensive holding penalty on guard Tre' Jackson that nullified a 51-yard pass completion from Brady to wide receiver Keshawn Martin on a third-and-long play. The Broncos then marched down the field, but had to settle for a 21-yard field goal by McManus to pull to within 21-17 with 6:12 remaining in the fourth quarter. The two teams traded punts on their next possessions, and with 2:39 remaining and no timeouts, the Broncos forced a Patriots' punt. The Broncos marched down the field and were facing a 2nd-and-goal from the Patriots' 7-yard line, when Osweiler was sacked for an eight-yard loss. However, the sack was nullified by a defensive holding penalty on Patriots' safety Patrick Chung. On the very next play, the Broncos grabbed their first lead of the game, when Osweiler connected with wide receiver Andre Caldwell on a 4-yard touchdown with 1:15 remaining in the fourth quarter. The Patriots were not done yet, as Brady engineered a 5-play, 51-yard drive, which culminated with placekicker Stephen Gostkowski kicking a game-tying 47-yard field goal as time expired, sending the game to overtime. The Patriots won the overtime coin toss, but their offense went three-and-out. Following a Patriots' punt, the Broncos started their first overtime drive at their own 43-yard line, and three plays later, Anderson scampered down the sideline for a game-winning 48-yard touchdown run.

While President Barack Obama has made promoting rights for gays and lesbians worldwide a key foreign policy goal, that is little comfort to Ali Asseri, a former Saudi diplomat who is gay. Asseri is fighting a years-long battle for asylum in the United States, convinced his life will be in danger if he is forced to return home. The case presents a dilemma for the Obama administration as the President travels to Saudi Arabia to meet with King Abdullah amid a time of strained relations between the close allies. Saudi Arabia's radical form of Islam mandates the death penalty for same-sex relations. \\"I come from the darkest place on earth,\\" Asseri said in a phone interview from his home in West Hollywood. \\"We are brainwashed that we have the best system and sharia law comes from god. But they teach us to hate others. I came to America to clear my mind.\\" Asseri grew up in a middle class conservative Saudi family, the middle child with three brothers and three sisters. His parents had little education and raised him and his brothers and sisters true to Saudi culture and religion. There was no music or TV. He didn't know for years that he was gay. By age 13, he realized he was different than other boys his age, he just had no idea what that difference was. \\"We don't have any education about sex. You don't know what gay means. You just know that you have feelings. You can't talk about it with anyone. According to the Koran they are a sin. I thought it would just go away. I just had feelings but you can't talk about it with any person.\\" As a law student, he considered a career as an attorney and took a job as a clerk for a judge in the Saudi court. After a few months, he quit. In a petition seeking asylum to the United States obtained by CNN, he wrote that \\"unfair bias\\" in the treatment of cases in Saudi Arabia made it \\"morally impossible for me to continue.\\" \\"I was frequently upset and saddened by the system in general and the punishments given to the accused,\\" he wrote. Investigates sexuality. For another year he worked as a trainee in the Bureau of Investigation and Prosecution, where he would check on the prisoners to see whether they were receiving proper treatment. He was forced by his managers to witness prisoners being lashed, which gave him bad dreams. He quit his job once again, frustrated with the harsh punishments and his inability to do anything to stop them. At that time he started to investigate his faith, religion and sexuality. \\"Without these jobs I wouldn't be the same person now,\\" he said. \\"I began to understand something isn't right about the way we practice religion. Something didn't feel good. I said to myself the only way you can have freedom is to be a diplomat and travel out of the country.\\" He joined the Foreign Ministry as a diplomat and got married to a Saudi woman, all the time hiding his feelings and dreaming of the day he could leave the country and live his life as an openly gay man. When his wife gave birth to his son, Fahad, Asseri tried one last time to give his arrangement a chance. But he found he could not keep up the charade and they divorced in 2004. Asseri was transferred to the Saudi consulate in Los Angeles the next year. A double life. Here, he writes in his asylum petition, \\"I discovered the gay community, the gay culture and that I was in fact gay.\\" For four years he led a double life. By day, he was a traditional diplomat. By night, he visited gay bars and told friends he was from Italy or any other country than his own. Asseri's two worlds collided in 2009 when he fell in love and moved into a West Hollywood apartment with his boyfriend. Finding happiness for the first time, he enjoyed an open social life in West Hollywood with his new friends. Soon his colleagues began to ask him about his life outside of work and started following him. When his passport expired and he submitted it for renewal, he received no reply. After several months, his office told him his time in the United States was up and he would have to return to Saudi Arabia. He began to fear he was found out. He called a friend in the foreign ministry in Riyadh, who told him indeed the Consul General sent a letter to the ministry stating he was gay and had information about his lifestyle. \\"This is when I became really scared and paranoid,\\" he writes in his asylum petition. \\"I was so scared they would do something to me physically. I was even afraid to go to my car thinking there could be a bomb in it. When I came home I had to check every closet.\\" He sent a letter to various news organizations saying he was being harassed by colleagues and he feared for his life. Fearing persecution. He applied for asylum as a gay person who would face persecution if sent home. In more than eight hours of questioning, immigration officers focused on his jobs in the Saudi courts and Bureau of investigation. His bid for asylum was no common occurrence. The last Saudi diplomat to seek asylum was in 1994, when Mohammed al-Khilewi, then first secretary for the Saudi mission to the United Nations, was granted asylum for publicly criticizing his country's human rights record and alleged support for terrorism. Fourteen months later in October 2011, the Department of Homeland Security denied Asseri's application. In the rejection letter, obtained by CNN, the government says \\"evidence indicates that you ordered, incited, assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution of others on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.\\" The case went to automatic appeal. \\"They interviewed him once and it took 14 months and it showed they were going for denial,\\" says Ali Ahmed, a Saudi dissident and activist that has been helping Asseri with his case. \\"They used the reason that he worked for the courts to call him a human rights violator which is really bogus.\\" Obama on gay rights. Two months later, Obama signed a Memorandum on International Initiatives to Advance the Human Rights of LGBT Persons. It included a program to protect gay refugees and asylum seekers, including \\"ensuring the federal government has the ability to identify and expedite resettlement of highly vulnerable persons with urgent protection needs.\\" In the memo, Obama writes that the fight to end discrimination against LGBT people is \\"a global challenge\\" and \\"central to the United States' commitment to promoting human rights.\\" \\"I am deeply concerned by the violence and discrimination targeting LGBT persons around the world â€” whether it is passing laws that criminalize LGBT status, beating citizens simply for joining peaceful LGBT pride celebrations, or killing men, women, and children for their perceived sexual orientation,\\" Obama said. In its most recent human rights report, the State Department said under sharia law in the Saudi Arabia, \\"consensual same-sex conduct is punishable by death or flogging.\\" Ongoing case. It wasn't until this past February that Asseri was finally granted a hearing date for his appeal. At the court, the immigration officer offered him a deal to remain in the country permanently without possibility of asylum or a green card. Additionally, he could never leave the country. When he rejected the offer, the immigration officer applied for another continuance, saying she needed to submit more documents in the two-year case. He is now looking at a new hearing date in 2015. Today, Asseri barely makes ends meet as a part-time security guard. He lives on couches at friends' apartments in West Hollywood. His family has shunned him and his ex-wife won't allow him to talk to his son. As unbearable as his life in limbo is, he says returning to Saudi Arabia would be a death sentence. \\"There is no question,\\" he says. \\"If you go back and say I am gay and proud and I don't believe in religion anymore. Under sharia law this is death. You will be happy if they kill you right away. \\" Ahmed, the Saudi activist, says Asseri is a victim of U.S. desires not to upset the Saudi monarchy. Asseri had been convinced that Obama's stated commitment to gay rights would trump politics and keep him safe in the United States. \\"When President Obama ran in 2008 I supported him. I cried for him, I encouraged my American friends to vote for him. Now I can't stand to watch him on TV,\\" he says. \\"I'm angry. He said he supports the rights of gay people, so why is this happening to me?\\" The Saudi embassy in Washington and consulate in Los Angeles did not return phone calls.

Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Joan Crawford (Faye Dunaway) is a driven actress and compulsively clean housekeeper who tries to control the lives of those around her as tightly as she controls herself. To prepare for a work day at MGM Studios, she rises at 4:00 a.m. and engages in a strict morning ritual: scrubbing her face and arms with soap and boiling hot water, then plunging her face into a bowl of rubbing alcohol and ice to close the pores. When Helga (Alice Nunn), a new maid, thinks she has Joan's living room in spotless condition, Joan finds one minor detail that she overlooked and loses her temper. Joan is in a relationship with Hollywood lawyer Gregg Savitt (Steve Forrest), but her career is in a bit of a downswing. Despite desperately wanting a baby, she is unable to get pregnant: seven pregnancies when she was married to actor Franchot Tone have all ended in miscarriages. When she is denied an application for adoption, she enlists Gregg's help to secure a baby. Joan adopts a girl whom she names Christina (Mara Hobel), and later a boy, Christopher (Jeremy Scott Reinholt). Joan sometimes lavishes Christina with attention and luxuries such as an extravagant birthday party, but also enforces a very stern code of denial and discipline. When Christina is showered with gifts, Joan allows her to choose only one she likes best that she can keep, then donates the rest to charity. As Christina rebels against her mother, confrontations ensue. Joan overtakes Christina in a swimming-pool race and laughs at the child. Joan becomes enraged when Christina reacts with anger and locks her in the pool house. Later, Joan discovers Christina wearing her makeup and imitating her. Even though Christina openly denies it and despite her protests, Joan - thinking that Christina is making fun of her, always rummaging through her drawers, trying to find a way to make people look at her, and always looking at herself in the mirror - hysterically cuts off chunks of Christina's hair to humiliate her. Joan resents Gregg's allegiance to studio boss Louis B....

Article: He's out there somewhere, an instant icon in the records of American conflict, the final big-game hunter. But a puzzle, too, his identity would be kept a secret for now, and maybe forever. He is the unknown shooter. The nameless, faceless triggerman who put a bullet in the head of the world's most notorious terrorist, Bin Laden. He's likely between the ages of 26 and 33, says Marcinko, founder of the \\"SEALs Team 6\\" that many believe led the attack on Bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan. He'll be old enough to have had time to hurdle the extra training tests required to join the counter-terrorism unit, yet young enough to stand the body-punishing harshness of the job. The shooter's a man, it's safe to say, because there are no women in the SEALs. And there's a good chance he's white, though the SEALs have stepped up efforts to increase the number of minorities in their ranks, Marcinko and Smith say. He was probably a high school or college athlete, Smith says, a physical specimen who combines strength, speed and wisdom. \\"They call themselves 'tactical athletes,'\\" says Smith, who works with many future SEALs in his Heroes of Tomorrow training program in Severna Park. \\"It's getting very scientific.\\" Marcinko puts it in more conventional terms: \\"He'll be ripped,\\" says the author of the best-selling autobiography \\"Rogue Warrior.\\"\\"He's got a lot of upper-body strength. Long arms. Thin waist. Flat stomach.\\" On this point, Greitens departs a bit. \\"You can't make a lot of physical assumptions,\\" says the author of \\"The Heart and the Fist: The Education of a Humanitarian, the Making of a Navy SEAL.\\" There are SEALs who are 5 feet 4 and SEALs who are 6 feet 5, Greitens says. In his training group, he adds, there were college football boys who couldn't hack it; those who survived were most often men in good shape, but they also had a willingness to show their concerns in favor of the mission. The shooter's probably not the crew-cut , neatly shaven ideal we've come to expect from American fighting forces. \\"He's bearded,...

Process: - The saliva breaks down the chemicals in the food a bit, which helps make the food mushy and easy to swallow - Your tongue helps out, pushing the food around while you chew with your teeth - The esophagus moves food from the back of your throat to your stomach - Strong muscles in the walls of the stomach and gastric juices break down food in your stomach - Your stomach moves the food into the intestines to complete digestion - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more cake ingredients available happens, how will it affect MORE digestion occuring. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"The process of digestion begins in the mouth and continues through the stomach, intestines, and finally ends with excretion. To understand the effect of more cake ingredients being available on digestion, we need to delve deeper into the digestive process and examine any direct or indirect consequences. 1. Mouth: When you eat cake, the digestion starts in the mouth as you mentioned. Saliva, with the help of the enzyme amylase, begins breaking down complex carbohydrates into simpler sugars. Chewing also breaks the cake into smaller pieces, increasing the surface area for enzymes to work on. 2. Esophagus: Once you swallow the cake, it travels through the esophagus, a muscular tube that moves food from the throat to the stomach. 3. Stomach: In the stomach, the cake is mixed with stomach acid and enzymes, like pepsin, which start breaking down proteins. The stomach's strong muscles mix and churn the food into a semi-liquid substance called chyme. 4. Small Intestine: Chyme moves from the stomach to the small intestine. Here, it is mixed with bile from the liver (which emulsifies fats) and enzymes from the pancreas, such as lipase (for breaking down fats), trypsin, and chymotrypsin (for further protein digestion). Other enzymes from the intestinal walls, like maltase and lactase, help break down carbohydrates. Nutrients from the cake, including glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids, are absorbed through the intestinal walls into the bloodstream. 5. Large Intestine: Finally, undigested food particles enter the large intestine, where water and electrolytes are absorbed, and the remaining waste is converted into feces for excretion. Now, considering the perturbation hypothesis: if more cake ingredients are available and this results in a larger serving size or more frequent consumption of cake, there may be both direct and indirect effects on digestion. Direct effects: - Consuming larger portions or eating cake more frequently might lead to a higher intake of calories, sugar, and fat. This could require the digestive system to work harder and longer to process the food. - Overwhelming the digestive system with too much food at once might cause discomfort, such as bloating or indigestion. Indirect effects: - Consuming excessive amounts of cake could contribute to long-term health consequences, like obesity or diabetes, which can indirectly impact the efficiency of the digestive system and nutrient absorption. - A diet high in sugar and unhealthy fats might also lead to imbalances in gut bacteria, which play a crucial role in digestion and overall health. In conclusion, while the consumption of cake ingredients will not directly alter the digestion process, consuming more cake could place additional strain on the digestive system and indirectly affect one's health. It is important to maintain a balanced diet and moderate portion sizes to ensure optimal digestive function and overall wellbeing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The fire which ripped through part of Eastbourne Pier is now being treated as suspicious, police have said. New information today suggests the blaze on the 144-year-old structure on Wednesday ‘may have been started by someone, either deliberately or accidentally’. It comes after David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne visited the town to announce a £2million cash injection to help with the aftermath of the blaze. Scroll down for video. David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne visited Eastbourne pier today after pledging to support town. The Prime Minister walks alongside the devastated wreckage along with George Osborne and members of the East Sussex Fire and Rescue who managed to save most of the structure. Outside the former entrance to the pier, David Cameron speaks with members of the fire service. Detective Inspector Mark O'Brien, of Sussex Police, said: ‘As a result of our investigation we have received information to suggest that the fire may have been started by someone, either deliberately or accidentally, and our investigation is now focusing on that line of enquiry. ‘A temporary scaffold platform has been erected adjacent to where the fire is thought to have broken out in order to enable scenes of crime officers and fire investigators safe access to the area.’ Police have called on people to submit pictures or video footage taken at the entrance or on the pier in the hours before it started. Superintendent Laurence Taylor said: ‘The area around and under the pier is still very hazardous and there is a security team deployed to stop people putting themselves in danger.’ The Prime Minister met with the crew from the Inshore Lifeboat Station as the wreckage stood behind him. David Cameron shaking hands with members of the fire and rescue service who saved most of the building. The Prime Minister visited the town today with George Osborne as he pledged to support the town. The pair met with members of the East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service and the crew from the Inshore Lifeboat Station. Mr Cameron said: ‘The Government is absolutely committed to supporting coastal towns, and through our long-term economic plan we are creating jobs and boosting tourism. ‘I know that the loss of one of Eastbourne’s most prominent and well-loved landmarks will have hit the town hard and I am determined to do all I can to help local businesses recover.’ The fire happened at the height of Eastbourne’s important summer tourist season. In the next fortnight, the resort hosts its biggest summer tourist event - the annual Airbourne Air Show - which draws tens of thousands of visitors. Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne also announced an extra £3 million for the Government’s Coastal Communities Fund to encourage growth and create jobs in coastal towns. Mr Osborne said: ‘Eastbourne Pier is a much-loved local attraction and this fire is devastating news. I am therefore delighted to be able to provide financial support so we can minimise the effect on business and tourism. People walk along the beach to catch a glimpse of what remains of devastated Eastbourne Pier. The town is now set to receive a £2 million boost after a fire destroyed its Grade II listed pier this week. ‘We will work with Eastbourne as a matter of urgency to ensure that the funding is provided without delay so people can start enjoying the pier again.’ Coastal Communities Minister Penny Mordaunt named 10 coastal towns which will receive £8.5 million from the fund in the latest round of applications. The money will be used to boost tourism, regenerate historic sites and provide new flood defences, Downing Street said. But there is hopes that the fire-hit pier could reopen again as early as next year, as two-thirds of it was untouched by flames, according to Eastbourne MP Stephen Lloyd. The Liberal Democrat MP has said that following talks with East Sussex’s chief fire officer, the structure appeared ‘pretty sound’ and called on the community to rally round the pier’s stricken traders after fears that some had no insurance. Mr Lloyd said: ‘There is real damage but I’m confident that it can be repaired. Crowds gathered on Wednesday as the popular pier went up in flames and plumes of smoke billowed out. It took more than 80 firefighters to dampen down the tangled wreck of Eastbourne Pier after the blaze. Crews were still dousing flames the morning after a large section was destroyed and left a charred shell. ‘It’s still very much standing, and I’m very hopeful and confident that it will be reopening next year and be back in business.’ Helen Brook and Stuart Pearce, who were due to get married on the pier in three weeks’ time, have seen their dream dashed. The couple were to have wed on a section of the Victorian structure which escaped the flames. Ms Brook told ITV Meridian: ‘Once we heard that people were safe and had been evacuated, it then hit home what it meant for us. ‘Since yesterday, it has been a very emotional couple of days. We are just shell-shocked really.’ Holiday makers walk along the promenade with the pier stretching out to sea in the background. Passengers landing on Eastbourne Pier after a boat cruise in 1936. The paddle steamers took passengers to destinations including Folkestone, Sandown, Brighton, Hastings and even as far afield as Boulogne in France. East Sussex has been cursed by the devastation of some of its beloved piers in recent times. In 2003 the 148-year-old West Pier in Brighton was reduced to a mangled mass of metal by two major blazes within two months. In Hastings, the Grade II listed pier was almost destroyed in a fire in 2010 following years of neglect by its then-Panama-registered owner.

A:","completion":"Title: Extremely Disappointing and Frustrating Experience Review: I hardly ever take the time to write reviews, but I felt compelled to share my awful experience with the com.kaneoriley.cyanogenport.launcher3 app. Honestly, I am baffled as to how this app even made it to the market. I had high expectations considering the buzz around it, but it has been an absolute disaster. In my opinion, this app deserves only 1-star for the following reasons: 1. Terrible performance - The app consistently performs poorly. It lags, freezes, and crashes multiple times a day, making it virtually impossible to use. I've tried clearing cache, uninstalling and reinstalling, and even using it on a different device, but the same issues persist. 2. Unresponsive customer support - I reached out to the customer support team several times, hoping they could offer some guidance or solutions. The responses were either robotic or lacking in any helpful information, leaving me to fend for myself. 3. Cluttered and confusing interface - The user interface is so cluttered and confusing that it takes a considerable amount of time to find what I'm looking for. The app does not follow any intuitive design principles, making navigation a headache. 4. Subpar features - Many advertised features either underperform or are completely non-existent. The customization options are limited and the implemented ones do not function well, leaving my phone's home screen looking like a mess. 5. Drains battery life - The app somehow consumes an unreasonable amount of battery life, even when it's not actively in use. This has forced me to constantly recharge my phone throughout the day. In conclusion, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend com.kaneoriley.cyanogenport.launcher3 to anyone. My experience with the app has been a frustrating test of patience, and I have since uninstalled it. Save yourself the trouble, and look elsewhere for a more reliable and functional launcher."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What area in the area that is used for hiking, hunting, and fishing was reopened for fishing in 1959? Answer the above question based on the context below: According to the DCNR, Quehanna Wild Area is for the public \\"to see, use and enjoy for such activities as hiking, hunting, and fishing\\". The main hiking trail on the Quehanna plateau is the Quehanna Trail, a 75-mile (121 km) loop trail that passes through the wild area and Moshannon and Elk State Forests. The main trailhead for most hikers is at Parker Dam State Park to the west of the wild area. From there the trail, which is blazed in orange, heads east to the southern part of Quehanna Wild Area, skirts Piper and the Boot Camp there, then turns north, crosses Wykoff Run and turns west again. After passing through Marion Brooks Natural Area, the trail leaves the wild area and completes the loop back at Parker Dam. The Quehanna Trail is considered a strenuous hike not just because of its length, but for its 9,700 feet (2,957 m) of changes in elevation. Two blue-blazed connector trails add 30 miles (48 km) to the system, and there are many side trails and small trails off the Quehanna Highway. Most trails are open to cross-country skiing in the winter. According to the DCNR, the Quehanna Trail \\"passes through some of the most wild and beautiful country Pennsylvania has to offer\\".Susan Stranahan's Susquehanna: River of Dreams reports that before Curtiss-Wright took over the area in 1955, Quehanna was considered \\"some of the best hunting land in the state\\". No hunting or fishing were initially allowed on the leased land, but by July 1959 fishing on Mosquito Creek was allowed again, as was limited hunting to help control the deer. In October 1963 hunting resumed throughout the wild area, four years before the state purchased the land back from Curtiss-Wright. As of 2010, the Pennsylvania Game Commission allowed hunting of the following species found in Quehanna Wild Area: American crow, beaver, black bear, black squirrel, bobcat, bobwhite quail, cottontail rabbit, coyote, elk, house sparrow, raccoon, red fox, ring-necked pheasant, ruffed grouse, white-tailed deer, wild turkey, and woodcock.

Police were still trying to sort out what led Heriberto Pagan to drive from his home in Brooklyn to his daughter's Staten Island house Friday and shoot two people before taking his own life. A law enforcement source said investigators were looking into the possibility that the grandson \\"was trying to take over\\" the home with his girlfriend and Pagan \\"wasn't appreciative of the way\\" his daughter was being treated in the process. It was not clear whether the daughter was at home at the time. Police found Pagan, a gunshot wound to the head, outside his car Friday evening near the home where the shootings occurred. He was hospitalized in critical condition, but died Saturday morning, police said.

On January 5, 1900, four friends arrive for a dinner at the London home of their inventor friend George, but he is not there. He arrives suddenly, bedraggled and exhausted, and begins describing the strange experiences he has had since they last met. At their earlier dinner on New Year's Eve, George said that time was \\"the fourth dimension\\". He shows David Filby, Dr. Philip Hillyer, Anthony Bridewell, and Walter Kemp a small model time machine and asks one of them to press a tiny lever on the model. The device disappears, validating his claim, but his friends remain unconvinced; their reactions vary from curiosity to frank dismissal. George bids his guests a good evening, then heads downstairs where his full-size time machine awaits. He presses a lever and moves forward through time 17 years into the future to September 15, 1917. He meets Filby's son, James, who tells him of Filby's death in a war. Saddened, he resumes his journey, stopping on June 19, 1940 during The Blitz, finding himself in the midst of \\"a new war\\"; George resumes his journey and his house is hit by a bomb and is destroyed. George stops on August 19, 1966 finding his neighborhood now part of a futuristic metropolis. People hurry into a nearby fallout shelter amid the blare of air raid sirens. An elderly James Filby urges George to immediately take cover. Moments later, a nuclear explosion destroys London, causing a volcanic eruption around him. George narrowly makes it back to his machine and continues his journey forward as the lava rapidly rises, cools, and hardens, trapping him inside. He travels much farther into the future until the lava erodes away, revealing a lush, green, unspoiled landscape.

Looks Like America In a Cabinet designed to look like America, Zoe Baird, the Attorney General-designate, has the bearing and credentials of what America would like to look like. Personable and smart, experienced in the ways of the Justice Department and White House, Ms. Baird more than vindicates President-elect Clinton's determination to put a woman at the head of the Federal legal establishment. After weeks of churning, Mr. Clinton has succeeded in assembling a Cabinet of rare, welcome diversity. Just how rare can be judged by comparing it with President Bush's performance. Of 16 positions in the Cabinet, 11 are now held by white men, 3 by women, 1 by a black man and 1 by a Hispanic man. Of 16 nominees to Mr. Clinton's cabinet, 7 are white men, 4 are women, 4 are black (1 is a black woman) and 2 are Hispanic. Diversity, while it demonstrates respect for minority Americans, does not by itself assure distinction. Starting with Ms. Baird, the appointees Mr. Clinton announced yesterday give promise of capable public service. For instance, environmentalists were disappointed that Tim Wirth, a longtime champion of environmental causes, was passed over for Interior and Energy. But they can only be pleased with the appointment of Bruce Babbitt, the former Governor of Arizona and witty candidate for the 1988 Democratic Presidential nomination, as Secretary of the Interior. Federico Pena, designated as Transportation Secretary, brings experience as the Mayor of Denver who fought for construction of a massive new airport. Mickey Kantor, Mr. Clinton's campaign chairman, has had no special experience to qualify him as U.S. trade representative. But like Carla Hills, Mr. Bush's choice who has performed brilliantly, he is a shrewd lawyer and negotiator who knows politics and public service. The most impressive nomination yesterday was Ms. Baird's. In a field long dominated by men, she has more than held her own. She was comfortable in male-dominated law environments when she rendered scholarly advice to the White House and practicing at high levels of corporate law. Ms. Baird has the added advantage of being neither the President's crony nor sycophant. Compare that with the Attorneys General -- all of them -- of the Reagan-Bush years. William French Smith looked and acted like a society lawyer. Edwin Meese looked and acted like a harsh partisan. Richard Thornburgh looked promising but acted like a candidate for high office. And William Barr, the incumbent short-timer, has pandered eagerly to the White House. A decade ago, Mr. Smith defaulted on his duty to defend the Internal Revenue Service's right to deny tax exemptions to racially discriminatory schools. Ms. Baird was part of the team of private lawyers that stepped in and successfully did that job as friend of the court. She will inherit a department with strong traditions but whose professionals have been short-changed in recent years for want of principled leadership. Mr. Clinton has made a wise choice for Justice, as he has made a wide choice for diversity. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. Zoe Baird, the Attorney General-designate, has an impressive background and credentials, which validates President-elect Clinton's decision to appoint a woman to lead the Federal legal establishment. 2. President-elect Clinton's Cabinet is significantly diverse compared to President Bush's. 3. Diversity alone does not guarantee distinction, but many of the appointees, including Baird, have shown promise for capable public service. 4.

Loans for Multifamily Homes THE rental market’s strength may be enticing some buyers to look at multifamily properties, but qualifying for a mortgage on rental units is often more difficult than on a single-family residence. Borrowers should be prepared to gather more documentation, and the interest rate and required down payment will very likely be higher. “It looks a lot easier than it is,” said Neil B. Garfinkel, a partner in charge of the real estate practice at Abrams Garfinkel Margolis Bergson, suggesting that anyone new to this subject work with a real estate professional experienced in rental properties. But the extra effort may be worthwhile for some people looking for income, or at least help with covering monthly expenses. A recent report by Frank E. Nothaft, the chief economist for Freddie Mac, noted that “the rental market has been a bright spot in the housing sector this year,” as more households postpone home-buying because of the uncertain economy. The overall rental vacancy rate in Manhattan is hovering around 1 percent, while rents are up for all kinds of apartments. Mr. Garfinkel, who is also an owner of apartments in Brooklyn and the Bronx through an investment firm, says buyers of multifamily property will need to do their due diligence on all the active leases and any service contracts for the building, including the employment terms of the superintendent. Some lenders are more comfortable lending for property with tenants in place, said John Manning, a Brooklyn mortgage broker, while vacant buildings would be fine with others. Mr. Manning’s advice: “Expect to put down 25 to 35 percent, or even more, as a down payment,” well above the 20 percent typically expected these days on single-family loans. He also notes that because multifamily properties are considered riskier, government agencies like Freddie Mac impose a “risk-based pricing adjustment,” which adds a quarter to a half percentage point to the mortgage rate (or buyers can pay a fee equal to 1 percent of the loan amount). The size of the multifamily building determines how lenders evaluate it. A two- to four-unit residence can usually be financed under Fannie Mae’s conventional mortgage guidelines, but if the owner does not plan to live there, he or she can expect to pay a higher mortgage rate. Borrowers’ incomes, credit scores and financial standing will be key. Mortgages for buildings with five or more apartments generally fall in the nonconforming-loans category, and may even be considered a commercial mortgage. The lender will be evaluating these rental properties as if they constituted a small business, Mr. Manning said, which means it will want to make sure that the rents cover the mortgage and other expenses. In many cases, these loans will come from a bank’s commercial lending department. Sometimes local or regional banks will offer them, but only if the property is in their area, according to Mark Lazar, an owner of Allied Financial, a mortgage brokerage in River Edge, N.J. Mr. Lazar says that those considering renting out their primary or second homes shouldn’t assume that the rental income will help them qualify for a mortgage. Many lenders require a homeowner to have at least 30 percent of the home’s value in equity before counting any rental income. For a first-time landlord, he added, only about half of lenders will count the rental income toward the total income needed to finance the multifamily purchase. “If you do not demonstrate experience as a landlord,” Mr. Lazar said, “we will not allow the credit to income,” even if the rent checks have come in steadily for the previous owner. Multifamily buyers should also consider the tax implications, including some favorable deductions for maintenance, snow removal and depreciation.

The Jaws does not come with a mouthpiece but it accommodates any 510 mouthpiece Say this using Spanish","completion":"Sure, translating the sentence \\"The Jaws does not come with a mouthpiece but it accommodates any 510 mouthpiece.\\" to Spanish. Step by step, this would be: 1. Translate \\"The Jaws does not come with a mouthpiece\\" into Spanish. 2. Translate \\"but it accommodates any 510 mouthpiece.\\" into Spanish. So the translation of the first part, \\"The Jaws does not come with a mouthpiece\\" is \\"The Jaws no viene con una boquilla\\". I have just translated each word to the most appropriate Spanish equivalent, while also maintaining the overall structure of the sentence. Secondly, translating \\"but it accommodates any 510 mouthpiece.\\" into Spanish would be \\"pero puede acomodar cualquier boquilla 510.\\". In this case, I utilized the Spanish word for \\"but\\" (pero), followed by a translation of \\"it accommodates\\" (puede acomodar), based on the context that \\"it\\" refers to Jaws. After that, the phrase \\"any 510 mouthpiece\\" is translated to \\"cualquier boquilla 510.\\" Joining both parts of the translated sentence, we have: \\"The Jaws no viene con una boquilla, pero puede acomodar cualquier boquilla 510.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I know that the answer to the question \\"What event occured in the 19th Century that was due to the discovery of a specific precious metal?\\" is in \\"Notre Dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket schedule and later on the football program covers.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who did the men who deserted tell of La Salle's death in 1688? Four of the men deserted when they reached the Neches River. La Salle and one of his nephews became very ill, forcing the group to halt for two months. While the men recovered, the group ran low on food and gunpowder. In August, the eight surviving members of the expedition returned to Fort Saint Louis, having never left East Texas.While La Salle was gone, six of those who had remained on the Belle finally arrived at Fort Saint Louis. According to them, the new captain of the Belle was always drunk. Many of the sailors did not know how to sail, and they grounded the boat on Matagorda Peninsula. The survivors took a canoe to the fort, leaving the ship behind. The destruction of their last ship left the settlers stranded on the Texas coast, with no hope of gaining assistance from the French colonies in the Caribbean Sea.By early January 1687, fewer than 45 of the original 180 people remained in the colony, which was beset by internal strife. La Salle believed that their only hope of survival lay in trekking overland to request assistance from New France, and some time that month he led a final expedition to try to reach the Illinois Country. Fewer than 20 people remained at Fort Saint Louis, primarily women, children, and those deemed unfit, as well as seven soldiers and three missionaries with whom La Salle was unhappy. Seventeen men were included on the expedition, including La Salle, his brother, and two of his nephews. While camping near present-day Navasota on March 18, several of the men quarreled over the division of buffalo meat. That night, an expedition member killed one of La Salle's nephews and two other men in their sleep. The following day La Salle was killed while approaching the camp to investigate his nephew's disappearance. Infighting led to the deaths of two other expedition members within a short time. Two of the surviving members, including Jean L'Archeveque, joined the Caddo. The remaining six men, led by Henri Joutel, made their way to Illinois Country.

Context: Papa, as a son of a dirt-poor farmer, left school early and went to work in a factory, for education was for the rich then. So, the world became his school. With great interest, he read everything he could lay his hands on, listened to the town elders and learned about the world beyond his tiny hometown. \\"There's so much to learn,\\" he'd say. \\"Though we're born stupid, only the stupid remain that way. \\" He was determined that none of his children would be denied an education. Thus, Papa insisted that we learn at least one new thing each day. Though, as children, we thought this was crazy, it would never have occurred to us to deny Papa a request. And dinner time seemed perfect for sharing what we had learned. We would talk about the news of the day; no matter how insignificant, it was never taken lightly. Papa would listen carefully and was ready with some comment, always to the point. Then came the moment--the time to share the day's new learning. Papa, at the head of the table, would push back his chair and pour a glass of red wine, ready to listen. \\"Felice,\\" he'd say, \\"tell me what you learned today. \\" \\"I learned that the population of Nepal is .... \\" Silence. Papa was thinking about what was said, as if the salvation of the world would depend upon it. \\"The population of Nepal. Hmm. Well . . . . \\" he'd say. \\"Get the map; let's see where Nepal is. \\" And the whole family went on a search for Nepal. This same experience was repeated until each family member had a turn. Dinner ended only after we had a clear understanding of at least half a dozen such facts. As children, we thought very little about these educational wonders. Our family, however, was growing together, sharing experiences and participating in one another's education. And by looking at us, listening to us, respecting our input, affirming our value, giving us a sense of dignity, Papa was unquestionably our most influential teacher. Later during my training as a future teacher /1 studied with some of the most famous educators. They were imparting what Papa had known all along--the value of continual learning. His technique has served me well all my life. Not a single day has been wasted, though I can never tell when knowing the population of Nepal might prove useful.

Threatened with frostbite and pneumonia, he is coerced into divulging intelligence to his German interrogator.He and many other Americans are later transferred by train to a prisoner of war camp. While en route, a flight of P-51 Mustangs attack the station. Since the painted letters POW on the top of the train are covered by thick snow, the Mustangs fire on the train, causing some of the POWs to be killed by friendly fire. To save themselves, the POWs leave the train, spell POW with their bodies, and prevent further strafing.After arriving at the camp, Hart is debriefed by the ranking American officer, Colonel William McNamara (Willis). When McNamara asks if he cooperated with the Germans after he was captured, Hart denies it. McNamara knows this to be a lie, since he knows Hart was held for three days after seeing only a Level 1 interrogator. He does not reveal this to Hart and sends him to bunk in a barracks for enlisted men, rather than allow him to bunk with the other officers.Two Tuskegee Airmen are brought to the camp, Second Lieutenants, Lincoln A. Scott (Howard) and Lamar T. Archer (Vicellous Reon Shannon). They are the only blacks in the platoon, and their situation is compounded by their status as officers. Staff Sergeant Vic W. Bedford (Cole Hauser), a vicious racist, is their primary antagonist.Later, a spike from the fence, which could be used as a weapon, is found in Archer's bunk. The Germans drag him out, and, as he stands proud and defiant, shoot him, claiming that he was trying to escape. Directly after that, a radio used by the Americans to receive coded messages via the BBC is found and destroyed.Bedford is himself later found dead.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: James Hudson Taylor (Chinese: Dai De Sheng ; 21 May 1832 - 3 June 1905) was a British Protestant Christian missionary to China and founder of the China Inland Mission (CIM, now OMF International). Taylor spent 51 years in China. The society that he began was responsible for bringing over 800 missionaries to the country who began 125 schools and directly resulted in 18,000 Christian conversions, as well as the establishment of more than 300 stations of work with more than 500 local helpers in all eighteen provinces. Taylor was born on 21 May 1832 the son of a chemist (pharmacist) and Methodist lay preacher James Taylor and his wife, Amelia (Hudson), but as a young man he ran away from the Christian beliefs of his parents. At 17, after reading an evangelistic tract pamphlet entitled \\"Poor Richard\\", he professed faith in Christ, and in December 1849, he committed himself to going to China as a missionary. At this time he came into contact with Edward Cronin of Kensington--one of the members of the first missionary party of the Plymouth Brethren to Baghdad. It is believed that Taylor learned his faith mission principles from his contact with the Brethren. Taylor was able to borrow a copy of China: Its State and Prospects by Walter Henry Medhurst, which he quickly read. About this time, he began studying the languages of Mandarin, Greek, Hebrew, and Latin. In 1851, he moved to a poor neighborhood in Kingston upon Hull to be a medical assistant with Robert Hardey, and began preparing himself for a life of faith and service, devoting himself to the poor and exercising faith that God would provide for his needs. He practised distributing gospel tracts and open-air preaching among the poor. He was baptized by Andrew John Jukes of the Plymouth Brethren in the Hull Brethren Assembly in 1852, and convinced his sister Amelia to also take adult baptism. In 1852 he began studying medicine at the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel, London, as preparation for working in China. The great interest awakened in England about China through the civil war, which was then erroneously supposed to be a mass movement toward Christianity, together with the glowing but exaggerated reports made by Karl Gutzlaff concerning China's accessibility, led to the founding of the Chinese Evangelisation Society, to the service of which Hudson Taylor offered himself as their first missionary. Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"There are several interesting aspects in the article on James Hudson Taylor. One notable aspect is his early life and turning point in his personal beliefs. Initially, he strayed away from the Christian beliefs of his parents, but at the age of 17, he read an evangelistic tract pamphlet, \\"Poor Richard,\\" which eventually led to his conversion to Christianity. This proved to be a pivotal moment in his life as he then decided to dedicate himself to missionary work in China. Another interesting component of the article is Taylor's extensive language learning efforts. He diligently studied Mandarin, Greek, Hebrew, and Latin, which implied his dedication to not only understanding the languages but also effectively communicating with people in different regions, particularly China. Furthermore, Taylor's decision to immerse himself in a poor neighborhood and work as a medical assistant demonstrated his commitment to serving the needy and preparing for his life as a missionary. He practiced distributing gospel tracts and preaching in public spaces, focusing on reaching out to the impoverished population. Taylor's connection to the Plymouth Brethren, particularly Edward Cronin and Andrew John Jukes, also played a significant role in shaping his faith mission principles. It is believed that his experiences with the Brethren helped develop his understanding of faith and service. Lastly, there is the mention of larger socio-political events in England. The civil war in China and its misinterpretation as a mass movement towards Christianity, as well as Karl Gutzlaff's exaggerated reports on China's accessibility, fueled interest in the region. This ultimately led to the establishment of the Chinese Evangelisation Society, to which Hudson Taylor offered his service as their first missionary. This decision marked the beginning of his long and influential missionary work in China."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Fact 1: Sugar causes food to taste sweet.

Article: A city in South Korea has added a new attraction to its cultural landscape --the world's first \\"Toilet Theme Park\\". The Restroom Cultural Park in the city of Suwon is proving a huge hit with locals and tourists alike. The park was built to memorize the former city mayor Sim Jae-duck, known as \\"Mr. Toilet\\". He believed the toilet is a very important place and full of culture. Visitors to the park can enjoy its toilet- bowl- shaped exhibition hall as well as lots of bronze statues in all kinds of toilet positions. They can even sit on Mr. Kim's original toilet, which includes a full-length glass door that mists up when it is being used. Suwon has become well known because of the promotion of toilet culture. The city attracts toilet- related artwork from around the world to its galleries. It famously hosts the Golden Poop Art Festival- a celebration of one of the calls of nature. The city also lists lots of its own public toilets as tourist attractions on its website. Sim Jae-duck's toilet-shaped house, now a museum, should be the must-see for _ .

Please answer the following question: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

Information: - Wallace Markfield (August 12, 1926 May 24, 2002) was an American comic novelist best known for his first novel, \\"To an Early Grave\\" (1964), about four men who spend the day driving across Brooklyn to their friend's funeral. He is also known for \\"Teitlebaum's Window\\" (1970), a comic novel about a Jewish boy growing up in Brooklyn in the 1930s and 1940s. Markfield was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1965 after the publication of \\"To an Early Grave\\". - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - Herbert Sargent ( July 15 , 1923 -- May 6 , 2005 ) was an American television writer , a producer for such comedy shows as The Tonight Show and Saturday Night Live , and a screenwriter ( Bye Bye Braverman ) . During his tenure at Saturday Night Live , he and Chevy Chase created Weekend Update , the longest - running sketch in the show 's history , and one of the longest running sketches on television . - A television set, more commonly called a television, TV, TV set, television receiver, or telly, is a device that combines a tuner, display, and loudspeakers for the purpose of viewing television. Introduced in the late 1920s in mechanical form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using cathode ray tubes. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets in the 1960s, and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for the first recorded media in the 1970s, such as Betamax, VHS and later DVD. It was also the display device for the first generation of home computers (e.g., Timex Sinclair 1000) and video game consoles (e.g., Atari) in the 1980s. In the 2010s flat panel television incorporating liquid-crystal displays, especially LED-backlit LCDs, largely replaced cathode ray tubes and other displays. - NeWS (Network extensible Window System) is a discontinued windowing system developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1980s. Originally known as \\"SunDew\\", its primary authors were James Gosling and David S. H. Rosenthal. The NeWS interpreter was based on PostScript (as was the later Display PostScript, although the two projects were otherwise unrelated) extending it to allow interaction and multiple \\"contexts\\" to support windows. Like PostScript, NeWS could be used as a complete programming language, but unlike PostScript, NeWS could be used to make complete interactive programs with mouse support and a GUI. - Herman Northrop Frye (July 14, 1912 January 23, 1991) was a Canadian literary critic and literary theorist, considered one of the most influential of the 20th century. - Sketch comedy comprises a series of short comedy scenes or vignettes, called \\"sketches\\", commonly between one and ten minutes long. Such sketches are performed by a group of comic actors or comedians, either on stage or through an audio or visual medium such as radio and television. Often sketches are first improvised by the actors and written down based on the outcome of these improv sessions; however, such improvisation is not necessarily involved in sketch comedy. - A screenplay writer, screenwriter for short, scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media such as films, television programs, comics or video games are based. - Laughter is a physical reaction in humans and some other species of primate, consisting typically of rhythmical, often audible contractions of the diaphragm and other parts of the respiratory system. It is a response to certain external or internal stimuli. Laughter can arise from such activities as being tickled, or from humorous stories or thoughts. Most commonly, it is considered a visual expression of a number of positive emotional states, such as joy, mirth, happiness, relief, etc. On some occasions, however, it may be caused by contrary emotional states such as embarrassment, apology, or confusion such as nervous laughter or courtesy laugh. Age, gender, education, language, and culture are all factors as to whether a person will experience laughter in a given situation. - Live television is a television production broadcast in real-time, as events happen, in the present. Shows broadcast live include newscasts, morning shows, awards shows, sports programs, and, occasionally, episodes of television series. Live television was more common until the late 1950s, when videotape technology was invented. Because of the prohibitive cost, adoption was slow, and some television show remained live until the 1970s, such as soap operas. To prevent unforeseen issues, live television programs may be delayed, which allows censors to edit the program. Some programs may be broadcast live in certain time zones and delayed in others. - Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience. - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\\"TV show\\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising. - A television program is a segment of content intended for broadcast on over-the-air, cable television, or Internet television, other than a commercial, trailer, or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewership. It may be a single production, or more commonly, a series of related productions (also called a television series or a television show). - A variety show, also known as variety arts or variety entertainment, is entertainment made up of a variety of acts (hence the name), especially musical performances and sketch comedy, and is normally introduced by a compère (master of ceremonies) or host. Other types of acts include magic, animal and circus acts, acrobatics, juggling, and ventriloquism. The variety format made its way from Victorian era stage to radio to television. Variety shows were a staple of anglophone television from its early days (late 1940s) into the 1980s. - Lorne Michaels (born Lorne Lipowitz; November 17, 1944) is a Canadian-American television producer, writer, comedian, and actor, best known for creating and producing \\"Saturday Night Live\\", and producing the \\"Late Night\\" series (since 1993), and \\"The Tonight Show\\" (since 2014). - The Colbert Report is an American late-night talk and news satire television program hosted by Stephen Colbert that aired four days a week on Comedy Central from October 17, 2005 to December 18, 2014 for 1,447 episodes. The show focused on a fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert, played by his real-life namesake. The character, described by Colbert as a \\"well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot\\", is a caricature of televised political pundits. Furthermore, the show satirized conservative personality-driven political talk programs, particularly Fox News' \\"The O'Reilly Factor\\". \\"The Colbert Report\\" is a spin-off of Comedy Central's \\"The Daily Show\\", where he acted as a correspondent for the program for several years while developing the character. - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County.

Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over . - Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian, or simply a stand-up. In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to \\"enhance\\" their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in comedy clubs, bars and pubs, nightclubs, neo-burlesques, colleges and theatres. Outside of live performance, stand-up is often distributed commercially via television, DVD, CD and the internet. - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - The Tonight Show is an American late-night talk show currently broadcast from the Rockefeller Center in New York City (and previously from various studios in the Los Angeles region) and airing on NBC since 1954. It is the world's longest-running talk show, and the longest running, regularly scheduled entertainment program in the United States. It is the third-longest-running show on NBC, after the news-and-talk shows \\"Today\\" and \\"Meet the Press\\". - A late-night talk show is a genre of talk show popular in the US, structured around humorous monologues about the day's news, guest interviews, comedy sketches and music performances. The late-night talk show format was popularized, though not invented, by Johnny Carson with \\"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\\" on NBC. Typically the show's host conducts interviews from behind a desk, while the guest is seated on a couch. Many late night talk shows feature a house band which generally performs cover songs for the studio audience during commercial breaks and occasionally will back up a guest artist. - Political satire is a significant part of satire that specializes in gaining entertainment from politics; it has also been used with subversive intent where political speech and dissent are forbidden by a regime, as a method of advancing political arguments where such arguments are expressly forbidden. - A cold open (also called a teaser) in a television program or movie is the technique of jumping directly into a story at the beginning or opening of the show before the title sequence or opening credits are shown. On television, this is often done on the theory that involving the audience in the plot as soon as possible will reduce the likelihood of their switching away from a show during the opening commercial. A cold open may summarize events in previous episodes or storylines that will be revisited during the current episode. - The Daily Show is an American news satire and late-night talk show television program hosted by Trevor Noah. It airs each Monday through Thursday on Comedy Central. Describing itself as a fake news program, \\"The Daily Show\\" draws its comedy and satire from recent news stories, political figures, media organizations, and often uses self-referential humor as well. - Advertising is an audio or visual form of marketing communication that employs an openly sponsored, nonpersonal message to promote or sell a product, service or idea. Sponsors of advertising are often businesses who wish to promote their products or services. Advertising is differentiated from public relations in that an advertiser usually pays for and has control over the message. It is differentiated from personal selling in that the message is nonpersonal, i.e., not directed to a particular individual. Advertising is communicated through various mass media, including old media such as newspapers, magazines, Television, Radio, outdoor advertising or direct mail; or new media such as search results, blogs, websites or text messages. The actual presentation of the message in a medium is referred to as an advertisement or \\"ad\\". - In theatre (especially in the illusionistic Western tradition), breaking character occurs when an actor ceases to maintain the illusion that they are identical with the character they are portraying. If the breaking of character is particularly serious, it is considered corpsing, which in film or television would normally result in an abandonment of that take. - A screenplay or script is a written work by screenwriters for a film, video game, or television program. These screenplays can be original works or adaptations from existing pieces of writing. In them, the movement, actions, expression, and dialogues of the characters are also narrated. A screenplay written for television is also known as a teleplay. - In theatre, a monologue (from , from \\"mónos\\", \\"alone, solitary\\" and \\"lógos\\", \\"speech\\") is a speech presented by a single character, most often to express their mental thoughts aloud, though sometimes also to directly address another character or the audience. Monologues are common across the range of dramatic media (plays, films, etc.), as well as in non-dramatic media such as poetry. Monologues share much in common with several other literary devices including soliloquies, apostrophes, and aside. There are, however, distinctions between each of these devices. - Duncan \\"Dick\\" Ebersol (born July 28, 1947) is an American television executive and a senior adviser for NBC Universal Sports & Olympics. He had previously been the chairman of NBC Sports, producing large scale television events such as the Olympic Games and National Football League broadcasts. - Satire is a genre of literature, and sometimes graphic and performing arts, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement. Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism, using wit to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society. - The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is the flagship property of NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of Comcast. The network is headquartered in the Comcast Building (formerly known as the GE Building) at Rockefeller Center in New York City, with additional major offices near Los Angeles (at Universal City Plaza), Chicago (at the NBC Tower) and soon in Philadelphia at Comcast Innovation and Technology Center. The network is part of the Big Three television networks. NBC is sometimes referred to as the \\"Peacock Network\\", in reference to its stylized peacock logo, which was originally created in 1956 for its then-new color broadcasts and became the network's official emblem in 1979. - Weekend Update is a \\"Saturday Night Live\\" sketch that comments on and parodies . It is the show's longest-running recurring sketch, having been on since the show's first broadcast, and is typically presented in the middle of the show immediately after the first musical performance. One or two of the players are cast in the role of news anchor, presenting gag news items based on and acting as hosts for occasional editorials, commentaries, or other performances by other cast members or guests. Chevy Chase has credited Weekend Update, which he started as anchor in 1975, for paving the way for comedic news shows like \\"The Daily Show\\" and \\"The Colbert Report\\". - Cornelius Crane \\"Chevy\\" Chase (born October 8, 1943) is an American actor, comedian, writer and producer. Born into a prominent New York family, he worked a plethora of strange jobs before moving into comedy and began acting with \\"National Lampoon\\". He immediately became a key cast member in the debut season of \\"Saturday Night Live\\", where his recurring \\"Weekend Update\\" segment soon became a staple of the show. - A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas. Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society. The word is also used elsewhere in the arts such as songwriter but as a standalone term, \\"writer\\" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition. - Meet the Press is a weekly American television news/interview program that is broadcast on NBC. It is the longest-running program in U.S. television history, though its current format bears little resemblance to the one it debuted with on November 6, 1947. Like similar shows that have followed it, \\"Meet the Press\\" specializes in interviews with national leaders on issues of politics, economics, foreign policy and other public affairs, along with panel discussions that provide opinions and analysis. It originates from NBC's Washington, D.C. studios. - Monochrome describes paintings, drawings, design, or photographs in one color or values of one color. A monochromatic object or image reflects colors in shades of limited colors or hues. Images using only shades of grey (with or without black or white) are called grayscale or black-and-white. However, scientifically speaking, monochromatic light refers to visible light of a narrow band of wavelengths (see spectral color). - Sidney Arthur Lumet (; June 25, 1924 April 9, 2011) was an American director, producer and screenwriter with over 50 films to his credit. He was nominated for the Academy Award as Best Director for \\"12 Angry Men\\" (1957), \\"Dog Day Afternoon\\" (1975), \\"Network\\" (1976) and \\"The Verdict\\" (1982). He did not win an individual Academy Award, but he did receive an Academy Honorary Award and 14 of his films were nominated for various Oscars, such as \\"Network\\", which was nominated for ten, winning four. - The history of comics has followed different paths in different cultures. Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\". American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (\\"\\") propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia. - Rockefeller Center is a large complex consisting of 19 highrise commercial buildings covering between 48th and 51st Streets in New York City. Commissioned by the Rockefeller family, it is located in the center of Midtown Manhattan, spanning the area between Fifth Avenue and Sixth Avenue. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987. - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance. - Irony, in its broadest sense, is a rhetorical device, literary technique, or event in which what appears, on the surface, to be the case, differs radically from what is actually the case. Irony may be divided into categories such as verbal, dramatic, and situational. Verbal, dramatic, and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth. The ironic form of simile, used in sarcasm, and some forms of litotes can emphasize one's meaning by the deliberate use of language which states the opposite of the truth, denies the contrary of the truth, or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection. - Bye Bye Braverman is a 1968 American comedy film directed by Sidney Lumet. The screenplay by Herbert Sargent was adapted from the 1964 novel \\"To an Early Grave\\" by Wallace Markfield. - A comedian or comic is a person who seeks to entertain an audience, primarily by making them laugh. This might be through jokes or amusing situations, or acting a fool, as in slapstick, or employing prop comedy. A comedian who addresses an audience directly is called a stand-up comic. - Saturday Night Live (abbreviated as SNL) is an American late-night live television sketch comedy and variety show created by Lorne Michaels and developed by Dick Ebersol. The show premiered on NBC on October 11, 1975, under the original title NBC's Saturday Night. The show's comedy sketches, which parody contemporary culture and politics, are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members. Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest (who usually delivers an opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast) and features performances by a musical guest. An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming, \\"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\\", properly beginning the show. - Screenwriting, also called scriptwriting, is the art and craft of writing scripts for mass media such as feature films, television productions or video games. It is frequently a freelance profession. - In a modern sense, comedy (from the , \\"kmidía\\") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.

I cried for my husband Simon to dial 999 and within minutes the air ambulance arrived. They quickly took him in the helicopter. During the flight, Freddie was looking at me and I remember thinking was a good sign, but then his eyes began to roll. As the doctors tried to stabilize him, I couldn't believe what was happening. When we arrived at the hospital in Portsmouth, there were some doctors and nurses waiting for us and they immediately set to work on Freddie. I was hopelessly wishing everything would be alright, but Freddie had broken his skull in two places and blood clots were forming in his brain. He needed surgery , and only a surgeon at another hospital in Bristol could do it. This meant another helicopter ride, but we couldn't go with Freddie because there was no enough space. Simon and I drove the long 130 miles from our home in north Devon in silence. Neither of us dared say what we were thinking, \\"What if we get there and he's dead?\\" \\"Is he going to be brain-damaged?\\" Freddie was just coming out of surgery when we arrived. The surgeon said it had gone well. When I finally saw him, I hardly recognize my child--he was covered in tubes and there were wires coming out of his head. On the third day, Simon went home to see our three girls and to pick up some clean clothes for us. While he was gone, the pressure in Freddie's brain suddenly increased. He was taken into theater again and this time I fell apart. Luckily, the surgery managed to stabilize Freddie. After almost a week, Freddie was finally woken up. When he opened his eyes, he looked at me. He didn't say anything, but I knew straight away that it was my old Freddie, and that he was going to be alright.

Information: - Baden-Württemberg is a state in Germany located in the southwest, east of the Upper Rhine. It is Germanys third largest state in terms of size and population, with an area of and 10.8 million inhabitants. The state capital and largest city is Stuttgart. - Common Era or Current Era, abbreviated CE, is a calendar era that is used as an alternative naming of the \\"Anno Domini\\" era (\\"in the year of the Lord\\"), abbreviated AD. The system uses BCE as an abbreviation for \\"before the Common (or Current) Era\\" and CE as an abbreviation for \\"Common Era\\". The CE/BCE designation uses the same numeric values as the \\"Anno Domini\\" year-numbering system first used by the 6th-century Christian monk Dionysius Exiguus. Neither notation includes a year zero, and the two notations (CE/BCE and AD/BC) are numerically equivalent; thus \\" CE\\" corresponds to \\"AD \\", and \\"400 BCE\\" corresponds to \\"400 BC\\". The Gregorian calendar and the year-numbering system associated with it is the calendar system with most widespread use in the world today. For decades, it has been the global standard, recognized by international institutions such as the United Nations and the Universal Postal Union. - The Julian calendar, proposed by Julius Caesar in 46 BC (708 AUC), was a reform of the Roman calendar. It took effect on 1 January 45 BC (AUC 709) (shortly before the Roman conquest of Egypt), by edict. It was the predominant calendar in the Roman world, most of Europe, and in European settlements in the Americas and elsewhere, until it was refined and gradually replaced by the Gregorian calendar, promulgated in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII. The Julian calendar gains against the mean tropical year at the rate of one day in 128 years. For the Gregorian the figure is one day in 3,030 years. The difference in the average length of the year between Julian (365.25 days) and Gregorian (365.2425 days) is 0.002%. - Otto of Sankt Blasien was a German Benedictine chronicler . He was born about the middle of the 12th century ; died on 23 July 1223 , at Sankt Blasien in the Black Forest , Baden ( southwestern Germany ) . Nothing is known of the events of his life . It is probable that in his later days he became abbot of the renowned Benedictine monastery of Sankt Blasien . He is known as the writer who continued the chronicles of Otto of Freising , like whom he possessed a great talent for presenting a clear survey of events . His language was lofty , and followed the model of the ancient classics . Like many of his contemporaries , he liked to apply the fixed formulas of Justinian to the German emperors , probably on the assumption , then widespread , that the Holy Roman Empire was only the continuation of the Roman Empire of the Caesars . His chronicles , written in the form of annals , \`\` Ad librum VII chronici Ottonis Frisingensis episcopi continuatae historiae appendix sive Continuatio Sanblasiana '' , embrace the period from 1146 to 1209 , that is the period from Conrad III to the murder of Philip of Swabia . Since he was distant in time from the facts he narrates , his accounts are quite objective , even though he makes no concealment of his prejudice in favour of the Hohenstaufen dynasty , which in 1218 received the bailiwick of St. Blasien from the dukes of Zahringen . Yet , after Otto of Brunswick was recognized as Holy Roman emperor , he writes of him in the same objective way as of his predecessors . Nevertheless , without any apparent cause , the narrative breaks off at the coronation of Otto IV. Perhaps the chronicler shrank from describing the bloody party conflicts of the times . His chief sources were the \`\` Gesta Friderici '' and perhaps Alsatian chronicles . On the whole his statements may be trusted . It is only when he has to resort to oral reports that he becomes unreliable ; this is especially the case in his chronology , though he is not to be reproached with intentional misrepresentation of facts... - As a means of recording the passage of time, the 12th century is the period from 1101 to 1200 in accordance with the Julian calendar in the Common Era. In the history of European culture, this period is considered part of the High Middle Ages and is sometimes called the Age of the Cistercians. In Song dynasty China an invasion by Jurchens caused a political schism of north and south. The Khmer Empire of Cambodia flourished during this century, while the Fatimids of Egypt were overtaken by the Ayyubid dynasty. - The Ayyubid dynasty ('; ') was a Muslim dynasty of Kurdish origin, founded by Saladin and centered in Egypt. The dynasty ruled much of the Middle East during the 12th and 13th centuries CE. Saladin had been the vizier of Fatimid Egypt before toppling the Fatimids in 1171. Three years later, he proclaimed himself sultan following the death of his former master, the Zengid ruler Nur al-Din. For the next decade, the Ayyubids launched conquests throughout the region and by 1183, they controlled Egypt, Syria, northern Mesopotamia, Hejaz, Yemen, and the North African coast up to the borders of modern-day Tunisia. Most of the Kingdom of Jerusalem fell to Saladin after his victory at the Battle of Hattin in 1187. However, the Crusaders regained control of Palestine's coastline in the 1190s. - The High Middle Ages or High Medieval Period was the period of European history around the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (c. 10011300). The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention end around 1500. - Year 1200 (MCC) was a leap year starting on Saturday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. - The Rhine (, , ) is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graubünden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-Liechtenstein, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the Rhineland and eventually empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands. The largest city on the river Rhine is Cologne, Germany, with a population of more than 1,050,000 people. It is the second-longest river in Central and Western Europe (after the Danube), at about , with an average discharge of about . - Year 1101 (MCI) was a common year starting on Tuesday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. It was the 2nd year of the 1100s decade, and the 1st year of the 12th century. - The Black Forest is a large forested mountain range in the state of Baden-Württemberg in southwestern Germany. It is bounded by the Rhine valley to the west and south. Its highest peak is the Feldberg with an elevation of 1,493 metres (4,898 ft). The region is roughly oblong in shape with a length of and breadth of up to . - The Song dynasty (9601279) was an era of Chinese history that began in 960 and continued until 1279. It succeeded the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, coincided with the Liao and Western Xia dynasties, and was followed by the Yuan dynasty. It was the first government in world history to issue banknotes or true paper money nationally and the first Chinese government to establish a permanent standing navy. This dynasty also saw the first known use of gunpowder, as well as the first discernment of true north using a compass. - St. Blasien (Sankt Blasien) is a small town located in the Waldshut district in Baden-Württemberg, Germany.

Step 2: Number of pins: We will set the number of pins, i.e., toilet paper rolls we'll use. Bowling in professional settings uses 10 pins, but this can be adjusted depending on the space available at home. Step 3: Set up the \\"pins\\": Set the empty toilet paper rolls on a flat surface. Formation should be in a triangular shape: 1 in the first row, then 2 in the second, and so on. If we are using 10 rolls it will be: first row 1, second row 2, third row 3, fourth row 4. Balance them so they're freestanding. Step 4: Mark the \\"alley\\": You may use a masking tape or any other form of marker to indicate the bowling alley. This gives a boundary for the game and makes it more realistic and interesting. Step 5: Choose the Ball: Use a ball that's not too heavy but has enough weight to knock over the tp rolls. A tennis ball would usually work just fine. Step 6: Set up the Rules: Now it's time to set the rules. They can be simple as you get 2 turns per round to knock all the pins. And you can count 1 point for each roll knocked over. Step 7: Play: Now you are all set to play. Take turns and bowl across the flat surface to knock over the toilet paper rolls. Step 8: Score Tracking: Make sure to track the score. Whoever knocks down the most \\"pins\\" by the end of the game wins.

Translate to English","completion":"The officials, fearful of the presence of the H5 virus in birds, had exterminated the remainder of the flock, disinfected the area, and established a protective zone of 3 kilometers. The H5 virus, also known as Avian Influenza or Bird Flu, is a type of influenza virus that primarily affects birds. In extreme instances, it can cross species barriers and infect humans as well. The early detection of such virus in a bird population is crucial to prevent a potential outbreak and subsequent transmission to humans. More specifically, H5N1 is a subtype of this virus that has caused the most serious health concerns worldwide, due to its ability to cause severe disease and high mortality rate among humans. Therefore, the actions taken by the officials in this situation were to minimize the risk of the disease spreading. Upon detection of the virus in a bird, swift action would have been necessary. In this case, the authorities killed the rest of the birds in the flock. This would have been done to eliminate the chance of further transmission within the bird population and to protect other wildlife and humans in the vicinity. Dissemination of the virus can occur through infected birds' saliva, nasal secretions, and feces. Thus, by euthanizing the birds, the officials would be stopping the spread at its source. Next, they disinfected the area. This step would be vital to kill any remaining virus that could be lurking on surfaces. The cleaning process would usually involve the use of strong disinfectants specified for disease control in a prescribed manner to ensure thorough cleaning and sanitation.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer is:","completion":"No, the provided information does not answer the question about how old Julio César Chávez was when he fought De La Hoya. To answer the question, let's look at the details: Julio César Chávez was born on July 12, 1962. He fought against Oscar De La Hoya on June 7, 1996, in a fight that was billed as \\"Ultimate Glory.\\" To determine his age during the fight, we'll subtract his birth year from the year of the fight: 1996 - 1962 = 34 years Now, we need to check if Chávez had his birthday before or after the fight: The fight took place on June 7, while Chávez's birthday is on July 12.

Summarize this article: Apply the glue and trim to 1 side of the label at a time. If you are decorating the front label, consider doing 3 rows of rhinestone trim. Use a thin trim for the first and third rows, and a larger trim for the middle row. Use a thin, simple trim for the back label. You don't have to use rhinestones for the middle row. Try pearls or even studs! Some bottles have a round stamp or seal near the top, right between the neck and label. Choose a large rhinestone, then glue it right over the stamp or seal. Glue 1 to 2 rows of tiny rhinestones around the larger one for a fancier look. The large rhinestone should be large enough to cover the stamp or seal. For more variation, use tiny pearls for the first row, and silver rhinestones for the second row. If all of your rhinestones are the same shape, size, and color, your bottle may look monotonous. Give the bottle a quick coat of a clear-drying glue or spray sealer, then shake some glitter onto it. This works especially well over smooth, pearl trims. If you are using spray sealer, it must be glossy, or you will dull down the rhinestones. Use glitter that is the same color as your rhinestones to help blend it in some more. Extra-fine glitter will look pretty, but you can use chunky glitter instead, or even a combination of both! If you covered your entire bottle with rhinestones, it may look a little monotonous. Let the bottle dry first, then add larger rhinestones, gemstones, or flat-backed pearls on top. Use these sparingly; do not cover the entire bottle with these. This works especially well over a pearl trim. The rhinestones will help add some texture. Cut a length of ribbon and tie it into a bow. Glue the bow to the neck of bottle, then cut the tails of the bow into angles. Glue a fancy gemstone or brooch to the center of the bow for a more detailed touch.","completion":"This article discusses the process of decorating a bottle using rhinestones, pearls, studs, and glitter.

What's the most logical way to complete this passage? (CNN) -- At age of 52, it might be too late to re-visit your beliefs and principles in order to change them. When you see the regression from where we were, to the situation now and realize the dream you have been working towards has moved almost entirely out-of-reach, you feel tired, hopeless, and less motivated to recharge yourself. I was born in Gaza in 1962 to a refugee family who had been expelled from their village \\"Sawafir\\" in the then British --mandate of Palestine. Five years later, in June 1967, Gaza was occupied by Israel, which meant that I grew up under the occupation. When you live under occupation, your national ambitions become clearer and stronger. And in OPTIONS: - British, politicians and groups compete to see who will be more aggressive towards the Palestinians. - CNN, politicians and groups compete to see who will be more aggressive towards the Palestinians. - Gaza, politicians and groups compete to see who will be more aggressive towards the Palestinians. - Israel, politicians and groups compete to see who will be more aggressive towards the Palestinians. - Omar Shaban, politicians and groups compete to see who will be more aggressive towards the Palestinians. - Palestine, politicians and groups compete to see who will be more aggressive towards the Palestinians. - Palestinian, politicians and groups compete to see who will be more aggressive towards the Palestinians. - Sawafir, politicians and groups compete to see who will be more aggressive towards the Palestinians.","completion":"...in Palestine, politicians and groups compete to see who will be more aggressive towards the Palestinians. This competition fuels tension and unrest within the region, further complicating any hope for peace and stability. As a Palestinian who has experienced these hardships firsthand, I can attest to the emotional and psychological toll that living under occupation takes on an individual and the community as a whole. Throughout my life, I have witnessed various political factions and extremist groups vying for power and influence, often at the expense of innocent civilians. This competition is a driving force behind the perpetuation of hostilities and the seemingly intractable nature of the conflict. What began as a struggle for self-determination and basic human rights has devolved into a cycle of violence and aggression that leaves the average Palestinian feeling increasingly isolated and disenfranchised. As a native of the region, I have observed firsthand the damage done by such political maneuvering. For instance, the Hamas takeover of Gaza in 2007 effectively divided the Palestinian Territories and hampered any efforts to establish a unified, cohesive government. In the absence of a strong, unified voice for all Palestinians, these political squabbles continue unabated, impeding any progress toward a peaceful resolution. In the meantime, the impact of this ongoing conflict is felt acutely by the Palestinian people, particularly in areas like Gaza, which has become effectively isolated from the rest of the world. The crippling blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt has made it exceedingly difficult for Gazans to access basic necessities or to rebuild their lives in the wake of multiple conflicts. Moreover, the devastating effects of war have also led to rampant poverty, unemployment, and poor infrastructure, eroding any semblance of normalcy or stability for the people in the affected areas. In the face of such insurmountable challenges, it is understandable that one might feel disheartened and pessimistic about the prospect of change. However, I believe that it is never too late to revisit one's principles and strive for a better future. To achieve lasting peace in the region, a shift in mindset and approach will be required, emphasizing dialogue and cooperation over aggression and hostility. The international community must also play a key role in moderating the conflict and fostering conditions conducive to negotiation and compromise. In conclusion, while it may be tempting to succumb to feelings of hopelessness in the face of ongoing hostility and political posturing, I maintain that it is never too late to challenge and re-evaluate one's beliefs and principles. After all, it is through the questioning of long-held assumptions and the pursuit of understanding that genuine change and progress can be achieved. Even within the tumultuous landscape of Palestine, where politicians and groups vie for power and influence by demonstrating aggression toward the Palestinians, the possibility of finding a path towards peace and understanding remains – for both Palestinians and Israelis alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Maya Angelou ( ( listen); born Marguerite Annie Johnson; April 4, 1928 - May 28, 2014) was an American poet, singer, memoirist, and civil rights activist. She published seven autobiographies, three books of essays, several books of poetry, and was credited with a list of plays, movies, and television shows spanning over 50 years. She received dozens of awards and more than 50 honorary degrees. Angelou is best known for her series of seven autobiographies, which focus on her childhood and early adult experiences. In 1951, Angelou married Greek electrician, former sailor, and aspiring musician Tosh Angelos, despite the condemnation of interracial relationships at the time and the disapproval of her mother. She took modern dance classes during this time, and met dancers and choreographers Alvin Ailey and Ruth Beckford. Angelou and Ailey formed a dance team, calling themselves \\"Al and Rita\\", and performed modern dance at fraternal black organizations throughout San Francisco, but never became successful. Angelou, her new husband, and her son moved to New York City so she could study African dance with Trinidadian dancer Pearl Primus, but they returned to San Francisco a year later. After Angelou's marriage ended in 1954, she danced professionally in clubs around San Francisco, including the nightclub the Purple Onion, where she sang and danced to calypso music. Up to that point she went by the name of \\"Marguerite Johnson\\", or \\"Rita\\", but at the strong suggestion of her managers and supporters at the Purple Onion she changed her professional name to \\"Maya Angelou\\" (her nickname and former married surname), a \\"distinctive name\\" that set her apart and captured the feel of her calypso dance performances. During 1954 and 1955, Angelou toured Europe with a production of the opera Porgy and Bess. She began her practice of learning the language of every country she visited, and in a few years she gained proficiency in several languages. In 1957, riding on the popularity of calypso, Angelou recorded her first album, Miss Calypso, which was reissued as a CD in 1996. She appeared in an off-Broadway review that inspired the 1957 film Calypso Heat Wave, in which Angelou sang and performed her own compositions. Angelou met novelist John Oliver Killens in 1959 and, at his urging, moved to New York to concentrate on her writing career. She joined the Harlem Writers Guild, where she met several major African-American authors, including John Henrik Clarke, Rosa Guy, Paule Marshall, and Julian Mayfield, and was published for the first time. In 1960, after meeting civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and hearing him speak, she and Killens organized \\"the legendary\\" Cabaret for Freedom to benefit the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and she was named SCLC's Northern Coordinator. According to scholar Lyman B. Hagen, her contributions to civil rights as a fundraiser and SCLC organizer were successful and \\"eminently effective\\".

The river supplies much of Dublin's water and a range of recreational opportunities. - The Greater Dublin Area (GDA) (Irish: \\"Mórcheantar Bhaile Átha Cliath\\"), or simply Greater Dublin is the city of Dublin and its hinterland, with varying definitions as to its extent. The National Transport Authority has defined the Greater Dublin Area as including the counties of Dublin (Dublin City, South Dublin, Dún LaoghaireRathdown and Fingal), Meath, Kildare, and Wicklow. However, this area does not comprise a formal political unit. The term can also apply more narrowly to the Dublin urban area and nearby suburban towns.

These beliefs can lead to social pressures even within the same group, if some members are darker than others. The result is that skin lightening has become very common across Africa, Asia and other areas of the world and more people with dark skin are using skin-lighting products, even if it means they may face health risks. They believe that having whiter skin will improve the quality of their lives. Many people think they will have a better family. Or they want to look like what their society generally considers beautiful. Some beauty care products and soaps contain chemicals that make skin lighter. However, some of the chemicals are extremely dangerous. The chemicals in the products block and break down the natural barrier to protect against sunlight. Then the skin can become thick and discolored. Usually the person will use more of the product in an effort to correct the problem, which just makes things even worse.

The site has been home to protestors since drilling began in July, and 124 arrests have been made so far, including that of Green MP Caroline Lucas. Body: Following the lack of expected results from initial drills, energy company Cuadrilla began the process of removing its exploratory drilling equipment from a site in Balcombe, West Sussex. To ensure smooth and secure transportation, police officers from four different forces were called in to marshal the equipment as it was driven from the site. The Balcombe location has been the epicenter of protests since Cuadrilla commenced drilling operations in July, attracting activists who oppose the company's fracking activities. However, only a few demonstrators attended the latest development, resulting in the arrest of two individuals. Since the start of the drilling, a total of 124 people have been arrested at the site for various reasons, one of them being Green MP Caroline Lucas. The arrests made throughout the months, coupled with the increased police assistance to remove the drilling equipment, show the intensity of the situation that has been brewing at the Balcombe site. Cuadrilla stated that it is unlikely to continue using the Balcombe site for fracking activities in the future. The decision was made after the initial drill tests were not as fruitful as the company had initially hoped. The removal of drilling equipment and the possibility of ceasing fracking activities at the site may mark a new phase in the ongoing debate surrounding the controversial energy exploration method. As Cuadrilla evaluates its future plans for the location, it remains to be seen if a resolution may be reached between the company, protestors, and the local community."},{"prompt":"Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"How may individual Jehovah's Witnesses specify what blood treatments they are willing to accept?\\" is in \\"Though Jehovah's Witnesses do not accept blood transfusions of whole blood, they may accept some blood plasma fractions at their own discretion.

Since 9 is multiplying with p, we can get p alone by dividing both sides of the equation by 9: 0 / 9 = (9 * p) / 9 0 divided by any number is still 0: 0 = p There we go! We found the value of p!

Here's the thought process or strategy around this: 1. Understand the questions: The first question \\"What are some ways to empathize?\\" is asking for different methods or techniques that can be used to empathize. Conversely, the second question \\"How do you empathize with people?\\" seems more personal, as if asking for your own individual methods of empathizing. 2. Recognize the overlap: Both questions revolve around the concept of empathy and seek to understand methods or approaches to achieve it. 3. Synthesize the answer: Based on the overlap, it can be inferred that both questions could receive the same or a very similar response. So, in essence, while the two questions are phrased differently, they are indeed similar in nature and can be answered in much the same way, as they both ask about ways to empathize.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. There are a few different products you can choose from to add a bit of shine and start blending your eyeliner. Note that this isn’t the actual gloss, but will add a bit of luster to get you started. For this, you want to use a wax-based product that isn’t overly sticky. A wax-based product like MAC’s Mixing Medium Shine is ideal. If you don’t want to shell out the cash for a designer product, you can use some waxy lip balm to create the same effect. If you’re trying this look out for the first time, it might be wise to save the cash and try creating it with cheaper products. If you love the look and want to wear it often, however, it’s worth investing in the longer-lasting products that are created specifically for the eyes. Whether you’re using the MAC product or a bit of balm, you’ll apply it the same way. Get a bit of the product on your fingertip and press it onto your eyelid. Using a light hand, carefully use the product to smudge out the kohl eyeliner you previously applied. Gently pull the eyeliner up the lid to create a softer, smokier effect. If you want your lash line to be darkest, you can certainly add a bit more eyeliner to your lash line after you’ve smudged it out a bit. Remember, though, that this look really isn’t about precision or stark lines. Finally, after you’ve blended your eyeliner and laid a shiny foundation, it’s time to apply your gloss. There are a few different eye glosses on the market, like MAC Eye Gloss, NYX Lid Lacquer, MAKE Face Gloss, and Glossier Balm Dotcom. You can find a variety of glosses online or at your local beauty supply store. Use a flat brush or your finger to apply the gloss over your entire lid. Start in the middle and carefully sweep it outwards. If you’re worried about your eyelids feeling sticky, avoid applying any product to the crease. Smooth the product to your lid below the crease and a bit above the crease, but don’t put any directly in it! If you don’t want to buy a product meant specifically for your eye, you can always use a clear lip gloss or Vaseline-type product instead.

Don't forget sunscreen on clear, cold days.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Keep Your Skin Protected: Tips for Healthy Skin in Every Weather Introduction Your skin is the largest organ of your body, and taking care of it should be a top priority. Skin protects you from various environmental factors and helps regulate body temperature, among other essential functions. However, many people overlook the importance of a proper skin care routine, especially during varying weather conditions. Inadequate skin care can lead to numerous issues such as dryness, fine lines, and even skin cancer. By following a few simple tips, you can protect your skin and keep it looking healthy—no matter what Mother Nature has in store. 1. Cover up! One of the best ways to protect your skin against the harsh elements is to cover it up with clothing. You don't need to have a heavy coat on every day, but ensuring that skin that is prone to sunburn or chapping is covered can help keep it protected. Consider wearing hats, gloves, and long-sleeved shirts, especially when it is cold or windy, to provide a physical barrier against the elements. 2. Use a moisturizer No matter the weather, a good moisturizer is essential for maintaining healthy skin. In cold or dry conditions, a thick moisturizer can help protect against chapping and flaking, while a lightweight formula will suit warm or humid climates. Applying moisturizer regularly helps maintain your skin's natural moisture balance, and will leave you with a silky, soft complexion. 3. Wear lip balm Your lips are exceptionally delicate, and just as vulnerable to harsh weather conditions as the rest of your skin. But a good moisturizer might not provide enough protection for them. For that reason, using a lip balm is crucial for maintaining healthy lips. Choose a balm that contains SPF for added protection against sun damage, and apply it throughout the day to keep your lips smooth, soft, and protected. 4. Stay dry Damp skin is a breeding ground for bacteria and can lead to various skin problems. Make sure to thoroughly dry your skin after bathing or sweating to minimize the risk of infections. This is particularly important in moist and humid environments. Carry an extra towel with you during the day if necessary. 5. Don't forget sunscreen on clear, cold days It's a common misconception that sunscreen is only necessary during the hot and sunny summer months. However, ultraviolet (UV) radiation can be just as harmful during cold, clear days. In fact, snow can even reflect up to 80% of the UV rays, increasing your exposure. Therefore, be sure to apply broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher to all exposed skin, even during colder months. This will protect you from sunburn, premature aging, and skin cancer. Conclusion By following these simple yet effective tips, you can keep your skin looking and feeling its best through all the different season. Remember, healthy skin starts with proper care and protection, so make it a priority to give your skin the care it needs to thrive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Megan had always wanted to learn how to swim so they asked Lindsey for lessons.","completion":"Megan had always wanted to learn how to swim, so they asked Lindsey for lessons. Lindsey, an excellent swimmer and certified lifeguard, was well-known for her expertise in the water. She had been swimming since she was a toddler and had a real affinity for the sport. Lindsey loved teaching others how to swim and eagerly agreed to help Megan. Megan and Lindsey decided that the best place to start was the community pool. It was a spot frequented by locals during the summer months, offering various classes, including swimming lessons for children and adults. The pool had a shallow end for beginners, a deeper area for more experienced swimmers, as well as a diving board and a separate area for water sports. Before their first lesson, Lindsey advised Megan on what to wear and what to bring to the pool. Megan needed a comfortable swimsuit, goggles, a swim cap to keep their hair dry, and a towel to dry off after the lesson. Lindsey also recommended that Megan invest in some swim fins and a kickboard to help with technique later on. For their initial lesson, Lindsey focused on helping Megan become comfortable in the water. They began in the shallow end of the pool, where Lindsey taught Megan how to breathe correctly while keeping their face in the water. Soon, Megan was able to float on their back and practice breathing techniques more easily. In the following lessons, Lindsey helped Megan master the four basic swimming strokes: freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke, and butterfly. Freestyle, also known as front crawl, involved alternating arm strokes, with legs kicking in a flutter kick motion. The breaststroke required a simultaneous arm pull and frog kick, encouraging Megan to glide smoothly on the water’s surface. The backstroke allowed Megan to swim with their face above the water, relying on a scissor-like kick and long arm strokes. Lastly, the butterfly stroke proved the most challenging of all. It demanded a powerful dolphin kick and a simultaneous overhead arm pull. Lindsey knew that it took time to learn the butterfly stroke, but, with practice, Megan would eventually grasp it. Along with learning the strokes, Megan wanted to know how to tread water. Lindsey shared techniques for staying afloat without expending too much energy, such as the eggbeater kick, which involved moving the legs in opposite circular motions. As Megan's confidence and skills grew, Lindsey began incorporating swimming drills. She designed these exercises to improve Megan's endurance, strength, and speed in the water. For instance, Megan learned how to streamline—a proper body position for cutting through the water—and practiced this with a series of underwater dolphin kicks. With each lesson, Megan found their love for swimming growing. The sense of accomplishment from mastering new skills, as well as the calming effect of being in the water, was invigorating. Lindsey was a patient and supportive teacher, always encouraging Megan to challenge themselves and celebrate their achievements. After several weeks of training together, Megan felt ready to tackle new swimming goals. They decided to join a local masters swimming team, where they could continue refining their technique, swim with other enthusiasts, and even participate in competitive swim meets. Megan's determination, coupled with Lindsey's guidance, transformed a once-unattainable dream into reality. By conquering their fear and developing a passion for swimming, Megan not only learned an essential life skill but also discovered a new world of enjoyment and possibility."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

These two cities are on opposite sides of the planet, but both wildfires are nearly identical in terms of scope and intensity. So, when it's daytime in Milton, it's nighttime in Parth. New firefighters in Milton are currently arriving at the scene of the fire as the sun beats down directly above them. They are getting instructions from their boss about what they need to do today and preparing themselves for a long day. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Are air currents in Parth traveling uphill or downhill? Hint: Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours. For example, burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth. Answer:","completion":"Given the information provided in the paragraph above, we can infer that the air currents in Parth are traveling downhill. Since it is currently daytime in Milton and nighttime in Parth, the temperature and conditions in Parth will be cooler in comparison. The sunlight has been warming the ground in Milton, causing air currents to travel uphill, whereas in Parth, the lack of sunlight and cooler nighttime temperatures cause the air currents to travel downhill. This is because the ground in Parth will be cooling off, leading to a downward flow of air currents. These air currents tend to fan the wildfires and often follow their path over hills and through valleys. So, as it is nighttime in Parth, the air currents are most likely traveling downhill."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Obsession comes in many flavors, and exists for a variety of reasons; for some it may be nothing more than a compulsive disorder, but for others it may be an avenue of survival. Lack of nurturing, combined with an inability to negotiate even the simplest necessities of daily life or the basic social requirements, may compel even a genius to enthusiastically embrace that which provides a personal comfort zone. And in extreme cases, the object of that satisfaction may become a manifested obsession, driving that individual on until what began as a means of survival becomes the very impetus of his undoing, and as we discover in \`The Luzhin Defence,' directed by Marleen Gorris, a high level of intelligence will not insure a satisfactory resolution to the problem, and in fact, may actually exacerbate the situation. Obsession, it seems, has no prejudice or preference; moreover, it gives no quarter. At an Italian resort in the 1920's, Alexander Luzhin (John Turturro) is one of many who have gathered there for a chess tournament, the winner of which will be the World Champion. Luzhin is a Master of the game, but he is vulnerable in that chess has long since ceased to be a game to him; rather, it is his obsession, that one thing discovered in childhood that saw him though his total ineptness in seemingly all areas of life, and enabled him to cope with the subtle disenfranchisements of his immediate family. So Luzhin is a genius with an Achilles heel, a flaw which perhaps only one other person knows about and understands, and furthermore realizes can be exploited for his own personal gain at this very tournament. That man is Valentinov (Stuart Wilson), Luzhin's former mentor, who after an absence of some years has suddenly reappeared and made himself known to Luzhin. Valentinov is an unwelcomed, disconcerting presence to Luzhin, and once again life threatens to overwhelm him. Not only is he about to face a formidable opponent in the tournament, Turati (Fabio Sartor), against whom in a previous match he emerged with a draw after fourteen hours, but he is also attempting to resolve a new element in his life-- his feelings for a young woman he's just met at the resort, Natalia (Emily Watson). And, genius though he may be, dark clouds are gathering above him that just may push Luzhin even deeper into the obsession that has been the saving grace, as well the curse, of his entire life. To tell Luzhin's story, Gorris effectively uses flashbacks to gradually reveal the elements of his childhood that very quickly led to his obsession with chess. And as his background is established, it affords the insights that allow the audience to more fully understand who Luzhin is and how he got to this point in his life. For the scenes of his childhood, Gorris textures them with an appropriately dark atmosphere and a subtle sense of foreboding that carries on into, and underlies, the present, more pastoral setting of the resort. The transitions through which she weaves the past together with the present are nicely handled, and with the pace Gorris sets it makes for a riveting, yet unrushed presentation that works extremely well. She also underplays the menace produced by the presence of Valentinov, concentrating on the drama rather than the suspense, which ultimately serves to heighten the overall impact of the film, making Luzhin's tragedy all the more believable and unsettling. The single element that makes this film so memorable, however, is the affecting performance of John Turturro. For this film to work, Luzhin must be absolutely believable; one false or feigned moment would be disastrous, as it would take the viewer out of the story immediately. It doesn't happen, however, and the film does work, because the Luzhin Turturro creates is impeccably honest and true-to-life. He captures Luzhin's genius, as well as his inadequacies, and presents his character in terms that are exceptionally telling and very real. It's a performance equal to, if not surpassing, Geoffrey Rush's portrayal of David Helfgott in \`Shine.' And when you compare his work here with other characters he's created, from Sid Lidz in \`Unstrung Heroes' to Pete in \`O Brother Where Art Thou?' to Al Fountain in \`Box of Moonlight,' you realize what an incredible range Turturro has as an actor, and what a remarkable artist he truly is. As Natalia, Emily Watson is excellent, as well, turning in a fairly reserved performance through which she develops and presents her character quite nicely. Though she has to be somewhat outgoing to relate to Luzhin, Watson manages to do it in an introspective way that is entirely effective. Most importantly, because of the detail she brings to her performance, it makes her accelerated relationship with Luzhin believable and lends total credibility to the story. You have but to look into Watson's eyes to know that the feelings she's conveying are real. It's a terrific bit of work from a talented and gifted actor. The supporting cast includes Geraldine James (Vera), Christopher Thompson (Stassard), Peter Blythe (Ilya), Orla Brady (Anna), Mark Tandy (Luzhin's Father), Kelly Hunter (Luzhin's Mother), Alexander Hunting (Young Luzhin) and Luigi Petrucci (Santucci). Well crafted and delivered, \`The Luzhin Defence' is an emotionally involving film, presented with a restrained compassion that evokes a sense of sorrow and perhaps a reflection upon man's inhumanity to man. We don't need a movie, of course, to tell us that there is cruelty in the world; but we are well served by the medium of the cinema when it reminds us of something we should never forget, inasmuch as we all have the ability to effect positive change, and to make a difference in the lives of those around us.

A federal judge on... (Associated Press) ST. LOUIS (AP) — A federal judge on Tuesday approved a settlement in the wrongful-death lawsuit filed by the parents of Michael Brown, an unarmed, black 18-year-old, whose fatal shooting by a white police officer nearly three years ago in Ferguson, Missouri, set off months of protests. Financial terms of the settlement approved by U.S. District Judge E. Richard Webber were not disclosed. Anthony Gray, the attorney for Brown's parents, declined comment, as did Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III. Michael Brown Sr. and Lezley McSpadden sued the city, former Police Chief Tom Jackson and former police officer Darren Wilson in 2015. They argued that the death of their son deprived them of financial support through his future potential wages. Their lawsuit also described the police culture in Ferguson as hostile to black residents, and said Wilson used excessive and unreasonable force in fatally shooting Brown during an Aug. 9, 2014, confrontation on a street. Ferguson, Jackson and Wilson denied the allegations. Wilson was cleared of wrongdoing, but the shooting led to sometimes violent unrest in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb. Wilson resigned from the police force in November 2014, soon after a St. Louis County grand jury announced he would not be indicted. The U.S. Department of Justice also found no grounds to prosecute Wilson. But the investigation led to a Justice Department lawsuit over racially biased police and court practices. A settlement calls for significant changes in operations, including sensitivity training for officers, adoption of community policing techniques, court reforms and other measures. The process is expected to cost more than 2 million and could take years. Webber's three-page ruling discloses nothing about the settlement amount, but said it is \\"fair and reasonable compensation for this wrongful death claim and is in the best interests of each Plaintiff,\\" with the money to be split between Michael Brown Sr. and McSpadden. Webber also wrote that the agreement \\"shall remain sealed by this Court and shall be considered a closed record\\" because disclosure of the information \\"could jeopardize the safety of individuals involved in this matter, whether as witnesses, parties, or investigators.\\" He did not elaborate. Settlements involving public money and public entities such as cities are typically open under Missouri law, but Webber wrote that the value of opening the record \\"is outweighed by the adverse impact to Plaintiffs.\\" ||||| FERGUSON • An insurance company for Ferguson has agreed to pay 1.5 million to settle a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the parents of Michael Brown over his 2014 death, a lawyer said Friday. Ferguson City Attorney Apollo Carey told the Post-Dispatch in an email Friday morning that the insurance company paid 1.5 million \\"on behalf of multiple defendants.\\" Brown's parents were suing the city, former Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson and former police Officer Darren Wilson, who shot Brown. U.S. District Judge E. Richard Webber approved the secret settlement Tuesday. In his order, Webber did not mention the amount, writing only that it is “fair and reasonable compensation for this wrongful death claim and is in the best interests of each Plaintiff.” Webber said the split of the amount between Michael Brown Sr. and Lezley McSpadden “is fair and reasonable,” and the agreement “provides for a reasonable amount” for attorney fees and expenses. Settlements involving public entities are generally open records under Missouri law, but Webber ordered the agreement sealed and said that it should be considered a closed record under the Law “due to the adverse impact to Plaintiffs should it be disclosed.\\" \\"Disclosure of the terms of the settlement agreement,\\" Webber wrote, \\"could jeopardize the safety of individuals involved in this matter, whether as witnesses, parties, or investigators. The public policy to consider records open is outweighed by the adverse impact to Plaintiffs.\\" State law does require that the settlement amount be released, and Carey disclosed the amount after open records requests from the Post-Dispatch and at least one other media organization, the Associated Press. The Post-Dispatch reported on Monday that a settlement was near, and that it would be less than the 3 million limit of the city's insurance. Lawyers on both sides, and a board member of the insurance company, declined in recent days to comment on any aspect of the settlement or what led to it. All sides faced risks if they took the case to trial. Peter Joy, professor at the Washington University School of Law, said that had the city lost, the insurance company would have paid any judgment up to the 3 million limit, but Ferguson would have had to pay any amount above that. They would also have to pay lawyers fees and costs. A trial alone could have cost 100,000 for just one side, he said, and he guessed that they'd already “sunk a lot of money into it to get to this point.” From the Brown's family's perspective, they could have lost at the trial, or they could have prevailed but been awarded less than the 1.5 million, he said. Plaintiff's lawyers working on a contingency basis typically take 33-40 percent of a settlement, and then the plaintiffs have to pay costs and any taxes, Joy said. The Brown family's 2016 lawsuit says that a police culture of pervasive hostility toward African-Americans led to the death of Brown, 18, on Aug. 9, 2014. Wilson used excessive and unreasonable force, the suit says. Ferguson, Jackson and Wilson denied the claims in court documents. A St. Louis County grand jury declined to indict Wilson, and the U.S. Justice Department declined to prosecute him, saying evidence and “credible” witnesses supported Wilson’s claims that Brown attacked him. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"A federal judge has approved a 1.5 million settlement in the wrongful-death lawsuit filed by the parents of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager whose fatal shooting by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 sparked months of protests.

The tomato festival is called \\"La Tomatina\\"in Spanish. It was the biggest and messiest tomato fight in the world. When we first got to the square where the festival took place, it was very crowded with people from all around the world, and many trucks were carrying tomatoes. My uncle told me the crowded people here were around 38,000 and this was more than four times the population of Bunol. The tomato fight started as soon as the first banger was beaten. Then everyone including me started throwing tomatoes at each other. I took red tomatoes and threw them at anyone that ran, moved, bent down, or turned around. Tomatoes must be squashed before people threw them in order not to hurt anybody. After a little while, the streets, people and nearby buildings were splashed with red.

Article: Thinking is something you choose to do as a fish chooses to live in water. To be human is to think. But thinking may come naturally without your knowing how you do it. Thinking about thinking is the key to critical thinking. When you think critically, you take control of your thinking processes . Otherwise, you might be controlled by the ideas of others. Indeed, critical thinking is at the heart of education. The word \\"critical\\" here has a special meaning. It does not mean taking one view against another view, as when someone criticizes another person for doing something wrong. The nature of critical thinking is thinking beyond the easily seen--beyond the pictures on TV, the untrue reports in the newspapers, and the faulty reasoning . Critical thinking is an attitude as much as an activity. If you are curious about life and desire to dig deeper into it, you are a critical thinker; if you find pleasure in deep thinking about different ideas, characters, and facts, you are a critical thinker. Activities of the mind and higher-order reasoning are processes of deep and careful consideration.

Jouvet Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"The Elusive Chase\\" Genre: Mystery/Comedy/Crime Plot Summary: In \\"The Elusive Chase,\\" Inspector Jouvet, a determined French police officer, hopes to find the renowned but clumsy Inspector Clouseau alive after he disappeared while working on a high-profile case. As Jouvet puts together his investigation, he finds clues that suggest Clouseau may still be alive and embarks on a race against time to unravel the truth. Along the way, he faces his own chaotic encounters, as Clouseau's clumsiness seems to be contagious. Plot: The film begins with a flashback, showing Inspector Clouseau's (Peter Sellers) last case before his disappearance. Clouseau was assigned a mission to uncover the mastermind behind a notorious crime syndicate involved in a series of art heists across France. Despite his best efforts, the case goes cold, and Clouseau disappears without a trace. Several years later, Inspector Jouvet (Jean Reno) is assigned to reopen Clouseau's cold case. He is a devoted fan of Clouseau's work and develops a hunch that Clouseau may still be alive, albeit in hiding. Jouvet enlists the help of Clouseau's former partner, Detective Ponton (André Dussollier), who reluctantly agrees to aid in the investigation. With Ponton's help, Jouvet discovers a series of cryptic messages left by Clouseau at key crime scene locations. These messages, in Clouseau's clumsy yet endearing fashion, lead Jouvet and Ponton closer to the elusive crime lord behind the heists. However, this also leads to them crossing paths with dangerous criminals and getting entangled in precarious situations that echo Clouseau's infamous clumsiness. As Jouvet digs deeper into the case, he starts to suspect that Clouseau may be more involved in the crime syndicate than he initially assumed. As his admiration for Clouseau shifts, he becomes obsessed with solving the case and proving Clouseau's innocence. After a wild goose chase filled with comedic twists and turns, Jouvet and Ponton finally uncover the crime lord's identity, played by Tchéky Karyo. He is a sophisticated art collector attempting to create the perfect collection by commissioning the thefts of famous artworks. They manage to infiltrate the crime lord's lair and discover that Clouseau had been secretly living among the criminals, working undercover to dismantle the operation and bring the kingpin to justice. In a climactic confrontation, Jouvet and Ponton, together with Clouseau, outsmart the crime lord, resulting in his arrest and the recovery of several stolen artworks. They save Clouseau from a sticky situation, and he finally gets the gratitude of his superiors. In the end, the legacy of Clouseau is redeemed, and Jouvet restores his faith in his idol. As a fitting tribute, Clouseau takes Jouvet under his wing, recognizing the young inspector as a worthy successor in the pursuit of justice. In turn, Jouvet learns that while Clouseau's methods may be unconventional, his dedication to fighting crime is unparalleled — a lesson he will take on throughout his career. \\"The Elusive Chase\\" combines the iconic slapstick humor of the classic Pink Panther films with a fresh twist, exploring the importance of trusting one's instincts and the mentor-mentee relationship. The film is filled with thrilling action, suspenseful crime-solving, and heartwarming comedy, appealing to both fans of the original series and new audiences alike."},{"prompt":"Larisa Grollemond is conducting a comparative study of illuminations in the Mirror of History (Speculum historiale, Miroir historial) as a graduate intern in the Manuscripts Department of the Getty Museum. The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery.

The administration decided to rely primarily on conscription, rather than voluntary enlistment, to raise military manpower for when only 73,000 volunteers enlisted out of the initial 1 million target in the first six weeks of the war. In 1917 10 million men were registered. This was deemed to be inadequate, so age ranges were increased and exemptions reduced, and so by the end of 1918 this increased to 24 million men that were registered with nearly 3 million inducted into the military services. The draft was universal and included blacks on the same terms as whites, although they served in different units. In all 367,710 black Americans were drafted , compared to 2,442,586 white . Forms of resistance ranged from peaceful protest to violent demonstrations and from humble letter-writing campaigns asking for mercy to radical newspapers demanding reform. The most common tactics were dodging and desertion, and many communities sheltered and defended their draft dodgers as political heroes. Many socialists were jailed for \\"obstructing the recruitment or enlistment service\\". The most famous was Eugene Debs, head of the Socialist Party of America, who ran for president in 1920 from his prison cell. In 1917 a number of radicals and anarchists challenged the new draft law in federal court, arguing that it was a direct violation of the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the draft act in the Selective Draft Law Cases on January 7, 1918.

When responding to the specific question, \\"When the photon energy is less than the work function of the material the light is shone upon, how many photoelectrons are emitted?\\" a more straightforward and focused response might be preferred. For instance, you could express the answer as follows: \\"When the energy of the incident photon is less than the work function of a material, generally no photoelectrons are emitted. This is because the work function, which is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the surface of a material, has not been met. Thus, the photon doesn't provide enough energy to overcome this energy barrier, resulting in a lack of photoemission.\\" However, it's important to note that there is an exception, which was mentioned in your original statement—the multiphoton effect. Here's how you could explain this phenomenon in the context of this question: \\"Nevertheless, an exception exists under the phenomenon known as the multiphoton effect. If multiple photons interact with the material almost simultaneously, their energies can add up. If this accumulated energy surpasses the work function, it can result in the emission of photoelectrons even though the energy of each individual photon is lower than the work function.\\" Understanding the context and potential background knowledge of the audience is imperative in delivering an effective response.

It might be low testosterone.” And then there’s the biggie. “Not feeling as interested in sex as you used to be?” You got it. It might be low testosterone. So, is low T, as it is commonly referred to, really such a big deal when it comes to low libido? According to Harvard urologist Dr. Abraham Morgentaler, founder of Men's Health Boston and the author of Testosterone for Life, it is. “Low T can cause symptoms of reduced sexual interest or performance, difficulty achieving an orgasm and reduced genital sensitivity,” he said. Clearly, not good. And that’s just the beginning. Low T can also cause “lack of energy, reduced sense of vitality, chronic fatigue, reduced stamina or muscular performance, depressed or flattened mood, irritability and increased abdominal fat. And all of those things, of course, can put a damper on libido in and of themselves. Not to mention that low T is also associated with shorter life span, increased risk of obesity, developing diabetes or the metabolic syndrome (an indicator of cardiovascular risk) and osteoporosis. And if you’re worried about or suffering from the above, that can definitely do a number on your sex life too. In other words, when it comes to one’s sex life, low T can be a very big deal. The good news is, all one needs is a simple blood test to find out if you have low T. So, when is testing recommended? Well, Morgentaler said, if one has “symptoms of decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, chronic fatigue, reduced exercise capability/stamina and depressed mood (the ‘blahs’),” testing would be a good idea. Morgentaler believes it’s important to measure total T, which is the traditionally accepted method, as well as free T, which is considered more accurate since it’s the bioavailable portion of T within the bloodstream. “Some men will have normal-appearing levels of total T, but low free T, and those men benefit from treatment,” he said. Once the test comes back, the doctor can check the levels and consider those in reference to the symptoms if any. So many problems with sex involve trial and error, counseling and arduous testing. Although low T might be a tough diagnosis at first mentally, it’s really no big deal and a very easy fix. Having low T does not make one less of a man. But not getting help for it is not a very manly move. If the test shows that low T is an issue, it can be treated with, of course, testosterone. “The most popular forms of treatment are gels, injections, and pellets placed under the skin,” Morgentaler said. “The advantage of the pellets is that they are the only long-acting form of treatment, providing good T levels for three to four months at a time, whereas gels must be applied daily, and injections are performed at one to two week intervals.” As with most medications, there can be side effects, including acne, breast tenderness or enlargement, swelling of feet and/or ankles, and an increase in the number of red blood cells. The good news is that none of these are common and all of them can be resolved with the termination of treatment, Morgentaler said. And it is not, as previously thought, a risk for prostate cancer. When it comes to sex, low T can be a problem for women too. So, post-menopausal women and women with low libido or vitality might want to have their testosterone levels checked as well. “Testosterone does seem to help a significant proportion of these women,” he added. “However, T treatment in women is relatively new and not yet approved by the FDA for this use.” The bottom line is this: It’s a simple blood test that can significantly change one’s quality of life. “It is not a ‘cure’ for everyone, but there is no doubt that a great many men who are treated for low T feel like they are ‘alive again,’ with increased energy, sexual desire, and a renewed sense of purpose and vitality,” Morgentaler said. The same goes for women. If you just don’t feel raring and ready to go like you used to, get tested. You just might be surprised at how quickly you’ll be back to your old self again.

Joe: The Rise of Cobra Movie plot: The film opens in France, in 1641. The Scotsman Klan McCullen has been accused of selling weaponry to both the Scots and French. Rather than being executed for treason, the jury brands his face with a white-hot mask in order to humiliate him. In the near future, weapons expert James McCullen (Christopher Eccleston) has created a nanotechnology-based weapon capable of destroying an entire city. His company MARS sells four warheads to NATO, and the U.S. Army is tasked with delivering the warheads. Duke (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) are delivering the warheads when they are ambushed by the Baroness (Sienna Miller), who Duke recognized to be his ex-fiancee Ana Lewis. Duke and Ripcord are rescued by Scarlett (Rachel Nichols), Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and Heavy Duty (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). They take the warheads to The Pit, G.I. Joe's command center in North Africa, and upon arriving rendezvous with General Hawk (Dennis Quaid), the head of the G.I. Joe Team. Hawk takes command of the war-heads and excuses Duke and Ripcord, only to be convinced to have them join his group after Duke reveals that he knows the Baroness.McCullen is revealed to be using the same nanotechnology to build an army of soldiers with the aid of the Doctor (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), planning on using the warheads to bring panic and bring about a new world order. Using a tracking device, McCullen locates the G.I. Joe base and sends Storm Shadow (Lee Byung-hun) and the Baroness to retrieve the warheads with assistance from Zartan (Arnold Vosloo), inflicting casualties on several G.I. Joe soldiers. After a fight, Storm Shadow and the Baroness retrieve the warheads and take them to Baron DeCobray, the Baroness's husband, for him to weaponize and use them to destroy the Eiffel Tower to serve as a showing of the warhead's destructive power. Making their way to Paris, the Joes pursue them through the streets but are unsuccessful in stopping them from launching the missile. Duke manages to hit the kill switch, but in doing so he is...

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Instructions: In this task you will be given a list of integers. You should remove any integer that is not prime. A prime integer is an integer that is only divisible by '1' and itself. The output should be the list of prime numbers in the input list. If there are no primes in the input list an empty list (\\"[]\\") should be returned. Input: [875, 139, 225, 346, 109, 136, 557, 907, 397, 907, 408, 886, 151, 848, 573, 881, 173, 569, 593] Output:","completion":"In this task, you are given a list of integers and your goal is to remove all the non-prime numbers from the list and return a list containing only prime numbers. Step 1: Understand what a prime number is. A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself without leaving any remainder. For example, 2, 3, and 5 are prime numbers, while 4 (divisible by 2) and 6 (divisible by 2 and 3) are not. Step 2: Analyze the given list of integers. Input: [875, 139, 225, 346, 109, 136, 557, 907, 397, 907, 408, 886, 151, 848, 573, 881, 173, 569, 593] Step 3: Check each integer in the list to determine if it's a prime number. - To check if a number is prime, you can start dividing the number by all the integers from 2 to the square root of the number itself. If any of these divisions result in a whole number (no remainder), then the number is not prime. Step 4: Create an empty list to store the prime numbers found. - As you check each integer in the input list, if it's a prime number, add it to the new list. Step 5: Continue checking each number in the input list and adding prime numbers to the new list until all numbers have been checked. Step 6: If there are no primes in the input list, return an empty list (\\"[]\\"). Step 7: Once you've checked all the numbers in the input list, return the list containing only prime numbers as the output. Using these steps, the output for the given input will be: Output: [139, 109, 557, 907, 397, 907, 151, 881, 173, 569, 593]"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

There were a lot of different numbers and symbols on the multimeter, but Brett explained that they needed to choose the one that looked like a \\"V\\" for volts because they were measuring a battery. Next, Brett showed Jason two wires with pointy ends. They were called \\"probes,\\" and they use these to touch the battery. One was red, which meant it was for the \\"plus\\" side of the battery, and the other was black for the \\"minus\\" side. Together, they gently touched the probes to the correct sides of the battery.

Title: The Class Movie plot: The film covers an academic year, beginning with the teachers gathering for the autumn term, introducing themselves to each other and being welcomed by the principal, an unsmiling figure wearing rimless glasses. It ends with an informal game of football between staff and pupils and a long hand-held shot of an empty classroom. The camera never leaves the school. The film is set in the staff room, the playground, the dining room, the principal's office, a conference room, and the classroom where FranÃ§ois Marin (FranÃ§ois BÃ©gaudeau) teaches French (i.e., language arts) to a mixed group of 13- and 14-year-olds. The film centers around Marin and the various experiences he has with students in his French literature class. The class is difficult, as Marin is unable to relate to his students due to his ethnicity and class status . Marin makes various attempts to try and garner trust and respect from his students but fails miserably . At the students protest of their dislike of the required reading material Anne Frank due to lack of cultural relevance, Marin tries to gain insight into the lives of his pupils. He assigns them to write self-portraits which describe their aspirations, hobbies and dislikes. These are eventually collated by Marin who creates an end-of-year book with them. Most of his students respond positively to this assignment including Soulemayne, a student from Mali whom Marin allows to complete a photographic autobiography . However all this new found trust and respect that Marin gets from his students quickly dissipates after a faculty meeting in which two of his students are allowed to attend as class representatives . Marin would go on to make disparaging comments about one of his students in this meeting and even more disparaging remarks about the class representatives who would serve to be whistle blowers later on in the film .

A post office was established there in 1873 on 13 - 12 - 5E and later moved . The community is home to the Immaculate Conception Ukrainian Catholic Church which is an intricately designed structure featuring nine cupolas and built almost entirely with volunteer labour . The church was built in 1923 . There is also another church , called St. Michael 's and Sacred Heart in town which is in the same property as the Cooks Creek Heritage Museum . - Birds Hill Provincial Park is a provincial park in Manitoba, Canada. It is located 24 kilometres north of Winnipeg on Highway 59, and covers approximately 8300 acres (35.1 square kilometres). The area (and park) is named after Dr. Curtis Bird, first speaker of the Manitoba provincial legislature in 1873, whose father had been a factor in the Hudson's Bay Company and received a large land grant at this location. Since the area is higher than the surrounding terrain, what is now Birds Hill Park served early settlers as a refuge from flooding in the years 1826 and 1852. It is part of the RM of Springfield, with a relatively small portion lying within the Rural Municipality of St. Clements. The provincial park features a mixture of aspen and oak forest with open prairie/savannah, spruce, bog areas and mixed boreal forest communities, not commonly found so close together. - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world. - The R.M. of Springfield was incorporated in 1880 as a result of changes made to the R.M. of Springfield and Sunnyside (1873-1880). The municipality received its name due to the presence of multiple natural springs found within its borders. Springfield stretches from urban industrial development on the eastern boundary of the City of Winnipeg, through urban, rural residential, agricultural and natural landscapes, to the Agassiz Provincial Forest on the municipality's eastern boundary. Birds Hill Provincial Park nestles into the northwestern corner of Springfield. While farming is still important in the municipality, today many residents are employed in nearby Winnipeg. In the 2011 census the population was 14,069, up 8.3% from 2006. - A community is commonly considered a social unit (a group of people) who have something in common, such as norms, values, or identity. Often - but not always - communities share a sense of place that is situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country, village, town, or neighborhood). Durable relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of community. People tend to define those social ties as important to their identity, practice, and roles in social institutions like family, home, work, government, society, or humanity, at large. Although communities are usually small relative to personal social ties (micro-level), \\"community\\" may also refer to large group affiliations (or macro-level), such as national communities, international communities, and virtual communities. - A post office is a customer service facility forming part of a national postal system. Post offices offer mail-related services such as acceptance of letters and parcels; provision of post office boxes; and sale of postage stamps, packaging, and stationery. In addition, many post offices offer additional services: providing and accepting government forms (such as passport applications), processing government services and fees (such as road tax), and banking services (such as savings accounts and money orders).

His stammering speech visibly unsettles the thousands of listeners in the audience. The prince tries several unsuccessful treatments and gives up, until the Duchess persuades him to see Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), an Australian speech therapist.In their first session, Logue requests that they address each other by their Christian names, a breach of royal etiquette: Logue tells the prince that he will be calling him Bertie from now on. At first, Bertie is reluctant to receive treatment, but Logue bets Bertie a shilling that he can read perfectly at that very moment, and gives him Hamlet's \\"To be, or not to be\\" soliloquy to read aloud, with music blaring so that he can't hear himself. Logue records Bertie's reading on a gramophone record, but convinced that he has stammered throughout, Bertie leaves in a huff, declaring his condition \\"hopeless.\\" Logue gives him the recording as a keepsake.Later that year, after Bertie's father, King George V (Michael Gambon), makes his 1934 Christmas address, he explains to his son the importance of broadcasting for the modern monarchy in a perilous international situation. He declares that Bertie's older brother, David, Prince of Wales, will bring ruin to the family and the country when he ascends the throne, and demands that Bertie train himself to fill in, beginning by reading his father's speech into a microphone for practice. After an agonizing attempt to do so made worse by his father's coaching, Bertie plays Logue's recording and hears himself reciting Shakespeare fluently, amazing both himself and the Duchess.Bertie returns to Logue's treatment, where they work together on muscle relaxation and breath control, as Logue gently probes the psychological roots of the stammer,...","completion":"In the movie \\"The King's Speech,\\" the person who persuades Prince Albert (later King George VI) to see Lionel Logue is the Duchess, his wife Elizabeth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: The trade-off theory of capital structure is the idea that a company chooses how much debt finance and how much equity finance to use by balancing the costs and benefits. The classical version of the hypothesis goes back to Kraus and Litzenberger[1] who considered a balance between the dead-weight costs of bankruptcy and the tax saving benefits of debt. Often agency costs are also included in the balance. This theory is often set up as a competitor theory to the pecking order theory of capital structure. A review of the literature is provided by Frank and Goyal.[2] An important purpose of the theory is to explain the fact that corporations usually are financed partly with debt and partly with equity. It states that there is an advantage to financing with debt, the tax benefits of debt and there is a cost of financing with debt, the costs of financial distress including bankruptcy costs of debt and non-bankruptcy costs (e.g. staff leaving, suppliers demanding disadvantageous payment terms, bondholder/stockholder infighting, etc.). The marginal benefit of further increases in debt declines as debt increases, while the marginal cost increases, so that a firm that is optimizing its overall value will focus on this trade-off when choosing how much debt and equity to use for financing. Company X stopped taking on more debt, and decided to file for bankruptcy, while company Y, kept benefiting from the tax benefits of debt, having a lower debt level. Which company had fewer costs than benefits related to debt, company X or company Y? Answer:","completion":"Company Y had fewer costs than benefits related to debt. Explanation: According to the trade-off theory of capital structure, a company should balance the costs and benefits of debt finance and equity finance. Company X stopped taking on more debt and decided to file for bankruptcy, which suggests that the costs of financial distress, including bankruptcy costs and non-bankruptcy costs, outweighed the tax benefits of debt for them. This indicates that Company X experienced more costs than benefits related to debt. On the other hand, Company Y continued to enjoy the tax benefits of debt, while maintaining a lower debt level. This implies that Company Y was able to effectively manage the costs associated with debt and benefit from the tax advantages. As a result, Company Y had fewer costs than benefits related to debt, as they managed to optimize their capital structure and maintain a balance between debt financing and equity financing."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This turns out to be a set-up; while Swagger is working with Johnson's agents to find the rumored assassin, the Ethiopian archbishop is instead shot while standing next to the president. Swagger is then shot twice by a city police officer, but manages to escape. The agents tell the police that Swagger is the shooter and stage a manhunt for the injured sniper.

Later, Serling is assigned to determine if Captain Karen Emma Walden (Meg Ryan) should be the first woman to receive a (posthumous) Medal of Honor. She was the commander of a Medevac Huey that was sent to rescue the crew of a shot-down Black Hawk. When she encountered a T-54, her crew destroyed it by dropping a fuel bladder onto the tank and igniting it with a flare gun. However, her own helicopter was shot down soon after. The two crews were unable to join forces, and on the next day, when further rescue arrived, Walden was reported dead. Serling notices inconsistencies between the testimonies of Walden's crew. Specialist Andrew Ilario, the medic (Matt Damon), praises Walden heavily. Staff Sergeant John Monfriez (Lou Diamond Phillips) claims that Walden was a coward and that Monfriez himself led the crew in combat, and that the fuel bladder technique was originated by him. Sergeant Altameyer, who is dying in a hospital, complains about a fire. Warrant Officer One Rady, the co-pilot, was injured early on and rendered unconscious. Meanwhile, the crew of the Black Hawk claims that they heard firing from an M16, which Ilario and Monfriez deny.

The Soviets are secretly constructing a bridge at night over a river. To avoid detection, it is being built underwater, just below the surface.

The company, retaining the title \\"Sadler's Wells Opera\\", opened at the Coliseum on 21 August 1968, with a new production of Mozart's Don Giovanni, directed by Sir John Gielgud. Though this production was not well received, the company rapidly established itself with a succession of highly praised productions of other works. Arlen died in January 1972, and was succeeded as managing director by Lord Harewood.The success of the 1968 Mastersingers was followed in the 1970s by the company's first Ring cycle, conducted by Goodall, with a new translation by Andrew Porter and designs by Ralph Koltai. The cast included Norman Bailey, Rita Hunter and Alberto Remedios. In Harewood's view, among the highlights of the first ten years at the Coliseum were the Ring, Prokofiev's War and Peace, and Richard Strauss's Salome and Der Rosenkavalier. The company's musical director from 1970 to 1977 was Charles Mackerras. Harewood praised his exceptional versatility, with a range \\"from The House of the Dead to Patience.\\" Among the operas he conducted for the company were Handel's Julius Caesar starring Janet Baker and Valerie Masterson; five Janáček operas; The Marriage of Figaro with pioneering use of 18th century performing style; Massenet's Werther; Donizetti's Mary Stuart with Baker; and Sullivan's Patience. The company took the production of the last to the Vienna Festival in 1975, along with Britten's Gloriana.

First, I identified the vocabulary used in the sentence: 1. 皮肉にも (hironi ni mo) - Ironically 2. かつては (katsute wa) - Once 3. 私達 (watashitachi) - We/us 4. 純愛 (jun'ai) - Pure love 5. 探し求める (sagashi motomeru) - Search for, seek 6. 時 (toki) - Time, when 7. 不倫 (furin) - Affair, adultery 8. 頼った (tayotta) - Relied on Next, I analyzed the sentence structure and how these words and phrases are connected to convey the intended meaning. The sentence starts with \\"皮肉にも\\" (ironically) and \\"かつては\\" (once), setting the tone and time frame. The main subject of the sentence is \\"私達\\" (we), and the main action is searching for pure love: \\"純愛を探し求めるとき\\". The latter part of the sentence describes the action that was taken during the time of searching for pure love, which is \\"不倫に頼った\\" (relied on affairs). By combining these components together, I was able to come up with the translation \\"Ironically, it was once when we sought pure love that we relied on affairs.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hillary married Louise Mary Rose on 3 September 1953, soon after the ascent of Everest; he admitted he was terrified of proposing to her and relied on her mother to propose on his behalf. They had three children: Peter (born 1954), Sarah (born 1955) and Belinda (1959-1975). In 1975 while en route to join Hillary in the village of Phaphlu, where he was helping to build a hospital, Louise and Belinda were killed in a plane crash near Kathmandu airport shortly after take-off. In 1989 he married June Mulgrew, the widow of his close friend Peter Mulgrew, who died on Air New Zealand Flight 901 in 1979. His son Peter Hillary also became a climber, summiting Everest in 1990. In May 2002 Peter climbed Everest as part of a 50th anniversary celebration; Jamling Tenzing Norgay (son of Tenzing who had died in 1986) was also part of the expedition. Hillary's home for most of his life was a property on Remuera Road in Auckland City, where he enjoyed reading adventure and science fiction novels in his retirement. He also built a bach at Whites Beach, one of Auckland's west coast beaches in the former Waitakere City, between Anawhata and North Piha; a friend called it Hillary's place of solace, where he could escape media attention. The Hillary family has had a connection with the west coast of Auckland since 1925, when Louise's father built a bach at Anawhata. The family donated land at Whites Beach that is now crossed by trampers on the Hillary Trail, named for Edmund. Hillary said of the area: \\"That is the thing that international travel brings home to me - it's always good to be going home.

Therefore, an analysis of the statement and the logical connections between the components is required to determine if it logically follows that \\"a boy is eating steak.\\" First, let's break down the statement and examine each part: 1. \\"A boy\\": This refers to a male child. Without any specific age range given, it can be assumed that this refers to any male individual who would still be considered a child. 2. \\"In a striped shirt\\": This detail provides information about the boy's clothing, specifically that he is wearing a shirt with stripes. This descriptor pertains to his appearance and does not imply anything about his activities or actions. 3. \\"Straddling the sides\\": In this context, \\"straddling\\" means sitting or standing with one's legs wide apart on each side of an object. This action requires balance and potentially some strength in the legs. It also suggests that the boy is currently engaged in a physical activity. 4. \\"Of a playground bridge\\": This component of the statement introduces the location and specific object with which the boy is interacting. A playground bridge is typically found in a play area for children and serves as a connector between different parts of the play structure. The bridge may be made of various materials, including wood or metal, and could have different designs such as being suspended, stationary, or resembling a rope bridge. Now let's consider if the statement \\"a boy is eating steak\\" logically follows from the given information. Eating is an action that involves consuming food, while steak refers to a specific food item, typically a piece of meat from a cow. Given the details of the original statement, it is clear that the boy is engaged in a physical activity related to playing on a playground bridge. There is no mention or implication of him eating at all, let alone eating a specific food like steak. From the provided information, one could reach several conclusions about the boy: he is physically active, he has the strength and balance to straddle a playground bridge's sides, and he is dressed in a striped shirt. However, none of those conclusions or any combination of them logically implies that the boy is eating steak. In conclusion, based on the given statement, \\"A boy in a striped shirt straddling the sides of a playground bridge,\\" it does not logically follow that \\"a boy is eating steak.\\" There is no direct connection between the provided information and the statement about the boy eating steak, nor is there a logical implication that would lead to that conclusion from the initial statement."},{"prompt":"Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that was imprisoned in Stirling in 1694? Following the accession of James VII in 1685, Bruce gradually fell from favour, and was distrusted by the new regime. After the Revolution of 1688, and the accession of William of Orange as King, he was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers, and he refused to take up his seat in Parliament. As a staunch Episcopalian, Bruce was considered a potential Jacobite threat. In 1693 he was briefly imprisoned in Stirling Castle for refusing to appear before the Privy Council. He was incarcerated again at Stirling in 1694, and from 1696 in Edinburgh Castle. Bruce was expelled from parliament in 1702, his seat passing to his son John Bruce. Despite these imprisonments, he continued his architectural work, indeed the 1690s and 1700s were his most prolific years.

Brett Lawrie suspended 4 games after helmet ‘took a bad hop’ As for the rest of it, he wouldn’t change a thing. The Toronto Blue Jays third baseman was suspended for four games and fined an undisclosed amount on Wednesday, one day after a ninth inning tirade directed at umpire Bill Miller. A pair of questionable strike calls triggered a fiery protest from Lawrie, who spiked his helmet on to turf just as he was ejected. The helmet bounced up and struck Miller on the hip. Lawrie has appealed the decision and can continue playing until his hearing, which will likely take place next week. UPDATE (3 p.m.): Lawrie has dropped his appeal, and according to the Blue Jays, the 22-year-old has apologized to Miller. “The only thing I would change is maybe not throwing the helmet or any equipment toward the umpire because you can get an unlucky hop and have the kind of mess that’s going on right now,” Lawrie said. He also said he plans to apologize to Miller for the incident. Lawrie started Wednesday night’s game against the New York Yankees and received the loudest ovation of any Blue Jays player. Miller was the third base umpire for the contest, but despite the close proximity, he and Lawrie did not exchange words. “He’s an energetic player, we don’t want him to lose that energy and that passion for the game, that will to compete and do whatever he has in his power at the moment to make an impact on the game,” Blue Jays manager John Farrell said. “The only thing I regret is the helmet hitting him,” he said. “I never meant to do that and it shows ... it took a bad hop and hit him totally by accident.” Playing the hot corner, Lawrie can attest to the unpredictable nature of the Rogers Centre’s AstroTurf Grass 3D playing surface.

What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about a controversial event involving Brett Lawrie, a third baseman for the Toronto Blue Jays. Lawrie was suspended for four games and fined an undisclosed amount after directing a furious protest against umpire Bill Miller, in the ninth inning of a game. His outrage was sparked by a couple of contentious strike calls. In the height of his anger, Lawrie spiked his helmet onto the turf just as he was ejected from the game. Unfortunately, the helmet bounced off the ground and hit Miller on the hip. Despite the consequences of his actions, Lawrie announced that he would not change anything about his on-field conduct, except for the act of throwing his helmet or any other equipment towards an umpire. This, he noted, can cause unpredictable results that could lead to more complications, as was the case in this incident. Lawrie launched an appeal against his suspension and fine, allowing him to continue playing until his hearing. However, in a later update, it was reported that he withdrew the appeal. According to the Blue Jays, the 22-year-old player also offered an apology to Miller. This information came after Lawrie started a game against the New York Yankees, where he received the loudest cheers among his team's players. Despite being physically close to Miller, who was the third base umpire for that particular game, there were no exchanges between the two. The Blue Jays manager, John Farrell, made comments about Lawrie's conduct, stating they want him to maintain his energetic approach to the game and his will to compete. Farrell does not want this incident to affect Lawrie's passion and competitive spirit. Lawrie also stated he regretted that the helmet hit the umpire, insisting this was not his intention and that the object bounced unpredictably off the turf, resulting in its unfortunate contact with the umpire. Several questions were posed towards the end of the article, wondering if Lawrie should have been more remorseful concerning the incident. Toward the end, the author includes notable headlines and mentions of other sports incidents and achievements, possibly in relation to the incident, as well as a brief biography of the author themselves, Matt Brooks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the person that was affected by the foggy weather? is inside the article: In June 1911 Holst and his Morley College students gave the first performance since the seventeenth century of Purcell's The Fairy-Queen. The full score had been lost soon after Purcell's death in 1695, and had only recently been found. Twenty-eight Morley students copied out the complete vocal and orchestral parts. There were 1,500 pages of music and it took the students almost eighteen months to copy them out in their spare time. A concert performance of the work was given at The Old Vic, preceded by an introductory talk by Vaughan Williams. The Times praised Holst and his forces for \\"a most interesting and artistic performance of this very important work\\".After this success, Holst was disappointed the following year by the lukewarm reception of his choral work The Cloud Messenger. He again went travelling, accepting an invitation from H. Balfour Gardiner to join him and the brothers Clifford and Arnold Bax in Spain. During this holiday Clifford Bax introduced Holst to astrology, an interest that later inspired his suite The Planets. Holst cast his friends' horoscopes for the rest of his life and referred to astrology as his \\"pet vice\\".In 1913, St Paul's Girls' School opened a new music wing, and Holst composed St Paul's Suite for the occasion. The new building contained a sound-proof room, handsomely equipped, where he could work undisturbed. Holst and his family moved to a house in Brook Green, very close to the school. For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities. In 1917 they moved to a house in the centre of the town, where they stayed until 1925., can you guess it ? Answer:","completion":"The name of the person affected by the foggy weather is Holst.

Lee Meyers","completion":"Title: The Final Curtain Genre: Drama, Mystery, Thriller Plot: Act 1: The Unveiling Lee Meyers, a once-renowned Broadway director, finds himself facing a slump in his career. Pursuing a new passion, he decides to take on the challenge of directing a modern adaptation of a classic Greek tragedy. The play chosen is Sophocles' \\"Antigone,\\" a tale of family, loyalty, and the consequences of defying authority. Act 2: The Playwright's Curse As the rehearsals begin, strange things start happening around the theater. A mysterious playwright's journal, believed to belong to the original director of the very first production of \\"Antigone,\\" finds its way into Lee's hands. It contains secret notes and annotations, possessing an eerie presence that is inexplicable. The cast and crew brush it off as coincidence, but Lee becomes obsessed with deciphering the cryptic writings in the journal and incorporating them into his adaptation. Act 3: Souls Intertwined The lines between reality and fiction begin to blur as Lee starts to lose his grasp on the present. He becomes consumed by the story, identifying with the tragic characters like never before, and frequently conversing with his actors as if he were part of the play. The lead actor, Sarah Matthews, who plays Antigone, also begins to experience unnerving occurrences, as if a spirit or force were trying to warn her of impending doom. Act 4: The Dark Revelation As opening night approaches, Lee discovers the chilling truth about the journal: its original owner was cursed after accidentally disrupting an ancient ritual during the premiere of the first-ever performance of \\"Antigone.\\" The curse led to the tragic deaths of the original cast and director and has remained dormant ever since. However, Lee's reimagining of the play and in-depth study of the journal has reawakened the curse, and now its consequences loom over the cast and crew. Act 5: The Final Act Fearing for the safety of everyone involved in the play, Lee must confront his demons and reveal the truth about the curse to his cast and crew. Together, they must work out a way to stage the play without giving in to the forces of the dark curse. With time running out, Lee becomes a master of manipulation, guiding each character through their respective roles while slowly unraveling the secret to breaking the curse. As the night unfolds, the audience witnesses a mesmerizing and haunting performance that transcends reality, and the powerful force that overshadowed the production is finally put to rest. In the end, Lee finds redemption and closure, rediscovering his passion for theater in the most unlikely manner. The cast and crew unite as a family who had faced darkness and emerged stronger than ever, forming bonds that exceed the confines of the stage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Il serait également intéressant de connaître les raisons pour lesquelles les parents qui ont des enfants en âge refusent de participer à ce programme. Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"It would also be interesting to know the reasons why parents who have children of age refuse to participate in this program. The sentence you provided in French raises a thought-provoking topic about parents who choose not to involve their children in a particular program. The potential reasons for this choice can be varied and multifaceted. In order to analyze these reasons and understand the factors influencing the parents' decisions, one can consider the following aspects: 1. Lack of Information: Parents may not have enough information about the program to make an informed decision. Sometimes, lack of proper communication channels or ineffective marketing strategies from the program organizers can lead to misconceptions or confusion about the program's benefits, requirements, or objectives. 2. Time Constraints: Parents may feel that their children's schedule is already too full with other extracurricular activities, academic commitments, or family obligations. Consequently, they might prioritize other activities over the particular program in question. 3. Financial Reasons: Some parents may not be able to afford the cost of participation in the program. Financial constraints can be a major factor preventing a family from getting involved, as well as affecting their willingness to invest in additional resources, such as transportation or extra materials. 4. Program Content: Parents may not agree with the content or methodology of the program, or they might feel that it doesn't align with their personal values or beliefs. It is essential for parents to choose programs that reflect their expectations and educational goals for their children. 5. Personal Experiences: Parents who have had negative experiences with similar programs in the past may be more hesitant to enroll their children in such programs again. Additionally, negative feedback from friends, relatives, or other trusted sources can strongly influence a parent's decision-making process. 6. Accessibility: Parents may find it difficult to access the program due to geographical limitations, transportation issues, or scheduling conflicts. This could lead to their unwillingness to participate, especially if alternative options are more easily accessible. 7. Child's Interest: Parents might choose not to enroll their children in the program if they perceive it as not meeting the interests, talents, or needs of their child. The motivation, engagement, and commitment of children to a program are crucial aspects to the success and enjoyment of their participation. Understanding the reasons behind parents' decisions is crucial for program organizers and educators to improve engagement and overall satisfaction within the community they serve. By considering various factors in the context of a specific program, organizers can tailor their approach to better address parental concerns, minimize potential barriers, and ultimately foster a positive, constructive relationship between parents, children, and the program itself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He was friendly with members of Warsaw's young artistic and intellectual world, including Fontana, Józef Bohdan Zaleski and Stefan Witwicki. He was also attracted to the singing student Konstancja Gładkowska. In letters to Woyciechowski, he indicated which of his works, and even which of their passages, were influenced by his fascination with her; his letter of 15 May 1830 revealed that the slow movement (Larghetto) of his Piano Concerto No. 1 (in E minor) was secretly dedicated to her – \\"It should be like dreaming in beautiful springtime – by moonlight.\\" His final Conservatory report (July 1829) read: \\"Chopin F., third-year student, exceptional talent, musical genius.\\"\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"Who else was he known to associate with?\\" is found in the provided passage that gives information about the close relationships and interactions of the person in question, presumably Frederic Chopin, a renowned Polish composer and pianist.

Among them, Julian Fontana and Jan Matuszyński followed him to Paris and became a part of his circle of friends in the artistically bustling city. Chopin was also friendly with members of Warsaw's youthful artistic and intellectual scene. This includes the aforementioned Julian Fontana, but also two more individuals were named - Józef Bohdan Zaleski and Stefan Witwicki. These individuals most probably provided a nurturing and stimulating creative environment that further fueled Chopin’s musical brilliance. In addition, he was romantically interested in a singing student named Konstancja Gładkowska. The extent of his fascination with her drove him to mention her influence on his works in his letters to Tytus Woyciechowski. He revealed that parts of his music, including the Larghetto of his Piano Concerto No. 1, were secretly dedicated to her. This liaison depicted how not only were his friends influencing him but also elements of romantic passion played a significant role in shaping Chopin's music. The final note of Chopin's association mentioned in the passage is with his mentors or assessors at the Conservatory. Though not mentioned by name, these individuals recognized the exceptional talent in Chopin, even going as far as referring to him as a \\"musical genius\\". All in all, this diverse group of people Chopin was known to associate with contributed to his experiences, enhancing both his personal life and his musical output."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"What on earth could Poirot be doing in London! \\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Poirot was supposed to be here.\\" true?","completion":"Based on the premise \\"What on earth could Poirot be doing in London!,\\" it is difficult to definitively conclude whether the hypothesis \\"Poirot was supposed to be here\\" is true or false without more context. However, we can consider a few potential interpretations and implications of the premise that may lend support or contradict the hypothesis. 1. Surprise or confusion about Poirot's presence in London: The exclamation in the phrase implies a sense of surprise or confusion about Poirot being in London. It could suggest that the speaker did not expect Poirot to be in London, thus potentially contradicting the hypothesis that \\"Poirot was supposed to be here.\\" The speaker may have believed that Poirot's presence in London is unusual or unexpected due to a variety of possible reasons, such as Poirot having previously communicated that he would be elsewhere, or that his professional responsibilities typically do not require him to be in London. 2. Poirot's potential reasons for being in London: The use of the phrase \\"on earth\\" suggests that there might be numerous reasons for Poirot to be in London, some of which could support or undermine the hypothesis. Poirot might be in London to solve a mystery, attend a meeting, or visit friends or family. Alternatively, he could be in London purely by coincidence or as a result of miscommunication or an unexpected change of plans. Without information about Poirot's reasons for being in London, it is difficult to assess the truth of the hypothesis. 3. Context about Poirot's character and typical behaviors: Poirot is a fictional detective created by Agatha Christie, well-known for his meticulous and methodical approach to solving mysteries. As a detective, he is often required to travel to different locations depending on the case he is working on. Depending on the storyline, Poirot may or may not be \\"supposed\\" to be in London. Understanding the specific timeline and events surrounding Poirot's appearance in London may help determine whether the hypothesis holds true. 4. The speaker's knowledge and perspective: The truth of the hypothesis may also depend on the speaker's own knowledge and perspective about Poirot's schedule, intentions, or obligations. If the speaker has accurate information about Poirot's plans, their surprise or confusion might indicate that Poirot was not supposed to be in London. On the other hand, if the speaker's knowledge is limited or inaccurate, their reaction may not accurately reflect whether Poirot was supposed to be in London or not. In summary, without additional context, it is not possible to definitively determine the truth of the hypothesis \\"Poirot was supposed to be here\\" based on the premise \\"What on earth could Poirot be doing in London!\\" There are various potential interpretations and implications of the premise that could either support or contradict the hypothesis. Assessing the truth of the hypothesis would require more information about Poirot's reasons for being in London, the speaker's knowledge and perspective, or other contextual cues from the surrounding narrative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It could be a situation where he might be nervous, worried or agitated about something, which may have caused an increase in his level of disturbance or discomfort. Then, the character views or notices the presence of someone - a woman, most likely - and there is something about her demeanor, appearance, or perhaps just the fact of her presence, that has a soothing effect on him. It could be her kind eyes, her serene smile, or a soothing aura. She may be an important character -- a partner, a loved one, or just a kind friend -- and her mere presence provides an immediate comfort to the agitated person. This situation brings him a feeling of reassurance and peace. He feels relaxed and a decrease in his level of discomfort is noticeable after seeing her, thus, he calms down. Remember, the context can vary depending on the overall situation of the scene or text this sentence is taken from. It can be a romantic setting where the sight of the loved one brings peace to a lover's chaotic mind, or it could be a stress relieving scene where a friend's presence brings relief to an agitated mind.

Problem:Context: Checkpoint adaptation (entry into mitosis with damaged DNA) is a process that links arrest at the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint and cell death in cancer cells. It is not known, however, whether cells treated with the genotoxic agent, cisplatin, undergo checkpoint adaptation or if checkpoint adaptation is a major pathway leading to cell death or not. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between treatment with cisplatin and cytotoxicity in cancer cells.', 'Treatment of HT-29 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with cisplatin can induce cell death by one of two different mechanisms. Cells treated with a cytotoxic 30 μM amount of cisplatin died after undergoing checkpoint adaptation. Before dying, however, almost all treated cells were positive for histone γH2AX staining and contained high levels of cyclin B1. Rounded cells appeared that were positive for phospho-Ser10 histone H3, with low levels of phospho-Tyr15 cyclin-dependent kinase 1, high levels of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 activity, and checkpoint kinase 1 that was not phosphorylated on Ser345. These cells were in mitosis with damaged DNA. Strikingly, with 30 μM cisplatin, 81% of cells had entered mitosis before dying. By contrast, after treatment with 100 μM cisplatin, nearly all cells died but only 7% of cells had entered mitosis. Instead, these cells died by apoptosis; they were positive for annexin-V staining, contained cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 9 and cleaved PARP and did not contain Mcl-1. Answer: Our data demonstrate that cancer cells treated with cisplatin can undergo one of two modes of cell death depending upon concentration used. These findings suggest that checkpoint adaptation is likely a primary pathway in genotoxic cell death at pharmacological concentrations of cisplatin. Solution:","completion":"Question: What are the two modes of cell death that cancer cells treated with cisplatin can undergo depending on the concentration used, and do the findings suggest that checkpoint adaptation is likely a primary pathway in genotoxic cell death at pharmacological concentrations of cisplatin?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A few old men used to protect the city streets at night and they were not paid. About 300 years ago, London was starting to get bigger and more and more people began to live there. The city was very dirty and many people were poor. There were so many thieves who stole money in the streets that people stayed in their homes as much as possible. In 1750,Henry Fielding started to pay a group of people to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called \\"Bow Street Runners\\" because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 \\"Bow Street Runners\\", but London had become very big and needed more policemen. So in 1829 , the first Metropolitan(or London)Police Force was started with 3,000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. Until 1920 all the police in London were men. Today, London police are quite well paid and for the few police officers who still ride horses, the pay is even better than for the others.

People around the world are getting fatter. The study found that obesity has almost doubled since 1980. Majid Ezzati, who led the research team, says the results show that obesity, high blood pressure and high blood pressure are no longer just found in wealthy nations. These are now worldwide problems. The study appeared shows that in 2008, almost ten percent of men were obese. That was up from about five percent in 1980. That same year, almost eight percent of women were obese. By 2008, the rate of obesity among women was almost fourteen percent. Obesity is commonly measured by body mass index , or BMI. This is a measure of a person's weight in relation to height. A person with a BMI of twenty-five to twenty-nine is considered overweight. The World Health Organization defines obesity as a body mass index of thirty or more. Pacific island nations have an average BMI of around thirty-five -- the highest in the world. But the study found that the United States had the single highest average among wealthy countries. Men and women had an average BMI of over twenty-eight. New Zealand was next. Japan had the lowest, at about twenty-two for women and twenty-four for men. The report had some good news, however, about high blood pressure. The percentage of people with this major cause of heart attacks and strokes has fallen since 1980. Dr. Ezzati credits improved testing and treatment in wealthy countries. He says a decrease in the use of salt and unhealthful fats probably also helped. In the United States, new guidelines urge Americans to reduce salt, sugar and fatty meats and to eat more fish and whole grains. People are being urged to choose water over sugared drinks and to eat more fruits and vegetables. But whatever they eat, Americans are being urged to follow new advice from the government: eat less.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Herman Melville (August 1, 1819 - September 28, 1891) was an American novelist, short story writer, and poet of the American Renaissance period. His best known works include Typee (1846), a romantic account of his experiences in Polynesian life, and his whaling novel Moby-Dick (1851). His work was almost forgotten during his last 30 years. His writing draws on his experience at sea as a common sailor, exploration of literature and philosophy, and engagement in the contradictions of American society in a period of rapid change. In 1884, Mrs. Melville received a legacy, which enabled her to allow Melville a monthly sum of 25 to spend on books and prints. While Melville had his steady customs job, he no longer showed signs of depression, which recurred after the death of his second son. On 23 February 1886, Stanwix Melville died in San Francisco at age 36. Melville retired on 31 December 1885, after several of his wife's relatives died and left the couple more legacies which Mrs. Melville administered with skill and good fortune. In 1889 Melville became a member of the New York Society Library. As English readers, pursuing the vogue for sea stories represented by such writers as G. A. Henty, rediscovered Melville's novels in the late nineteenth century, the author had a modest revival of popularity in England, though not in the United States. He wrote a series of poems, with prose head notes, inspired by his early experiences at sea. He published them in two collections, each issued in a tiny edition of 25 copies for his relatives and friends. Of these, scholar Robert Milder calls John Marr and Other Poems (1888), \\"the finest of his late verse collections\\". The second privately printed volume is Timoleon (1891). Intrigued by one of these poems, Melville began to rework the headnote, expanding it first as a short story and eventually as a novella. He worked on it on and off for several years, but when he died in September 1891, the piece was unfinished. Also left unpublished were another volume of poetry, Weeds and Wildings, and a sketch, \\"Daniel Orme.\\" To Billy Budd, his widow added notes and edited it, but the manuscript was not discovered until 1919, by Raymond Weaver, his first biographer. He worked at transcribing and editing a full text, which he published in 1924 as Billy Budd, Sailor. It was an immediate critical success in England and soon one in the United States. The authoritative version was published in 1962, after two scholars studied the papers for several years. In 1951 it was adapted as a stage play on Broadway, and as an opera by English composer Benjamin Britten with assistance on the libretto by E. M. Forster. In 1961 Peter Ustinov released a movie based on the stage play and starring Terence Stamp.

He is best known for his roles as Simon Wicks in the popular BBC soap opera \\"EastEnders\\" and as PC Nick Rowan in the British drama series \\"Heartbeat.\\" Berry's music career began when he was approached by BBC Records to record a soundtrack for \\"EastEnders.\\" This led to the creation of \\"Every Loser Wins,\\" which was composed by Simon May, Stewart James and Bradley James. The song was first featured on \\"EastEnders\\" in a storyline involving Berry's character, Simon, and it quickly gained popularity among the show's fans. As a result, it was released as a single on October 6, 1986 and became an instant success. The song's lyrics revolve around the themes of perseverance, resilience, and overcoming adversity. The chorus \\"Every loser wins, once the dream begins\\" reflects the idea that even in the face of setbacks and failures, for the dreamers, there is always hope of eventual success. This uplifting message resonated with listeners and played a significant role in propelling the song to the top of the charts. \\"Every Loser Wins\\" debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number 67 and quickly climbed the rankings. After spending three weeks at the top position, it finally knocked Madonna's \\"True Blue\\" off the No. 1 spot, making it one of the fastest-rising singles of its time. The song eventually stayed on the chart for a total of 18 weeks, and it went on to become the third best-selling single in the UK for 1986. Moreover, it still holds a place in the hearts of many fans and remains one of the most memorable and iconic theme songs in British television soap history.

What is the title of this article: The alkali metal ions are small and mobile; their presence in glass allows a degree of electrical conductivity, especially in molten state or at high temperature. Their mobility decreases the chemical resistance of the glass, allowing leaching by water and facilitating corrosion. Alkaline earth ions, with their two positive charges and requirement for two non-bridging oxygen ions to compensate for their charge, are much less mobile themselves and also hinder diffusion of other ions, especially the alkalis. The most common commercial glasses contain both alkali and alkaline earth ions (usually sodium and calcium), for easier processing and satisfying corrosion resistance. Corrosion resistance of glass can be achieved by dealkalization, removal of the alkali ions from the glass surface by reaction with e.g. sulfur or fluorine compounds. Presence of alkaline metal ions has also detrimental effect to the loss tangent of the glass, and to its electrical resistance; glasses for electronics (sealing, vacuum tubes, lamps...) have to take this in account.

Accept constructive criticism.","completion":"Title: Trust Your Gut and Embrace Experimentation: The Path to Artistic Success Introduction In the ever-evolving world of artistic expression, it is crucial for artists to remain adaptable, open-minded, and receptive to new ideas. As creatives, trusting one's intuition and allowing room for experimentation is the cornerstone of unique projects that hold personal meaning. This article will break down the benefits of listening to one's gut, experimenting across styles and disciplines, drawing influences from life experiences, seeking feedback, and accepting constructive criticism on the journey towards artistic success. 1. Trusting Your Gut Instinct When Choosing Projects In a competitive industry where opportunities abound, trusting your gut instinct plays a significant role in choosing projects that align with your values, interests, and aspirations. Not only do artists have to navigate various collaborations, but they also need to assess what will inspire them and bring out their best work. By tapping into a deeper sense of intuition and purpose, artists can make confident decisions that propel their careers forward while remaining true to their unique creative identity. 2. Embracing Experimentation across Styles and Disciplines The beauty of artistic expression lies in its limitless possibilities. By venturing into unknown territories and embracing experimentation, artists can unlock new passions, ideas, and avenues for growth. Experimenting with different techniques, styles, or genres can help artists identify their strengths and weaknesses, opening up potential collaborations and professional opportunities. Moreover, it enables them to stretch their creative muscles and continually challenge themselves, which is essential for artistic progress. 3. Drawing Influence from Life Experiences Holistic inspiration is integral to the development and expression of an artist's work. It is important to look beyond the confines of artistic pursuits and draw influence from one's entire life - from significant events, relationships, experiences, to subtle everyday moments. By recognizing and analyzing these personal influences, artists can foster a deeper connection to their work and bring their unique perspectives to life through their creations. 4. Seeking Feedback and Encouraging Diverse Perspectives The unparalleled advantage of sharing one's work is the diverse range of perspectives and feedback it can garner. Inviting fellow creatives, mentors, or even strangers to evaluate your work allows for the identification of patterns, strengths, and weaknesses that may have been overlooked. Additionally, the incorporation of others' constructive criticism can help artists refine their techniques, ideas, and artistic visions, resulting in more profound and resonant work. 5. Accepting Constructive Criticism and Adapting with Grace Feedback is the lifeblood of improvement, and learning to accept constructive criticism with grace is a crucial skill for artists to hone. When faced with critique, it's essential to view it as an opportunity to grow and improve, rather than an attack on one's work or self-worth. By maintaining openness and adaptability, artists can fully embrace the valuable learning experiences that criticism offers and channel that energy into the betterment of their craft. Conclusion The path to artistic success is paved with trust in one's instincts, a willingness to experiment, and the courage to embrace new influences. By actively seeking feedback and learning from constructive criticism, artists can continue to grow, refine their work, and evolve their creative practice. Ultimately, trusting your gut and embracing the rich, multifaceted nature of artistry will catalyze a fulfilling and successful career in the creative industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the answer correctly answer the question Choose your answer from: 1). yes; 2). no;","completion":"1). yes; In 1877, the Tucson area experienced an increase in stagecoach robberies. During this period, the Wild West was notorious for its outlaws and bandits, who targeted stagecoaches as they were often used to transport valuable goods such as gold, payroll, and mail. Despite the presence of law enforcement and vigilantism, these crimes remained relatively frequent due to the vast and often remote nature of the region. Stagecoach robberies in the Tucson area were not an isolated occurrence but rather were part of a larger trend across the Southwestern United States. The influx of settlers, miners, and the expanding railroad system led to the growth of the population and presented ample opportunities for bandits to capitalize on the increased wealth and commerce. One of the most notorious figures during this time was \\"Apache Kid,\\" a White Mountain Apache who first worked as a scout for the U.S. Army but then went on to become a wanted outlaw and stagecoach robber. Many other lawbreakers used the rugged and remote desert environment surrounding Tucson to elude capture and hide out. Another factor that contributed to the surge in stagecoach robberies in 1877 was the economic downturn caused by the Panic of 1873. During this period, the United States experienced a severe financial crisis that led to an economic depression lasting several years. Many desperate individuals turned to a life of crime to make ends meet, further contributing to the increase in robberies. The rise in crime during this time also led to the formation of criminal gangs that collaboratively executed their robberies. These groups often used violence and intimidation to overwhelm stagecoach drivers and guards, making getaways quicker and more successful. Some examples of these gangs include the Clanton Gang, the Dalton Gang, and the James-Younger Gang, all of which preyed on stagecoaches and trains during the era. As a response to the increased crime, local law enforcement, U.S. Marshals, and vigilante groups sought to maintain order and bring the criminals to justice. This cat-and-mouse game led to numerous standoffs and sometimes resulted in casualties on both sides. Eventually, the advent of faster and more secure forms of transportation, such as the railroad and armored cars, contributed to the decline in stagecoach robberies in the Tucson area and across the West. In conclusion, the Tucson area experienced a significant increase in stagecoach robberies in 1877 due to a variety of factors including population growth, economic despair, and the rise of organized criminal gangs. The increased crime led to a heightened response from law enforcement and vigilante groups, ultimately culminating in the eventual decline of the stagecoach robbery trend as technology progressed and new transportation methods rendered the crime less lucrative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court released its first four decisions in argued cases this term on Tuesday. They were all minor, but one was notable for being Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s Supreme Court debut and for prompting a testy concurrence from Justice Clarence Thomas. The case concerned whether federal trial-court rulings concerning the lawyer-client privilege may be appealed right away. Justice Sotomayor, with methodical reasoning and a formal writing style, said no. “Permitting parties to undertake successive, piecemeal appeals of all adverse attorney-client rulings,” she wrote, “would unduly delay the resolution of district court litigation and needlessly burden the courts of appeals.” Justice Sotomayor said that result was dictated by sound policy and was consistent with a law governing appeals. The decision was unanimous, but Justice Clarence Thomas declined to join the part of Justice Sotomayor’s opinion discussing why the cost of allowing immediate appeals outweighs the possibility that candid communications between lawyers and their clients might be chilled. In a concurrence, Justice Thomas took a swipe at his new colleague, saying she had “with a sweep of the court’s pen” substituted “value judgments” and “what the court thinks is a good idea” for the text of a federal law.

Indigenous peoples of the Americas Over the course of thousands of years, American indigenous peoples domesticated, bred and cultivated a large array of plant species. These species now constitute 50–60% of all crops in cultivation worldwide. In certain cases, the indigenous peoples developed entirely new species and strains through artificial selection, as was the case in the domestication and breeding of maize from wild teosinte grasses in the valleys of southern Mexico. Numerous such agricultural products retain their native names in the English and Spanish lexicons. Q: How were new species and strains of crops developed?","completion":"The development of new species and strains of crops by the indigenous peoples of the Americas was a result of a complex process of domestication, selective breeding, and cultivation that took place over the course of several millennia. These practices allowed them to harness the genetic potential of native plants, turning them into more productive and beneficial food sources. The process can be broken down into several stages: 1. Identification and collection of wild plants: The first step in developing new species and strains was identifying and collecting plant species with specific desirable characteristics, such as taste, size, yield potential, and resistance to diseases or pests. This was achieved through experimentation, observation, and knowledge exchange among different communities and groups. 2. Domestication: Once the potential candidate plants with desired traits were identified, they were domesticated, meaning they were grown and managed by humans for their benefit. This process involved nurturing the growth of these plants to ensure they thrived in their new environment and could be propagated successfully. Domestication often led to genetic changes in plants, making them more suited to human needs as they adapted to their new environments and human-driven selection pressures. 3. Selective breeding: Indigenous peoples actively practiced selective breeding, which involved choosing specific plants with the best characteristics and allowing them to reproduce while discarding those with less desirable traits. Over generations, this process resulted in plants that were better suited for agriculture, had higher yields, improved taste, or possessed other desirable characteristics. In some cases, this led to the development of entirely new species, as was seen with the transformation of wild teosinte grasses into modern maize. 4. Genetic diversity and local adaptation: Indigenous farmers also maintained a high level of genetic diversity in their crops by growing multiple strains or varieties that were well adapted to specific environmental conditions or had unique traits. This approach allowed crops to be more resilient to diseases, pests, and environmental challenges, as well as meeting different cultural preferences or nutritional needs. 5. Knowledge transmission and exchange: The success of these agricultural practices was largely dependent on the sharing of knowledge and techniques among different indigenous communities and across generations. Through this exchange, communities were able to learn from each other and improve upon their own agricultural practices, leading to more efficient crop management, plant breeding, and domestication techniques. 6. Sustainable farming practices: Indigenous peoples used various sustainable farming methods to support the cultivation and improvement of their crops. These practices included intercropping (growing multiple crops together), crop rotation, and agroforestry (integrating trees and shrubs with crops), as well as methods to conserve soil fertility and manage water resources efficiently. These sustainable practices further contributed to the development and success of new plant species and strains. The development of new species and strains of crops by the indigenous peoples of the Americas is an excellent case study of how traditional knowledge, close observation of nature, experimentation, and sustainable practices can lead to significant advancements in agricultural productivity, biodiversity, and food security. Today, these indigenous crops form the basis of many modern agricultural systems, contributing significantly to global food production and showcasing the value of indigenous knowledge and practices in agriculture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Andrew Luck and the Colts' offense drove 59 yards on their first offensive possession, with the drive ending on a turnover after the Colts failed to convert a fourth down. On the first play of the Ravens' offensive possession, Steve Smith fumbled the ball, which was then recovered by Montori Hughes of the Colts. The Colts settled for a 38-yard field goal by Adam Vinatieri, giving then an early 3-0 lead. A muffed punt return by Jacoby Jones resulted in a second Ravens' turnover, however, on the ensuing Colts' drive, Haloti Ngata intercepted Luck, their first turnover of the game. After a stalled Ravens' drive early in the second quarter, the Colts drove 70-yards in 20 plays, though they again settled for a Vinatieri. The Ravens responded, scoring on a 52-yard field goal from Justin Tucker as time expired, cutting the Colts' lead to 6-3 at halftime. The Ravens opened the second half on offense and committed their third turnover on a Joe Flacco interception by Vontae Davis. The Colts' took advantage of the turnover, by scoring their first touchdown on a Luck touchdown pass from Dwayne Allen, giving them a 13-3 lead.

Sir Richard Steele was born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1672 and passed away in Carmarthen, Wales, in 1729. He was a prominent figure in the literary and theatrical worlds of the late 17th and early 18th centuries. In addition to being a playwright, Steele was also an essayist, journalist, and politician. \\"The Conscious Lovers,\\" written in 1722, is a sentimental comedy that examines the development of genuine love and moral growth between its protagonists, Bevil Jr. and Indiana. The play highlights the importance of conscious decision-making in relationships and criticizes superficial attractions. It showcases Steele's talent as a playwright and his ability to address serious social issues with a comedic touch. Steele founded the \\"Tatler,\\" the \\"Spectator,\\" and the \\"Guardian,\\" which were all periodicals designed to entertain, inform, and educate the general public. These publications played a crucial role in shaping the middle-class culture of 18th-century Britain. They fostered a sense of sociability and promoted polite conversation, moral improvement, and critical thinking. The \\"Tatler,\\" founded in 1709, was the first of these periodicals and marked the beginning of the 18th-century literary journalism. Initially, it was published thrice weekly, with each issue covering a variety of topics, including politics, literature, and social etiquette. Steele used the pen name 'Isaac Bickerstaff' to write most of the articles; however, he also collaborated with his close friend and fellow author, Joseph Addison. In 1711, Steele and Addison established the \\"Spectator,\\" which achieved even greater success and fame than the \\"Tatler.\\" The \\"Spectator\\" was a daily publication that continued the tradition of discussing politics, literature, and social manners. It introduced fictional characters, such as Mr. Spectator and the Spectator Club, which allowed Steele and Addison to present different perspectives and engage with a broad range of issues concerning 18th-century society. Finally, in 1713, Steele founded the \\"Guardian\\" to further promote the ideals of politeness, moral virtue, and reason. Published daily, the \\"Guardian\\" continued the work of its predecessors but also employed additional writers, including Alexander Pope and John Gay. In conclusion, Sir Richard Steele was a prolific English playwright and literary figure who authored \\"The Conscious Lovers\\" and founded the \\"Tatler,\\" the \\"Spectator,\\" and the \\"Guardian.\\" Through his plays and periodicals, Steele significantly influenced the culture of 18th-century Britain and championed the values of moral decency, politeness, and critical thinking."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Byrds also recorded a version of the song that they released in the same year as their first single on Columbia Records, reaching number 1 on both the Billboard Hot 100 chart and the UK Singles Chart, as well as being the title track of their debut album, Mr. Tambourine Man. The Byrds' recording of the song was influential in popularizing the musical subgenres of folk rock and jangle pop, leading many contemporary bands to mimic its fusion of jangly guitars and intellectual lyrics in the wake of the single's success. William Ruhlmann, writing for the AllMusic Web site, has suggested the following interpretation of the song's lyrics: \\"The time seems to be early morning following a night when the narrator has not slept. Still unable to sleep, though amazed by his weariness, he is available and open to Mr. Tambourine Man's song, and says he will follow him. In the course of four verses studded with internal rhymes, he expounds on this situation, his meaning often heavily embroidered with imagery, though the desire to be freed by the tambourine man's song remains clear.\\" While there has been speculation that the song is about drugs such as LSD or marijuana, particularly with lines such as \\"take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship\\" and \\"the smoke rings of my mind\\", Dylan has always denied the song is about drugs. Though he was using marijuana at the time the song was written, Dylan was not introduced to LSD until a few months later. Other commentators have interpreted the song as a call to the singer's spirit or muse, or the singer's search for transcendence. In particular, biographer John Hinchey has suggested in his book Like a Complete Unknown that the singer is praying to his muse for inspiration; Hinchey notes that ironically the song itself is evidence the muse has already provided the sought-after inspiration. Mr. Tambourine Man has also been interpreted as a symbol for Jesus Christ and for the Pied Piper of Hamelin. The song may also reference gospel music, with Mr. Tambourine Man being the bringer of religious salvation. Dylan has cited the influence of Federico Fellini's movie La Strada on the song, while other commentators have found echoes of the poetry of Arthur Rimbaud. Author Howard Sounes has identified the lyrics \\"in the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you\\" as having been taken from a Lord Buckley recording. Bruce Langhorne, who performs guitar on the track, has been cited by Dylan as the inspiration for the tambourine man image in the song. Langhorne used to play a giant, four-inch-deep \\"tambourine\\" (actually a Turkish frame drum), and had brought the instrument to a previous Dylan recording session.

Early in 1277, before the main royal army had been mustered, Edward deployed, in south and mid-Wales, a mixture of forces comprising paid troops, some of the marcher lords' retainers and knights of the royal household. They met with considerable success as many of the native Welsh rulers, resentful of Llywelyn's overlordship, surrendered and joined the English. In July 1277, Edward launched a punitive expedition into North Wales with his own army of 15,500 — of whom 9,000 were Welshmen from the south — raised through a traditional feudal summons. From Chester the army marched into Gwynedd, camping first at Flint and then Rhuddlan and Deganwy, most likely causing significant damage to the areas it advanced through. A fleet from the Cinque ports provided naval support. Llywelyn soon realised his position was hopeless and quickly surrendered. The campaign never came to a major battle. However, Edward decided to negotiate a settlement rather than attempt total conquest. It may be that he was running short of men and supplies by November 1277 and, in any case, complete conquest of Llywelyn's territories had not been his objective.

In the past, it was designed to serve this broader region. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Victoria was named after a queen","completion":"While the information provided in the text is primarily about the ABC Western Victoria radio station, the station does serve the Western Victoria region, which leads to discussing the origin of Victoria's name. Yes, the next sentence, \\"Victoria was named after a queen,\\" does follow, given the preceding text, though indirectly. To provide a more detailed and long answer, let's delve more into the history of Victoria: The region of Victoria, Australia, was named in honor of Queen Victoria, who ruled the United Kingdom from 1837 until her death in 1901. Queen Victoria was the reigning monarch at the time of the establishment of the separate colony of Victoria in 1851, which eventually became a state when the six Australian colonies federated in 1901 to form the Commonwealth of Australia. The naming of the region served as a means to pay tribute to Queen Victoria's role in promoting Britain's interests and expanding its empire during her reign, which was a time of significant economic, industrial, and territorial growth. Regarding the ABC Western Victoria radio station, it is crucial to highlight its purpose and reach within the Wimmera region and beyond. The radio station is part of ABC Local Radio, a network of publicly funded local radio stations across Australia operated by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). The Wimmera region is an area in the western part of Victoria, which is defined by its geographical, cultural, and economic characteristics, and the ABC Western Victoria station serves this specific region. The primary transmitter for ABC Western Victoria, located in Horsham, broadcasts on 594 kHz AM. The signal can be received over most of western Victoria, extending well beyond the Wimmera region. This fact highlights the significance of the radio station in providing information, news, and entertainment services for a broader audience. In conclusion, while the connection between the ABC Western Victoria radio station's service area and the naming of the region after Queen Victoria might seem tangential, it is reasonable to mention the historical context of the region's name. This context helps to create a comprehensive understanding of the area served by the radio station, allowing for the sentence, \\"Victoria was named after a queen,\\" to follow the provided information from the original text."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A representative for Sam Smith acknowledged the similarity between the two songs, stating that the likeness was a complete coincidence. All parties involved in the matter came to an immediate and amicable agreement. However, Petty and Lynne will not be considered Grammy nominees or recipients if \\"Stay With Me\\" wins an award. Instead, they will be given certificates to honor their participation in the work as writers of sampled or interpolated work.

Question: Where is Liz stopping for a drink? Movie title: Whore Movie plot: Liz (Russell) is a Los Angeles prostitute the audience first sees attempting to get a customer on a busy downtown street near a tunnel. She addresses the audience directly on her life and problems throughout the film. When a van stops by, she gives it the brush off, recalling the last time she serviced a man in a van: it turned out there were several other men in the van, who gang-raped her and left her for dead. A passer-by (Jack Nance) helps her to the hospital, and even pays her bill there. She sends him a thank you note. Liz isn't merely attempting to get a customer, however: she is attempting to escape her pimp, Blake (Benjamin Mouton). Blake is a well-dressed, businesslike and extremely controlling man who catches up with her at a convenience store. He demands money, and Liz has no choice but to agree though she gives him the finger as he leaves. As Liz stops off at a strip club for a drink, she explains how she ended up as she did: she was a small town girl, who married a violent drunk named Charlie (Frank Smith). Though they have a child together, she can no longer take it and leaves him, taking her son with her, as he's sleeping it off. She takes a job on the graveyard shift at a diner, and when a customer offers her more money to have sex with him, she decides, given her rather low pay, to take it. She does this independently for a time until she meets Blake, who takes her to LA. Though Blake does do some things for her (including getting her tattooed), he is ultimately as cruel as her husband, so she decides to escape from him. A local homeless person/street performer named Rasta (Antonio Fargas) decides to treat Liz to a movie. Though Rasta is a bit scary (his act involves walking on broken glass), Liz agrees. At this point the scenes of Liz and Rasta at the movie are intercut with Blake explaining his life to the audience, giving the impression that Liz and Rasta are watching Blake's soliloquy.

A:","completion":"In the movie titled \\"Whore\\", the character Liz, played by Theresa Russell, stops for a drink at a strip club. The story revolves around Liz trying to escape her life as a prostitute in Los Angeles and her controlling pimp, Blake (played by Benjamin Mouton). Upon stopping at the strip club, Liz shares her backstory with the audience. She explains that she was a small-town girl who married a violent and alcoholic man named Charlie (played by Frank Smith). After having a child together and unable to bear Charlie's abuse any longer, Liz leaves him and takes her son with her while Charlie is passed out drunk. In an attempt to make a living, Liz starts working the graveyard shift at a diner, where she eventually agrees to have sex with a customer for extra money. She continues engaging in prostitution independently until she meets Blake, who brings her to LA. Despite the seemingly helpful things Blake does (such as getting her tattooed), he ultimately turns out to be as cruel as her husband, prompting Liz to decide to escape from him. During the film, Liz befriends a local homeless person and street performer named Rasta (played by Antonio Fargas), who invites her to watch a movie. Rasta's act of walking on broken glass might seem scary, but Liz agrees to join him anyway. The movie then intercuts scenes of Liz and Rasta at the theater with Blake's soliloquy as if they were watching his story unfold on the screen. Throughout the movie, it's evident that Liz deeply loves her son, whom she had to leave behind in her previous life. The struggle to break free from the controlling influences of Charlie and Blake serve as the central plot of the film \\"Whore\\".

You must generate a detailed and long answer. How does this story end? (CNN) -- The fog has been lifted. There is no serious doubt left that Russia is \\"now directly involved in the fighting\\" in Ukraine, as Geoffrey Pyatt, U.S. Ambassador in Ukraine has said on Twitter. \\"Russian supplied tanks, armored vehicles, artillery and multiple rocket launchers have been insufficient to defeat Ukraine' armed forces. So now an increasing number of Russian troops are intervening directly in fighting on Ukrainian territory. Russia has also sent its newest air defense systems including the SA-22 into eastern Ukraine,\\" he wrote. This is the step from proxy war to war. It is also probably the end of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's attempts to prevent the worst through diplomacy. She spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin more than 30 times this year on the phone, much more often than any other Western leader. Germany has taken the lead in the crisis because it has become a central player in","completion":"European politics and has a vested interest in maintaining a stable relationship with Russia. With deep economic ties between the two nations, both governments have been cautious in their approach towards each other. However, as the situation in Ukraine escalates, it becomes increasingly difficult for Merkel to maintain a neutral stance. As the most powerful leader in Europe, her diplomatic efforts are crucial for the evolution of the conflict. The increasing presence of Russian troops in Ukraine forces the European Union and the United States to take a stronger stance against Russia. The first step includes imposing harsher economic sanctions that target vital assets and individuals close to Putin. This move could potentially weaken the Russian economy and force the government to reconsider its military intervention in Ukraine. However, the sanctions might not be enough, and the conflict could escalate into a larger-scale war. Such a scenario would situate European nations, as well as the United States, against Russia. These countries would provide military assistance to Ukraine, including weapons, ammunition, and possibly troops. At the same time, the Ukrainian army would be trained and bolstered by NATO forces to withstand the Russian onslaught. As the fighting intensifies, the human toll of the conflict would likely skyrocket. Thousands of soldiers from both sides would lose their lives, and the number of civilian casualties would become an international humanitarian crisis. As countries all over the world witness the devastation, the pressure on international powers to find a peaceful resolution would mount. Ultimately, diplomatic efforts would play a critical role in reaching an agreement between Russia, Ukraine, and other Western powers. A round of peace negotiations would take place in a neutral country with the objective of carving out a solution that would see the end of military hostilities and address the political grievances of the involved parties. The resulting peace treaty would include provisions that recognize Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as guaranteeing the rights of the Russian-speaking minority in the east. Additionally, it would require Russia to withdraw its troops from Ukrainian soil and offer compensation for the damages caused by its military actions. In return, Ukraine would agree to remain neutral in the ongoing power struggle between Russia and the West, holding off on NATO membership and maintaining a balanced economic and political relationship with both sides. New Ukrainian leadership, supported by both Russian and Western governments, would work on establishing a functional and inclusive government that reflects the diverse ethnic background and political preferences of their population. Ukraine would gradually start rebuilding, with financial and political support from the international community. Foreign aid would help in the reconstruction efforts, restoring infrastructure, and fostering economic growth. Moreover, steps would be taken towards ensuring transparency and reducing corruption within the Ukrainian government, allowing the country to enjoy political stability and prosperity. In the long-term aftermath, the relationship between Russia, Europe, and the United States would remain tense. While the peace treaty would ease immediate tensions, the mistrust and animosity developed during the crisis would take years, if not decades, to overcome. The incident would serve as a turning point for European nations - especially Germany - to reconsider their dependency on Russian resources, prompting the diversification of energy sources and a potential reevaluation of military capabilities within NATO. In the end, the story of Russia's direct involvement in the Ukrainian crisis would result in a temporary shifting of world politics and a fragile peace. The resolution of the conflict serves as a cautionary tale to countries all across the globe - forcing them to reevaluate their priorities and navigate their geopolitical challenges with a renewed focus on cooperation and diplomacy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a goal: How to make instant pudding. Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of making instant pudding, I would follow this step-by-step process: 1. Choose the flavor: First, select the desired flavor of instant pudding mix available in the market, such as vanilla, chocolate, or butterscotch. 2. Gather the ingredients and utensils: To make instant pudding, you will primarily need the instant pudding mix and cold milk. The quantity of milk you will need depends on the serving size mentioned on the pudding mix package. Additionally, you will require a whisk or an electric mixer for mixing, along with a large bowl. 3. Pour the pudding mix into the bowl: Open the instant pudding mix package and pour its contents into the large bowl. 4. Measure the milk: Use a measuring cup to measure the required amount of cold milk as specified on the package instructions. 5. Combine the milk with the pudding mix: Slowly pour the cold milk into the bowl containing the pudding mix while continuously stirring the mixture to ensure a smooth consistency. This step helps to prevent the formation of lumps in the pudding. 6. Mix thoroughly: Use a whisk or an electric mixer to mix the pudding and milk together until the mixture is smooth, thick, and well-combined. Typically, it takes about 2-3 minutes for this process. 7. Let the pudding thicken: Allow the pudding to sit undisturbed at room temperature for about 5 minutes. During this time, it will thicken further, achieving a more desirable consistency. 8. Refrigerate the pudding (optional): For those who prefer a chilled pudding, cover the bowl with plastic wrap or transfer the pudding into individual serving dishes, and then refrigerate it for about 30 minutes to an hour before serving. This process makes sense in accomplishing the goal because it provides clear, simple, and efficient steps to follow when making instant pudding. By adhering to these instructions and the recommended serving sizes on the instant pudding mix package, you can easily achieve a uniformly textured and delicious dessert."},{"prompt":"I’ve learnt a great amount throughout this studio, first and foremost I was taught: how the art world functions, how specific galleries such as Gertrude St Contemporary run and how artists earn a living.

One such group adopting this technology at a faster rate is the Britons over 60 years old. According to recent data from Barclaycard, this age group is the fastest-growing demographic embracing contactless card payments. (Step 1: Present the main topic of the article, which is the popularity of contactless card payments among Britons over 60.) The Shift to Contactless Payments: The use of contactless card payments has soared in recent years, mainly due to the convenience and speed associated with the technology. Shopping experiences have become more seamless and less time-consuming with the simple tap-and-go functionality of contactless payments. (Step 2: Explain the reasons behind the shift to contactless payments, focusing on convenience and speed.) Adoption of New Technologies Among Older Britons: Older adults are often perceived as hesitant to adopt new technologies. However, the reality is that many in this age group have been embracing digital systems and devices that suit their needs. The adoption of contactless card payments by Britons over 60 years old is a testament to this change. This can be attributed to the same reasons driving the broader population, including convenience, speed, and increased security features associated with contactless cards. (Step 3: Address the common perception of older adults being hesitant to adopt new technologies and mention how this age group has been embracing digital systems.) Banking Sector Response: Banks and financial institutions are taking note of this trend and have been focusing on ensuring their card offerings and digital services cater to all age groups. They have been streamlining their services to provide simpler and more user-friendly experiences. Moreover, they have been bolstering security elements to address potential concerns among senior customers. (Step 4: Mention how banks and financial institutions have responded to this trend, focusing on specific offerings and security measures.) The Benefits of Contactless Payments for the Elderly Population: Contactless card payments can be particularly beneficial for the elderly population. The growing use of this technology is a result of the many advantages it offers, such as: 1. Ease of use: Contactless payments eliminate the need to remember PINs or carry cash, making transactions easier for older adults who may have memory or mobility limitations. 2. Efficiency: Transactions with contactless cards are faster than traditional chip or magnetic stripe transactions, reducing wait times and frustration. 3. Security: Contactless technology provides a more secure payment option compared to cash, as lost or stolen cards can be quickly canceled and replaced. 4. Hygiene: Amid a global pandemic, contactless payments offer a safer and more hygienic alternative to handling cash or touching keypads. (Step 5: List the reasons and benefits for contactless card payments, especially for the elderly population.) Conclusion: The rising adoption of contactless card payments among Britons over 60 demonstrates that the advancements in technology are being embraced across a wide spectrum of age groups.

Then fall from the trees to the ground. As the leaves are falling, they have kinetic energy. While they are still attached to the trees they also have energy. When they are attached they are not in motion, so how can they have energy? Instead of kinetic energy, they have stored energy. This stored energy is called potential energy. An object has potential energy because of its position. For example, leaves on trees have potential energy because they could fall. They fall because of the pull of gravity. Potential energy can be transferred into motion. Motion can also be turned back into potential energy. Objects have potential energy due to their position.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose first opera was L'Orfeo? from the following article ? The Italian composer Claudio Monteverdi (1567–1643), in addition to a large output of church music and madrigals, wrote prolifically for the stage. His theatrical works were written between 1604 and 1643 and included ten operas, of which three—L'Orfeo (1607), Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (1640) and L'incoronazione di Poppea (1643)—have survived with their music and librettos intact. In the case of the other seven operas, the music has disappeared almost entirely, although some of the librettos exist. The loss of these works, written during a critical period of early opera history, has been much regretted by commentators and musicologists. Opera, as a musical and theatrical genre, began to emerge during the early part of Monteverdi's career, initially as a form of courtly entertainment. With other composers, he played a leading part in its development into the main form of public musical theatre. His first opera, L'Orfeo, written in 1607 for the Mantuan court, which employed him, was a major success. In the years that followed, at Mantua and in his later capacity as maestro di cappella (director of music) at St Mark's Basilica in Venice, Monteverdi continued to write theatrical music in various genres, including operas, dances, and intermedi (short musical interludes inserted into straight plays). Because in Monteverdi's times stage music was rarely thought to have much utility after its initial performance, much of this music vanished shortly after its creation. Most of the available information relating to the seven lost operas has been deduced from contemporary documents, including the many letters that Monteverdi wrote. These papers provide irrefutable evidence that four of these works—L'Arianna, Andromeda, Proserpina rapita and Le nozze d'Enea con Lavinia—were completed and performed in Monteverdi's lifetime, but of their music, only the famous lament from L'Arianna and a trio from Proserpina are known to have survived. The other three lost operas—Le nozze di Tetide, La finta pazza Licori and Armida... Answer:","completion":"The last name of the person whose first opera was L'Orfeo is Monteverdi. The Italian composer Claudio Monteverdi created L'Orfeo in 1607, which was a major success and marked the beginning of his contributions to the opera genre."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Having read the above passage, choose the right answer to the following question (choices are faster or slower ): When animals are moving in the cold they are faster or slower? Answer:","completion":"Slower To answer this question, let's clarify the relationship between sound speed, temperature, and the movement of animals in cold environments. Sound speed is affected by the temperature of the medium it is traveling through. In lower temperatures, the particles in a medium (such as air or water) have less kinetic energy, resulting in less movement and weaker particle-to-particle interactions. Consequently, sound waves travel more slowly through the medium. This principle applies to air, water, and other materials. However, the question refers to the movement of animals when exposed to cold temperatures, which is a separate but related concept. In cold environments, animals experience physiological and behavioral adaptations to conserve energy and survive. One of the most common responses is a reduction in general activity levels and metabolic rates. As an organism's activities decrease to preserve energy, it is likely that their movement speed would also decrease. The slowed metabolic rate may lead to reduced muscle movement and contractions, which would result in a slower overall speed of movement. Moreover, cold-blooded animals (ectotherms) rely on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature. In cold conditions, these animals are often less active and move more slowly due to the reduced metabolic rate and energy available for movement and other activities. Warm-blooded animals (endotherms) might also experience reduced movement since their bodies need to work harder to maintain their body temperature and keep physiological processes functioning normally in cold environments. Consuming energy to regulate body temperature might lead to a decrease in overall energy levels, potentially causing slowed movement. Therefore, when animals move in cold environments, they are generally slower due to the physiological and behavioral adaptations required for survival in low-temperature conditions. It is important to note that the relationship between sound speed and temperature mentioned in the passage only serves as a context for the question and does not directly influence the speed of animals in cold environments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Its powerful presence lays the groundwork for the rest of the drumline, so mastering the bass drum is crucial for any percussionist. This article aims to guide bass drum players through essential steps to develop proficiency and continually improve their skills. 1. Get the Correct Posture Correct posture is fundamental to effective bass drum playing. Proper ergonomics not only prevent injury but also enable better control and efficiency. Here are some essential tips for achieving the perfect posture: - Stand straight with your feet shoulder-width apart, balancing your weight evenly on both feet. - Bend your knees slightly to maintain stability and fluidity in your movement. - Keep your back straight and shoulders relaxed. - Hold your drumsticks with a relaxed grip, allowing for smooth, natural motion. 2. Hit the Drum Correctly Striking the drum head accurately is critical for consistent sound quality. Focus on the following aspects: - Ensure that your drumsticks make full contact with the drumhead, using the drumstick tips for precision and control. - Utilize the rebound effect following each strike, allowing the drumsticks to bounce back naturally for faster play. - Maintain a firm enough grip to retain control but without tensing your hand muscles. 3. Get the Rhythm Right Mastering rhythm is the key to a successful bass drum performance. To improve your rhythmic skills: - Practice counting out loud while playing to internalize beat patterns. - Utilize a metronome during practice sessions to develop steady tempo control. - Break down complex rhythms into simpler parts and gradually build up to accurate, full-speed execution. 4. Don't Practice \\"Above Your Head\\" Always practice at a level that matches your current skillset. Pushing yourself beyond your capabilities can lead to poor technique and ingrained bad habits. To avoid this: - Set realistic and achievable goals for each practice session. - Incrementally increase the difficulty of your practice material as you progress. - Focus on mastering one skill fully before moving on to the next. 5. Memorize Your Music Internalizing your music is essential for confident performance and seamless integration with the rest of the drumline. To perfect memorization: - Break down the music into smaller sections and focus on memorizing each part individually. - Visualize the sheet music in your mind, paying attention to each rhythm and dynamic aspect. - Repeatedly practice the music from memory to strengthen recall. 6. Practice with the Bassline Once confident with your own parts, practice within a bassline setting, as it will help: - Adapt to the interaction between various parts and tempos played by fellow drummers. - Hone listening skills and develop the ability to adjust your playing in real-time. - Strengthen ensemble communication and cohesiveness. 7. On the Practice Field: Playing Long Splits Long splits are challenging exercises for bass drummers, requiring concentration and stamina. To excel at these exercises: - Maintain proper posture and positioning throughout each practice run. - Develop consistency in your strokes and impacts for a uniform sound. - Prioritize breath control, as it reduces fatigue and supports sustained focus. Conclusion Mastering the bass drum is an ongoing process that requires dedication, patience, and practice. By committing to the essential steps outlined in this article, you can develop strong foundational skills, refine your technique, and continue to excel as a percussionist in an ensemble setting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

ROYAL SCANDAL BRITS FUME OVER TOPLESS PIX OF PRINCE'S GAL By ELLEN TUMPOSKY and HELEN KENNEDY Daily News Writers Thursday, May 27th 1999, 2:10AM LONDON The Brits were in a royal tizzy again yesterday after London's biggest tabloid printed a topless picture of princess-to-be Sophie Rhys-Jones, a commoner who is to marry Prince Edward in three weeks. What would have been another silly royal scandal a few years ago has become a national uproar in the wake of Princess Diana's death, which was widely blamed on Fleet Street's disregard for royal privacy. The hullabaloo was so enormous the tabloid Sun actually issued a groveling apology. The 11-year-old snapshot published in the Sun showed Rhys-Jones gallivanting with star radio disc jockey Chris Tarrant during a 1988 business trip to Spain. Taken by another deejay, Kara Noble, the saucy snap shows Tarrant yanking up a laughing Rhys-Jones' bikini top, exposing one breast. At the time, Rhys-Jones, a pretty blonde with a rambunctious past who now heads her own public relations firm, worked in promotions at Capital Radio, where Tarrant and Noble were on-air personalities. Rhys-Jones, whose June 19 wedding at Windsor Castle is much anticipated in Britain, leaked word that she felt \\"utterly betrayed\\" by the Sun and by Noble, who sold the photo for a reported 160,000. \\"This has ruined my engagement. This [wedding] was supposed to be the happiest day of my life,\\" Rhys-Jones told the Daily Mail. Her prince, she said, was \\"totally disgusted and livid.\\" The 34-year-old exec did not go to work yesterday, avoiding passing newsstands plastered with the screaming headline: \\"Sophie Topless!\\" Queen Elizabeth was said to be horrified. Buckingham Palace made a formal complaint yesterday to the Press Complaints Commission, calling the photo publication \\"premeditated cruelty\\" and \\"a gross invasion of privacy.\\" Rhys-Jones has waited six years for this wedding, through a lengthy courtship that fueled malicious speculation about Prince Edward's sexuality. Noble, who left Capital Radio in 1995 for rival Heart FM, was fired. The picture ran on page 3 of the Sun a space usually reserved for less posh topless women. Londoners lined up on Rhys-Jones' side, comparing Noble to the reviled heel James Hewitt, Diana's onetime lover who told all for money. \\"They haven't learned anything from Diana, have they,\\" said Sue Ray. \\"The woman hasn't even married Edward yet, and they already have parts of her anatomy in the paper.\\" \\"Leave Sophie alone,\\" Tarrant said on his radio show. \\"Haven't you learned anything from the death of Princess Diana?\\" The other tabs, not to be outdone, howled at the Sun's lack of propriety. \\"Shame on You,\\" blared one headline. \\"This Disgusting Betrayal,\\" yowled another. \\"How Many More Will They Smear?\\" demanded a third. Chastened, Sun editor David Yelland issued a statement saying, \\"We clearly upset Miss Rhys-Jones. It's clear to me that we have caused her great distress. I have therefore decided to apologize to her and to the palace.\\" He said he didn't expect to be invited to the wedding. MEMORABLE MOMENTS IN UNCOVERAGE OF FERGIE August 1997: Princess Diana made front-page news with this shipboard smooch with new love Dodi Fayed, weeks before the couple was killed in car crash.

In rare cases, parents, teachers, and administrators are also implicated. However, all efforts to improve the quality of education are doomed to fail if the system itself is not examined and understood to be the most significant impediment. After over six years in the making, THE WAR ON KIDS reveals that the problems with public education ultimately stem from the institution itself. Astonishingly all efforts at reform consistently avoid even considering this to be a possibility and the future for children and American democracy are at stake.In 95 minutes, THE WAR ON KIDS exposes the many ways the public school system has failed children and our future by robbing students of all freedoms due largely to irrational fears. Children are subjected to endure prison-like security, arbitrary punishments, and pharmacological abuse through the forced prescription of dangerous drugs. Even with these measures, schools not only fail to educate students, but the drive to teach has become secondary to the need to control children.THE WAR ON KIDS begins with the history of Zero Tolerance policy. In the 1990s, almost all schools began instituting guidelines that were originally designed to keep weapons and drugs off campus. Very quickly, school officials began to arbitrarily decide what should be considered a weapon and what should be considered a drug. Hundreds of situations followed where children were (and continue to be) suspended or expelled for possessing food knives, nail clippers, key chains, chicken strips, aspirin, and candy. Kindergarteners were even suspended for playing cops and robbers and using their fingers as guns.

Possible answers: having a good time, bad if they lost, getting bored Answer:","completion":"Ash can be described as someone who enjoys engaging in social and recreational activities, particularly the game of poker. Playing poker every Tuesday indicates that this activity holds significant importance as a regular part of Ash's routine. It suggests that Ash finds satisfaction in the strategic and mental aspects of the game, the social interactions with fellow players, and the thrilling nature of luck and chance. Having a good time is likely a primary motivation for Ash to participate in these weekly poker games. Poker's competitive nature can lead to a highly engaging experience, where players need to strategize, analyze their opponents' behavior, and make smart decisions to increase their chances of winning. Participating in an activity that requires mental agility and personal skills development could be highly enjoyable for Ash. However, it is also worth considering that losses are an inevitable part of any gambling-related activity. When Ash loses, feelings of disappointment or frustration may arise, but these emotions don't necessarily define the overall experience. It is entirely possible that, despite occasional losses, Ash's enthusiasm for the game stems from the camaraderie, thrill, and learning opportunities poker provides. On the other hand, if Ash experiences consistent losses or a lack of variety in the game over time, the possibility of getting bored can emerge. Even when a person enjoys a specific activity, repetitiveness and lack of novelty can lead to a decrease in interest and excitement. If Ash isn't able to maintain a balance between winning and losing, or if the social aspect of the poker games were to diminish, it might contribute to a decline in Ash's enjoyment of this weekly event. In conclusion, Ash could be described as someone who cherishes the excitement, social interaction, and intellectual challenge that a game of poker provides. Although occasional setbacks might lead to negative emotions, the overall experience of playing poker every Tuesday likely contributes to Ash having a good time with friends and engaging in a stimulating activity. The risk of boredom could arise if the game becomes too repetitive or loses its appeal due to other factors, but as long as Ash's enthusiasm and enjoyment remain intact, these weekly poker nights can continue serving as a highly-valued component of Ash's lifestyle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In today's digital age, the internet has revolutionized the way we shop, providing us with a vast array of options to choose from when it comes to buying anything from groceries to clothes, electronics, and even services. The convenience, accessibility, and speed that online shopping offers has made it an increasingly popular method of purchasing for people of all ages and backgrounds. One of the primary advantages of the internet is its ability to provide a platform for businesses to showcase their products and services to potential customers all over the world. This enables customers to access a wider range of options, making it more likely for them to find products or services that may not be available in their local area. In addition, shopping online saves time and effort as it allows consumers to browse and compare items from the comfort of their own homes––or even while on the go, thanks to mobile devices. They can efficiently scour through thousands of products within minutes, speedily compare prices and features, and ultimately make informed decisions about their purchases. This enables individuals to buy exactly what they want at the best possible price. Many online retailers also offer fast shipping options––sometimes with same-day delivery––which means that consumers do not have to wait for lengthy periods to receive their purchases. This is particularly useful when the items in question are urgently needed or when buying gifts for special occasions. Another major benefit of online shopping is the availability of discounts, sales, and promotions that are often exclusive to internet shoppers. These deals often come in the form of coupon codes, membership rewards, or loyalty programs, and allow consumers to take advantage of reduced prices or even free products and services. Access to these discounts and promotions can be regularly found on websites that specialize in tracking these deals, like Honey, RetailMeNot, and eBates. Moreover, the internet provides online shoppers with a wealth of information about products and services, thanks to customer reviews and ratings. This enables potential buyers to make more informed decisions by reading the experiences and opinions of other consumers who have already purchased and used the same products. This level of transparency is unique to the online shopping experience and invaluable to customers seeking truthful, unbiased information about the products they are considering. Additionally, online shopping provides a platform for niche markets and communities to gather, allowing customers with specific interests or needs to find products that cater directly to them. For example, specialty products like organic, vegan, or sustainable items are often more easily accessible online than in brick-and-mortar stores. Many stores also offer international shipping, making it even easier for customers to access unique and in-demand items from other countries. Despite the many advantages of online shopping, it is essential for customers to keep their personal information and financial details secure when making transactions on the internet. Utilizing encrypted, reputable payment processing services like PayPal, and double-checking the security of the website before entering sensitive information can help keep online shopping experiences safe and enjoyable. In conclusion, the internet offers fast and easy ways to order and purchase items from all around the world. The convenience, accessibility, and speed provided through online shopping make it an increasingly popular method of purchasing goods and services in today's digital age. As long as customers maintain awareness of best practices regarding online security, the potential benefits of online shopping far outweigh any disadvantages."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill Thursday that would protect from arbitrary dismissal the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The measure, backed by 10 Democrats and four Republicans, would codify Justice Department regulations that the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or a designee for \\"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.\\" The proposal would give the special counsel 10 days to challenge a dismissal in court. If a court determines the firing was not for \\"good cause,\\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation. While marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea. The legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller. Mueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign. Trump has said there was no collusion and repeatedly denounced the probe as a \\"witch hunt.\\" Despite his harsh criticism of the Special Counsel and the Justice Department, Trump has dismissed reports that he's privately talked about firing Mueller.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Daniel Barenboim (born 15 November 1942) is an Argentine-Israeli pianist and conductor who is a citizen of Argentina, Israel, Palestine, and Spain. He is the general music director of the Berlin State Opera, and the Staatskapelle Berlin; he previously served as Music Director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Orchestre de Paris and La Scala in Milan. Barenboim is known for his work with the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, a Seville-based orchestra of young Arab and Israeli musicians, and as a resolute critic of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. Barenboim has received many awards and prizes, including an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, France's Legion d'honneur both as a Commander and Grand Officier, and the German Grosses Bundesverdienstkreuz and Willy Brandt Award. In the beginning of his career, Barenboim concentrated on music of the classical era, as well as some romantic composers. He made his first recording in 1954. Notable classical recordings include the complete cycles of Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert's piano sonatas, and Mozart's piano concertos (in the latter, taking part as both soloist and conductor). Romantic recordings include Brahms's piano concertos (with John Barbirolli), Mendelssohn's Songs Without Words, and Chopin's nocturnes. Barenboim also recorded many chamber works, especially in collaboration with his first wife, Jacqueline du Pre, the violinist Itzhak Perlman, and the violinist and violist Pinchas Zukerman. Noted performances include: the complete Mozart violin sonatas (with Perlman), Brahms's violin sonatas (live concert with Perlman, previously in the studio with Zukerman), Beethoven's and Brahms's cello sonatas (with du Pre), Beethoven's and Tchaikovsky's piano trios (with du Pre and Zukerman), and Schubert's Trout Quintet (with du Pre, Perlman, Zukerman, and Zubin Mehta). Notable recordings as a conductor include: the complete symphonies of Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, Schubert and Schumann, the Da Ponte operas of Mozart, numerous operas by Wagner, including the complete Ring Cycle, and various concertos. Barenboim has written about his changing attitude to the music of Mahler; he has recorded Mahler's Fifth, Seventh and Ninth symphonies and Das Lied von der Erde. He has also performed and recorded the Concierto de Aranjuez by Rodrigo and Villa-Lobos guitar concerto with John Williams as the guitar soloist. By the late 1990s, Barenboim had widened his concert repertoire, performing works by baroque as well as twentieth-century classical composers. Examples include: J.S. Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier (which he has played since childhood) and Goldberg Variations, Albeniz's Iberia, and Debussy's Preludes. In addition, he turned to other musical genres, such as jazz, and the folk music of his birthplace, Argentina. He conducted the 2006 New Year's Eve concert in Buenos Aires, in which tangos were played. Barenboim has continued to perform and record chamber music, sometimes with members of the orchestras he has led. Some examples include the Quartet for the End of Time by Messiaen with members of the Orchestre de Paris during his tenure there, Richard Strauss with members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and Mozart's Clarinet Trio with members of the Berlin Staatskapelle. To mark Barenboim's 75th birthday, Deutsche Grammophon released a box set of 39 CDs of his solo recordings, and Sony Classical issued a box set of Barenboim's orchestral recordings on 43 CDs and three DVDs in 2017, Daniel Barenboim - A Retrospective.

Summarize the following: You don't have to go this road alone. Even if you don't make business partnerships with your loved ones (which can be a smart idea), you can lean on these people in the beginning (and later, when times are hard). Family and friends can offer powerful emotional support during your entrepreneurial journey. When you're stressed to your limit, this support can make the difference between pushing yourself to succeed and throwing into the well. Talk to your family and make sure they agree with your overall business plan, because you may, at times, have to tax your family's resources, time, money, health, and nerves. It's only fair that they know what they're getting in to. After becoming the boss in your business life, you may feel the temptation to become bossy at home, too. Don't act on this temptation. Keep your business concerns and your family concerns separate - make a rule that you won't discuss your business at dinner, for instance. Having sound knowledge of commercial law (especially contract law, tax law, and the legal requirements for running a small business) is a valuable skill for an entrepreneur to have. If possible, it's a great idea to familiarize yourself with these areas of law, before starting your business. If you're truly confident in these areas of law, you can save money, you, otherwise may have had to spend on legal counsel. You'll also spare yourself from serious headaches when trying to decipher complex business and tax documents. However, if you're not familiar with the law, get help. The money you spend on a lawyer can save you many times your initial investment, for instance, by preventing you from getting into damaging contracts. If you lose your health, you may lose it all. A healthy body, mind, and soul are vital to success as a business owner. Especially in the beginning, the hours may be very long and the work may be very hard. Still, you should always try to devote reasonable amounts of time to exercise, sleep, and \\"down-time.\\" Treat these things with the value they deserve - they keep you healthy and sane. Remember, if you're incapacitated, you can't run your business. Try to get income protection insurance, especially if your job is one with a risk of injury - a self-employed person cannot afford to lose income to this possibility. Do all things in moderation. Live life with a sense of balance, even when you're starting a business with barely a cent in the bank. Losing your perspective in life will make you poorer in the long run (emotionally - not necessarily financially), so it's never a risk worth taking. Never miss a night’s sleep. Don't work yourself to death. Always devote time to your family, your hobbies, and, of course, yourself. Your life should be a source of joy and passion - not just an opportunity to work. Additionally, you should never rely on drugs to aid your performance ability or to replace your regular healthy eating and exercise plans. This will, in the long run, break you down and cause you to make irrational, emotional decisions which are never a good thing in business.","completion":"Entrepreneurs should seek support from loved ones, maintain work-life balance, and ensure they understand relevant laws for running a business. Family and friends can provide emotional support during tough times, and establishing boundaries at home can help maintain a healthy work-life balance. Gaining knowledge of commercial law can save money and prevent legal issues, but if unfamiliar with it, seek legal counsel. Prioritize personal health and well-being, obtain income protection insurance if necessary, and avoid relying on drugs for performance.

We were driving in the right lane when, suddenly, a black car jumped out of a parking space right in front of us. My taxi driver stopped his car at once. The tire made a very loud noise, and at the very last moment our car stopped just one inch from the black of the other car. I was _ . But then I couldn't believe what happened next. The driver of the other car, the guy who almost caused a big accident, turned his head and started yelling at us. I couldn't believe it! But my taxi driver just smiled at the guy. So I asked, \\"Why did you just do that? This guy almost sent us to hospital. \\" This is when my taxi driver taught me what I now call \\"The Law of the Rubbish Truck . \\" He explained that many people are like rubbish trucks. They run around full of rubbish, full of anger and full of bad feelings. As their rubbish piles up, they look for a place to throw it away and sometimes they'll throw it at you. Don't take it personally. Just smile, wish them well, and move on. Don't take their rubbish and spread it to other people at work, at home or on the streets. Successful people never let rubbish trucks change their moods . Life is too short to wake up in the morning with regrets, so love those who love you and pray for those who don't.

Additionally, this review might prompt potential viewers to consider other options, exploring better-reviewed films that might provide a more satisfying cinematic experience. In conclusion, the tone and content of the review convey a negative opinion of the movie, highlighting the film's inability to successfully execute the fundamental elements that are essential for an engaging and well-crafted film.

Entailment, in linguistics and logic, refers to a relationship between statements where the truth of one statement requires the truth of another. In this case, the first statement \\"Yes, they can\\" is vague and lacks specific context, it could refer to any possible action or capability and doesn't necessarily concern changing a \\"corrupted system into something better\\". On the other hand, the second statement \\"Yes, they are able to change this corrupted system into something better\\" is quite specific, referencing the capability to change a corrupted system into a better one. While the first sentence can be interpreted in numerous ways depending on context, the second sentence is clearly about a specific change in a system. So, even though both sentences reflect the affirmative ability or capability to do something, the information provided in the second sentence far exceeds the information stated or implied in the first sentence.

Science/Tech. Answer:","completion":"4). Science/Tech. This text is about a dispute related to the teaching of evolution in biology classes in Cobb County, Georgia. It involves a decision by a school official to put stickers in textbooks, which has led to controversy and debate. The issue of teaching evolution in schools has long been a contentious topic in the United States, with various arguments and beliefs coming into play. The scientific community generally supports the teaching of evolution, as it is widely regarded as a central concept in the study of biology and life sciences. Evolutionary theory seeks to provide an explanation for the diversity and common ancestry of life on Earth, as well as the mechanisms by which species adapt, change, and diversify over time. However, some groups, particularly those with religious or conservative ideologies, question the validity or appropriateness of teaching evolution in schools. They often argue that the teaching of evolution may contradict their religious or moral beliefs, or that other concepts, such as intelligent design or creationism, should be taught alongside it to ensure a balanced perspective. The introduction of stickers in textbooks in the Cobb County case is likely an attempt to address these concerns by the school official(s). Such stickers could serve multiple purposes, such as providing disclaimers, offering alternative viewpoints, or even questioning the credibility of the material presented. However, such actions often spark further controversy and debate, as they may be seen as attempts to undermine scientific consensus or promote non-scientific perspectives in the context of education. Overall, this text represents an ongoing struggle between science and non-scientific beliefs in the educational system, particularly in relation to the teaching of evolution. The case in Cobb County, Georgia, serves as an example of how these disputes manifest in real-world situations, often involving decisions that affect the presentation of scientific knowledge in classrooms and the perspectives students are exposed to."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A high school senior's lawsuit against her mother and father for financial support and college tuition hit a hurdle Tuesday when a New Jersey judge denied the teenager's request for immediate financial assistance from the parents. Rachel Canning, 18, alleges in her lawsuit that her parents forced her out of their Lincoln Park, New Jersey home, and that she is unable to support herself financially. The lawsuit asks that her parents pay the remaining tuition for her last semester at her private high school, pay her current living and transportation expenses, commit to paying her college tuition and pay her legal fees for the suit she filed against her parents. Her parents say she left home because she didn't want to obey their rules. Judge Peter Bogaard denied the request for high school tuition and current living expenses at a hearing Tuesday in New Jersey State Superior Court. Another hearing will be held in April on other issues in the suit, including whether Canning left home of her own accord, the judge said. Canning, an honor student and cheerleader at Morris Catholic High School in Denville, says in court documents she had to leave her parents' home because of emotional and psychological mistreatment, alleging, among other things, that her mother called her \\"fat\\" and \\"porky\\" and that her father threatened to beat her. \\"I have been subjected to severe verbal and physical abuse by my mother and father,\\" Canning wrote in a court certification. \\"I am not willingly and voluntarily leaving a reasonable situation at home to make my own decisions. I had to leave to end the abuse.\\" Canning left her parents' home at the end of last October. After spending two nights at her boyfriend's home, she moved into the home of her friend in a nearby town, where she has been staying ever since, according to court documents written by the parents' attorney. Fair or outrageous? New Jersey teen sues her parents to pay up for college. Canning seeks a court's official declaration that she is unemancipated, meaning her parents would still be required to support her financially. She also is suing to reimburse her friend's parents, John and Amy Inglesino, for legal fees that they have been paying since the lawsuit was initiated, according to the suit. Canning's parents, Sean and Elizabeth Canning, claim that allegations of abuse are completely unfounded. \\"We were always her support team, cheering her on or defending her whenever she had a problem,\\" wrote Elizabeth Canning in a court certification. She claims that her daughter was never forced out of the family's home, but rather \\"took it upon herself to run away so that she could live her life without any parental supervision and without any rules.\\" Canning was suspended from school for truancy last October, according to court documents filed by her parents' attorney, Laurie Rush-Masuret. Her parents told the teen that she could no longer see her boyfriend, who was also suspended from school. Car and phone privileges were also taken away. Once she learned of the punishment, Canning cut school again and then decided to run away, her father said in court documents. Once she left home, her parents notified Morris Catholic High School that they would no longer pay for their daughter's tuition, the documents state. \\"They stopped paying my high school tuition to punish the school and me, and have redirected my college fund indicating their refusal to afford me an education,\\" Rachel Canning stated in court documents. The situation around the teen and her family initiated an investigation by New Jersey's Division of Child Protection and Permanency (DCPP), which received allegations that Rachel was being abused. The teen wrote in court documents that her school contacted the state agency. When DCPP staffers interviewed the teen, her parents, and her two younger sisters, they ultimately \\"determined that allegation of emotional abuse was unfounded,\\" a letter from DCPP states. Sean Canning, a retired Lincoln Park police chief and current business administrator for the town of Mount Olive, told CNN affiliate WCBS that he and his wife are \\"distraught.\\" \\"We're being sued by our child. I'm dumbfounded. So is my wife. So are my other daughters,\\" he said. \\"Living in our house, there's very few things. There's minor chores, there's curfews. When I say curfew, it's usually after 11 o'clock at night.\\" Sean Canning wrote in court documents that the Inglesinos, for taking in his daughter, had \\"enabled the situation to an absurd level. Under the guise of good intentions, they have arrogantly placed themselves in our stead and operated under the belief that their parenting style is superior to our own.\\" CNN's attempts to reach John or Amy Inglesino were unsuccessful. Stephanie Frangos Hagan, a family law attorney and New Jersey State Bar Association family law officer, said to her knowledge, a case like this is unprecedented. Though Canning is 18 years old, New Jersey law does not consider a person to be emancipated unless that person has left \\"the scope of his or her parents' authority,\\" according to Hagan. \\"A parent is not obligated to contribute to the support of an emancipated child,\\" said Hagan. \\"A child is emancipated when he or she is beyond the control of the parents. Is she truly beyond the scope of her parents' authority, as a result of her own voluntary acts? That's for the judge to decide.\\" \\"The argument (she) is making is that she didn't leave home voluntary. She's saying 'I was thrown out,'\\" Hagan said. Neither Rachel Canning nor her parents testified at Tuesday's hearing, but it saw a reunion between the daughter and her estranged parents, the first one in over four months. While Sean Canning was seen speaking to Rachel, Elizabeth was seen briefly weeping after being seated. The parents' attorney, Rush-Masuret, told CNN that Elizabeth Canning is too upset about the situation to even talk about it. She said the Cannings have told their daughter to come home, and she has refused. \\"To be clear, my clients never abandoned nor abused their child and they have asked her to come home. They simply sought to exert their own parental judgment and reasonable household rules which she is not willing to accept,\\" Rush-Masuret said in court Tuesday. Rachel Canning's attorney, Tanya N. Helfand, said Sean and Elizabeth Canning are being \\"negligent and irresponsible.\\" \\"Normal healthy parents want to help their children. They want their children to go to college. They want to help them with their difficulties,\\" Helfand said in court. \\"You may not get along wonderfully every single day with your teenager. That doesn't mean that you abandon them and you say, 'Guess what, you're on your own.'\\" Judge Bogaard denied the request for the last semester of high school tuition because the school said she could continue anyway, since she is an honor student. And Rachel Canning wrote in her court certification that \\"The peer ministers at Morris Catholic have decided to raise funds to pay ... tuition so I don't have to leave early.\\" As for why he denied the request for immediate financial assistance, the judge indicated he didn't see an emergency situation, and would make further decisions at the next hearing. The teen wrote in her court certification that she aspires to be a biomedical engineer. Her first choice for college is the University of Delaware, from which she has yet to hear back from regarding her admission decision. She said taking legal action was necessary to ensure that she is able to accomplish her future goals. \\"I am a very good student. I have no drug problems. I am a good athlete. I work at a job outside of school,\\" she wrote. \\"My parents simply will not help me any longer...(They) should be required to provide for my support and education until I can stand on my own two feet. In order to do this, I had to take legal action.\\" Girl costs father 80,000 with 'SUCK IT' Facebook post.

After winning a fight in a local mechanic's garage, Hector tries to get another fight but the entertainment is interrupted by Tito who scolds both Hector and the owner due to the fact that Tito could get into more trouble for illegal gambling fights as if smuggling illegals across the border isn't enough.

Sentence 2: In the 1970s Suzuki was one of the first buyers of Woolrich fashion in America . In 2006 he became a designer for Woolrich Woolen Mills in Japan . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","completion":"Although the two sentences share some similarities in content, they do not convey the same information. Let's break down each sentence first to better understand the differences: Sentence 1: - In the 1970s, Suzuki was one of the first buyers of Woolrich Mode in Japan. - Suzuki became a Designer for Woolrich Woolen Mills in America in 2006. Sentence 2: - In the 1970s, Suzuki was one of the first buyers of Woolrich fashion in America. - In 2006, he became a designer for Woolrich Woolen Mills in Japan. To compare the two sentences, we will analyze three key aspects: the time period, the role of Suzuki, and the locations. Time period: Both sentences mention the same two time periods: - In the 1970s - In 2006 In this aspect, the sentences are indeed similar. However, the roles and locations associated with these time periods differ in each sentence. Role of Suzuki: In Sentence 1, Suzuki is a buyer in the 1970s and a designer in 2006. In contrast, Sentence 2 has Suzuki as a buyer during the 1970s and a designer in 2006, which is the same. However, the associated location with these roles is different in each sentence. Location: In Sentence 1, Suzuki's role as a buyer is linked with Japan, and his role as a designer is connected to America. Conversely, in Sentence 2, Suzuki's role as a buyer is related to America, and his role as a designer is tied to Japan. In summary, although both sentences discuss Suzuki's roles as a buyer and a designer during the 1970s and in 2006, the locations of these roles are not the same in each sentence. Sentence 1 emphasizes Suzuki's connection with Japan in the 1970s and America in 2006, while Sentence 2 focuses on his connection to America in the 1970s and Japan in 2006. As such, these two sentences do not convey the same information due to differences in the locations associated with Suzuki's roles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Math Problem Solve 194*b - 31*b = -243*b + 93*b + 24414 for b.","completion":"Okay, little buddy! Let's solve the math problem step by step. We have the equation: 194b - 31b = -243b + 93b + 24414 First, we want to simplify both sides of the equation by combining the b's. On the left side, we combine 194b and -31b, which is: 194b - 31b = 163b On the right side, we combine -243b and 93b, which is: -243b + 93b = -150b So now our equation looks like this: 163b = -150b + 24414 Now, we want to move all b's to the left side and numbers to the right side. To do that, let's add 150b to both sides of the equation: 163b + 150b = 24414 This simplifies to: 313b = 24414 Now we want to find the value of b. So, we'll divide both sides by 313: b = 24414 / 313 When we do the division, we get: b = 78 So, the value of b is 78. Good job solving the problem with me!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Question: How many times has the film director of Marnie been nominated for an Oscar? Passage 1:Beck was born to the actress Cindy Robbins. She starred in such movies as Massacre at Central High, Roller Boogie, and . Among her notable television credits are General Hospital, Capitol (billed as Kimberly Beck-Hilton), Fantasy Island, Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (as one side of a Jekyll-and-Hyde character, whose counterpart was played by Trisha Noble), Westwind, The Brady Bunch, Dynasty, Lucas Tanner and Peyton Place (as the character Kim Schuster). As a child, she appeared in Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie and television commercials for such products as Mattel Toymakers Barbie and Chatty dolls. She had a very brief appearance on The Munsters as a transformed Eddie Munster after Eddie drank the rest of Grandpa's Texas Playgirl Potion in season 1, episode 33 entitled \\"Lily Munster, Girl Model\\". She starred on the pilot episode of Eight Is Enough as Nancy Bradford, the role that, in the series, went to Dianne Kay. She also had the role of Diane Porter in Rich Man, Poor Man Book II with Peter Strauss and appeared in a host of other well-received television miniseries productions. In 1968, she and her stepfather Tommy Leonetti, then working in Australia, recorded the single \\"Let's Take a Walk\\", released under the name of \\"Tommy Leonetti and his daughter Kim\\". It charted at #4 on the Melbourne charts. Passage 2:As a neuroendocrinologist, he has focused his research on issues of stress and neuronal degeneration, as well as on the possibilities of gene therapy strategies for protecting susceptible neurons from disease. Currently, he is working on gene transfer techniques to strengthen neurons against the disabling effects of glucocorticoids. Each year, Sapolsky spends time in Kenya studying a population of wild baboons in order to identify the sources of stress in their environment, and the relationship between personality and patterns of stress-related disease in these animals. More specifically, Sapolsky studies the cortisol levels between the alpha male and female and the subordinates to determine stress level. An early but still relevant example of his studies of olive baboons is to be found in his 1990 Scientific American article, \\"Stress in the Wild\\". He has also written about neurological impairment and the insanity defense within the American legal system. Passage 3:By 1968 regular air force military airlift squadrons were operating the Lockheed C-141 Starlifter, while reserve heavy airlift units still flew the obsolete Douglas C-124 Globemaster II. As the Globemaster was retired, Air Force Reserve formed associate units with the C-141. In this program reserve units flew and maintained aircraft owned by an associated regular unit. On 25 March 1968, the 730th moved to Norton Air Force Base without aircraft as an associate of the active duty 63d Military Airlift Wing. In 1973, Air Force Reserve inactivated its reserve associate groups and the squadron was assigned directly to the 445th Military Airlift Wing. Missions the 730th has flown included humanitarian relief, aeromedical flights, and airdrops of supplies and paratroopers.

Given the question: I have a new situation: High lake had a lot of fresh and salt water mixing, therefore presented layers of stratified water.The water was poor in nutrients.Low lake had no such problems and it was a very abundant and prolific fishing spot. But I can use this background: Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers. Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2] What is an answer for this question: Which lake had less anoxia? The answer is:","completion":"To answer the question \\"Which lake had less anoxia?\\", we need to analyze the information provided and consider the possible factors that could influence anoxia levels in both lakes. Step 1: Analyze the information about the lakes - High lake has a lot of fresh and saltwater mixing, leading to stratified water layers. It is also poor in nutrients. - Low lake has no such stratification issues and is abundant in fish due to nutrient-rich waters. Step 2: Consider the impact of stratification on anoxia From the background information, water stratification can lead to anoxia (low levels of dissolved oxygen) by preventing mixing between layers, thus limiting nutrient availability and primary production. Step 3: Compare the potential for anoxia in both lakes - High lake has stratification, which could lead to anoxia due to poor mixing between layers. The lake is also nutrient-poor, which may limit primary production. - Low lake has no stratification issues, allowing for better mixing between layers, and it is nutrient-rich. The better nutrient availability could support higher primary production and potentially lower the risk of anoxia. Step 4: Draw a conclusion Based on the information provided and the impact of stratification on anoxia, Low lake likely has less anoxia compared to High lake. This is due to the lack of stratification, which allows for better mixing between layers, and the lake's nutrient-rich waters that can support higher primary production, thus reducing the likelihood of anoxic conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: You are given a new situation: Two soccer players had a friendly match one on one after work. Paul had plenty of time to do his warm up properly, but John got there late and didn't warm up. Paul won the match. and a hint : Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ). Please answer this question : Which player had an increased hear rate before the match? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, Paul had an increased heart rate before the match. This is because Paul had plenty of time to do his warm-up properly, whereas John arrived late and did not warm up. A proper warm-up prepares the muscles for an activity by increasing blood flow and heart rate, reducing the chances of injuries. Since Paul warmed up, his heart rate was increased before the match, giving him a better physical preparation for the game."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: who serves as dante's guide through paradise?","completion":"In Dante Alighieri's epic poem, \\"The Divine Comedy,\\" we follow the journey of Dante as he travels through Hell (Inferno), moves on to Purgatory (Purgatorio), and finally reaches Heaven (Paradiso). Throughout this allegorical pilgrimage, Dante encounters various guides who help him navigate the realms of the afterlife. While it is the Roman poet, Virgil, who accompanies Dante through Hell and Purgatory, a different guide assists him in navigating Heaven, or Paradise. In \\"Paradiso,\\" Dante's guide through Paradise is none other than Beatrice Portinari, a woman who represented the epitome of purity and divine love for Dante on Earth. Beatrice was a real historical figure who was famously admired by Dante from a young age. Although Dante and Beatrice barely interacted during their lives, she played an important role in Dante's emotional and intellectual growth as she became his eternal muse and inspiration. Their encounters inspired Dante to write poetry, elevating Beatrice to the status of a heavenly being in his works. In the narrative of \\"The Divine Comedy,\\" Beatrice takes over the role of Dante's guide from Virgil once he reaches the Earthly Paradise at the summit of Mount Purgatory. As a non-Christian, Virgil cannot enter Heaven, and thus, the profoundly wise and pure Beatrice takes over as Dante's heavenly guide. The choice of Beatrice as Dante's guide through Paradise is highly symbolic, as she embodies the perfection of divine wisdom, love, and beauty that Dante seeks on his journey. The decision is also meaningful because Dante associates Beatrice with divine grace that untangles doubts and leads Dante to the truth. As Dante ascends through the celestial spheres of Paradise, Beatrice continues to provide explanations, philosophical insights, and spiritual teachings to the pilgrim. She remains by Dante's side as they experience the diverse heavens and meet various blessed souls in each sphere, guiding him towards salvation and contemplation of the divine. Throughout their journey in \\"Paradiso,\\" Beatrice's radiance and beauty visually represent the increasing proximity of Dante to the ultimate goal - his encounter with the Supreme Being, God Himself. Eventually, Beatrice leads Dante to the highest celestial realm known as the Empyrean, where they stand before the Beatific Vision - the divine light of the presence of God. At this final stage of their journey, Beatrice no longer serves as Dante's guide, as he experiences the ultimate source of divine wisdom and understanding directly. Dante is then guided by Saint Bernard, who leads him in prayer before they behold the Holy Trinity. In conclusion, Beatrice Portinari, representing divine love and wisdom, serves as Dante's guide through Paradise in \\"The Divine Comedy.\\" The choice of Beatrice as Dante's heavenly guide emphasizes the personal association of the poet with the object of his adoration on Earth and serves as a profound representation of the transformative power of love, grace, and divine enlightenment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By-elections also spelled bye-election (known as special elections in the United States, and bypolls in India) are used to fill elected offices that have become vacant between general elections. In most cases these elections occur after the incumbent dies or resigns, but they also occur when the incumbent becomes ineligible to continue in office (because of a recall, ennoblement, criminal conviction, or failure to maintain a minimum attendance). Less commonly, these elections have been called when a constituency election is invalidated by voting irregularities. In the United States, these contests have been called \\"special elections\\" because they do not always occur on Election Day like regular congressional elections. A 2016 study of special elections to the United States House of Representatives found \\"that while candidate characteristics affect special election outcomes, presidential approval is predictive of special election outcomes as well. Furthermore, we find that the effect of presidential approval on special election outcomes has increased in magnitude from 1995 to 2014, with the 2002 midterm representing an important juncture in the nationalization of special elections.\\" The procedure for filling a vacant seat in the House of Commons of England was developed during the Reformation Parliament of the 16th century by Thomas Cromwell; previously a seat had remained empty upon the death of a member.

TJ had been placed in charge of the children when the kids' grandmother, Katherine, left home on July 15 and will watch the children while the legal proceedings play out in a California court.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. The Seagulls looked set to open a four-point lead over the Magpies at the top thanks to a penalty from Glenn Murray. But Diame equalised when Christian Atsu's shot looped up off his boot. And then Atsu crossed from the left for substitute Perez, who had only come on seven minutes earlier, to fire home. The victory moves Newcastle two points above Brighton as they attempt to return to the Premier League at the first time of asking. The Seagulls were fired up for this top-of-the table contest and made a terrific start, camping in the Newcastle half and forcing Karl Darlow into two saves before he was beaten by the spot-kick from Murray. But the penalty was controversial, with Murray and Ciaran Clark appearing to wrestle each other, but Bobby Madley pointed to the spot. Soon after, left-back Sebastien Pocognoli was forced off with an injury to be replaced by Chelsea loanee Fikayo Tomori and Newcastle took advantage of the disruption. They started to dominate possession with Atsu looking dangerous on the right, but failed to really trouble David Stockdale until first-half stoppage time when the Brighton goalkeeper had to deny Matt Ritchie and Atsu. Although Paul Dummett brilliantly cleared off the line from Lewis Dunk at the start of the second half, Brighton became careless with Yoan Gouffran failing to capitalise on mistakes by Steve Sidwell and Stockwell. Brighton had their moments but Newcastle looked the more dangerous side, even though they were let down by poor finishing, before they finally broke through. Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez, involved in some dramatic comebacks during his career, masterminded another one with his two late substitutions. The first replacement, Daryl Murphy, had already become the latest player to be denied by Stockdale when the Magpies finally equalised with one of the most bizarre goals of the season. Atsu, who had been a constant menace to Brighton all night, tried his luck from the edge of the area and the ball ricocheted off not one, but two colleagues, Diame being the second, before finding its way into the roof of the net. A minute later, Benitez threw on Spanish striker Perez for the wasteful Gouffran, and within seven minutes he had hit the winner. Atsu led the defence on a merry dance once again, after a superb sweeping 60-yard pass from Matt Ritchie, before crossing firmly from the left for Perez to slam home from close range. Given their next few fixtures, it could be a vital victory for Newcastle as they face every other team in the current top seven in the next few weeks. They travel to third-placed Huddersfield, who now trail them by eight points, on Saturday and then go to Reading next Tuesday. By the middle of April they also have to face Fulham, Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds. By contrast, Leeds, Derby and Norwich are the only other sides in the top half of the table who Brighton will face in their remaining 12 games. The Seagulls are trying to win their first promotion to the top flight since 1982-83 after missing out so cruelly last season. Having been pipped on goal difference by Middlesbrough to finish third, they then lost to Sheffield Wednesday in the play-off semi-finals. Brighton manager Chris Hughton: \\"Was it [the equaliser] a sickener? Yes, and I don't think it was a result we deserved. \\"I've seen the penalty and there is no doubt Clark has his hands all over him. The referee was in a good position to see it. I think it was a penalty. \\"But then it's one of those really unfortunate goals. I wondered at the time how it had gone in. \\"But that gives Newcastle momentum going into that last period. I didn't think we were at our best today but I still thought we would go on to win.\\" Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez: \\"It was difficult when you play against a good team and with the advantage of goal from penalty that wasn't, it was more difficult. \\"Watching the replay of the penalty he was pushing our player. But the reaction of the team was good. \\"We were creating chances and you have to be pleased with the performance of everyone, on the pitch and off the bench. \\"We created a lot of good situations before we got a little bit lucky.

The U.S. Flag Code states that the American flag should never be dipped. American flag buntings are available to be used as patriotic decorations instead. Displaying the flag respectfully on a flagpole is not considered decorative and is acceptable to do. For example, you should never use the American flag as a tablecloth or drape it over a podium that someone will be speaking at. There is a debate over whether this includes wearing clothing like shirts and dresses with the American flag on it. Some people view it as patriotic, others view it as offensive. The only exception to the rule is for military members, police officers, and firefighters, who are all able to wear an American flag patch on their uniforms. This includes writing words on the flag, drawing numbers or symbols, or attaching any kind of image to the flag. People in uniform, members of the armed services, and veterans do the military salute. While it is customary for non-military and non-uniformed persons to remove any headwear and hold their right hand over their heart, the US Supreme Court determined (in their ruling West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette) “If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.”","completion":"Dipping a flag is a sign of respect, but the U.S. Flag Code prohibits dipping the American flag.

In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would Tanzania have thicker or thinner \\"A horizon\\" than Kenya? Hint: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.","completion":"Based on the information provided, Tanzania would have a thinner \\"A horizon\\" than Kenya. Here's the step-by-step justification: 1. In grasslands, like the ones in Kenya, the organic matter added to the soil comes primarily from the deep, fibrous grass root systems. This results in a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter. 2. In forests, such as those in Tanzania, the primary source of soil organic matter is the tree leaves falling on the forest floor. This contributes to the development of the O horizon and a thinner A horizon. 3. The frequent occurrence of fires in the grasslands destroys aboveground material but stimulates even greater contributions from roots, further contributing to the thicker A horizon in Kenyan grasslands. 4. The greater acidity under forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil, limiting the development of the A horizon in Tanzanian forests. So, considering these factors, we can conclude that Tanzania would have a thinner \\"A horizon\\" compared to Kenya."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

During the course of the film, it is revealed that Sam has changed dramatically and is not the person he was six years ago. He has learnt from his mistakes and is still haunted by his crime. Sam is later on a bus and witnesses two occupants give their seat up to a woman. He also sees another man staring at him. Later, when he visits Trife's grave at Oak Park cemetery, the man he saw earlier sits next to him. He says his name is Jehvon and starts a conversation with him. Later in the conversation, the man brings up the murder and attacks Sam. He turns out to be Trife's cousin, and he wounds Sam. However, Sam is later able to gain control of the fight and beats him into submission. Trife's cousin informs him that he will not survive the day, as many people want him dead â and will stop at nothing, not even harming his family. Sam, troubled by these claims, goes to his house and breaks in. However, no one is home, so Sam bandages up his wound. He then has a flashback to his prison days which reveals he helped a high ranking prison mate escape an attack from Trife's uncle, Curtis. Sam then goes into a room, goes through the drawers and picks up a gun which he discards, then leaves. Sam later visits Claire and asks for information regarding his mother, saying he won't hurt her, however Claire says she hasn't seen his mother in over a year, and also tells him that Mooney is at university, and that that's all she knows.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: I can use this background: At the end of the Proterozoic, the supercontinent Pannotia had broken apart into the smaller continents Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia and Gondwana. During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416–359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana. Now, I have a new situation: Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets. Given that these planets have no names, the explorers decide to name them after themselves. The planet of Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift. Many of the continents on the planet are currently breaking apart and moving. Timon, however, has been a stable planet with no continental moving for quite awhile now. Answer this question please: Is the volcanic crust on Sarahn or Timon hotter? Answer:","completion":"The volcanic crust on planet Sarahn is likely to be hotter than on planet Timon. This is because Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift with continents breaking apart and moving. Such tectonic activity often leads to the formation of new oceanic crust through volcanic activity. When this occurs, young volcanic crust is formed, which is relatively hotter and less dense compared to older oceanic crust. On the other hand, planet Timon has been stable with no continental movement for quite some time. This suggests that there has been little to no new volcanic crust formation on Timon and the existing crust is likely older and cooler. In summary, the volcanic crust on Sarahn is expected to be hotter due to its ongoing tectonic activity, while Timon's crust is likely cooler due to its stability and lack of recent volcanic activity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let's examine each sentence and compare the information they provide: 1. Its earliest settlers were George Woods in 1774, and George McCormick who settled at Spring Mills in 1773 and built the first mill there. This sentence highlights the earliest settlers' timeline and contributions. It first mentions George Woods who settled in the area in 1774, then introduces George McCormick who settled at Spring Mills in 1773, as well as his accomplishment of building the first mill there. Woods and McCormick are presented as two separate entities. 2. Its earliest settlers were George McCormick and George Woods in 1774, who settled in Spring Mills in 1773 and built the first mill there. This sentence primarily focuses on the two George's as the earliest settlers of the area, suggesting that both of them settled together in 1774. However, it then backs up in time and specifies that the pair settled in Spring Mills in 1773 and built the first mill there. In this version, George McCormick and George Woods are portrayed as being more closely associated, perhaps working together on establishing the settlement. In summary, both sentences convey similar information, but they do so with slightly different emphasis and structure: - Sentence 1 emphasizes the individuals and their separate contributions: George Woods settled in 1774, whereas George McCormick settled in Spring Mills in 1773 and built the first mill there. - Sentence 2 gives the impression that George McCormick and George Woods settled together in 1774, but then clarifies that they settled in Spring Mills in 1773 and built the first mill there, possibly as a team effort. The meaning of both sentences is close, but the way the information is presented differs, leading to small variations in how the story of the earliest settlers is understood."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Singapore Bids Farewell to Lee Kuan Yew in Elaborate Funeral (SINGAPORE) — Tens of thousands of Singaporeans undeterred by heavy rains lined a 15 kilometer (9 mile) route through the Southeast Asian city-state to witness an elaborate funeral procession Sunday for longtime leader Lee Kuan Yew. Lee’s coffin, protected from the downpour by a glass casing, lay atop a ceremonial gun carriage that was being led solemnly past city landmarks from parliament to a cultural center where the state funeral will be held. Walking slowly in the coffin’s wake as it exited parliament were Lee’s son, the current prime minister Lee Hsien Loong, other family members and government officials. Crowds of people that began forming not long after dawn for the early afternoon funeral cortege chanted “Lee Kuan Yew” and waved Singapore’s national flag. Four howitzers fired a 21-gun salute, air force fighter jets streaked over the island and navy patrol ships blasted horns. During a week of national mourning that began Monday after Lee’s death at age 91, some 450,000 people queued for hours for a glimpse of the statesman’s coffin at Parliament House. A million people visited tribute sites at community centers around the city. The expansive show of emotion is a rare event for Singapore. The island nation about four times the size of Washington D.C. is known around the world as a wealthy trade and finance center with a strict social order including a ban on chewing gum and caning for some crimes. Lee was Singapore’s prime minister for more than three decades, ruling with an iron grip until 1990, and is regarded by Singaporeans as the architect of their nation’s prosperity and harmonious race relations. But his authoritarian rule has also left a legacy of restrictions on free speech, a tame media and a stunted democracy. “He did everything for us Singaporeans regardless of race, language or religion,” said Jennie Yeo, a 58-year-old teacher, who arrived at 7 a.m. to stake out front row positions with two friends. “Education, housing, everything you can think of, he’s taken care of for us,” she said. Leaders and dignitaries from more than two dozen countries are attending the state funeral. The U.S. delegation is led by former President Bill Clinton. Abroad, India has declared a national day of mourning and in New Zealand, the government is flying flags at half-staff. During the funeral service, civil defense sirens will blare across the island to begin a minute’s silence.","completion":"Tens of thousands of Singaporeans gathered to witness the elaborate funeral procession for the nation's founding father, Lee Kuan Yew.

Burns worked as a cinematographer for the BBC, Italian television, and others, and in 1977, having completed some documentary short films, he began work on adapting David McCullough's book The Great Bridge, about the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge. Developing a signature style of documentary filmmaking in which he \\"adopted the technique of cutting rapidly from one still picture to another in a fluid, linear fashion [and] then pepped up the visuals with 'first hand' narration gleaned from contemporary writings and recited by top stage and screen actors\\", he made the feature documentary Brooklyn Bridge (1981), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary and ran on PBS in the United States. Following another documentary, The Shakers: Hands to Work, Hearts to God (1984), Burns was Oscar-nominated again for The Statue of Liberty (1985). Burns frequently collaborates with author and historian Geoffrey Ward, notably on documentaries such as The Civil War, Jazz, Baseball, and the 10 part TV series The Vietnam War (aired September 2017). Burns has gone on to a long, successful career directing and producing well-received television documentaries and documentary miniseries on subjects as diverse as arts and letters (Thomas Hart Benton, 1988); mass media (Empire of the Air: The Men Who Made Radio, 1991); sports (Baseball, 1994, updated with 10th Inning, 2010); politicians (Thomas Jefferson, 1997); music (Jazz, 2001); literature (Mark Twain, 2001); war (the 15-hour World War II documentary The War, 2007); environmentalism (The National Parks, 2009); and the Civil War (the 11-hour The Civil War, 1990, which All Media Guide says \\"many consider his 'chef d'oeuvre'\\").

Given the question: - Water evaporates from the ground up to the sky - Water droplets are in clouds - The air gets cold - Water droplets turn into ice crystals What might be the last step of the process? The answer is:","completion":"The last step of the process after the formation of ice crystals in the clouds is the precipitation of those ice particles back to the earth's surface in the form of snow, hail, sleet, or rain, depending on the atmospheric conditions. To give a more detailed explanation, the entire process comprises several interconnected processes known as the water cycle or hydrologic cycle. The water cycle consists of the continuous movement of water on, below, and above Earth's surface, involving the following key stages: 1. Evaporation: As the sun heats up the surface water in oceans, rivers, and lakes, the water molecules turn into water vapor, a gaseous state, and rise into the atmosphere. This process is called evaporation. Plants also contribute water vapor to the atmosphere through a process known as transpiration. 2. Condensation: As the water vapor rises into the atmosphere, it cools down and eventually condenses into tiny water droplets. These droplets come together, forming clouds. The process of water vapor transforming back into liquid droplets or ice particles in the atmosphere is called condensation. 3. Cloud Formation: Clouds are formed when billions of condensed water droplets or ice particles combine. The type of cloud formed depends on factors such as temperature, altitude, and humidity in the atmosphere. 4. Cold Air and Formation of Ice Crystals: As the ambient air temperature decreases, especially in high altitude locations or cold environments, the water droplets in the clouds may turn into ice crystals. These ice particles combine to form larger particles as they collide or stick together. This process is known as coagulation and typically occurs in colder regions where the temperature is below freezing. 5. Precipitation: The final step of the process is precipitation. Depending on atmospheric conditions such as temperature and air pressure, the particles (be it water droplets or ice crystals) within the clouds may fall back to Earth in various forms. This precipitation can take different forms, including rain (liquid water droplets), snow (ice crystals or snowflakes), sleet (ice pellets), or hail (chunks or balls of ice). In conclusion, the last step of the process following the formation of ice crystals in clouds is precipitation, where the ice particles fall back to the earth's surface in different forms such as snow, hail, sleet, or rain. Numerous factors, including temperature, humidity, and geographical location, determine the specific type of precipitation experienced."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Remain cheerleaders including former Labour leader Ed Miliband, ex Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and former Cabinet minister Nicky Morgan all claimed there was “no mandate for a hard Brexit”. The cross-party group want to force a Commons vote on leaving the single market. Tonight, furious Brexiteers rounded on the Remainers accusing them of “pure hypocrisy” and promoting “Project Nasty” by fuelling fears on the economy. Downing St sources described it as a bid to “thwart the will of the British people”. And Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon weighed in yesterday declaring Britain was full steam ahead for a “full Brexit” – in a direct jibe to his doom-mongering Cabinet colleague Philip Hammond. Mr Miliband who hopes to team up with the SNP, the Greens and pro-EU Tories said it would be an “outrage” for MPs not to be consulted on Brexit negotiations. Mr Clegg said it would “not be remotely acceptable”. And Mrs Morgan said MPs across the Commons would make “common cause” to press for the “right Brexit”. She said: “There’s no doubt that there’s a lot of us in Parliament who do feel that it would be extraordinary for Parliament not to have a big say in the Brexit negotiations as they unfold, on the guiding principles, to be asking questions.” But amid rumours of divisions in the Cabinet on the issue, Sir Michael insisted: “This is Brexit. “This is full Brexit, if you like. “We’re going to be outside the European Union but we still, because it’s over 40 per cent of our trade, we still want to maximise our trade with it. “We are all Brexiteers now. “We’re respecting the decision of the British people and we’ve got to make a success of it.” A No 10 source declared: “Parliament voted by a margin of 6 to one in favour of the referendum. “While Labour are are looking for ways to stop Brexit we are focused on delivering on the peoples verdict — and making a success of it. “Of course Parliament will have a role in the exit process, but this suggestion is simply an attempt to find another way to thwart the will of the British people.” Brexiteers lined up yesterday to blast the move. Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said: “People voted to leave and there is a full mandate for that. “The twice rejected standard bearers of the liberal elite, Miliband and Clegg, cannot understand that the electorate is both more authoritative and intelligent then they are.” Fellow Tory MP Steve Baker added: “If the vote had gone the other way by the same margin, these characters would be demanding we all accept the same result. “I pledged to do so. “I’m asking nothing of them I did not commit to myself if I say it is time for them to support leaving the EU.” Eurosceptic Bill Cash blasted the pro-EU MPs for their “double standards”. He said: “These people are demonstrating they have no regard for democracy. “The words ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ Brexit are meaningless. “They must respect the will of the British people. It’s pure hypocrisy and double standards.” Former Cabinet minister Owen Paterson added: “We had Project Fear, Project Uncertainty and now it’s Project Complexity and they are trying to turn it into Project Nasty. “We want to get on with this. The PM wants to publish and pass the bill and the quicker we do it, the quicker the uncertainty is over.” Prominent Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith said remaining in the single market was not on the agenda. He told the BBC’s Sunday Politics: “The single market is part of the European Union. “Whether you like it or not, the British people voted to leave.” Write a title for it.","completion":"Pro-EU Rebel Group Slapped Down by Theresa May in Fresh Bid to Derail Brexit"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: More than 27,000 people from around the UK set off at dawn from London to begin the cycle route through Surrey to the Sussex coast. The annual 54-mile ride raises money for the British Heart Foundation(BHF) and is Europe's largest charity cycling event. Cyclists began the exhausting journey at Clapham Common at 6 a. m. , hoping to reach Brighton seafront within an average of six hours. Money from today's event will help the charity to continue its vital work through heart research and the development of its care and support services. Among those taking part was BBC Breakfast's resident Dr Rosemary Leonard and several colleagues. BHF spokeswoman Gemma Cloke said, \\"It was quite cold this morning, but everyone set off without any problems.\\" Those taking part range in age from 14 to those in their 70s. Last year cyclists raisedPS4. 1 million for the charity, and have raised more thanPS50 million since the BHF became involved in the event in 1980. The first ride was held in 1976. It is hoped this year's fund raising total could reachPS4. 5 million. She added : \\"We have a lot of people taking part, from the more experienced cyclists to those cycling with friends and family in memory of someone and to raise money through sponsorship.\\" \\"People are always pleased knowing the money is going to a good cause.

In New York City, 1934, jazz singer Dot Clark and her shady gangster boyfriend, Louie The Lug (\\"An Earful of Music\\"), are introduced. After having an affair with the deceased Professor Edward Wilson, Dot is now technically his common-law wife and heiress to 77 million. She has to go to Egypt to claim the money, and sets off with Louie in hopes of getting the cash. Former assistant to Edward Wilson, Gerald Lane, informs the law offices of Benton, Loring, and Slade of Professor Wilson's death and the fact that Edward's son, Eddie Wilson, Jr, is the rightful heir to the money. Mr. Slade, the lawyer, goes to a barge in Brooklyn where Eddie is living with his adopted father, Pops, an old stevedore, and his three sons, Oscar, Adolph, and Herman, who roughhouse Eddie. However, Eddie is managing to live a nice life nonetheless, with his girlfriend, Nora 'Toots', and his care for all the kids on the barge. He dreams of the day when he will have enough money to live his own life outside of the dirty barge (\\"When My Ship Comes In\\"). Moments later, Eddie is informed that he has inherited the 77 million and boards a ship bound for Egypt to claim the money. Aboard the ship is Colonel Henry Larrabee, a gentleman from Virginia who sponsored Eddie, Sr's exploration endeavors and wants a share of the money, as well. Eddie befriends his beautiful niece, Joan, and Dot and Louie realize that they are not the only ones traveling to Egypt.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. “What was your worst makeup disaster?” Do fingernails count? I hope so, because this is a good one: I was 21 years old. I worked for a major commercial airline. A friend of mine and I decided to go to Puerto Rico for a long weekend. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. The hotel at which we stayed had a lovely (classy/expensive) restaurant serving continental fare. So, we decided to have our first dinner there. We dressed to the nines. Our hair and makeup were perfect. I had fake fingernails (not acrylic - those were fairly new back then. I had the type one glues on). Those fingernails were long, and painted a very bright - and obvious - red. When the waiter came to take our drink order, we both ordered glasses of wine. The waiter brought the wine, set it down on the table, and waited to take our meal orders. I smoked back then, and at the time, smoking was still allowed in restaurants. In a 21-year-old attempt to look classy and sophisticated, at that moment I took out a cigarette, put it between my lips, picked up my lighter, and lit my cigarette - or so I thought. Unfortunately, my long, red, fake thumbnail got in the way of the flame, and it caught on fire. The waiter’s mouth dropped open, his eyes wide. He froze in place. I was horrified. The flame was literally shooting up from my nail! And smoke; the nail was plastic! Quickly scanning the table for the closest thing with which I could extinguish the flame, I spied my glass of wine. As nonchalantly as possible, I stuck my thumb in the glass. There was a sizzle as the flaming nail hit the wine. When I withdrew my thumb from the glass, the nail was melted, black, and curled under. Ever the professional, the waiter regained his composure and proceeded to take our orders without missing a beat - but I’m sure I was the talk of the kitchen for the rest of the evening. So much for my attempt at appearing “classy” and “sophisticated”…. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products. and the situation: Hill town was full of gasoline powered vehicles, while Valley town 50 miles away, banned all gas powered vehicles and allows only electrical vehicles or horse-and-buggies.

A:","completion":"Given the information provided, Hill town, which was full of gasoline-powered vehicles, had more evaporated and unused fuel compared to Valley town, which banned all gas-powered vehicles and allowed only electric vehicles or horse-and-buggies. This is because gasoline-powered vehicles release evaporated and unused fuel in the form of volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere, which contributes to the formation of smog. In contrast, electric vehicles do not emit such emissions, and horse-and-buggies do not rely on gasoline for propulsion.

Context: As someone diagnosed with bpd this question kinda tugged at my heart, for a few reasons. From my understanding, the core of the disorder is an unstable sense of self and an inherent shame or worthlessness. Before I was treated I thought I just needed someone else, the right person to come along to love me in just the right way, being mindful of trauma and never triggering my symptoms. I was living in a fantasy world. You cannot expect another person, a whole person with a sound mind and stable to sense of self to subject themselves to the circus act of our lives. We can't even manage it ourselves!! I have been in two long-term relationships, and dozens of short ones six months or less. One of the two began when I was very low and lasted a very toxic 3 years. I entered treatment during that relationship, which resulted in it's demise. I was much happier afterward. The second relationship began after I completed treatment. We have seperated twice during the past 2 and a half years, and our relationship is currently rocky as well. But who I am in the relationship has changed. I am no longer the girl who needs extra reassurance daily that he's coming home from work. I can breathe when he goes to hang out with his friends. I am not threatened by every waking thought of his not being about me. Instead I am the woman that validates him and myself in arguments, and I put respect over everything. Of course I lose my temper. Self improvement is a constant process. But, to avoid hurting anyone you love, you should definitely talk to a counselor if you are looking for another person to help you :) For family members/lovers/caregivers, it's stressful and often results in a lot of resentment in the relationship!

From the moment I walked through the front door, I was impressed by the elegant ambiance, the warm and attentive staff, and their impressive menu that offers a delightful fusion of global culinary delights. Upon arrival, I was greeted by the hostess, Rebecca, who was incredibly welcoming and took the time to answer my questions about the menu's vegan and gluten-free options. She guided us to our table, which was perfectly situated on their outdoor terrace, providing a serene and intimate setting overlooking the city skyline. The evening was already off to a fantastic start! Our server, Samuel, was the epitome of professionalism and promptness. He was knowledgeable about the menu and shared his recommendations with infectious enthusiasm. For appetizers, we ordered the Seared Scallops with Cauliflower Purée and the Morrocan Spiced Lamb Meatballs. Both dishes arrived beautifully presented and were packed full of robust flavors. The scallops were cooked to perfection, melting in my mouth, while the lamb meatballs were tender and succulent. I was in gastronomic heaven! For our main courses, I opted for the Pan-Seared Salmon with Artichoke Risotto and Grilled Asparagus, and my partner chose the Braised Short Ribs with Truffled Mashed Potatoes. The chef displayed their expertise in crafting these beautifully executed dishes. The salmon was cooked impeccably, and the artichoke risotto provided the perfect accompaniment, both creamy and rich in flavor. My partner raved about the tenderness of the short ribs, and the truffled mashed potatoes were a luxurious and satisfying side dish. As a wine enthusiast, I was thrilled to discover their extensive wine list, featuring bottles from around the world, appealing to various budgets and tastes. Samuel provided excellent recommendations that complemented our meal beautifully, elevating the dining experience to another level. To finish off a wonderful evening, we indulged in their decadent Chocolate Marquise with Raspberry Coulis and a Cappuccino. The dessert was not overly sweet, but rich and satisfying, while the sharpness of the raspberry coulis rounded off the dish perfectly. What truly set The Gourmet Bistro apart from other dining experiences was the consistency of exceptional service, the delicious and creatively crafted dishes, and the attention to detail in the overall presentation of the establishment. The management has evidently invested significantly in training their staff, and it shines through in every interaction. I cannot recommend The Gourmet Bistro enough, whether you're in search of a romantic spot for date night, a celebratory meal, or a venue to share quality time with friends and family.

Article:SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon accused Tory counterpart Ruth Davidson of \\"talking so much about independence that I can't get a word in edgeways about it\\". But Ms Davidson hit back by telling Ms Sturgeon: \\"The country said 'No' and you won't listen to them.\\" Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said people \\"want to move on\\" from the referendum. The televised debate, which was hosted by the BBC's Sarah Smith in front of a live audience, also featured Willie Rennie of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Scottish Green Party co-convener Patrick Harvie and UKIP's David Coburn. Ms Sturgeon opened the debate by arguing that only her party could protect Scotland from an \\"extreme Brexit\\". And she said that supporting the SNP would \\"protect Scotland's right to make our own decisions\\" with regard to an independence referendum. The first minister was followed by Ms Davidson, who told Ms Sturgeon that she should: \\"Fix our schools, don't split up our country. Champion our businesses, don't put a border at Berwick.\\" She added: \\"At this election we can send the SNP a message they can't ignore, and with your help we can stop them, and in so doing we can get back to the issues that really matter.\\" Ms Sturgeon responded by accusing the Scottish Conservative leader of using independence as a smokescreen for her party's \\"toxic\\" policies. She said: \\"Ruth Davidson says I talk about nothing else, the truth is she talks so much about independence that I can't get a word in edgeways about it. \\"Ruth Davidson is using independence as a smokescreen in this campaign because she knows the Tory record and Tory policies are toxic.\\" Ms Dugdale warned the opinion polls were suggesting that the Conservatives \\"will be back and they will be more destructive than ever before\\" after the election. She added: \\"So who do you want to stand up to the Tories? Labour MPs who understand your life, because they've lived, or SNP MPs who will use every bit of Tory cruelty to exploit the case for independence.\\" Mr Rennie said the SNP's focus was \\"always independence\\", adding: \\"It took 44 days for Nicola Sturgeon to publish her Bill on another independence referendum. It took 15 months for them to write their mental health strategy. \\"It took two years for us to persuade them to expand nursery education for two-year-olds and it took six years for us to persuade them about a pupil premium.\\" Meanwhile, Mr Harvie warned social and environmental rights, guaranteed in the EU, would be \\"in the hands of a hard right Tory government hell-bent on a bonfire of the regulations\\". And Mr Coburn used his opening remarks to state that \\"UKIP is the party of Brexit. We must elect UKIP to the Commons to ensure Brexit means exit\\". The debate also saw Ms Sturgeon come under fire from the politically balanced audience over the SNP's record on health and education - both of which are devolved to the Scottish Parliament. One member said she was a nurse and had been forced to use a foodbank. She said that colleagues were considering leaving nursing, adding: \\"You have no idea how demoralising it is to work in the NHS.\\" Making a direct plea to the first minister, she said: \\"Don't come on your announced visits, come in in the middle of any day to any ward, to any A&E department and see what we're up against.\\" Ms Sturgeon told her \\"My sister works in the National Health Service, believe me she tells me exactly what she thinks about these matters.\\" She said the \\"austerity policies\\" of the UK government meant public sector workers had had pay rises capped at 1%. And she stressed that the Scottish government had a policy of no compulsory redundancies in the NHS and wider public sector. Analysis By Philip Sim, BBC Scotland political reporter At times it was like a Thursday session of First Minister's Questions, with the leaders of the main parties trading barbs over a faintly baffling mix of devolved and reserved policies. With the SNP defending 56 seats, it was natural that the other leaders would target Nicola Sturgeon. So, the early stages saw Ruth Davidson and Kezia Dugdale attack the SNP's record in government, although the Scottish Tory leader came under sustained pressure herself over immigration. There were the usual bouts of participants shouting over each other, and but it was notable that Ms Sturgeon came under much more detailed scrutiny than she did during the UK-wide debate on ITV on Thursday. The first minister is a skilled operator when it comes to this political sparring though, so she held her ground reasonably well; it was a member of the audience who landed the most notable blow on her. The nurse in the audience who took the first minister to task will go down as the most memorable moment of the debate, and will no doubt be the element which leads tomorrow's headlines. There were also fierce exchanges between Ms Sturgeon and Ms Davidson over immigration, with the SNP leader arguing that Conservative manifesto pledges to slash net migration to the UK would be \\"devastating\\" for Scotland's economy. Calling for politicians to be \\"honest\\" about immigration, Ms Sturgeon continued: \\"When we are talking about migrants here we are talking about people working in our hospitals, people serving us in our restaurants, we are talking about our friends and our neighbours. \\"The language around immigration I think is shocking. We have got a need in this country to grow our population. \\"If EU migration was to be ended over the next 25 years, or even constrained, we would see our working age population fall while our pensioner-age population is due to go up by 50%. That would be an economic catastrophe.\\" Ms Davidson said that \\"no one is talking about ending\\" migration from the EU, and that it was important that any immigration system was \\"trusted\\" by people in order to avoid it causing social unrest. She added: \\"What I want to see is Scotland to be the most attractive place so we can attract the brightest and the best. At the moment, despite having a third of the landmass of the UK, and 8.4% of the population, we only attract 4% of immigrants to this country\\". Ms Sturgeon said those figures - which Ms Davidson said were from the UK government - were \\"not true\\", and instead pointed to National Records of Scotland figures which said the country attracted 7% of migrants to the UK. Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), argued in a televised debate that her party alone could protect Scotland from \\"extreme Brexit\\", and maintained that backing the SNP would \\"protect Scotland's right to make our own decisions\\". But her chief opponents, Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, and Kezia Dugdale, the leader of Scottish Labour, claimed that the country wanted to move on from the issue of independence and that the SNP had to listen to the 2014 referendum vote against the concept."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After about 20 years of working and living in the United States, Verhoeven returned to the Netherlands for the shooting of a new film. Together with his screenwriter Gerard Soeteman, Verhoeven made Black Book (2006). The director was hailed by the host of the Netherlands Film Festival with the words \\"The return of a hero.\\" Black Book eventually won six Golden Calves at this festival, including Best Director. When the shooting of Black Book was delayed due to financial issues, there was speculation about a new production. The film Beast of Bataan had been announced, but once the shooting for Black Book resumed, the other film was never realized. Since his return to European cinema in 2006 with Black Book, Verhoeven has been connected to a large number of projects, but for the moment none of them has come to fruition. Some of those titles were produced with other directors at the helm, such as The Paperboy. Finally, in a rather unexpected twist, Verhoeven followed Black Book by directing a movie in French: Elle, an adaptation of a novel by Philippe Djian. The film by Verhoeven, a psycho-thriller where Isabelle Huppert plays a rape victim, was selected in the Official Competition at the Cannes International Film Festival, where it obtained very favourable reviews. Verhoeven has been a knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion since 2007. In December 2016 it was announced that Verhoeven would be the President of the Jury for the 67th Berlin International Film Festival, scheduled to take place in February 2017. In April 2017 his next French film titled Blessed Virgin was announced, to start filming in August of the same year. It is a biographical film about the life of Benedetta Carlini, which will be portrayed by Elle co-star Virginie Efira, and is an adaptation of the non-fiction book Immodest Acts - The life of a lesbian nun in Renaissance Italy by Judith C.

I heard that Riley had gotten separated from the group and become lost in the forest, but Sydney led Riley back to safety. And I was wondering What does Sydney need to do before this?","completion":"Before Sydney can lead Riley back to safety after getting separated from the group and lost in the forest, there are several steps and precautions that they both need to consider. Here is a detailed list of things that Sydney must do before successfully guiding Riley out of the forest: 1. Ensure their own safety: The first and foremost step for Sydney is to make sure they are in a safe location and secure environment. This may involve finding a stable ground to stand on, being aware of their surroundings, and checking for any immediate threats or hazards. 2. Assess the situation: Sydney needs to evaluate the extent of the problem, including understanding the reasons behind the separation, the severity of the situation, and the general direction in which Riley might be lost. 3. Gather essential supplies: Before venturing deeper into the forest to find Riley, Sydney should gather necessary items that will help in their search, such as food, water, flashlight, first aid kit, emergency whistle, compass, and a map (if available). 4. Inform other group members: Sydney must communicate with the rest of the group regarding the situation and their intentions to search for Riley. It is important to establish a rendezvous point and a timeframe for regrouping, and emergency procedures if Sydney is unable to locate Riley. 5. Plan a search strategy: Sydney should develop a search plan by determining the best method to locate Riley. This could involve retracing their steps, searching in a grid pattern, or following any traces, sounds or signs that might indicate Riley's whereabouts. Additionally, Sydney should consider using natural landmarks and the sun's position to navigate through the forest. 6. Implement the search: Once the search plan has been formulated, Sydney will effectively execute the plan while continuously reassessing the situation and adjusting the strategy accordingly. They should remain alert, stay focused and preserve their energy during this process. 7. Locate Riley: Upon finding Riley, Sydney should first assess their condition for any injuries, dehydration, or fatigue. It is crucial to provide immediate aid and comfort to Riley to ensure their well-being. 8. Determine the safest route back: Sydney must identify the most efficient and safest route to guide Riley back to the group or exit the forest. This may involve retracing their steps, making use of any available navigation tools or following a recognizable landmark that leads to the rendezvous point. 9. Stay vigilant and cautious during the return journey: Both Sydney and Riley should remain attentive to their surroundings, and any possible dangers they might encounter as they make their way back. Sydney should continue to lead and support Riley throughout the journey and keep an open communication regarding their progress and comfort level. 10. Reunite with the group: Once they have successfully navigated their way out of the forest or reached the designated rendezvous point, Sydney should ensure that Riley reconnects with the group. A debriefing should then take place with the entire group to discuss the events that led to the separation, the lessons learned, and any measures to prevent such incidents in the future. In summary, Sydney's main task before leading Riley back to safety involves ensuring their own safety, assessing the situation, gathering essential supplies, informing the group, planning and executing a search strategy, locating Riley, determining the safest route back, staying vigilant during the return journey, and finally reuniting with the group."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If you're not ready to give up your long, feminine locks, try tying them back in a ponytail or sporting a \\"man bun.\\" If you want to cut your hair short, familiarize yourself with the names of different men's hairstyles before getting it cut. Taper Cut- A short haircut with the sides and back of the head cut progressively shorter down toward the neck. Bowl Cut- Longer hair around the top of the head, shorter hair around the lower part of the head, with little or no blending in between the two lengths. Looks like someone placed a bowl on your head and simply cut around it. Brush Cut- Short, tapered hair around the sides of the head, uniform in length at the top of the head. Hair at the top of the head is styled straight up to resemble the bristles of a brush. Business Man's Cut- Generic term for a shorter (but not too short), conservative haircut, appropriate for the office. Hair is short and tapered around the sides and longer at the top to allow for a part. Caesar Cut- Back and sides are tapered, while hair at the top of the head is layered one to two inches in length. The top hair is combed forward giving the effect of bangs. Crew Cut- Very short cut that is tapered on the back and sides and top of the head. Fade- Extremely tapered cut, with hair on the sides and back cut very close to the head and tapered upward to a longer length at the top of the head. Flat Top- Back and sides are very tapered, while hair on the top is cut to stand straight up.

Pomade- Use on shorter styles, to create texture. Wax- Use to add shine. Mud- Use on longer styles, to create a \\"disheveled\\" look. Cream- Use to control frizz. Gel- Use for a strong hold or to create a \\"wet\\" look. Hairspray- Use to add volume and greater control to hair. With shorter hairstyles, men need to be more conscious of the hair on the backs of their necks and the way their sideburns look. They have less hair to hide under than most women do.

Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed. The food not digested is released as waste.

I hadn't been able to sleep and I was stuck in a too small tent with my wife and two kids. \\"Things haven't worked out,\\" I said to myself. But, like so many other things I complain before my morning coffee, this one was ridiculously off-key. Things weren't bad; they were good. A hundred yards(91 meters) away was Summit Lake, with its wonderful early morning mists shimmering off the water. A couple of miles to the southwest was the base of the Lassen Peak Trail. The base was 8,000 feet (2,400 meters) above sea level, huge snow banks dotting the place even in mid August. It was beautiful. We fired up the camp stove, got out our cold boxes from the heavy metal locker ,fired up some bacon, cut open some bread, and boiled up a cup of coffee. Half an hour later, my 6-year-old daughter and I were in the parking lot of the Lassen Peak Trail, getting ready to hike. We wouldn't make it all the way-- young legs get pretty tired on a steep mountain path, but it didn't matter. We would see great views spread out below us, the volcanic ash that layered on the earth turning the melting snow a mysterious pink as the sun struck it. Later, on the hike, I felt stupid about my morning complaints. Everything had been worthwhile. It gave me enormous satisfaction to see my daughter so excited about the view from the mountain. Yes, camping is uncomfortable. But there's also something wonderful about being so close to nature. Just as importantly, there's something about getting young children out of their increasingly technology-filled comfort zones and forcing them to encounter the non-cyber world around them.

While traveling 35,000 feet above eastern Ohio, United 93 suddenly dropped 700 feet. Eleven seconds into the descent, the FAA's air traffic control center in Cleveland received the first of two radio transmissions from the aircraft. During the first broadcast, the captain or first officer could be heard declaring \\"Mayday\\" amid the sounds of a physical struggle in the cockpit. The second radio transmission, 35 seconds later, indicated that the fight was continuing. The captain or first officer could be heard shouting:\\" Hey get out of here-get out of here-get out of here.\\" On the morning of 9/11, there were only 37 passengers on United 93-33 in addition to the 4 hijackers. This was below the norm for Tuesday mornings during the summer of 2001. But there is no evidence that the hijackers manipulated passenger levels or purchased additional seats to facilitate their operation. The terrorists who hijacked three other commercial flights on 9/11 operated in five-man teams. They initiated their cockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff. On Flight 93, however, the takeover took place 46 minutes after takeoff and there were only four hijackers. The operative likely intended to round out the team for this flight, Mohamed al Kahtani, had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration inspector at Florida's Orlando International Airport in August. Because several passengers on United 93 described three hijackers on the plane, not four, some have wondered whether one of the hijackers had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight. FAA rules allow use of this seat by documented and approved individuals, usually air carrier or FAA personnel. We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers, or anyone else, sat there on this flight. All the hijackers had assigned seats in first class, and they seem to have used them. We believe it is more likely that Jarrah, the crucial pilot-trained member of their team, remained seated and inconspicuous until after the cockpit was seized; and once inside, he would not have been visible to the passengers.

Generate a detailed description of this data","completion":"Based on the given data, we can infer that Bionico is a type of dessert that includes different variations and ingredients. We will analyze and provide a detailed description of each aspect of the data provided. 1. Bionico as a dessert: As the data indicates, Bionico is primarily served as a dessert. Desserts are typically sweet dishes that are enjoyed as the last course of a meal, often after the main course or dinner. They can be served hot or cold and come in various forms like cakes, pastries, ice creams, fruit-based dishes, and even beverages. Bionico, being a dessert, likely has a pleasing and indulgent taste that can be enjoyed as a perfect ending to a satisfying meal. 2. Ingredient - Raisin: One of the ingredients in a Bionico dessert is raisins. Raisins are dried grapes that can range from a dark and purple-brown to a golden-yellow color, depending on the grape variety used to create them. They come in different sizes, with some being seedless and others containing seeds. Raisins are naturally sweet due to their high sugar content and are packed with essential nutrients, including vitamins and minerals like iron, potassium, and calcium. In a Bionico dessert, raisins could be either an important ingredient that gives the dish its characteristic taste or adds texture, or merely used as a topping to enhance the overall appearance and flavor profile. They can also be used for their health benefits, as raisins are known to aid digestion and provide energy due to their natural fruit sugars. 3. Dish Variation - Cottage Cheese: A variation of the Bionico dessert includes the addition of cottage cheese. Cottage cheese is a type of cheese made from the curds of cow's milk and is popular for its mild, slightly tangy flavor and soft, creamy texture. It is highly versatile and can be used in various dishes – from salads and savory meals to desserts like Bionico. Incorporating cottage cheese in a Bionico dessert could add richness, creaminess, and a contrasting element of tanginess that complements the sweetness of the other ingredients in the dish. This variation could cater to individuals who enjoy the combination of sweet and slightly sour flavors in their desserts. Additionally, cottage cheese is a good source of protein, calcium, and other nutrients that can elevate the nutritional value of the dessert. In conclusion, Bionico is a versatile dessert that can be prepared with various ingredients, such as raisins, and different variations like the incorporation of cottage cheese. Whether you opt for the traditional version or choose one of the many variations, Bionico is sure to provide a scrumptious, sweet, and satisfying dessert experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Stephen is researching some very big questions, such as: How did the universe begin? How will it end? Stephen was a student at Oxford University. He studied math and science. Then, at the age of twenty, he became sick. He was so young, but the doctors said to his family, \\"He has only two more years to live.\\" As a matter of fact, the doctors were wrong---- he didn't die. He can't walk now but he uses a wheelchair . He can't feed himself and get in or out of bed himself. But he refused to give in to the condition. He talks with the help of a computer. After Oxford, Stephen went to Cambridge University. Three years later, in 1965, he became a doctor of philosophy . Because of his serious health problems, it was difficult for him to draw diagrams or to write. So he started to think in pictures. With this new way of thinking, he became one of the most famous scientists in the world. In 1991, he met the Pope in Rome. They talked about his ideas. Then in 1998, he wrote his first important book, A Brief History of Time. It sold more than 5.5 million copies in 33 different languages. He was once invited to China, he impressed us with his self-confidence, humorous and witty conversation. Question: How old was Stephen when he became a doctor of philosophy? - 21 - 23 - 27 - 25 The answer to this question is:","completion":"23 Step-by-step justification: 1. The article states that Stephen Hawking was born in 1942. 2. It also mentions that he became a doctor of philosophy in 1965. 3. To determine his age at that time, we can subtract his birth year from the year he became a doctor of philosophy (1965 - 1942). 4. The result is 23, so Stephen Hawking was 23 years old when he became a doctor of philosophy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Plot title: Get Him to the Greek Movie plot: Rock star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) releases an album and an accompanying single \\"African Child\\". The song and music video flops, is banned and called \\"the worst thing to happen to Africa since the apartheid\\" by NME. His girlfriend, Jackie Q (Rose Byrne), takes custody of their son, Naples, and leaves him; as a result, Aldous hits rock bottom by drinking and doing drugs excessively once again.Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) is a driven, idealistic young college graduate who works as a low-level talent scout at Pinnacle Records. He lives with his girlfriend, Daphne (Elisabeth Moss), a doctor in her internship, but they do not get to see each other often due to her heavy work schedule. Pinnacle Records has lost a lot of money, so the head of the company, Sergio Roma (Sean \\"Diddy\\" Combs), asks for ideas. Green proposes to have Aldous Snow play at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles for the tenth anniversary of a particularly famous performance there. One month later, he sends Aaron to London to retrieve Aldous. Before leaving, Aaron visits sleep-deprived Daphne at her hospital to tell her that he'll be gone for a few days. She informs Aaron that she received a job offer at a hospital in Seattle, where she will have a less hectic work schedule. Aaron doesn't appreciate her insisting that they move to Seattle and leave their current jobs behind, and an argument ensues and leads to an implied break-up.After retrieving Aldous from his apartment, Aaron tries desperately to control Aldous' rambunctious behavior, which causes them to miss several flights. They bar-hop across the city for several hours, leaving a trail of women and alcohol in their wake. Daphne calls him to apologize for the fight, but Aaron already believes that they had broken up. Throughout this partying, buttons on Aaron's cell phone (placed in his pocket) accidentally call his girlfriend, and his girlfriend overhears him partying with other women.Once the two have made it to New York, they proceed to Aldous' Welcome Back...

Help as much as you can. I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: We know that sugary sodas aren't good for our bodies. Now it turns out that they may not be good for our minds, either. A new study of more than 260,000 people has found a link between sweetened soft-drinks and depression, and diet sodas may be making matters worse. Americans drink far more sodas than people in other countries-- as much as 170 liters per person per year. But the impact of this study isn't limited to the United States. \\"Sweetened drinks, coffee and tea are commonly consumed worldwide and have important physical consequences. And they may have important mental-health consequences as well,\\" study author Dr Honglei Chen said in a statement. The study studied 263,925 people between the ages of 50 and 71. Researchers followed their consumption of drinks like soda, tea coffee, and other soft drinks from 1995 to 1996 and then. 10 years later, asked them if they had been diagnosed with depression since the year 2000. More than 11,3000 of them had. Participants who drank more than four servings of sodas per day were 30 percent more likely to develop depression than participants who did not drink sodas at all. People who stuck with fruit punch , had a 38 percent higher risk than people who didn't drink sweetened drinks. And all that extra sugar isn't the actual problem. Researchers say that the artificial sweetener _ may be to blame. The study found a link but could not surely determine whether sodas and other sweet soft drinks cause depression. Still, the results \\"are consistent with a small but growing body of evidence suggesting that artificially sweetened beverages may be linked to poor health outcomes.\\" But there's a bright side for those who can't live without their daily sodas. Adults who drank coffee had a 10 percent lower risk of depression compared to people who didn't drink any coffee, according to the study. \\"Our research suggests that cutting out or down on sweetened diet drinks or replacing them with unsweetened coffee may naturally help lower your depression risk,\\" said Chen. Question: It is implied in the passage that _ . Options: A: more research is needed to confirm the new findings B: the new findings aren't consistent with any previous findings C: cutting one's sodas intake will surely reduce one's depression D: the new findings won't have an impact on people's drinking habits","completion":"Based on the content provided in the article, the best answer seems to be A: more research is needed to confirm the new findings.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: As new seafloor forms and spreads apart from the mid-ocean ridge it slowly cools over time. Older seafloor is, therefore, colder than new seafloor, and older oceanic basins deeper than new oceanic basins due to isostasy. If the diameter of the earth remains relatively constant despite the production of new crust, a mechanism must exist by which crust is also destroyed. The destruction of oceanic crust occurs at subduction zones where oceanic crust is forced under either continental crust or oceanic crust. Today, the Atlantic basin is actively spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Only a small portion of the oceanic crust produced in the Atlantic is subducted. However, the plates making up the Pacific Ocean are experiencing subduction along many of their boundaries which causes the volcanic activity in what has been termed the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific is also home to one of the world's most active spreading centers (the East Pacific Rise) with spreading rates of up to 13 cm/yr. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a \\"textbook\\" slow-spreading center, while the East Pacific Rise is used as an example of fast spreading. Spreading centers at slow and intermediate rates exhibit a rift valley while at fast rates an axial high is found within the crustal accretion zone. The differences in spreading rates affect not only the geometries of the ridges but also the geochemistry of the basalts that are produced.Since the new oceanic basins are shallower than the old oceanic basins, the total capacity of the world's ocean basins decreases during times of active sea floor spreading. During the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, sea level was so high that a Western Interior Seaway formed across North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. I am facing a new situation today: Barry and Will are two geologists. Barry is specialized in subduction zones and new seafloor. Will is specialized in montology. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which person learned more about isostasy? Answer:","completion":"From the information given, Barry, who is specialized in subduction zones and new seafloor, would have learned more about isostasy. Isostasy is a term used in geology to refer to the state of gravitational equilibrium between the Earth's lithosphere and asthenosphere such that the tectonic plates \\"float\\" at an elevation determined by their thickness and density. This concept is closely related to the phenomenon of continental drift, plate tectonics, and the creation and destruction of the Earth's crust, all of which are part of the geodynamic process taking place in subduction zones and at mid-oceanic ridges. In the background article you read, it describes how new seafloor forms and spreads apart from the mid-ocean ridge, cooling over time, which is directly related to Barry's area of expertise. It further explains that older seafloors are colder and thus heavier, which causes them to sink deeper into the underlying asthenosphere - a clear illustration of isostatic adjustment. Also, it discusses how the generation of new crust must be balanced by an equal destruction of crust through a mechanism occurring in subduction zones. Given Barry's area of specialization, which as we've seen has direct relation to the concepts of isostasy, new seafloor, and subduction zones, he would likely have a deep understanding of isostasy. On the other hand, Will specializes in montology, which is the study of mountains. While the formation and evolution of mountains do involve some concepts related to isostasy and tectonic activities, it is more focused on aspects like the physical and chemical composition of mountains, the impact of climate and erosion, and the biodiversity of mountainous ecosystems. Thus, while Will would likely have some knowledge of isostasy, given his field of specialization, it would not be as extensive and intensive as Barry’s. Therefore, Barry, with his specialization in subduction zones and new seafloor, would have learned more about isostasy than Will, who is specialized in montology."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

At the same time, the certainty of the old biblical paradise began to slip from the grasp of thinkers into the realms of mythology. In response, treatment of the Paradise in literature, poetry and art shifted towards a self-consciously fictional Utopian representation, as exemplified by the writings of Thomas More (1478–1535).Albrecht Dürer was an avid student of exotic animals, and drew many sketches based on his visits to European zoos. Dürer visited 's-Hertogenbosch during Bosch's lifetime, and it is likely the two artists met, and that Bosch drew inspiration from the German's work.Attempts to find sources for the work in literature from the period have not been successful. Art historian Erwin Panofsky wrote in 1953 that, \\"In spite of all the ingenious, erudite and in part extremely useful research devoted to the task of \\"decoding Jerome Bosch\\", I cannot help feeling that the real secret of his magnificent nightmares and daydreams has still to be disclosed. We have bored a few holes through the door of the locked room; but somehow we do not seem to have discovered the key.\\" The humanist Desiderius Erasmus has been suggested as a possible influence; the writer lived in 's-Hertogenbosch in the 1480s, and it is likely he knew Bosch.

Choices: [A]. unacceptable [B]. acceptable","completion":"[B]. Acceptable The test sentence \\"I spoke to him about the war yesterday, that guy who's always following us.\\" is an acceptable English sentence. It might not be the most formal or refined structure, but it is still grammatically correct and conveys a clear idea. Let's break down the sentence to understand its various components: 1. Subject: \\"I\\" – The speaker is the subject of the sentence and is addressing their action. 2. Verb: \\"spoke\\" – This is the simple past form of the verb \\"speak\\" and is appropriate for describing an action that occurred in the past. 3. Object: \\"him\\" – This pronoun specifies the person the speaker had a conversation with. The main clause of the sentence is \\"I spoke to him about the war yesterday.\\" This part of the sentence conveys the essential information – the speaker talked with someone else regarding a war and the conversation happened the day before. The use of the adverb \\"yesterday\\" places the action in the past, clearly indicating the time the action took place. Now, let's examine the second part of the sentence, \\"that guy who's always following us.\\" 1. Modifier: This phrase is used to provide additional information about the person referred to as \\"him\\" in the main clause. It helps the reader or listener identify who \\"him\\" is. 2. Relative Pronoun: \\"who\\" – It is used here to introduce a defining relative clause. 3. Verb: \\"following\\" – This verb, in its present participle form, indicates the repeated action of \\"always following us\\". 4. Subject: \\"us\\" – The subject of the relative clause, which indicates the person or people the \\"guy\\" is always following. 5. Contraction: \\"who's\\" – It combines \\"who\\" and \\"is\\" into a single word, shortening the sentence and making it more casual.

Why are people afraid of dying when they do not know for certain what happens after death? Why do I get so scared when I think about what happens after death? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Options: [-] no. [-] yes.","completion":"These two questions are related but not exactly the same. The first question asks for an explanation regarding the fear of death and the uncertainty of what happens after, while the second question dives into the reason someone personally gets scared when they think about what happens after death. Now, let us explore the first question: People are generally afraid of dying due to multiple reasons. At its core, this fear may be evolutionary, having developed in order to create a survival instinct and self-preservation. Fear of death, also known as \\"Thanatophobia,\\" is a universal experience that transcends cultural and societal boundaries. There are several factors that contribute to this fear, including: 1. Fear of the unknown: Death is one of the most incomprehensible and mysterious aspects of life. Since there is no definitive evidence or universally accepted belief about what happens after death, people tend to fear the unknown. The uncertainty of what follows death can be unsettling and induce anxiety when pondering the subject. 2. Loss of control: Confronting one's own mortality often leads to feelings of powerlessness and dread because the idea of death represents the ultimate loss of control. This fear can be further exacerbated by the inability to foresee when or how death will occur. 3. Regret and unfinished business: People may fear dying because they have unfinished goals, dreams, or relationships that they wish to experience and accomplish before their life is over. The desire to live a full life and the belief that one has not yet achieved everything they hoped to adds to the fear of death. 4. Fear of separation and loneliness: Many people worry about leaving their loved ones behind when they die, causing grief and pain for those who remain. The fear of separation and loneliness that can accompany death contributes to the overall anxiety it causes. 5. Existential fears and concerns: Contemplating death often leads individuals to confront broader existential questions about the meaning of life and their own sense of identity, which can induce further anxiety. Regarding the second question: Personal fear concerning the concept of death and the aftermath likely stems from a mix of the factors mentioned above. Experiencing this fear is normal, as humans often grapple with the mystery of death and their mortality. However, each person's experience with this fear can vary depending on their particular life experiences, personality traits, cultural background, and religious beliefs. It is important to note that this fear can be managed through several approaches, including talking to friends or family, seeking support from therapists or religious leaders, or using various coping mechanisms. By contemplating one's own values and finding purpose in life, individuals can reduce the extent of their fear and anxiety surrounding death and the unknown that follows. Ultimately, understanding and accepting the inevitability of death can help people focus on cherishing and enjoying the time they have while they are alive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Thanks for the A2A Josh: Tough one to reduce to just a single incident but I’ll try. I grew up in North Central Indiana, about 50 miles south of South Bend. It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70’s and 80’s. My family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses. My dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between. It was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed. As I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway. Some people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools. I remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether. I don’t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn’t do a good job. Later in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing. I still remember hating shoveling snow. But I’m forever grateful that I did it. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What does the man make his children do now that he is grown?

Although Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Who asked a German family to help him continue his education in 1991?\\" is \\"Atta\\"?","completion":"Yes, according to the paragraph provided, it is correct to answer \\"Atta\\" to the question \\"Who asked a German family to help him continue his education in 1991?\\" The text clearly states \\"In the fall of 1991, [Mohamed Atta] asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany.\\" Therefore, the information provided supports the answer as being Mohamed Atta."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is common for forces to be combined. Most objects on Earth have at least two forces acting on them. Do you know what one of them is? Of course, that force is gravity. How many forces do you have on you right now? Gravity pulls you down toward the center of Earth. Your legs exert a downward force. They hold you up against the pull of gravity. Consider the example in Figure 1.3. A book is resting on a table. Gravity pulls the book downward. It has a force of 20 newtons. At the same time, the table pushes the book upward. Its force is also 20 newtons. The table opposes the pull of gravity. Question: \\"How many forces do you have on you right now?\\" Answer: \\"Two\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"Yes, the answer to the question \\"How many forces do you have on you right now?\\" is correct. There are generally two main forces acting on a person or an object in everyday situations: 1. Gravitational force: This force is exerted by Earth and pulls objects downward towards the center of the Earth. It acts on all objects with mass and is responsible for holding us on the ground. 2. Normal force or contact force: This is the force exerted by a surface or an object that supports another object from falling under the influence of gravity. For example, when we stand on the ground, our legs exert a downward force, while the ground exerts an upward force, known as normal force, opposing our body weight (the force due to gravity), preventing us from sinking into the ground. In the mentioned example of a book resting on a table, the forces acting on the book are gravitational force (downward) and the normal force exerted by the table (upward). Both forces are equal and opposite in direction, totaling 20 newtons each, which results in a net force of zero. This equilibrium is why the book remains at rest on the table. So, there are at least two forces acting on any object or person in most situations on Earth, and these are the forces mentioned earlier: gravity and normal force."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the aftermath of the tragedy, at least 12 people were killed and 59 others injured, marking one of the deadliest mass shootings in American history. The Incident Minutes into the movie, the unidentified gunman made his way into the auditorium wearing tactical gear, including a ballistic helmet, gas mask, and body armor. He initially released a canister of tear gas or smoke, prompting panic and confusion among the audience. As the smoke filled the room, the assailant opened fire with an assortment of weapons, including an AR-15 assault rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun, and a .40-caliber Glock handgun. As people in the theater desperately tried to escape, the gunman slowly and methodically walked up and down the aisles, shooting victims at point-blank range. Some people managed to flee through emergency exits, while others hid behind theater seats and even pretended to be dead in an attempt to avoid the shooter. The horror inside the dark theater lasted for several minutes until police arrived at the scene and apprehended the suspect, later identified as 24-year-old James Holmes. Victims and Survivors Among the 12 victims who lost their lives that night were young parents, military veterans, and students who had gathered to enjoy the latest Batman installment. The injured included children as young as 4 months old, some of whom suffered from gunshot wounds and other traumatic injuries. In the days following the massacre, stories of heroism, sacrifice, and survival emerged as survivors recounted harrowing tales of narrowly escaping death and shielding loved ones from harm. The Shooter James Eagan Holmes, the man responsible for this heinous act, was a former neuroscience graduate student who had recently withdrawn from his studies at the University of Colorado. He had no prior criminal record but had been seeing a psychiatrist for undisclosed reasons. In the days leading up to the shooting, Holmes had stockpiled an arsenal of weapons, ammunition, and explosives, which he used not only in the attack but also to booby-trap his apartment in an apparent attempt to cause additional destruction and death. Legal Proceedings and Aftermath Holmes was charged with 24 counts of first-degree murder, 116 counts of attempted murder, and one count of possession of explosives for the attack and booby-trapping his apartment. In July 2015, he was found guilty on all counts and sentenced to 3,318 years in prison without the possibility of parole. The tragic shooting in Aurora sparked national conversations about gun control, mental health, and violence in American culture. It led to increased security measures in movie theaters across the nation, focusing on emergency preparedness and potential threats. The incident also inspired calls for change in the mental health system, emphasizing early intervention and access to treatment to help prevent such devastating acts of violence. Conclusion The Aurora, Colorado movie theater massacre remains a heartbreaking reminder of the senseless violence that occurred during what should have been a night of entertainment and excitement. Today, we honor those who lost their lives in this tragic event and remember the bravery and resilience of the survivors. As the nation continues to grapple with issues of gun control and mental health, the hope remains that some measure of solace and healing can be found for the community of Aurora and for all those who were affected by this incomprehensible act of violence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Poorer children would be offered the chance to attend lessons on Saturday to help catch up with their middle-class peers , the shadow schools secretary, Michael Gove, said today. The Conservatives would give English state schools the freedom to choose to have longer teaching hours and extra classes at the weekend; he told the Association of Teachers and Lecturers' annual conference. Gove said the move would help to close the achievement gap with richer children whose parents could afford extras such as tutoring and music lessons. He told delegates in Manchester, \\"For children who come from homes where parents don't have the resources to provide _ and cultural experiences, there are benefits in having those children in the learning environment, in school, for longer.\\" \\"Parents would love to have schools starting earlier in some circumstances, and certainly going on later in the afternoon, given the reality of their working lives,\\" he said. He held up the example of Kipp (Knowledge Is Power Program) schools in the US, which are often based in the poorest communities and open from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays, plus Saturdays. But it would be up to schools to decide to offer longer hours, Gove added. Parents said Saturday classes could become a \\"badge of dishonor\\" if pupils were forced to go while teachers raised concerns about their workload. Margaret Morrissey, of Parents Outloud, said, \\"I think the suggestion the government made about one-to-one teaching for these kids would be a more preferable way of improving these children's performance. I'm just not sure whether taking away a child at weekends is actually going to make them cleverer in the week.\\" The ATL's general secretary, Mary Bousted, said, \\"If we want Saturday schools, then we need more teachers doing the extra hours, not the same teachers working longer.\\" What is Margaret Morrissey's opinion about the new program?

By the reign of Henry VII the cathedral was complete, appearing much as it does today (though the fittings have changed). From 1508 to 1546, the eminent Italian humanist scholar Polydore Vergil was active as the chapter's representative in London. He donated a set of hangings for the choir of the cathedral. While Wells survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries better than the cathedrals of monastic foundation, the abolition of chantries in 1547 resulted in a reduction in its income. Medieval brasses were sold, and a pulpit was placed in the nave for the first time. Between 1551 and 1568, in two periods as dean, William Turner established a herb garden, which was recreated between 2003 and 2010.Elizabeth I gave the chapter and the Vicars Choral a new charter in 1591, creating a new governing body, consisting of a dean and eight residentiary canons with control over the church estates and authority over its affairs, but no longer entitled to elect the dean (that entitlement thenceforward belonged ultimately to the Crown). The stability brought by the new charter ended with the onset of the Civil War and the execution of Charles I. Local fighting damaged the cathedral's stonework, furniture and windows. The dean, Walter Raleigh, a nephew of the explorer Walter Raleigh, was placed under house arrest after the fall of Bridgwater to the Parliamentarians in 1645, first in the rectory at Chedzoy and then in the deanery at Wells. His jailor, the shoe maker and city constable, David Barrett, caught him writing a letter to his wife. When he refused to surrender it, Barrett ran him through with a sword and he died six weeks later, on 10 October 1646. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the choir before the dean's stall. During the Commonwealth of England under Oliver Cromwell no dean was appointed and the cathedral fell into disrepair.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Millions of families around the world have been given a helping hand out of poverty by micro-credits. These very small loans , usually less than US200, have enabled the very poorest people to set up or expand businesses and become self-sufficient. The micro-credit movement started with Professor Muhammad Yunus, who founded the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. Professor Yunus, who won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, used his own money to set up a bank to benefit the poorest people in Bangladesh--families living on less than US1 a day. There are now hundreds of organizations around the world following his blueprint to help people escape from poverty. So how does the system work? Local microfinance institutions (MFIs) make contact with families and offer loans, usually to women, to enable them to start or expand a business. These are very poor people who would not normally be able to get credit, but as no collateral is required they can get micro-credits. They pay back the loan on a weekly basis, over six months to a year. A very important aspect to the success of the micro-credit system is that receivers get local support. The MFIs educate local communities about ways to improve their lives, and offer practical support as well as collecting weekly loans payments. They encourage people to help each other, so that the whole community can pull itself out of poverty. MFIs may also help with literacy and health problems. Micro-credits are mainly given to women. Experience has shown that women are more motivated to improve their children's lives and will spend the money they make on better nutrition and schooling for their children. This may be the first chance they've had to contribute financially to the family, and their status in the home and the local community is raised. The micro-credit system is not charity. The payments are fixed-term loans and interest is charged. The costs of making such small loans, collecting them and giving personal support are high. This is shown in the interest rates, which range from 15...

In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1. find the Name of captain table ordered ascending by age","completion":"To find the name of captains in the table and order them ascending by age, you can use the following SQL statement: \`\`\`SQL SELECT Name FROM captain ORDER BY age ASC; \`\`\`"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Where is homemade food often stored? - supermarket - jar - backpack - wal-mart - container The best answer is The answer is:","completion":"Container. Homemade food is often stored in containers. These containers can be made from various materials such as glass, plastic, or metal. They are used as they can be sealed to prevent spoilage and contamination, allowing the food to remain fresh for a longer period. The containers can then be stored in appropriate places such as the refrigerator or pantry. Supermarkets and Walmart are places where you buy ingredients to make homemade food, not to store it. A jar is a type of container, however the question presumably refers to a general method of storing food at home, making container the more inclusive answer.
