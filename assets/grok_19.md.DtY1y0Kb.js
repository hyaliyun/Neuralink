Great Britain's Lynsey Sharp just fell short in her bid to retain the European crown, as not even a personal-best performance was enough for her to add gold to the 800 metres silver from the Commonwealth Games. A fortnight ago, the 24-year-old became the pride of Scotland after overcoming the odds to secure a podium finish at Hampden Park. Sharp was on a drip in the athletes' village clinic until 5.30am on the morning of the Glasgow final, yet managed to win silver after a wonderful late surge.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Oliver Leaman in particularly interested in this philosophy, which includes the philosophy dominant in Sri Lanka. A:","completion":"Oliver Leaman is a well-known scholar and philosopher who is particularly interested in the study of Islamic, Jewish, and Oriental philosophies. Among his areas of interest is the philosophy dominant in Sri Lanka, which is predominantly influenced by Theravada Buddhism and elements of traditional Sri Lankan culture. Theravada Buddhism, also known as \\"The Doctrine of the Elders,\\" is an ancient school of Buddhism and the dominant form of the belief system in countries like Sri Lanka, Burma (Myanmar), Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia. This school of thought stands out due to its emphasis on the Pali Canon, a comprehensive collection of sacred texts that serve as the primary source of knowledge for Theravada Buddhism. One of the key philosophical points in Theravada Buddhism is the understanding and realization of the Four Noble Truths. The first truth, \\"dukkha,\\" refers to the existence of suffering or unsatisfactoriness in life. The second, \\"samudaya,\\" is the acknowledgment of the causes of suffering, which are essentially rooted in desire, craving, and ignorance. The third truth, \\"nirodha,\\" recognizes that suffering can be brought to an end through the cessation of these causes, and the fourth truth, \\"magga,\\" presents the Eightfold Path as the way to achieve the cessation of suffering (enlightenment or Nirvana). The Eightfold Path consists of a set of ethical, mental, and contemplative practices meant to guide individuals toward understanding reality and attaining enlightenment. These practices are organized into three main areas: morality (sila), concentration (samadhi), and wisdom (pañña). Followers are encouraged to cultivate these virtues to overcome cravings, desire, and aversion, which are associated with dukkha. Sri Lankan philosophy also places a strong emphasis on the importance of meditation and mindfulness practices. There are various styles of meditation prominent in the tradition, including Vipassana (insight) meditation, Samatha (concentration) meditation, and Metta (loving-kindness) meditation. The goal of these practices is to develop both clarity of thought and the direct experience of ultimate truths. In addition to meditation practices and the focus on the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path, Theravada Buddhism also teaches the doctrine of ‘anicca,' or impermanence. This concept refers to the transient nature of existence, as every aspect of life is subject to change, decay, and cessation. By understanding impermanence, practitioners can develop the ability to let go of attachments and aversions that obstruct the path to enlightenment. Sri Lanka also has a rich philosophical tradition linked to its history, political and socio-cultural evolution. The development of a unique Sri Lankan identity was greatly influenced by interactions with Indian, Southeast Asian, and European philosophies and religions over the centuries. As a result, Sri Lankan philosophical thought is characterized by a blend of indigenous wisdom, Theravada Buddhist principles, and a diverse assortment of external cultural and philosophical influences. In summary, Oliver Leaman's interest in the philosophy dominant in Sri Lanka is centered on Theravada Buddhism and the unique cultural amalgamation that has shaped Sri Lankan thought. Key philosophical concepts such as the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path, meditation and mindfulness practices, and the doctrines of impermanence and non-attachment are integral to this rich and diverse school of thought. Studying Sri Lankan philosophy enables us to gain a deeper understanding of the historical and cultural factors that have contributed to the development of its unique perspective on the nature of reality, ethics, and the path to enlightenment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: - The virus has receptors that lock onto a target cell - The virus enters the cell - The virus uses the cell like a factory to make new copies of the virus - The new copies of the virus leave the cell - Infect other cells - The host gets sick as its cells are damaged. What might be the first step of the process? A:","completion":"A: The first step of the process in a viral infection is the attachment of the virus to the target cell. This is a crucial stage, as it facilitates the entry of the virus into the host cell and lays the foundation for the subsequent steps in the infection process. In this step, the virus seeks out and binds to specific receptors on the surface of the target cell using its surface proteins or glycoproteins. Viruses typically have a high degree of specificity for their host cells, meaning they will only infect certain types of cells within an organism. This specificity is determined by the interaction between the virus's surface proteins and the receptor molecules on the host cell membrane. The receptors on the host cell are usually proteins or glycoproteins which play other essential roles in the cell's physiological processes, such as cell signaling, immune response, or intercellular communication. However, viruses have evolved to take advantage of these molecules as a means of entry into the cell. The binding between the viral surface protein and the host cell receptor is governed by molecular recognition, with a \\"lock-and-key\\" mechanism: the shape and chemical properties of the viral protein and host receptor complement each other, allowing them to fit together. This specific interaction ensures that the virus only infects appropriate host cells and minimizes the chances of the virus binding to non-susceptible cells or organisms. Once the virus has firmly attached to the host cell receptor, it undergoes a conformational change that triggers the subsequent steps in the infection process. These steps include the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane and the internalization of the virus into the host cell, either through endocytosis or by direct penetration. In summary, the first step of the viral infection process is the attachment of the virus to the target cell via specific interactions between the viral surface proteins and the host cell receptors. This attachment initiates the chain of events that ultimately lead to the replication of the virus, cellular damage, and the onset of illness in the host organism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hot water (known as \\"liquor\\" in brewing terms) is mixed with crushed malt or malts (known as \\"grist\\") in a mash tun. The mashing process takes around 1 to 2 hours, during which the starches are converted to sugars, and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains. The grains are now washed in a process known as \\"sparging\\". This washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible. The process of filtering the spent grain from the wort and sparge water is called wort separation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: William Martin Joel was born in the Bronx on May 9, 1949, and was raised in Levittown, New York in the town of Oyster Bay. In 1963 when zip codes were assigned, the section of Levittown in Oyster Bay was given a Hicksville, New York zip code and has since been part of Hicksville. Joel's father, Howard (born Helmuth) Joel, a classical pianist, was born in Germany, to a Jewish family, the son of a merchant and manufacturer, Karl Amson Joel. Howard emigrated to Switzerland and later to the United States (via Cuba, as immigration quotas for German Jews prevented direct immigration at the time) to escape the Nazi regime. In 1974, Joel recorded his second Columbia album in Los Angeles, Streetlife Serenade. His manager at the time was Jon Troy, an old friend from the New York neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant; Troy would soon be replaced by Joel's wife Elizabeth. Streetlife Serenade contains references to suburbia and the inner city. It is perhaps best known for \\"The Entertainer\\", a No. 34 hit in the US. Upset that \\"Piano Man\\" had been significantly cut for radio play, Joel wrote \\"The Entertainer\\" as a sarcastic response: \\"If you're gonna have a hit, you gotta make it fit, so they cut it down to 3:05.\\" Although Streetlife Serenade is often considered one of Joel's weaker albums (Joel dislikes it himself), it contains the notable songs \\"Los Angelenos\\" and \\"Root Beer Rag\\", an instrumental that was a staple of his live set in the 1970s. In late 1975, Joel played piano and organ on several tracks on Bo Diddley's The 20th Anniversary of Rock 'n' Roll all-star album. Disenchanted with Los Angeles, Joel returned to New York City in 1975 and recorded Turnstiles, the first album he recorded with the group of hand-picked musicians who became the Billy Joel Band. Produced by James William Guercio (then Chicago's producer), Turnstiles was first recorded at Caribou Ranch with members of Elton John's band. Dissatisfied with the result, Joel re-recorded the songs and produced the album himself. \\"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\\" was a minor hit; Ronnie Spector recorded a cover as did Nigel Olsson, then drummer with Elton John. In a 2008 radio interview, Joel said that he no longer performs the song because singing it in its high original key \\"shreds\\" his vocal cords; however, he did finally play it live for the first time since 1982 when he sang it at the Hollywood Bowl in May 2014. Though never released as a single, \\"New York State of Mind\\" became one of Joel's best-known songs; Barbra Streisand and Tony Bennett have each recorded covers (Bennett's a duet with Joel on Playing with My Friends: Bennett Sings the Blues). Other notable songs from the album include \\"Summer, Highland Falls\\", \\"Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)\\", \\"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\\", (a live version of which became a Top 40 hit), and \\"Prelude/Angry Young Man\\", a concert mainstay. was it successful?","completion":"Yes, it was successful. There were songs from the albums that became well-known and loved by many people. For example, \\"The Entertainer\\" was a hit, and \\"New York State of Mind\\" became a very famous song, even though it was never a single. Also, famous singers like Barbra Streisand and Tony Bennett recorded covers of those songs.

Wood has argued that the United States is a model for the world in terms of how a separation of church and state—no state-run or state-established church—is good for both the church and the state, allowing a variety of religions to flourish.

Options: a ) 70 , b ) 50 , c ) 60 , d ) 80 , e ) 65 Student:","completion":"To solve this problem, we will follow these steps: 1. Determine the price of oil before the reduction 2. Calculate the reduced price of oil 3. Find the new quantity of oil the housewife can buy for Rs. 700 4. Calculate the reduced price per kg of oil Step 1: Determine the price of oil before the reduction Let \\"x\\" be the price of oil before the reduction. The housewife is able to buy 3 kgs more after a reduction of 30% in price. This means that the price she is paying for the additional 3 kgs of oil is equal to 30% of the original price. 0.30 * x = 3 * x - 700 Step 2: Calculate the original price of oil Multiplying both sides of the equation by 10/3, we get: x = 700 / 0.10 x = 7,000 / 1 = 7,000 Step 3: Find the new reduced price of oil The reduced price is 70% of the original price (100% - 30%): Reduced price = 0.70 * 7,000 = 4,900 Step 4: Calculate the new quantity of oil the housewife can buy for Rs. 700 Let \\"y\\" be the new quantity of oil: 4,900y = 700 y = 700 / 4,900 y = 1/7 With the reduced price, the housewife can buy 1/7 kg more of oil. Step 5: Calculate the reduced price per kg of oil Now, we know the housewife can buy 3 kgs + 1/7 kg of oil for Rs. 700: Reduced price per kg = 700 / (3 + 1/7) Reduced price per kg = 700 / (22/7) Reduced price per kg = (700 * 7) / 22 Reduced price per kg = 4,900 / 22 Reduced price per kg = Rs. 50 Thus, the correct answer is option 'b', which is 50."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the year 120 AD, the powerful Roman Empire, under the reign of Hadrian, had expanded its rule to the Central Asian countries. During their time of expanding, the great Roman Empire agreed to create an alliance with the Han Dynasty by marrying their two prince and princess, thus uniting the two powers of East and West. However, the Roman prince, Marcus Carprenius (Gavin Stenhouse), did not agree with the decision. Instead, he wants to be free and not be controlled by politics. The Han princess, Meng Li Hua (Jing Lusi), also wants to be free instead being a pawn in a political game. The Roman fleet sails off from the coast of Arabia to the mysterious peninsula dividing the two great kingdoms. The Roman fleet are struck by a powerful storm, which causes the Romans to lose much of their fleet. They go instead to the coast of Goa. They are greeted by a local Goan dealer, (Mano Maniam), and later introduced to Merong Mahawangsa (Stephen Rahman-Hughes), said to be the descendant of Alexander the great himself. Merong is preparing to duel against Sunder (Ravi Sunderlingam), a Goan nobleman who challenged him after Merong had an illicit relationship with the nobleman's sister, YasodharÄ (Deborah Henry). Merong defeats Sunder and Marcus is impressed by Merong's fighting skill. Subsequently, Merong agrees to escort Marcus to the peninsula while Lycius (Eric Karl Henrik Norman), the Roman fleet admiral returns to Rome and promises to return to Goa with a brand new fleet, carrying the payment in gold for the passage of the prince to the Golden Khersonees. Merong is also promised a ship large enough for him to explore the known world. Merong escorts Marcus to the peninsula and is greeted by the Chinese Admiral Liu Yun (Craig Robert Fong).

Q:Q: What scientist created the modern system for classifying organisms? Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Linnaeus published his classification system in the 1700s. Since then, many new species have been discovered. The biochemistry of many organisms has also become known. Eventually, scientists realized that Linnaeus’s system of classification needed revision. Choices: - Bohr - Newton - Pasteur - linnaeus A: A:","completion":"The scientist who created the modern system for classifying organisms is Linnaeus. Carl Linnaeus, also known as Carl von Linné, was a renowned Swedish botanist, physician, and zoologist. He excelled in the 18th century and developed a method of naming, classifying, and ranking organisms that is still largely in use — and continually being expanded upon — today. This system of classification is known as the Linnaean taxonomy, which applied a binomial nomenclature to the organism he classified. This system is considered the basis of modern taxonomy. It brought a sense of systematic order to the then chaotic world of biological science. In this system, every species gets a two-part name – the genus it belongs to and a specific epithet. This produced a unique name for every species. For example, the binomial name for a human is Homo sapiens. The paragraph provided also alludes to Linnaeus’s system as it talks about his publication of the classification system in the 1700s and how it elicited a need for revision with the discovery of new species and advancing understandings of biochemistry. This changing nature of scientific understanding and subsequent revision of established systems hint towards the dynamic and evolving nature of scientific truths. However Linnaeus’ revolutionary contribution provided a workable system that has been built upon and refined ever since to accommodate these newer discoveries. Overall, his work on the classification of organisms has had a significant influence on the field of biology, or more specifically, the sub-discipline of taxonomy and systematics. Other scientists listed such as Bohr, Newton, and Pasteur were significant contributors to their respective fields but were not involved in organism classification. Bohr was a physicist who made foundational contributions to understanding atomic structure and quantum theory. Newton, also a physicist and mathematician, is best known for his laws of motion and universal gravitation. Pasteur was a biologist, microbiologist, and chemist renowned for his work on vaccination, microbial fermentation, and pasteurization. So, among the options given, Linnaeus is the correct answer as he was the one who indeed developed the modern system for classifying organisms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This sentence comes to its conclusion emphasizing that the individual has a preference for wearing dresses over pants as it enhances her sense of beauty and confidence. By opting for option \\"A. pants\\", the sentence provides a clear reason for her dislike towards wearing pants and her inclination towards dresses. Wearing clothes that make one feel beautiful and comfortable is an essential aspect of self-expression and building confidence. For many, their choice of attire serves as an extension of their personality and conveys their personal preferences. In the given sentence, the reason for her preference is the feeling of being less beautiful while wearing pants. It is important to recognize that beauty is subjective and depends on an individual's perspective. What the individual perceives as beautiful may not necessarily align with societal expectations or norms and might be different for each person. Moreover, personal style and clothing preferences can also be influenced by a variety of factors, including cultural background, body shape, personal experiences, and even the environment. For some individuals, feeling more beautiful in dresses could be attributed to feeling more feminine or adhering to traditional gender roles, while others might simply find the flow and design of dresses more appealing. In conclusion, the sentence ends on a note that highlights the individual's personal preference and the connection between her sense of beauty and her clothing choices. It emphasizes the importance of wearing what makes one feel good about themselves and the role that clothing can play in defining one's self-image. By choosing option \\"A. pants\\", it illustrates that her love for wearing dresses is due to the feeling of being less beautiful in pants, thus making the sentence more coherent and effectively conveying the intended message."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Emmet Walsh as various images of the Texas landscape are shown. The film then shifts to a conversation between Abby (Frances McDormand) and Ray (John Getz) in a car as it drives through a heavy downpour at night. They seem to be discussing Abby's bad marriage and Ray indicates that he's driving her to Houston. But instead of driving Abby to Houston, Ray drives to a motel and they have sex. We later find out that Julian Marty (Dan Hedaya), who owns a Texas bar, has suspected Abby's affair with Ray, one of his bartenders, so he hires private detective Loren Visser (M. Emmet Walsh) to take photos of them. When Visser reports back to Marty, he teases him about being cuckolded. The morning after their tryst, Marty makes a silent phone call to Ray and Abby. The following day Ray goes to the bar to collect his earnings, two weeks worth of work, but instead confronts Marty and quits his job. Marty threatens Ray's life and advises him not to trust Abby, that she will one day tell him she \\"hasn't done anything funny\\" and he won't believe her. Marty then hires Visser to kill the couple. Visser suggests he take a fishing trip to Corpus Christi to establish an alibi. He then breaks into Ray's home, steals Abby's gun, and photographs the sleeping couple through the bedroom window. Visser presents an edited photo of their fake corpses to Marty, who dumps four dead fish on his desk. Marty goes to the bathroom to vomit, then opens the safe to give Visser his 10,000 fee. Visser then shoots Marty with Abby's gun in a double cross, leaving her gun at the scene as evidence that she killed Marty. But he accidentally leaves his cigarette lighter and does not realize that Marty has stolen one of the incriminating photographs and locked it in the safe. Ray returns to the bar to get his last paycheck and accidentally kicks Abby's gun, firing it. He finds a motionless Marty and decides to cover up the murder. He cleans up the blood and disposes of evidence in a backyard...

Looks like tree nuts, red wine, and plenty of sleep can all help you stay fit. Researchers found that nut eaters weighed less and had a lower waist circumference and BMI than those who don't eat nuts, the Daily Mail reports. The snacks may also help fight heart disease. Meanwhile, scientists have spotted a compound in red wine that battles obesity by slowing the growth of fat cells. The compound, piceatannol, may also fight neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, the Mail notes. Sleep habits can also have an effect on your weight: Research subjects who got less than five and a half hours burned some 120 fewer calories a day, leading to a 12.5 pound weight gain over a year. (Another study finds that those who sleep less also consume more calories.) Lastly, some news for diet soda fanatics: What you eat is apparently more important than what you drink. Some 32% of diet soda drinkers who ate a \\"Western\\" diet of meats, fried food, and sugars developed metabolic syndrome over two decades, compared to 20% of diet soda fans who ate a \\"prudent\\" diet of fruits and veggies, fish, and whole grains. The lowest risk, at 17.8%? Those who followed a \\"prudent\\" diet and drank no soda, NPR reports. Expand this summary.","completion":"A variety of research findings offer new insights into maintaining a healthy weight, with tree nuts, red wine, proper sleep, and a balanced diet being key factors. Firstly, tree nuts consumption has been linked with numerous health benefits. Research has shown that individuals who regularly consume tree nuts tend to weigh less, have a smaller waist circumference, and possess a lower body mass index (BMI) compared to those who do not eat nuts. The presence of nutrients and antioxidants in nuts contributes to the decreased risk of heart diseases, making them an advantageous addition to one's diet. In addition to nuts, red wine has also been found to assist in maintaining a healthy weight. Scientists have discovered piceatannol, a compound present in red wine, that aids in combating obesity by reducing the growth of fat cells. Besides its positive effects on weight management, piceatannol also offers protection against cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, further signifying the importance of moderate red wine consumption. Sleep is another crucial factor that can impact one's weight. Studies have shown that individuals who sleep for less than five and a half hours tend to burn approximately 120 fewer calories per day than those who sleep more, which could lead to a weight gain of 12.5 pounds in a year. Moreover, people who get insufficient sleep often consume more calories than those who enjoy a full night's rest. Lastly, diet soda consumption has been linked with varied health outcomes, depending on one's food habits. Research has found that 32% of diet soda drinkers who consumed a \\"Western\\" diet, consisting of meats, fried foods, and sugars, developed metabolic syndrome over 20 years. However, only 20% of diet soda consumers who followed a \\"prudent\\" diet rich in fruits, vegetables, fish, and whole grains experienced the same outcomes. The lowest risk rate of 17.8% was observed in those who adhered to a prudent diet without any soda intake. In summary, incorporating tree nuts and red wine into a balanced diet, maintaining healthy sleep habits, and reducing or eliminating soda consumption can all contribute to better weight management and overall health. These findings emphasize the importance of making conscious lifestyle choices in order to promote long-term well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Would \\"Tradition ascribes authorship of the book to Isaiah son of Amoz , but now scholars widely agree that the book is the work of three different authors - few scholars deny this view, and those that do, do so for theological reasons.\\" be a reasonable answer? Available choices: A). No; B). Yes; A:","completion":"A). No; While your description of the multiple authors of the book of Isaiah and the reasons for disagreement among scholars is accurate, it does not directly address the meaning of the specific verses mentioned, Isaiah 55:8-9. To provide a more detailed and thorough answer, one should examine the context and content of these verses. Isaiah 55:8-9 states: \\"For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.\\" These verses contrast the ways and thoughts of God with those of humans. The Lord's thoughts and ways are different from – and higher than – that of human beings. This distinction expresses the transcendent nature of God and demonstrates His incomprehensible wisdom and knowledge. In the context of the book of Isaiah, these verses serve to remind the people of Israel that God's ways are ultimately beyond human understanding, and therefore, they should trust and rely on Him in times of hardship, deliverance, and prophecy. A more detailed answer to the question about the meaning of these verses should include the context and content of Isaiah 55:8-9, relating to the distinction between God's thoughts and ways compared to those of humans. Additionally, including the information about the authorship and scholarly debate as supplementary context to the overall understanding of the book of Isaiah would provide a well-rounded answer."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sentence 1: Please turn down the volume on the stereo. Sentence 2: The kids played their music at full volume. Does volume mean the same thing in these two sentences?","completion":"In both sentences, the term \\"volume\\" refers to the level of sound or loudness produced by an audio source, in this case, the stereo system and the music played by the kids. However, the context in which the term is used is different in each sentence. Let me provide a detailed explanation of each sentence: Sentence 1: \\"Please turn down the volume on the stereo.\\" In this sentence, \\"volume\\" refers to the loudness of the audio output from the stereo system. The request is to decrease the level of sound being produced by the stereo. The term \\"volume\\" is used directly concerning a device (the stereo) and its settings. The person making the request is asking for an adjustment to be made on the stereo system to reduce the loudness. In this context, \\"volume\\" carries the idea of control or an adjustable property of the stereo. Sentence 2: \\"The kids played their music at full volume.\\" In this sentence, \\"volume\\" also refers to the loudness of the audio output, but the context has shifted. Instead of being directly related to a device's settings, it is now referring to the intensity with which the music was played by the kids. The term \\"full volume\\" implies that the music is being played at the maximum loudness possible. Although \\"volume\\" refers to the same concept of loudness or sound level, in this case, it is being used to describe the manner in which the kids engaged with their music. The focus is on the kids' experience and the intensity of their chosen activity. In conclusion, although \\"volume\\" refers to the level of sound or loudness in both sentences, the contexts in which the term is being used are different. The first sentence emphasizes the control or adjustment of an audio device, while the second sentence focuses on the intensity and experience of the kids playing their music. Despite these contextual differences, the core meaning of \\"volume\\" as a level of sound remains consistent across both sentences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is mostly used for general aviation, but is also served by one commercial airline. Service is subsidized by the Essential Air Service program. Can we draw the following conclusion? Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport does not have more than one commercial airline.","completion":"Yes, based on the information provided, we can draw the conclusion that Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport (SHD) does not have more than one commercial airline operating at the facility. This information is confirmed by the statement: \\"It is mostly used for general aviation but is also served by one commercial airline.\\" The airport, located near Staunton, Virginia, primarily caters to general aviation, which may include private aircraft, flight training, and other non-commercial aviation activities. Also mentioned is its participation in the Essential Air Service (EAS) program, a government initiative aimed at ensuring a minimal level of scheduled air service to smaller, underserved communities. The EAS program subsidizes the operations of the commercial airline serving the Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport, making it possible for this single airline to provide scheduled service despite potentially lower passenger demand. Furthermore, airports can have multiple commercial airlines serving different routes and destinations. However, in the case of Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport, given its smaller size and primary focus on general aviation, it has only attracted one commercial airline. Factors influencing this may include the airport's infrastructure, proximity to larger airports, or the surrounding communities' size and travel demands.

Article: What is a six-letter word that immediately comes to mind when you need some information on the Internet? You probably thought of Google. But Google wasn't always the name of the famous search engine. In fact, the original name was BackRub! BackRub was the name two graduate students gave to the new search engine they developed in 1996. They called it BackRub because the engine used backlinks to measure the popularity of Web sites. Later, they wanted a better name -- a name that suggests huge quantities of data. They thought of the word googol. (A googol is a number followed by 100 zeros.) When they checked the Internet registry of names to see if googol was already taken, one of the students misspelled the word by mistake, and that's how Google was born. Google is just one example of a name change in the business world. Many other companies have decided to change their names or the names of their products. Here are some more examples: Jerry Yang and David Filo, two young computer specialists, developed a guide to Internet content in 1994. They called it \\"Jerry and David's Guide to World Wide Web.\\" But they soon realized that this wasn't a very catchy name, so they searched through a dictionary and found a better one: \\"Yahoo.\\" Sometimes companies change their names because of the popularity of one of their products.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Kurt Julian Weill (March 2, 1900 - April 3, 1950) was a German composer, active from the 1920s in his native country, and in his later years in the United States. He was a leading composer for the stage who was best known for his fruitful collaborations with Bertolt Brecht. With Brecht, he developed productions such as his best-known work The Threepenny Opera, which included the ballad \\"Mack the Knife\\". Weill held the ideal of writing music that served a socially useful purpose. In 1922 he joined the Novembergruppe, a group of leftist Berlin artists that included Hanns Eisler and Stefan Wolpe. In February 1924 the conductor Fritz Busch introduced him to the dramatist Georg Kaiser, with whom Weill would have a long-lasting creative partnership resulting in several one-act operas. At Kaiser's house in Grunheide, Weill first met singer/actress Lotte Lenya in the summer of 1924. The couple were married twice: in 1926 and again in 1937 (following their divorce in 1933). She took great care to support Weill's work, and after his death she took it upon herself to increase awareness of his music, forming the Kurt Weill Foundation. From November 1924 to May 1929, Weill wrote hundreds of reviews for the influential and comprehensive radio program guide Der deutsche Rundfunk. Hans Siebert von Heister had already worked with Weill in the November Group, and offered Weill the job shortly after becoming editor-in-chief. Although he had some success with his first mature non-stage works (such as the String Quartet, Op. 8, or the Concerto for Violin and Wind Orchestra, Op. 12), which were influenced by Gustav Mahler, Arnold Schoenberg and Igor Stravinsky, Weill tended more and more to vocal music and musical theatre. His musical theatre work and his songs were extremely popular with the wider public in Germany at the end of the 1920s and the beginning of the 1930s. Weill's music was admired by composers such as Alban Berg, Alexander von Zemlinsky, Darius Milhaud and Stravinsky, but it was also criticised by others: by Schoenberg, who later revised his opinion, and by Anton Webern. His best-known work is The Threepenny Opera (1928), a reworking of John Gay's The Beggar's Opera written in collaboration with Bertolt Brecht. Engel directed the original production of The Threepenny Opera in 1928. It contains Weill's most famous song, \\"Mack the Knife\\" (\\"Die Moritat von Mackie Messer\\"). The stage success was filmed by G. W. Pabst in two language versions: Die 3-Groschen-Oper and L'opera de quat' sous. Weill and Brecht tried to stop the film adaptation through a well publicised lawsuit--which Weill won and Brecht lost. Weill's working association with Brecht, although successful, came to an end over politics in 1930. Though Weill associated with socialism, after Brecht tried to push the play even further into a left wing direction, Weill commented, according to his wife Lotte Lenya, that he was unable to \\"set the communist party manifesto to music.\\" Entity:","completion":"This text is about Kurt Julian Weill, a German composer who was active in the 1920s in Germany and later in the United States.

During major international incidents or crises, America has seldom voted against an incumbent president.

В ходе значительных международных происшествий или кризисных ситуаций, которые имели место в мировой политике, Соединенные Штаты Америки во многих случаях продемонстрировали склонность к поддержке своего действующего президента. Этот фактор обуславливается тем, что в сложные периоды население страны ожидает от своего главы государства решительных действий и определенной стратегии для стабилизации ситуации. Верность нации своему президенту может объясняться также необходимостью демонстрации солидарности и сплоченности перед лицом общей, зачастую внешней угрозы. Подобна реакция заложена в основе человеческой природы и взаимодействия между представителями социума. Соединенные Штаты Америки, как мировая сверхдержава, находятся на виду более чем в одном случае международных разногласий или чрезвычайных обстоятельств, что способствует активному процессу формирования общественного мнения в пользу действующего президента и его администрации. Однако не стоит упускать из виду и тот факт, что решение о поддержке или осуждении своего президента население страны принимает исходя из анализа его предыдущих успехов и ошибок. Иными словами, если действующий президент уже позитивно зарекомендовал себя в решении предыдущих кризисов или внутриполитических проблем, вероятность того что он получит доверие народа возрастает. Резюмируя, можно сказать, что причинами поддержки американского народа в случае крупных международных инцидентов или кризисов являются следующие факторы: необходимость выработки совместной стратегии, стремление к солидарности перед возникающими угрозами, оценка предыдущих достижений и неудач действующего президента.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? pick from the following. [a]. Soak the lid in hot water for a few minutes.. [b]. Soak the lid in cold water for a few minutes..","completion":"The more sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning is [a]. Soak the lid in hot water for a few minutes. There are several reasons why this solution is more effective for taking off a stuck jar lid compared to soaking the lid in cold water: 1. Thermal expansion: When you soak the lid in hot water, the metal or plastic material of the lid will undergo thermal expansion. This means that the material will expand slightly due to the heat. Research has shown that molecules of most substances move faster and spread out when heated. When the lid expands, the tightness of its grip on the jar decreases, which should make it easier to twist off. 2. Reduction of air pressure: If the contents of the jar were hot when the jar was sealed, the air inside the jar may have experienced some cooling when the contents settled. This can create a vacuum as the air pressure inside the jar is lower than the outside air pressure. By soaking the lid in hot water, the air pressure inside the jar will increase as the temperature rises, equalizing the pressure and making it easier to remove the lid. 3. Softening of any residue: Sometimes a stuck jar lid can be due to food residue or a sticky substance creating a bond between the lid and the jar. In this case, soaking the lid in hot water can soften the residue, making it easier to loosen and twist off the lid. 4. Increased grip on the lid: The process of holding the jar under hot water will also warm your hands. This can potentially improve your grip on the lid, making it easier to twist off. When your hands are cold and wet from cold water, your grip may be compromised and it would be harder to generate the necessary torque to loosen the jar lid. In summary, the naive physics reasoning suggests that soaking the jar lid in hot water for a few minutes is the more effective solution for removing a stuck jar lid. Not only does it allow for the expansion of the lid material, but it also helps balance the air pressure inside and outside the jar, softens any residue sticking the lid to the jar, and potentially improves grip."},{"prompt":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: In New York City, Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) checks in to the Roosevelt Hotel under the false name of Walker, goes to his hotel room on the 21st floor, and climbs on the ledge, apparently ready to commit suicide.

Nick was given a 25-year sentence but escaped from the Sing Sing Correctional Facility one month earlier, after being allowed to attend his father's funeral. Nick, however, maintains his innocence and accuses Englander of framing him for the theft of the diamond, as Englander lost his fortune and was too proud to sell the diamond.

Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed most commonly on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it is prepared for by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night; in some traditions, Christmastide includes an Octave. The traditional Christmas narrative, the Nativity of Jesus, delineated in the New Testament says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies; when Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then disseminated the message furthermore.

Article:Minutes of a meeting in 1985 show Leon Brittan then home secretary, wanted to avoid \\"any form of enquiry\\" into policing of the picket lines. Miners say the files show successive governments \\"never wanted the truth to come out\\" over the events. But the Home Office said there were few lessons to be learnt from 30 years ago. Eighteen new files have been released to the National Archive, after current Home Secretary Amber Rudd promised that 30 previously unreleased files connected with the strike would be published. Ex-miner Frank Arrowsmith, who was on the picket line during the year long strike, said \\"the suspicion is never going to go away that those in Number 10 and the Home Secretary decided to use the police as a battering ram to defeat the miners\\". \\"If a government can get away with burying this you're thinking what's next? But given what they've released so far, I don't think we're going to go away, we are one day going to hold them to account,\\" he added. The documents do not show evidence to support the claim made by some miners that ministers in the Thatcher government were directly controlling the operational tactics of police forces. But Nicholas Jones, who covered the strike as the BBC's industrial correspondent, said: \\"These documents really open the window on what the government and the police were thinking in 1985. \\"There is no sign of any feeling of remorse in these files, in fact the police are quite dismissive about the event\\". The files were released after Ms Rudd ruled out holding an inquiry into the so-called Battle of Orgreave.. In June 1984 thousands of police and striking miners clashed violently at the Orgreave coking plant in South Yorkshire. South Yorkshire Police has been criticised for how they conducted themselves during the incident, and it has been claimed the force used the same tactics on the Liverpool fans in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster. \\"I find it worrying that there were immediate efforts from the very top of government to shut down any enquiry into the miners strike\\", said Labour MP Andy Burnham who has campaigned on behalf the Hillsborough families. \\"The events at Orgreave and Hillsborough can't be separated. We can't have the full truth about Hillsborough until we also know what happened four years earlier\\". There are 15 Home Office files still to be passed to be the National Archive, and its understood the South Yorkshire force is yet to publish 65 files connected with its actions during the strike. A Home Office spokesman said: \\"The Home Secretary's decision that there will no inquiry into the events at Orgreave was made after careful consideration of the key purposes of an inquiry and, critically, taking into account how the policing landscape has changed fundamentally since 1984 at all levels. \\"There would be very few lessons for the policing system today to be learned from any review of the events and practices of three decades ago.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"This article is about some important papers from a long time ago.

Even though the papers don't show this, they do show that the people in charge knew about the fight and didn't want to do anything about it. Some people now want to know more about what happened, because they think it might be connected to another problem that happened later, during a football game.

A Subglacial Volcanic Eruption in Iceland Could Reach the Atmosphere Updated Sunday, August 24 at 10:00 a.m. A subglacial eruption is underway at Iceland’s Bardarbunga volcano, where there have been thousands of earthquakes in the past week, Iceland’s Meteorological Office said Saturday. Seismic data suggests that volcanic lava is melting ice beneath the Vatnajokull glacier, said seismic vulcanologist Melissa Pfeffer, Reuters reports. It’s unclear whether the eruption will break through the ice and shoot steam and ash into the atmosphere. The amount of ash produced in a larger eruption would depend on how thick the ice is, Pfeffer said, with thicker ice likely to cause a more explosive and ash-rich eruption. On Sunday, Iceland lowered its aviation alert level to orange from red, saying there is no sign of an eruption at the Bardarbunga volcano. Iceland had said the day before that an eruption could cause “significant emission of ash into the atmosphere” and set its alert level for the volcano to the highest degree, red. Ash clouds can cause a massive headache for international airlines, as aircraft have to be rerouted to avoid them. More than 100,000 flights were cancelled in 2010 after the eruption of Eyjafjallajokul, an Icelandic volcano that produced a cloud so large it obstructed air travel.

Write a summary based on this article: Adrian Wojnarowski explains how moving to L.A. could benefit LeBron James off the hardwood and how it will help the Lakers' recruiting strategy. (1:33) LOS ANGELES -- LeBron James' next NBA chapter will be set on the West Coast. James will be playing for the Los Angeles Lakers on a four-year, 153.3 million contract. He will try to bring the storied franchise another championship. The announcement was made through his agency, Klutch Sports Group, which announced the deal as 154 million. ESPN's Brian Windhorst reported that the fourth year is a player option. It is the longest deal James has signed since inking a six-year contract with the Miami Heat in 2010. His previous three deals were three years or shorter. James leaves his hometown team as a free agent for the second time in his career. Four years ago, James had stated his intention to finish his career with the Cleveland Cavaliers. Whether the four-time MVP and 14-time All-Star does that or not, he certainly has left his mark on his city. James, 33, thanked his home area in an Instagram story. He wrote in text overlaying a photo from the Cavaliers' 2016 NBA title victory parade, \\"Thank you Northeast Ohio for an incredible 4 seasons. This will always be home.\\" He delivered the first championship to the sports-obsessed city in 52 years and did so with storybook gusto, helping the Cavaliers become the first team in NBA Finals history to rally from a 3-1 series deficit to win it all. The team he took down, the Golden State Warriors, had the best regular-season record in league history, at 73-9. \\"Words do not express the meaning and the feeling this accomplishment brought to the people of Northeast Ohio,\\" Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert said in a lengthy statement thanking James. \\"None of this would have happened if LeBron James did not agree to come back home and lead the Cavaliers to the promised land. \\"LeBron is a family man, first. We wish his kids, his wife, Savannah, his mother, Gloria, and LeBron himself nothing but the best in the years and decades ahead. LeBron's connection to Akron, Cleveland and all of Northeast Ohio will most certainly endure as his commitment to the region and his support of many important causes has been impactful to so many kids and families. \\"LeBron, you came home and delivered the ultimate goal. Nothing but appreciation and gratitude for everything you put into every moment you spent in a Cavaliers uniform. We look forward to the retirement of the famous #23 Cavs jersey one day down the line ...\\" James leaves the Cavaliers franchise as its leader in nearly every major statistical category: games played, points, rebounds, assists and steals. If 2017-18 was his final act in Cleveland, what a show he put on -- playing in all 82 games for the first time in his 15-year career and capping it off with a postseason performance as dominant as any playoff run James has ever been part of. play 1:54 Windhorst says L.A. was the desired location for LeBron Brian Windhorst details how LeBron James came to his decision to leave the Cavaliers for the Lakers. James becomes the first player in NBA history to lead a postseason in scoring and switch teams the following offseason. He joins the illustrious list of NBA legends to play for the Lakers, some of whom have already welcomed James to the family. I am sure the Lakernation is rejoicing The acquisition of LeBron James means that the Lakers are just a smidgen away from being real contenders. Congrats to @MagicJohnson & @LALakersLive et al. Cross your fingers for news from San Antonio. — Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (@kaj33) July 2, 2018 NBA players past and present reacted on Twitter too. James' agent, Rich Paul, called Lakers president of basketball operations Magic Johnson minutes before he sent the announcement tweet, a source told ESPN's Ramona Shelburne. Paul then called Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman as soon as he got off the phone with Johnson. Then the tweet was sent. The Lakers, after failing to get a meeting with free-agent target Paul George prior to George's announcement that he would re-sign with the Oklahoma City Thunder, have secured free agency's most coveted player. In the franchise's biggest free-agent splash since Shaquille O'Neal became a Laker in the summer of 1996, Johnson and general manager Rob Pelinka have delivered a major piece of the plan they plotted when they joined the Lakers in February 2017. Johnson took the job largely to restore the franchise's glorious past and recruit elite superstars to Los Angeles -- something the franchise had struggled with in recent years. James joins the league's second-youngest team when weighted by playing time from last season. The Lakers have an up-and-coming young core of Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Kyle Kuzma and Josh Hart. Top 8 Scorers Points A Laker? Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 38,387 Yes Karl Malone 36,928 Yes Kobe Bryant 33,643 Yes Michael Jordan 32,292 No Wilt Chamberlain 31,419 Yes Dirk Nowitzki 31,187 No LeBron James 31,038 Yes Shaquille O'Neal 28,596 Yes Which of the Lakers' young prospects will stay to play alongside James remains to be seen. The Lakers have been trying to acquire Kawhi Leonard, who reportedly is unhappy with the San Antonio Spurs and would prefer to play for the Lakers. The Spurs would surely want as many prospects and assets as possible from the Lakers in exchange for the two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year. A source told Shelburne that the Lakers felt a sense of urgency this week to find a co-star to play alongside James, either through free agency with George or through a trade for Leonard. Johnson went to one of James' houses in Los Angeles late Saturday night and met with him for several hours, sources told Shelburne. However, when Johnson spoke to James and James' camp at the opening of free agency, James assured the Lakers that this was a long-term play for him and his decision wouldn't be affected by a single transaction the Lakers could make under time pressure. James made it clear that this latest NBA-altering decision would be made with his family in mind. James has two homes in Los Angeles, where his off-the-court business interests can thrive. Johnson and Pelinka will continue to work to surround James with more talent in order to challenge the Warriors and Houston Rockets in the Western Conference. But Johnson has landed the biggest fish he was trying to catch. Lakers controlling owner Jeanie Buss said she had ultimate faith in Johnson and Pelinka, but she also said last week that she wants to see the Lakers, who went 35-47 last season, return to the postseason for the first time since 2012-13. Johnson said last week that if he failed to add stars to the Lakers by next summer, he would step down from his job. That is moot with the team landing James. play 3:23 LeBron chooses Lakers for next chapter Mark Schwarz breaks down LeBron James' path to the Lakers, with whom he will continue to chase Michael Jordan's GOAT title and the dynasty of the Dubs. \\"No pressure on me,\\" Johnson said last week when asked if he felt urgency to add a star in this free agency. \\"I am going to do my job. I have always done that. ... Do you know how many Finals I have been in [as a player]? So you think I am worried about this? I have played against Larry Bird in the Finals. I mean, come on, man. I have been in nine Finals. I have been in college NCAA championships.\\" When told that this is a different job than being the point guard who orchestrated the Lakers' \\"Showtime\\" dynasty, Johnson reminded people of who he is. \\"I'm Magic Johnson. I am still the same dude,\\" he said. \\"I am not going to change. No pressure on me. I am going to do my job. That's what I do. I do my job. I'm excited. It's fun. I am looking forward to it.\\" And enjoying it. ESPN's Dave McMenamin contributed to this report. ||||| LeBron James is on the move once again. Bringing an end to months (and for some fans, years) of speculation, James announced through his agent on Sunday that he is ending his second stint as a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers to join the Los Angeles Lakers for the upcoming NBA season. “LeBron James, four time NBA MVP, three time NBA finals MVP, fourteen time NBA All Star, and two time Olympic gold medalist has agreed to a four year, 154 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers,” reads a press release tweeted by Klutch Sports Group, James’ agency, on Sunday. It was widely thought that James, who turns 34 in December, would leave Cleveland for a team on the verge of championship contention, or a franchise with the flexibility to create one. Doing so would not only give the athlete a chance at a ninth NBA finals appearance but would likely lead him to another match-up against back-to-back NBA champion Golden State Warriors. (The warriors have faced James four consecutive times for the Larry O’Brien trophy, winning three of the match-ups.) But James’ decision wasn’t cut-and-dry from the start, as several teams — barring some trades or free agency signings — were in solid position to sign the star, including the Philadelphia 76ers, Boston Celtics, Houston Rockets, Los Angeles Clippers and the Cavaliers. Since the 2018 NBA Finals ended in an embarrassing sweep of the Cavaliers by the Warriors, James has said that his next move would come down to what he felt was best for his children — Bryce Maximus James, 10, LeBron James Jr., 13, and Zhuri James, 3 — and his wife, Savannah Brinson. Although James has kept mum about any preferences, that hasn’t stopped NBA analysts and fans from speculating where he’d end up. Discussions about which team is the favorite to land the superstar have changed from week to week. Jason Miller/Getty RELATED: ‘Worst Play in NBA Finals History?’ Twitter (and LeBron James) React to JR Smith’s Epic Fail Initially, many believed that James would switch conferences from the East to the West to sign with the Rockets, joining all-stars Chris Paul and James Harden. The Rockets held a 3-2 series lead over the Warriors in the Western Conference Finals before Paul suffered a hamstring injury, which allowed the Warriors to take the series in seven games. The Sixers also seemed to be a good fit, as James would likely be able to reach the finals once again with young stars like Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. But the tide appeared to turn in the Lakers’ favor in early June when NBA legend Gary Payton said in an interview that LeBron James Jr. had signed up to attend an LA-area school for eighth grade. Then, Kawhi Leonard of the San Antonio Spurs allegedly demanded a trade, saying he preferred to be sent to the Lakers for the upcoming season, according to ESPN. This fueled rumors that James, Leonard, and free agent Paul George of the Oklahoma City Thunder were planning to create a super team in Los Angeles to rival the Warriors. George signed a contract with Oklahoma City as soon as free agency began. Because Leonard cannot opt out of his contract until next summer, he hasn’t had much say in where he’ll go. And the Spurs have been reluctant to trade their best player to another team in the Western Conference. Still, without another big-time player heading to the LA team, many were unsure whether James would pick the Lakers after all. Now that he has made his choice known, the rest of the NBA can plan their next moves. RELATED: LeBron James Explains New Pair of ‘Equality’ Shoes This isn’t the first time James has sent shockwaves through the NBA as a free agent. In a controversial move, now known as “The Decision,” James took to ESPN for a televised interview in 2010 where he announced he was leaving Cleveland and “taking [his] talents to South Beach” to join Dwyane Wade and the Miami Heat. Many criticized James’ decision and denounced the dramatic announcement. Thus, the phrase “taking my talents” quickly became a meme. At the start of his first season in Miami, James expressed slight regret about how he went about breaking the news. “If I had to go back on it, I probably would do it a little bit different”, James told the New York Times. “But I’m happy with my decision.” He would go on to win two consecutive championships with the Heat in 2012 and 2013. But James would surprise the basketball world once again in 2014 when he announced that he was rejoining the Cavaliers in a Sports Illustrated article titled “I’m Coming Home.” This time, the announcement was well-received by many (except Heat fans, of course). Beck Diefenbach/AFP/Getty Images Though James — who was born a short ways from Cleveland in Akron, Ohio — is leaving the team once again, during his four years back, he helped to give something to the city they never had before: an NBA championship. Along with point guard Kyrie Irving, James led the Cavs to a thrilling Game 7 victory over the Warriors in the 2016 NBA Finals. It was the first professional sports title for Cleveland in over half-a-century, and, though his time with the team is over (for now?), for the city, those memories will certainly last a lifetime. ||||| Summary:","completion":"LeBron James will leave the Cleveland Cavaliers for the second time in his career to join the Los Angeles Lakers on a four-year, 153.3 million contract.

Kylie Radatti, 34, was given a six month jail sentence after she upset a stranger's child by spinning them too fast on a merry-go-round. A woman who upset a stranger's child by spinning them too fast on a merry-go-round has been given a six month jail sentence. Kylie Jean Radatti, 34, was attending the Bongo Beat event at a Gold Coast park on Sunday where she was playing with a number of children at a public playground. Ms Radatti asked a four-year-old boy if he wanted a turn but when she began spinning him around the boy became upset and screamed, the Gold Coast Bulletin reported. On Monday, she pleaded guilty to one count of public nuisance and was handed a six month jail sentence but was released on parole. Ms Radatti said she told the four-year-old she was going to go fast before he jumped on the merry-go-round at Justins Park in Burleigh Heads. 'He said he'd have a go. He had a bit of a scream then he got off and the other kids jumped on and off we went,' she told the Bulletin. 'There was one family that decided they wanted to ring the police and they hunted me down and handcuffed me in front of everyone.' In Southport Magistrates Court, Prosecutor Ben Fotheringham told the court Ms Radatti spun the playground ride and caused the child to scream for help, adding that he was 'incredibly distressed' by being spun around fast. Ms Radatti's solicitor said the Burleigh Waters woman was 'heavily intoxicated' at the time but that the matter did not involve violence. Ms Radatti, 34, was attending the Bongo Beat event at Justins Park in Burleigh on the Gold Coast. 'This is possibly what could best be described as poor decision making, but no other parents were opposed to this,' he said. Magistrate Dermot Kehoe said Ms Radatti had risked injuring the four-year-old boy, and that she should not have been playing with strangers' children. Court documents show Ms Radatti has a criminal history dating back to 2005. She was convicted of a number of other offences including assault occasioning bodily harm, assaulting or obstructing a police officer, breaching probation and bail conditions, and other public nuisance offences. In Southport Magistrates Court she pleaded guilty to one count of public nuisance and was handed a six month jail sentence but was released on parole.

Article: Sugar--free beets that still taste sweet, tastier tomatoes and brighter-colored fruits and vegetables that stay ripe longer are all foods that are being grown now. How can they carry traits, such as being tastier, brighter, and riper? They are genetically engineered. Genetic engineering is like making a change in a recipe. For example, when you make cakes, you mix together all of the usual ingredients. If you add an extra ingredient, like salt, the cakes will taste differently. Genes are ingredients in the recipe for life. They carry the traits of living things. Your genes dictate what color hair and eyes you'll have, how tall you'll be, as well as many other traits. Genes carry traits for plants, too. By adding genes to a plant, you can sometimes create new traits. For example, adding a certain gene to a potato plant can make the potato plant distasteful to bugs . This makes some farmers happy because they don't have to use chemicals to keep bugs away from their plants. It sounds great, but some people are opposed to the idea of food that is genetically engineered. Ronnie Cummins, from the Campaign for Food Safety, is against it. He says that one of the major concerns is allergies . Supermarkets don't always label foods that are genetically engineered. A customer could unknowingly buy food that has an added gene from another plant that he or she is allergic to. It could be dangerous. Gary Burton from Monsanto, a seed company that engineers food, disagrees. He says his company tests for allergies. Burton believes that genetic engineering is a valuable tool for making better food. The technology can help farmers use less insecticide and grow healthier crops. Burton thinks there are many advantages. But Cummins says that we just don't know what will happen in the future if we keep adding genes to foods. We could mistakenly create a monster. People have different opinions about genetic engineering. One side supports it and thinks it will only help us. The other side is opposed to playing with nature and fears... Question: In general, who does not support the idea of genetic food? Answer: The answer is:","completion":"In general, people who do not support the idea of genetically engineered food are those who have concerns regarding potential health risks, such as allergies, and those who are opposed to interfering with nature.

Providing them with a comfortable and engaging environment is the key to ensuring their happiness and well-being. In this article, we will discuss some essential tips to make their cages a stimulating and comfortable habitat for your feathered friend. 1. Make sure their cage is large enough: One of the most important factors in choosing a cage for your pet bird is ensuring that it is spacious enough for them to move around freely and spread their wings. A large cage will not only be critical to their physical well-being but will also help in addressing issues such as stress or boredom. To determine the appropriate cage size, take into account the bird's size, species, and the number of birds you plan to house. Remember to consider the extra space required for perches, toys, and other accessories. 2. Place the cage in an active area of your home: Birds are social creatures that thrive on interaction and stimulation. Placing their cage in an active area of your home, such as the living room or family room, will help them feel more connected with you and your family members. This will prevent feelings of isolation and loneliness while providing the necessary mental stimulation. However, take care to avoid direct sunlight and drafts, as well as areas with constant loud noises or too much foot traffic. 3. Add a variety of perches to encourage flight: Including different types and sizes of perches in your bird's cage will encourage them to fly from one to another, promoting exercise and improving their overall health. Providing a variety of perches made from different materials, such as wood, rope, or plastic, is also essential for maintaining their foot health and preventing foot injuries. Ensure each perch is the appropriate size for your bird's species and securely attached to the cage. 4. Put a few toys inside their cage: Toys play a vital role in providing mental stimulation and entertainment for your pet bird. They also help to alleviate boredom, which can lead to behavioral issues such as excessive noise-making or self-harming. Add a variety of toys, such as those designed for chewing, foraging, or climbing, and be sure to rotate them regularly to maintain your bird's interest. Always ensure that any toys are size-appropriate for your bird and are made from safe materials. 5. Set a bath inside of their cage: Providing your pet bird with a bath inside their cage offers several benefits. It helps promote healthy feather condition, allows for important preening activities, and offers an opportunity for exercise and play. Ensure the bath is shallow and easy for your bird to access, with a non-slip surface for their safety. Remember to clean and refill the bath regularly to keep it hygienic for your pet. Conclusion: By following these essential tips, you can offer your pet bird an environment that is both comfortable and stimulating. A well-appointed and spacious cage, coupled with regular social interaction, ensures your feathered friend will lead a happy, healthy, and fulfilling life. Remember, a contented and engaged bird is not only a joy to have around but also a testament to your commitment to their well-being."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

James Caan, an accomplished American actor, rose to fame in the early '60s and continued to have a successful acting career spanning decades. Some of his other notable roles include Sonny Corleone in \\"The Godfather\\" (1972), Paul Sheldon in \\"Misery\\" (1990), and Ed Deline in the television series \\"Las Vegas\\" (2003-2008). In \\"El Dorado\\" specifically, Caan's character Mississippi (full name: Alan Bourdillion Trahern) is a young and somewhat inexperienced gunslinger with a talent for knife throwing. He joins forces with two experienced gunfighters, played by John Wayne (as Cole Thornton) and Robert Mitchum (as Sheriff J.P. Harrah), to defend a ranching family against a crooked land baron in the town of El Dorado. The film focuses on themes of loyalty, friendship, and redemption, and Mississippi's character serves as a central figure who helps bridge the gap between the two older and more experienced gunfighters. Ultimately, James Caan's performance as Mississippi in \\"El Dorado\\" is highly regarded, as the film continues to be a classic in the western genre.

On the day that France surrenders to Nazi Germany in 1940, Prudence \\"Pru\\" Cathaway a strong-willed young woman from the upper class, joins the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, a military organisation linked to the Royal Air Force, to her family's surprise. Her aunt Iris and uncle Wilbur disapprove since she has chosen to serve as a private rather than as an officer. However, family butler Parsons privately expresses his support. She goes off to training camp, where she makes friends with fellow WAAF Violet Worthing. As a favor to Violet, Prudence agrees to go on a double date one night; she is paired with Clive Briggs, a moody mysterious man with a dark secret. He seems to her rather bitter about something and is indifferent, even hostile, to her aristocratic background, but she likes him, and he asks her out again. Romance blooms. On a holiday together on the southern coast, Pru twice overhears Clive talking in his sleep. The second time, she wakes him up, but he does not want to talk about it. Then his friend Monty shows up.

No wave musicians such as the Contortions, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, Mars, DNA, Theoretical Girls and Rhys Chatham instead experimented with noise, dissonance and atonality in addition to non-rock styles.

Let's elaborate on this. Premise: You asked these men and women to help protect your village from the slavery that will soon fall upon them by a large band of murderers most vile. The given premise implies a couple of things: 1. There is a potential threat to the village from a group of dangerous individuals. 2. You believe that the intervention of these men and women will help guard your village against this imminent threat. Hypothesis: You didn't need any help at all. The hypothesis contradicts the premise. If you didn't need any help, then asking the men and women to protect your village wouldn't make sense. It means that you might have either exaggerated or misjudged the severity of the threat, or that you underestimated your own abilities to defend the village. To determine if the hypothesis is true, we would have to examine additional information and context: 1. Did the threat to the village materialize as expected? If it turned out that the perceived threat was not as severe as initially thought, then it is possible that you didn't need any help in the end. 2. Were there any other factors or circumstances that were not considered in the premise, such as the availability of different resources or ways to counter the threat that were not initially apparent? 3. Did the men and women who were asked to help turn out to be a hindrance instead of an asset in protecting the village? If so, perhaps you would have been better off without them. Only by analyzing these and other relevant factors can we conclude whether or not the hypothesis is true. However, based on the information given in the premise alone, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true.

Since 1827, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has always simultaneously held the office of Second Lord of the Treasury when that person has not also been the Prime Minister. The official residence of the Second Lord of The Treasury is 11 Downing Street. - Her Majesty's Government (HMG), commonly referred to as the UK government or British government, is the central government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. - Downing Street in London, United Kingdom, has for more than three hundred years housed the official residences of two of the most senior British Cabinet ministers: the First Lord of the Treasury, an office now synonymous with that of Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; and the Second Lord of the Treasury, an office held by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Prime Minister's official residence is 10 Downing Street; the Chancellor's official residence is next door at Number 11. The government's Chief Whip has an official residence at Number 12, although the current Chief Whip's residence is at Number 9. - The Chancellor and Under-Treasurer of Her Majesty's Exchequer, commonly known as the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is a senior official within the Government of the United Kingdom and head of Her Majesty's Treasury. The office is a British Cabinet-level position. - The Chief Whip is a political office in some legislatures whose task is to administer the whipping system that tries to ensure that members of the party attend and vote as the party leadership desires. In British politics, the Chief Whip of the governing party in the House of Commons is usually also appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, a Cabinet position. The Government Chief Whip has an official residence at 12 Downing Street. However, the Chief Whip's office is currently located at 9 Downing Street. - The First Lord of the Treasury is the head of the commission exercising the ancient office of Lord High Treasurer in the United Kingdom, and is now always also the Prime Minister. This office is not equivalent to the usual position of the \\"Treasurer\\" in other governments; the closer equivalent of a Treasurer in the United Kingdom is the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who is the Second Lord of the Treasury. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is the head of Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom.

By the time this film was released I had seen Chorus Line on stage 4 times, and had been anticipating most eagerly the long-rumored production of a film of the story. My wife and I were in line hours before the box office opened on the day the film was released. It was not just a disappointment, it was a kick in the abdomen. First, the story was \\"moved outside,\\" so to speak, by including scenes not in the confines of the theater. Those confines are a large portion of the meaning and impact of the story. Second & Third together (assign your own order): one of the original songs, with very dynamic dance number, was removed; a song which was NOT in the stage production was added. Say what ?? I'm confused! The only reason I gave this film 2 stars instead of 1 is my admiration for the talent and hard work of the performers. I've now seen Chorus Line on stage 6 times, and wouldn't mind seeing it 6 more times before I die. It is superbly written, with wonderful music, and heart- wrenchingly true stories.

We have the math problem: 141 * m = 145 * m - 4 First, let's look at both sides of the equal sign (=). On the left side, we have 141 times some number (m). On the right side, we have 145 times the same number (m) and then subtract 4. We need to find out what number (m) will make both sides equal. Let's work on it together. Step 1: We need to get all the m's on one side of the equation. To do this, we will subtract 141 * m from both sides. New equation: 0 = (145 * m - 141 * m) - 4 Step 2: Now, let's simplify the equation. On the right side, we have 145 * m - 141 * m. Since we are multiplying the same number (m) by two different numbers (145 and 141) and then subtracting, we can write it as (145 - 141) * m. New equation: 0 = (4 * m) - 4 Step 3: We are almost there. Now, let's find the number m. To do this, we need to move the -4 to the left side. We will add 4 to both sides. New equation: 4 = 4 * m Step 4: Lastly, we want to know how many times does 4 multiply itself to get 4 (4 * m = 4). To find this, we will divide both sides by 4.

The movie portrays the story of a forensic pathologist called Jack Cucchiaio (played by Paul Clemens; \\"cucchiaio\\" means spoon in Italian), who finds himself being haunted by a deranged looking man (Brian Rohan), who is, without any clear reason, hitting him with a spoon. No-one seems to believe this though as the mysterious attacker only shows up when Jack is alone. He is seen developing a phobia of spoons, stirring his coffee with a fork. Jack attempts to defend himself - stabbing the murderer in the throat with a kitchen knife. But to Jack's surprise his enemy turns out to be immortal, pulling the knife out of his throat and throwing it away, then continuing to hit Jack with the spoon.

Use the following highlights to write an article: Major outlets highlighted PM’s fury, likening him to Fawlty Towers customers. One wrote 'a diner unconvinced by proposed EU menu..refusing to pay bill' Another spoke of him 'abandoning traditional English reserve' in his rant.","completion":"Title: Prime Minister's Fury Over EU Menu Causes Fawlty Towers Comparison In an unprecedented move that has left the media buzzing, the recent outburst from the Prime Minister during EU negotiations has drawn comparisons to the popular British sitcom, Fawlty Towers. Known for its comedic look at the mishaps of a customer-centric hotel proprietor, Fawlty Towers captured the hearts of viewers both in the UK and abroad. However, the storyline that unfolded in the political arena was no laughing matter. The incident began when the Prime Minister expressed his dissatisfaction with the proposed EU menu, likening it to an unpalatable meal at a poorly-run establishment. Major outlets were quick to draw comparisons between this political standoff and the antics seen on Fawlty Towers, where customers were often left disgruntled by the quality of food and service. One such outlet framed the situation as the Prime Minister being \\"a diner unconvinced by proposed EU menu…refusing to pay [the] bill.\\" This analogy suggests that the stronger tone taken by the Prime Minister was a refusal to conform to Europe’s expectations of accepting their proposals without question, just like the customers who refused to pay for unsatisfactory service at the fictional hotel. Another major news platform described the Prime Minister as \\"abandoning traditional English reserve\\" in his impassioned speech. This highlights the shift from the typically polite and measured political discourse to a more direct and emotionally-charged way of communicating dissatisfaction. Fans of Fawlty Towers might recall multiple incidents when the usually reserved protagonist, Basil Fawlty, played by John Cleese, would lose his temper and engage in verbal altercations with hotel guests. The parallels between the two situations do not end there. Just as Basil Fawlty's frustration with his guests would often spiral out of control, leading to chaos and misunderstandings, the Prime Minister's outburst has caused an uproar among politicians and diplomats alike. The repercussions of this incident are yet to be fully understood, but it has undoubtedly shaken up the way negotiations are conducted in the future. Despite these similarities, it is crucial to remember that the stakes of these two situations are vastly different — the fate of an entire nation as opposed to the goings-on at a small hotel. However, the use of Fawlty Towers as an analogy has helped the public understand and empathize with the Prime Minister's stance. Furthermore, this comparison aids in humanizing the often complex political arena, providing a relatable and easily digestible parallel to the current political narrative. While the sitcom's themes may not have been intended for a political context, the universality of human emotions and the struggle to communicate effectively are timeless, making the comparison apt for describing the situation. In conclusion, the Prime Minister's dissatisfaction over the proposed EU menu sits at an interesting crossroads of politics, popular culture, and human emotion. By comparing the situation to Fawlty Towers, the press has not only made the issue more accessible to the public but also highlighted the importance of effective communication in the world of politics. As negotiations continue, it remains to be seen whether this new approach will yield better results for the parties involved and whether the Prime Minister will continue to channel his inner Basil Fawlty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The latter were in turn conquered by the Romans, who called the lake Verbanus Lacus or Lacus Maximus. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the lake was under different dominations. Most of the current settlements originated in the Middle Ages, when the lake was under the Della Torre, Visconti, the Borromeo and Habsburg families.

This move by the Jobbik party to utilize such a historically and religiously significant location for their rally has been met with widespread disapproval, questioning the insensitivity and even the potential anti-Semitic undertones of the political extremist group. Background: The Jobbik Party The Jobbik party, which stands for Movement for a Better Hungary, is a nationalist, far-right political group that has gained momentum in recent years by adopting a euro-sceptic, anti-globalist, and anti-immigrant platform. The group is known for promoting an exclusionary vision of Hungarian identity, and it has been previously accused of encouraging xenophobic attitudes and anti-Semitic sentiments within the country. The Esztergom Synagogue The site chosen by the Jobbik party for their most recent meeting is a former synagogue in Esztergom, a small town near the Slovak border. Built in the 19th century, the synagogue used to be a vibrant place of worship for the sizable Jewish community of the town. However, during World War II, the Jewish community was decimated, with many Jews being deported to concentration camps or fleeing the country. Post-war, the building functioned as a warehouse until the early 1990s, when the government handed it over to the Hungarian Jewish Heritage Foundation. Since then, the former synagogue has served as a cultural center and exhibition space, focusing on preserving the Jewish history and culture of the town. The Controversial Rally The Jobbik party's decision to hold a political rally in the former Esztergom synagogue has met with shock, anger, and disapproval from various quarters. The insensitivity of holding a far-right event in a building that once symbolized peace, worship, and a thriving Jewish community—and in a space that is tasked to preserve Jewish heritage and culture—has raised many eyebrows. Criticism and Condemnation Various international and Hungarian media outlets, political groups, religious organizations, and other voices have been quick to condemn the Jobbik party for its actions. Critics argue that the group's decision to host an event in a former synagogue demonstrates not only a lack of empathy towards the Jewish community but also, possibly, a more sinister and deliberate attempt at dog-whistling to anti-Semitic supporters. The Jobbik party has defended its decision by stating that the former synagogue is now a public venue available for rent, and they have claimed that their political event was respectful of the building's history. Regardless of their intentions, the move has undeniably raised concerns about the increasingly radical political climate in Hungary. Implications and Broader Context The Jobbik party's controversial rally comes amid rising concerns about the resurgence of far-right and nationalist sentiments throughout Europe, with the embracing of extremist rhetoric by certain political factions. This specific incident illustrates that this trend is not limited to Western Europe, but is also manifesting in Central and Eastern Europe, impacting smaller countries like Hungary. Moreover, the Jobbik party's decision can be seen as symbolic of ongoing challenges related to preserving historical memory and engaging in dialogue about the role that Jewish communities have played in Hungarian history. By utilizing a former synagogue in a bid to garner attention and provoke reactions, the group has thrust into sharp relief the challenges posed by nationalist narratives and polarizing politics. Conclusion The Jobbik party's rally in the former Esztergom synagogue has generated controversy and criticism, raising important questions about the role of far-right parties in contemporary European politics, the protection of religious and historical sites, and current discussions about European identity. The event, therefore, offers a crucial opportunity to reflect on the need for careful and considerate handling of historical and religious spaces, and for promoting inclusive and tolerant political discourse in Hungary and beyond."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I have a new situation: Rob is testing the properties of gas. To that end, he experimented with a cylinder of gas in three stages, stage A, stage B, and stage C. In stage A he kept the gas in room temperature. In stage B he heated the gas up. And in stage C he cooled the gas down. But I can use this background: Shown in the Figure below is a cylinder of gas on the left that is at room temperature (300 K). On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease. What is an answer for this question: In which stage the kinetic energy of the gas molecules would not increase, stage A or stage B? A:","completion":"In stage A, the kinetic energy of the gas molecules would not increase. Stage A represents a situation where the gas is kept at room temperature (300 K), meaning the gas molecules are not exposed to any additional heat and, as a result, their kinetic energy remains constant. On the other hand, in stage B, the gas is heated up, causing the Kelvin temperature to double to 600 K. This increase in temperature results in an increase in the kinetic energy of the gas molecules. This is because the particles move faster and collide more forcefully with the walls of the container, subsequently leading to a doubling of the gas pressure. In summary: - Stage A: Gas is at room temperature, and the kinetic energy of gas molecules remains constant. - Stage B: Gas is heated up, causing an increase in temperature and the kinetic energy of gas molecules, which in turn results in increased gas pressure. Therefore, that answer to the question is stage A, as this is the scenario where the kinetic energy of gas molecules would not increase."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I know that the answer to the question \\"Styli made of sapphire and osmium alloy replaced those made from what?\\" is in \\"In 1931, RCA Victor introduced their vinyl-based Victrolac compound as a material for some unusual-format and special-purpose records. By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.\\".

Answer the following question: Process: - A butterfly starts as an egg - The egg hatches - A larva emerges - The larva eats and grows - The larva sheds its skin - The larva enters a chrysalis - The pupa grows inside the chrysalis - The adult butterfly exits the chrysalis - The adult butterfly is now fully grown - The adult butterfly lays more eggs. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less larvae enter chrysalis happens, how will it affect LESS butterflies. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The life cycle of a butterfly is a complex and fascinating process, consisting of multiple stages--from egg to larva, then to pupa, and finally to the adult butterfly. The perturbation hypothesis under consideration proposes that fewer larvae enter the chrysalis stage, and we are tasked with exploring its effects on the butterfly population and the overall life cycle process. Direct Effects of Perturbation: 1. Reduced number of adults: With less larvae entering the chrysalis phase, it is evident that a fewer number of adult butterflies will emerge as a direct result. This will cause a decline in the overall population of butterflies in the area, as fewer adults are available to continue the natural cycle. 2. Reduction in genetic diversity: As fewer larvae enter the chrysalis stage, the gene pool of the adult butterfly population will get restricted. This may lead to less diversity among the butterfly species, which can have wide-ranging consequences for their survival in the long run. Less genetic diversity could make them more vulnerable to diseases or environmental changes, reducing their adaptability and resilience. Indirect Effects of Perturbation: 1. Impacts on the food chain: A reduced butterfly population can have cascading effects on other organisms within the ecosystem. Butterflies play a role as pollinators and as a food source for other predators, such as birds or insects. With fewer butterflies, pollination levels might drop, leading to potential declines in plant species. Similarly, butterfly predators may face food scarcity, which could have ripple effects throughout the ecosystem. 2. Lower egg count and subsequent generations: Adult butterflies are responsible for laying eggs and starting the life cycle process anew. Therefore, with fewer adult butterflies emerging from the chrysalis stage, there will be less eggs laid. This will lead to fewer larvae in the subsequent generation and potentially result in a decline in butterfly populations over time, as each successive generation sees a gradual shrink in numbers. 3. Possible alterations in other butterfly behaviors: With fewer larvae entering the chrysalis stage, the competition for resources (food and space) during the larval stage may decrease. This could lead to changes in the growth rate or behavior of the larvae, as they adjust to the availability of resources or face less pressure from competition. 4. Potential beneficial effects: While the perturbation primarily has negative effects on the butterfly population, it could potentially have positive effects on plant species that are consumed by the larvae. If the number of larvae declines, there could be less consumption of plant material, allowing these plant species to proliferate and benefit from decreased predation. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation in which fewer larvae enter the chrysalis stage can have both direct and indirect consequences on the process. Primarily, there would be a decline in the butterfly population as fewer adults emerge, leading to reduced genetic diversity and a decrease in egg count. This would impact the entire ecosystem due to their role in pollination and as a food source for predators. Despite some potential positive effects such as less plant predation, the overall implications of this perturbation would be negative on the butterfly population and the ecosystem as a whole."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose from: (a). impress Jordan with a party (b). be jealous of Jordan (c). make sure Jordan had a good time The answer is:","completion":"(c). make sure Jordan had a good time Since Kendall decided to have their birthday party at Jordan's house, it indicates a certain level of trust and closeness in their relationship. Kendall likely appreciates the effort Jordan put into hosting the party and wants to ensure that their friend also enjoyed the celebration. In this scenario, making sure Jordan had a good time is most in line with the values of friendship, gratitude, and reciprocity. The other options do not align with these values. If Kendall were to try and impress Jordan with a party, it might create an unnecessary competition between friends. Impressions and competition can sometimes lead to rifts in friendships, as one might try to outdo the other. This, in turn, creates a focus on self-centered pursuits rather than fostering a sense of camaraderie. As for being jealous of Jordan, this option would also not make sense in the context of the story. Kendall has already celebrated their birthday at Jordan's house, which implies that they were not only welcome but most likely encouraged by Jordan to do so. Jealousy stems from a feeling of insecurity, fear, or lack of trust, which does not fit within the context of the situation. Therefore, ensuring that Jordan had a good time is not only the appropriate choice considering their friendship but also serves to strengthen their bond. This act reflects the values of gratitude, empathy, and a genuine concern for the well-being and happiness of others.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Earlier this year my depression got very bad, very quickly. I’d been having intrusive suicidal thoughts for a while. It was a combination of a bad medication regimen and lots of little stressors—school, work, a car accident, you name it. I took to a very private social media account that only those I was closest to could see. I used that account to rant about my problems. It was my coping mechanism and how I kept myself sane. Somehow just typing it out got it off my chest in ways writing in a journal couldn’t (now, I try to use Quora for this purpose instead). One night in early March I went to a performance that my friends were part of. I went alone. While I was there, I got a series of texts regarding my girlfriend. I knew that what those texts said would cause me an immense amount of stress and sleepless nights. I went onto my social media account. I don’t remember exactly what I posted. It wasn’t specific, but rather something along the lines of “I’m stressed, this is the cherry on top, I honestly don’t know how I’m going to handle this.” Whatever it was, someone who followed that account knew I was at my breaking point. They called an anonymous tip line and reported that they believed I was in danger of killing myself. I got home from the performance at midnight and my dad was in my driveway. I asked him why. He told me he’d been contacted and that someone reported a concern about me. I was admitted to the hospital the next day, and I spent a week an an inpatient psychiatric unit where I received better medication, therapy and coaching on positive coping mechanisms. Whoever called saved me, but in a way I saved my own life that day. What I thought was just another routine post about stress got me the help I so desperately needed. I know without it, I would have ended my own life that day. Funny how that works.

Detailed Instructions: Given a scientific passage and an answer, generate a question for the given answer. Problem:Passage: Chapter 23 1 Figure 23.5 All eukaryotic cells have mitochondria, but not all eukaryotic cells have chloroplasts. 3 Figure 23.18 C 4 D 6 C 8 D 10 B 12 C 14 A 16 A 18 Eukaryotic cells arose through endosymbiotic events that gave rise to the energy-producing organelles within the eukaryotic cells such as mitochondria and chloroplasts. The nuclear genome of eukaryotes is related most closely to the Archaea, so it may have been an early archaean that engulfed a bacterial cell that evolved into a mitochondrion. Mitochondria appear to have originated from an alpha-proteobacterium, whereas chloroplasts originated as a cyanobacterium. There is also evidence of secondary endosymbiotic events. Other cell components may also have resulted from endosymbiotic events. 20 As an intestinal parasite, Giardia cysts would be exposed to low pH in the stomach acids of its host. To survive this environment and reach the intestine, the cysts would have to be resistant to acidic conditions. 22 By definition, an obligate saprobe lacks the ability to perform photosynthesis, so it cannot directly obtain nutrition by searching for light. Instead, a chemotactic mechanism that senses the odors released during decay might be a more effective sensing organ for a saprobe. 24 The trypanosomes that cause this disease are capable of expressing a glycoprotein coat with a different molecular structure with each generation. Because the immune system must respond to specific antigens to raise a meaningful defense, the changing nature of trypanosome antigens prevents the immune system from ever clearing this infection. Massive trypanosome infection eventually leads to host organ failure and death. Answer: chloroplasts Solution:","completion":"Part #1: Identify the key information about the answer in the passage. Usage: The key information about \\"chloroplasts\\" in the passage is \\"All eukaryotic cells have mitochondria, but not all eukaryotic cells have chloroplasts.\\" and \\"chloroplasts originated as a cyanobacterium.\\" This is relevant because it informs us that chloroplasts are not present in all eukaryotic cells and that they originated from cyanobacteria. Part #2: Determine the main context or subject related to the answer. Usage: The main context for \\"chloroplasts\\" is endosymbiotic events and the origin of cellular organelles. This is important because the passage discusses how mitochondria and chloroplasts arose from endosymbiotic events, giving us a basis to form a question on this topic. Part #3: Create a question that focuses on the answer and the context or subject. Usage: A sample question that focuses on \\"chloroplasts\\" and its context could be \\"From which type of bacterium did chloroplasts in eukaryotic cells originate?\\" This question directly refers to the information provided in the passage about the origin of chloroplasts, and the answer is \\"cyanobacterium,\\" as stated in the passage."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: A teenage girl of Hispanic heritage named Cynthia Gimenez lives in a cramped Manhattan apartment on the edge of Spanish Harlem. Her mother and grandmother speak minimal English. Her older sister is an unwed mother living on welfare. Her older brother is a drug-dealing junkie. In the course of the film, Cynthia faces chaos and betrayal. One of her friends is deliberately murdered, while another of her loved ones is accidentally shot. She runs from the police at one point, and to them at another. But through it all, Cynthia has a secret friend: Anne Frank. In a flashback scene early in the film, Cynthiaâs now-dead father gives his young daughter a dog-eared copy of The Diary Of Anne Frank and for the rest of the film Anneâs words, read verbatim by Cynthia, provide both her solace and her inspiration. Cynthia buys herself a plaid notebook that looks very much like Anneâs original, and she retreats to her corner, like Anne did, to record her private thoughts. âAll children must look after their own upbringing,â she reads, and from these words she understands that she can either blame her surroundings and give up, or take responsibility for her own future. She finds out that her brother is selling her poems to a rapper named âDeuceâ who has been performing them and recording them and claiming them as his own. But with Anneâs voice in her head, Cynthia finds her courage, and by the end of the film she has transformed herself into an artist named âAnne B. Real.â The answer is:","completion":"\\"Voices of the Barrio: The Anne B. Real Story\\" Here's a step-by-step breakdown and justification of the title creation process: 1. Identify key elements of the plot: The movie is primarily about a teenage girl, Cynthia, living in a tough environment in Spanish Harlem. Key aspects are her Hispanic heritage, her tumultuous family life, and her connection to Anne Frank. 2. Incorporate cultural/geographic background: The term \\"Barrio\\" is a Spanish word for \\"neighborhood\\" and is often used to describe Hispanic neighborhoods in the United States. By using the term \\"Barrio,\\" the title reflects Cynthia's Hispanic heritage and setting of Spanish Harlem. 3.

Real Story\\" in the title, it emphasizes her personal growth and ultimate self-discovery. 4. Show the importance of Anne Frank's influence: Anne Frank's presence is a constant source of inspiration and solace for Cynthia. Using \\"Voices\\" in the title highlights the importance of Anne's words and her influence on Cynthia's life. Overall, the title \\"Voices of the Barrio: The Anne B. Real Story\\" highlights key elements of the plot, shows Cynthia's Hispanic background and cultural setting, underscores her personal growth and journey, and accentuates the vital role Anne Frank's words play in Cynthia's life."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Wilson believes that the island holds vast untapped deposits of oil, a potential fortune which he is determined to secure for Petrox. Unknown to Wilson or the crew, Jack Prescott (Jeff Bridges), a primate paleontologist who wants to see the island for himself, has stowed away on the expedition's vessel, the Petrox Explorer.

Wilson orders Prescott locked up, believing him to be a corporate spy from a rival oil company. While being escorted to lock-up, Prescott spots a life raft which, upon inspection, is found to be carrying the beautiful and unconscious Dwan (Jessica Lange). After conducting a thorough background check on the 'spy', Wilson realizes that he is telling the truth and appoints Prescott as the expedition's official photographer, requesting that, due to his medical training, he be present when Dwan revives. When she does regain consciousness, Dwan states that she is an aspiring actress who was aboard a director's yacht, which suddenly and inexplicably exploded.

At least 145 people were injured - many critically - when two trains collided overnight in West Bengal. Police said Maoist rebels sabotaged the track causing the Calcutta-Mumbai passenger train to derail, throwing five of its carriages into the path of an oncoming goods train. But a spokesman for the Maoist rebels called the BBC to deny any involvement. A railway spokesman said 78 bodies had been recovered, but that more than 30 remained trapped in three carriages that were crushed by the freight train. Officials said rescue workers were still working to free survivors from the wreckage in the Jhargram area of West Midnapore, about 150km (90 miles) west of Calcutta. The area is known to be a stronghold of Maoist rebels. Maoist claim The state police chief, Bhupinder Singh, said a 46cm (1.5ft) portion of the train track was missing. He said posters from a local group believed to have close ties to the Maoists were found at the scene, claiming it had carried out the attack. ANALYSIS Continue reading the main story Rail officials say the incident took place when it was still dark, so the driver of the Gyaneshwar Express failed to spot the damaged track. This is the peak travel season and the train would have been packed with people going for summer holidays. An investigation is yet to begin but local police say Maoist rebels left posters at the site saying they carried out the attack. The site is in a remote part of West Bengal, close to the border with Jharkhand state - a known Maoist stronghold. Maoists have targeted the Indian railways in the past, leading the authorities to deploy police patrols along the main railway lines. The rebels have stepped up attacks in recent months, and have called for a \\"black week\\" beginning on Friday in the region. Are Maoist rebels winning the war? But Maoist spokesman Comrade Khokan spoke to the BBC by telephone to deny any involvement. He said the government \\"put the blame on us and put us on the defensive\\". Some analysts say that in this case the Maoist script may have gone awry. Maoists frequently tamper with railway lines and often these lead to minor derailments; there have been hijackings but no major attacks on civilian transport with such a death toll. The rebels had called for observance of a \\"black week\\" of protests from Friday to Wednesday in five states - including West Bengal - where they wield considerable influence. The incident happened at 0130 local time (2000 GMT) when it was still dark, which meant the driver had failed to see the damaged track, rail officials said. Rescue workers were still using sledgehammers and gas cutters to break into carriages where survivors were thought to be trapped, the BBC's Amitabha Bhattasali reported from the scene. Bodies are still being removed from mangled carriages and helicopters are airlifting injured passengers to nearby hospitals. Hundreds of police, troops and emergency workers are involved in the search and recovery effort. INDIA'S MAOIST INSURGENCY Continue reading the main story Violent rebellion began in 1967 in West Bengal village of Naxalbari and spread over rural areas of central and eastern India Led by elusive military commander Kishenji, supported by between 10,000 and 20,000 fighters More than 6,000 killed since rebellion began Worst attacks include 76 killed in April 2010 ambushes in Dantewada; 55 killed in attack on police outpost in 2007 Profile: India's Maoist rebels In pictures: India train collision Railway spokesman Soumitra Majumdar said five coaches of the passenger train, the Gyaneshwar Express, had been derailed due to missing \\"fish plates\\" - which join rails together. These coaches then fell on to the neighbouring track where they were rammed by the goods train, he said. There were 13 carriages - including 10 sleeper coaches and a coach with unreserved seating - on the passenger train, the Times of India reported. Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee has visited the crash site. The government has been under pressure following a wave of Maoist-led violence. In April, 76 paramilitary troops were killed in an ambush - the single biggest attack on the Indian security forces by the rebels. Maoist rebels have in recent months stepped up attacks in response to a government security push to flush them out of their jungle bases. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has described the insurgency as India's biggest internal security challenge. ||||| Maoist guerillas are believed to be behind the blast in their West Bengal stronghold. If confirmed it would mark a major escalation of their insurgency in the state and a shift from military to civilian targets. Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh has described the Maoist rebellion as the country's greatest internal security challenge - they are a powerful force in one-third of India's 600-plus districts. The explosion follows a number of Maoist attack attacks in recent weeks, including an ambush which killed 76 Indian paramilitary police in Chhattisgarh and an attack on a bus which left 35 dead. This time the attackers struck at 1:30am as the Mumbai-Calcutta Gyaneshwari Express passed through Jhargram in West Midnapore, West Bengal, just over 80 miles from its destination. The driver heard an explosion which derailed 13 of the train's coaches and hurled five of them into the path of an on-coming freight train. Ten of those derailed were sleeper coaches. India's railways minister Mamata Bannerjee said the incident was \\"definitely sabotage\\" and that a bomb attack had derailed the train. \\"From whatever I have been told the apprehension is the Maoists were involved,\\" she said. Police investigating the attack said they were also exploring whether the removal of the track's \\"fish plates\\" by saboteurs had caused the derailment and collision. \\"The driver heard a loud noise which indicates there could be a blast. A detail investigation will reveal more, but definitely there was lot of tinkering done to the tracks,\\" Vivek Sahay, a senior railway official, said. Television pictures showed the mangled carriages as rescue workers fought to cut survivors from the wreckage. One reporter described a scene of chaos and panic. \\"People are crying. Rescuers are struggling to save the survivors and get the bodies out,\\" Naresh Jana said. \\"I can see body parts hanging out of the compartments and under the wheels. I can hear people, women, crying for help from inside the affected coaches.\\" The Maoists insurgents are known in India as \\"Naxalites\\" – they began their campaign in Naxalbari, in northern West Bengal in support of peasants demanding land reform in 1967. They have since grown in strength in India's poorest and most rural states. They now are a powerful force in Chhattisgarh, Orissa, West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand. Their popularity has grown in the last few years among peasants and tribesman as government-backed mining companies have moved into their districts and seized their land. They have threatened to launch a new terror campaign in Orissa to halt plans by Britain's wealthiest man, Lakshmi Mittal to open steel plants in state Their recent attacks have been in response to an operation by government forces to flush them out from their jungle strongholds. |||||","completion":"A train crash in eastern India has killed over 100 people and injured at least 145.

From it we can get food, minerals and treasures. For thousands of years, we just sailed on it but couldn't go far under its surface. We want to explore deep into the sea. However, we are not fish. We must breathe, so we can't stay underwater for long. To explore deep water, we face even more dangers and problems. A diver trying to stay underwater for a long time must breathe air or a special mixture of gases. He can wear a diving suit and have air pumped to him from above. He can carry a tank of air on his back and breathe through a special pipe. Water weighs 800 times as much as air. Tons of water pushes against a diver deep in the sea, so his body is under great pressure. When a diver is under great pressure, his blood takes in some of the gases he breathes. As he rises to the surface, the water pressure becomes less. If the diver rises too quickly, the gases in his blood form bubbles . The diver is then suffering from a kind of illness. This kind of illness can cause a diver great pains and even kill him.

Here is a news article: A second video of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford smoking what has been described as crack cocaine by a self-professed drug dealer was secretly filmed in his sister's basement early Saturday morning. The clip, which was viewed by two Globe and Mail reporters, shows Mr. Ford taking a drag from a long copper-coloured pipe, exhaling a cloud of smoke and then frantically shaking his right hand. The footage is part of a package of three videos that the drug dealer says he surreptitiously shot around 1:15 a.m., and which he says he is now selling for \\"at least six figures.\\" See photos from the recent videos of Rob Ford appearing to smoke crack. And our continuing live coverage. Story continues below advertisement The footage comes to light weeks after Mr. Ford embarked on a re-election campaign styled on the importance of second chances and forgiving mistakes. Nearly a year ago, the mayor thrust himself into worldwide infamy when another drug dealer, Mohamed Siad, tried to sell another video of the mayor allegedly smoking crack to media outlets in Canada and the United States. At the time, the mayor denied using the drug, only to later admit that he had smoked crack cocaine in a \\"drunken stupor\\" and said that he was not an addict. Since then Mr. Ford has been filmed numerous times in public appearing erratic and acting impaired. In each instance, the mayor has admitted to drinking, but never to using drugs. A few weeks ago when asked directly if he was continuing to use drugs, Mr. Ford said: \\"You guys ask stupid questions.\\" Approached at City Hall Wednesday evening, Mr. Ford declined to respond to questions about the video. Shortly after The Globe confronted Mr. Ford, he issued a statement. \\"I have decided to take a leave from campaigning and from my duties as Mayor to seek immediate help,\\" he said. In one of the clips shown to The Globe and Mail Wednesday, the mayor rapidly shifts his weight back and forth on the spot, talking into his cellphone and his right arm swinging at his side. When the camera pans around the room, a man that looks like Alessandro \\"Sandro\\" Lisi, the mayor's former driver who has been charged with drug dealing and extortion, can be seen in the background. Mr. Ford's sister, Kathy, who has admitted in media interviews to being a drug addict, is sitting in front of her brother. In the last of three clips, Mr. Ford is holding the pipe and speaking to his sister. A man who answered Mr. Lisi's cellphone told The Globe not to call back. Mr. Lisi's lawyer, Seth Weinstein, said: \\"I think the only thing I can tell you now is that, until such time the video's contents are authenticated, it would be inappropriate to comment any further.\\" A reporter attempted to contact Ms. Ford at her home, but there was no answer. In all three clips, the mayor is wearing a white shirt and a dark-coloured tie with a pattern of thin white marks. This is the same shirt-and-tie combination he was wearing Friday afternoon at a press conference where he was critical of the dismissal of Gene Jones, who was appointed by the mayor to run the Toronto Community Housing Corporation and was removed after a damning ombudsman investigation. The drug dealer who showed The Globe the videos said that the mayor was also ranting about Mr. Jones's ouster in his sister's basement. In one of the video clips, the camera pans onto a second cellphone, which is flipped open and shows the time and date. Unlike the first notorious video that captured the mayor apparently smoking crack cocaine, the mayor is not smoking from a glass pipe, rather a metal one. Scott MacIntyre, the former common-law spouse of Kathy Ford who is now suing the mayor, said in an interview that the mayor's sister smokes crack from metal pipes that can also be used to smoke marijuana. When shown a photo of the mayor holding the pipe, Mr. MacIntyre said it is similar to the crack pipes that the mayor's sister has used. \\"She uses those brass elbows,\\" he said, referring to plumbing that can be converted into a pipe. Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement All three clips were shot in a cluttered, dimly lit room with a white tile ceiling. The drug dealer selling the video identified it as the basement of Ms. Ford's home. When asked what the ceiling of Ms. Ford's basement looks like, Mr. MacIntyre said it has white perforated tiles. The drug dealer who approached The Globe said that the audio on the three clips was not available because the speaker on his phone was broken when he recorded the footage. The dealer said he supplied the crack that was smoked that night and that he had decided to sell the footage to \\"make money.\\" He supplied an alias to The Globe and urged the paper to publish his nickname because: \\"I want someone to come to me.\\" The Globe is not publishing that nickname because of concerns about the drug dealer's intentions. The Globe cannot confirm the substance inside the pipe. Reached late last night, Mr. Ford's long-time criminal lawyer Dennis Morris questioned the authenticity of the video. \\"If these guys are drug dealers and there's money involved, they can say whatever they want to get more money, to extract more money from the people who are paying.\\" It's difficult for anyone to prove what the mayor is smoking in the video, Mr. Morris said. \\"So say for example it was marijuana,\\" he said. \\"Would [you] pay more for a video if I told you it was marijuana or crack cocaine?\\" The Globe did not purchase the video but it did buy a series of screen grabs from the three clips. Story continues below advertisement The Globe reporters met the dealer and one of his associates, who said he was not in Ms. Ford's basement but also identified himself as a drug dealer, at a strip-mall parking lot west of Toronto. The drug dealer selling the video said that he sold drugs to the mayor several times over the past year. Since the first crack video emerged, his brother and campaign manager, Councillor Doug Ford, has repeatedly said that voters aren't concerned with the mayor's drug use. \\"You're out of touch with what the people care about. People don't care about that,\\" he said in January. With reports from Ann Hui, Renata D'Aliesio, Elizabeth Church and Patrick White ||||| TORONTO - Mayor Rob Ford says he’s “ready to take a break” from the mayoral election campaign to “go get help.” The decision to immediately step away from the campaign — while staying on the ballot — came after the Toronto Sun exclusively obtained a new raunchy audio recording of Ford ranting and swearing in an Etobicoke bar. The Globe and Mail also published a report that a new video surfaced of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford smoking what has been described as crack-cocaine early Saturday morning. Ford told the Sun columnist Joe Warmington that he realizes “it’s time” and that he “wants” to “deal with his issues.” He said he is being urged to not leave the mayoral race by people around him. The audio recording, covertly taped by a patron of Sullie Gorman’s Monday night, captures the mayor being unruly as he’s ordering booze at the Royal York Rd. bar, complaining about his wife Renata and making lewd comments about mayoral contender Karen Stintz. “I’d like to f-----g jam her (Stintz), but she doesn’t want ... I can’t talk like this...I’m so sorry,” Ford is heard saying on the recording. “I forgot there’s a woman in the house.” According to one witness, Ford was seen buying shooters and tequila and trying to fight with patrons Monday. “He was really wasted,” said the witness. “And he was acting like a real ass.” A bartender at the local watering hole — located in a plaza, near his mother Diane Ford’s home and across from a park named in honour of his father, Doug Ford Sr. – described the mayor as being “in fine form.” Witnesses say the mayor was not with his driver, Jerry Agyemang, but his Escalade was parked in the plaza lot — something the mayor denies. Ford was not seen at City Hall the following day. The mayor said he didn’t recall saying any of the things on the recording, but confirmed he was at Sullie Gorman’s that night. “I wouldn’t say that — I wouldn’t say the word, ‘jam,’ — that’s not my terminology,” he said in a phone interview with Warmington Wednesday afternoon. “I am appalled (at what I said). I’d like to verify this (audio) first. Of course, I’m just joking around. Clearly, that’s what I mean.” Also on the recording, Ford was heard ranting about being pressed to keep the gay pride rainbow flag raised at City Hall. “They put this f-----g flag up ahead of our Canadian flag, I said, ‘No, I’m sorry. Bulls---,” he said. Ford is heard using threatening language: “Give me a shot right now or I’ll f-----g break your legs. I want another one.” A few moments later, he says, “If you don’t give me a shot I’m going to knock your f-----g teeth out.” He also uttered: “I’m so f-----g sick of politics, dude. Look at my record” and “I wish that f-----g conversation had never been taped,” but doesn’t specify any context. Ford, again, said he doesn’t remember — but remained silent when asked if it was one of his drunken stupors. “I don’t know who I’m threatening,” he said. “This is from Monday night? That’s weird. I wasn’t messed up. I wouldn’t use that language. This was inside the bar? I’d like to know who I threatened to punch out.” Stintz’s initial reaction to what Ford said about her? Laughter. “I’m just hoping the (audio) didn’t accurately reflect his feelings towards me as a colleague,” she said in a follow-up phone call. When told Ford was ready to take a 30-day break from politics, Stintz said it was “a good decision.\\" “I wish him luck getting the help that he needs,” she said. “I think it is good for him, for his family, I think it’s a very good decision.” Councillor Giorgio Mammoliti predicted Ford will likely be admitted to a 28-day rehab program. “When you’re addict, you’re always an addict until you realize it,” he said. “It’s taken him quite a while to recognize it and he finally has and that’s good for him. It’s 28 days and he’ll be back in the race, I imagine. If he isn’t, there may be others that choose to enter the race, including myself.” Ford’s battles with drinking and drugs have made headlines for more than a year and plagued his mayoralty. Last November, Ford admitted to smoking crack cocaine but blamed it on “one of my drunken stupors.” That crack confession came after months of Ford denying he had been caught on video smoking the drug. In the aftermath, Ford promised in several televised interviews that he had given up drinking entirely after having a \\"come to Jesus\\" moment. Last January, Ford was caught on video at Etobicoke's Steak Queen slurring and swearing about Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair in Jamaican Patois. After that video surfaced, Ford called the incident \\"a minor setback.\\" \\"I’m entitled to a personal life. My personal life does not interfere with the work I do day in and day out,\\" Ford said at the time. Back in November, the Sun broke the news about another video of Ford ranting, this time about murdering someone, that was being shopped around. \\"I need f---ing 10 minutes to make sure he's dead,\\" Ford said in that video. \\"I'm going to kill that f---ing guy. I'm telling you it's first-degree murder.\\" Ford came out after that video was made public claiming he had been \\"extremely, extremely inebriated\\" when it was filmed. In a statement of defence filed in March against a lawsuit alleging he orchestrated a jailhouse beating, Ford claimed he was doing a parody of wresting legend Hulk Hogan whom he was soon to arm wrestle.

Article: One of the most popular and enduring myths about depression is that depressed people are sad all the time--and that by extension, people who are happy can't be experiencing depression, even if they say they are. It is a mistaken version of depression. Depression doesn't make you sad all the time. When I'm having a depressive feeling, I'm not walking around in black clothes, and weeping. I go out with friends. I play jokes. I keep working, and have friendly chats with the people I work with. I read books. Above all, I experience moments of happiness. Yet I feel a strange conflicting pressure. On the one hand, I feel like I need to engage in a sort of sadness for people to understand that I really am depressed and that each day is a struggle for me. Because that way I will appear suitably sad, and thus, depressed--and then maybe people will recognize that I'm depressed and perhaps they'll even offer support and assistance. On the other hand, I feel an extreme pressure to perform just the opposite, because sad depressed people are boring and no fun, as I am continually reminded every time I speak openly about depression or express feelings of sadness and frustration. I'm caught in a trap where if I don't perform sadness, I'm not really depressed, but if I express sadness at all to any degree, I'm annoying and boring and should stop being so self-centered. Depression can become your master, but you can slip out from under it occasionally. And many depressed people don't actually spend it fainting dramatically on the couch and talking about how miserable they are. Question: What's the writer's attitude to being sad and depressed?

They are caught in a challenging position where they feel the need to display sadness in order to be recognized as truly depressed, yet they face social pressure to not be sad as this makes them appear boring or self-centered. The answer to whether their attitude is \\"Negative\\" is not a straightforward yes or no, but it can be interpreted as leaning towards negative due to the struggle they face in navigating societal expectations and their own experiences with depression."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Both dealerships are run by twin brothers, Roy L Fuchs and Luke Fuchs (both played by Jack Warden). However, Roy L's dealership is easily the more lucrative than his brother's, which deals in often junked used cars.One of New Deal's most prominent salesmen is Ruddy Russo (Kurt Russell), a young man who never shies away from making a deal, and also is planning to run for a seat on the State Senate. Along with Ruddy, there's Jeff (Garrit Graham), a superstitious fellow, and Jim (Frank McRae), the mechanic who is easily excitable.Recently, Luke has been having problems with his heart, much to the delight of his other brother.

Context: The doctors told me I would be placed on a seventy-two hour hold for observation. Knowing this was the only way out, I obeyed and diligently signed all the papers. I hated my parents but still felt the inescapable drive to prove to them that I was worth something. I had to show them I wasn't crazy. As the hours passed, I was shown to a blank room with plastic sheets and plastic pillows, which caused me to wonder what kind of distant confused souls had been imprisoned in this sterile place. There were bars on the windows and the only door out of the unit was locked 24/7. I knew my only refuge for the time being would be through the hour a day art therapy class and the smoke breaks I could take at will. They had given me a legal pad after my parents had told them of my affinity for writing. With it I set to work on the flow of words and the river of thoughts, both dark and hopeful that careened through my tired mind. Instead of sleep, I would write. I expressed my vicious frustration for the place and thought constantly of the passing hours, counting them down as they went. Because of this I was thankful for the eight to ten I would use up easily in my escapes to the world behind my eyelids. There I was free and could experience a life unhindered by limitations of ethics or gravity. When I'd awake I'd write what I could remember of my escapes on the obtrusive legal pad. I had the suspicion that the attendants would come in and read my thoughts as I was eating meals or watching TV and I wondered if this was hindering my ability to get out. I wondered what kind of opinions and judgments they were forming about me. I had bared my soul on those pages explaining desperately how the thoughts would not leave even in this place, where it mattered most that they were gone. The fuckers would never leave. Maybe I was crazy. Question: How long would the speaker most likely stay in the hospital?

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who said Presley was concerned that his 24-month spell as a GI would ruin his career? from the following article ? On March 24, 1958, Presley was drafted into the U.S. Army as a private at Fort Chaffee, near Fort Smith, Arkansas. His arrival was a major media event. Hundreds of people descended on Presley as he stepped from the bus; photographers then accompanied him into the fort. Presley announced that he was looking forward to his military stint, saying that he did not want to be treated any differently from anyone else: \\"The Army can do anything it wants with me.\\"Presley commenced basic training at Fort Hood, Texas. During a two-week leave in early June, he recorded five songs in Nashville. In early August, his mother was diagnosed with hepatitis, and her condition rapidly worsened. Presley, granted emergency leave to visit her, arrived in Memphis on August 12. Two days later, she died of heart failure, aged 46. Presley was devastated; their relationship had remained extremely close—even into his adulthood, they would use baby talk with each other and Presley would address her with pet names.After training, Presley joined the 3rd Armored Division in Friedberg, Germany, on October 1. While on maneuvers, Presley was introduced to amphetamines by a sergeant. He became \\"practically evangelical about their benefits\\", not only for energy but for \\"strength\\" and weight loss as well, and many of his friends in the outfit joined him in indulging. The Army also introduced Presley to karate, which he studied seriously, training with Jürgen Seydel. It became a lifelong interest, which he later included in his live performances. Fellow soldiers have attested to Presley's wish to be seen as an able, ordinary soldier, despite his fame, and to his generosity. He donated his Army pay to charity, purchased TV sets for the base, and bought an extra set of fatigues for everyone in his outfit.While in Friedberg, Presley met 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu. They would eventually marry after a seven-and-a-half-year courtship. In her autobiography, Priscilla said that Presley was concerned that his 24-month spell as a GI would ruin his career....

Is Monastic reform became an important issue during the 11th century, as elites began to worry that monks were not adhering to the rules binding them to a strictly religious life. a good answer to this question? [A]. yes [B]. no","completion":"[B]. no The answer provided does not directly address the question about the location of Cluny Abbey's founding in France. However, for a detailed and long answer, we can discuss both the geographical location of Cluny Abbey and its significance in monastic reform. Cluny Abbey was founded in 910 AD in the region of Burgundy, which is located in the eastern part of France. It was established by William I, the Duke of Aquitaine, who provided lands and resources for the monastery. The Abbey was situated in the present-day commune of Cluny in the department of Saône-et-Loire, which is part of the larger region of Bourgogne-Franche-Comté. The founding of Cluny Abbey holds immense significance in the history of monasticism, especially as it relates to the broader monastic reform movement that took place during the 10th and 11th centuries. Cluny Abbey played a central role in shaping the Cluniac Reform, which sought to address concerns about the laxity in religious observance and adherence to the Rule of St. Benedict among monks across Europe. The Cluniac Reform aimed to restore the vigor and strict observance of the monastic rules, strengthening the centralization and independence of monasteries from secular authorities such as local lords, kings, or bishops. Under the leadership of several noteworthy abbots, like Odo of Cluny, Majolus, and Odilo, the reform spread to other monasteries, and Cluny became a leading center of monasticism with its influence reaching across the continent. Cluny Abbey held a tight control over a large network of monastic houses, numbering around a thousand at its peak, with a vast community of monks committed to the ideal of religious life. Cluny Abbey was particularly known for its emphasis on liturgy and prayer, with its monks dedicating a significant portion of their time to chanting the divine offices throughout the day and night, seeking to fulfill St. Benedict's directive of \\"pray and work\\" through continuous intercession for the Church and the world. This allowed the Cluniac monks to serve as a spiritual focal point for the Christian faithful, facilitating their connection to God and saints. In conclusion, Cluny Abbey was founded in the Burgundy region of eastern France, in the present-day commune of Cluny in the department of Saône-et-Loire. Its establishment marked the beginning of the influential Cluniac Reform, which sought to restore strict observance of monastic rules, promote the centralization of monastic institutions, and increase their independence from secular authorities. Cluny Abbey was a leading force behind this reform movement in the 10th and 11th centuries and became an important spiritual center for European monasticism."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To unbrick a hard-bricked Samsung GT-S5570, you will need to find a special program called software (or firmware) that can make your phone work again.

The group's membership has had at least a dozen changes over the years, including a period from 1976 to 1981 when the band performed and recorded as the Dirt Band. Constant members since the early times are singer-guitarist Jeff Hanna and drummer Jimmie Fadden. Multi-instrumentalist John McEuen was with the band from 1966 to 1986 and returned during 2001 departing once again in November 2017. The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band was founded around 1966 in Long Beach, California by singer-guitarist Jeff Hanna and singer-songwriter guitarist Bruce Kunkel who had performed as the New Coast Two and later the Illegitimate Jug Band. Trying, in the words of the band's website, to \\"figure out how not to have to work for a living,\\" Hanna and Kunkel joined informal jam sessions at McCabe's Guitar Shop in Long Beach. There they met a few other musicians: guitarist/washtub bassist Ralph Barr, guitarist-clarinetist Les Thompson, harmonicist and jug player Jimmie Fadden, and guitarist-vocalist Jackson Browne. As Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, the six men started as a jug band and adopted the burgeoning southern California folk rock musical style, playing in local clubs while wearing pinstripe suits and cowboy boots. Their first paying performance was at the Golden Bear in Huntington Beach, California. Browne was in the band for only a few months before he left to concentrate on a solo career as a singer-songwriter. He was replaced by John McEuen on banjo, fiddle, mandolin, and steel guitar. McEuen's older brother, William, was the group's manager, and he helped the band get signed with Liberty Records, which released the group's debut album, The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band during 1967. The band's first single, \\"Buy for Me the Rain,\\" was a Top 40 success, and the band gained exposure on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, as well as concerts with such disparate artists as Jack Benny and The Doors. A second album, Ricochet, was released later during the year and was less successful than their first. Kunkel wanted the band to \\"go electric\\", and include more original material. Bruce left the group to form WordSalad and Of The People. He was replaced by multi-instrumentalist Chris Darrow. By 1968, the band adopted electrical instruments anyway, and added drums. The first electric album, Rare Junk, was a commercial failure, as was their next, Alive. The band continued to gain publicity, mainly as a novelty act, making an appearance in the 1968 film, For Singles Only, and a cameo appearance in the 1969 musical western film, Paint Your Wagon, performing \\"Hand Me Down That Can o' Beans\\". The band also played Carnegie Hall as an opening act for Bill Cosby and played in a jam session with Dizzy Gillespie.

Stone Sour is an American rock band formed in Des Moines, Iowa, in 1992, performing for five years, before disbanding in 1997. They reunited in 2000 and since 2006, the group has consisted of Corey Taylor (lead vocals, guitar), Josh Rand (guitar) and Roy Mayorga (drums). Longtime members Joel Ekman (drums, percussion), Shawn Economaki (bass guitar), and Jim Root (guitar) left the group in 2006, 2011, and 2014 respectively. To date, Stone Sour have released six studio albums Stone Sour (2002); Come What(ever) The band released a song called \\"The Pessimist\\" as a free download on their Facebook page on March 27, 2012. The song was previously only available on the iTunes deluxe version of the soundtrack to Transformers: Dark of the Moon. They also released their first DVD Live at Brighton in the same year, capturing their performance on November 7, 2010. It was announced via Instagram on May 3, 2012 that bassist Shawn Economaki had parted ways with the band on amicable terms. He was replaced in the studio by current Skid Row bassist Rachel Bolan. Stone Sour started recording their fourth studio album in early 2012. Corey Taylor stated that the album would end up being a double album or concept album, and described the album's sound as \\"Pink Floyd's The Wall meets Alice in Chains's Dirt\\". It was later announced that the new material would be released as two separate albums. The first album, House of Gold & Bones - Part 1 was released worldwide on October 23, 2012, and the second album House of Gold & Bones - Part 2 was released worldwide on April 9, 2013. The project also has a 4-part graphic novel series that accompanies the albums, telling the linear storyline featured in the twin albums' lyrics. The first two songs from Part 1, \\"Gone Sovereign\\" and the first official single, \\"Absolute Zero\\" were released for radio airplay in mid/late August 2012. The first single from House of Gold & Bones Part 2 was \\"Do Me a Favor\\". It was released digitally on February 12. Guitarist Josh Rand stated in an interview with O2 Academy that there was a song recorded for Part 1, an instrumental which was deemed 'not up to par' by the band. The song will likely be released in the future once James Root and Josh Rand do 'some stuff to it guitar-wise'. On October 5, 2012, Johny Chow of Fireball Ministry and Cavalera Conspiracy was announced as the bassist for the band on the House of Gold & Bones tour cycle. Stone Sour subsequently played Soundwave Festival 2013 in Australia and on the Sunday at Download Festival 2013. Guitarist James Root did not tour with Stone Sour in the winter of 2013, as he had to take a brief hiatus from the group to work on .5: The Gray Chapter with Slipknot, although it was later revealed that he was fired from the band due to musical differences. He claimed that the band wanted to focus on \\"radio play and money,\\" in which Root fought against, and that led to a split. Christian Martucci filled in for Root during that period.

Anyone found guilty of \\"funding or sponsoring homosexuality or other related activities\\" will be sentenced to a seven-year jail term.

Now, let me explain why the other choices are not the best fit: - AIDS, CNN, Africa, Harry Belafonte, Mathilde Krim, Nigeria, U.S., Uganda, and Yoweri Museveni in the United States: These options don't make sense because they don't focus on the main topic, which is HIV/AIDS.

Article: Almost 80% of the Americans have stated their opposition to cloning pet animals such as cats and dogs, yet companies still try to make a business out of selling cloned pets. Pet cloning has been promoted as a way to \\"bring back\\" or \\"copy\\" a beloved companion animal. However, studies have shown that cloning remains an experimental technology with many failures. Behind each lovely picture of a cloned cat or dog lie hundreds of animals that were kept in lab cages, receiving bad treatment to produce just that one cloned animal. For all that, you end up with a cloned animal who is unlikely to appear like the original physically or behaviorally and may experience serious health problems. Also, while pet cloning companies are charging customers up to 150,000 for a cloned pet, millions of homeless animals of the same species are available in US animal shelters for around 100. Unfortunately, most of these animals are killed for lack of adopting homes. With No Pet Cloning campaign, the American Anti-Vivisection Society (AAVS) tries to protect both animals and people from harm. They campaigned until the US companies that sold cloned animals closed their doors. First it was Genetic Savings & Clone Inc. and then it was BioArts International. When BioArts was closed, its owner, Lou Hawthorne, finally had to _ the problems of pet cloning. According to Hawthorne, he has seen numerous failures during his pet cloning attempts, \\"One clone----which was supposed to be black and white----was born greenish-yellow where it should have been white (we still have no good explanation for how that happened).\\" The AAVS is educating the public about the animal suffering and is seeking regulation of cloning activities.

Question: When water absorbs salt the water becomes _______. Answer: more dense Explanation: The question is asking about the effect of dissolving salt in water on the water's properties. Specifically, it is about the change in water's density after absorbing salt. To answer the question, we use the provided information that when water absorbs salt, it becomes \\"more dense.\\" So the blank in the question should be filled with \\"more dense\\": \\"When water absorbs salt, the water becomes more dense.\\" This occurs because, by dissolving salt in water, we are adding more mass (from the salt) into the same volume of water. As a result, the density of the solution increases. Density is defined as mass per unit of volume, so when more mass (salt) is added without changing the volume significantly, the density increases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What does the government sometimes have too much of? A. canada B. trouble C. city D. control E. water The best answer is Answer:","completion":"D. Control The best answer is D. Control, as the government sometimes has too much control over various aspects of people's lives, the economy, and society in general. This issue has been widely debated throughout history. In an ideal democracy, the government's power is supposed to be limited and derived from the consent of the governed. The government should work for the welfare of its citizens and respect their fundamental rights. However, in practice, many governments tend to have too much control over certain aspects, which can lead to the infringement of individual liberties and a centralized decision-making process that may not cater to the diverse needs of the population. Some examples of the government having too much control may include: 1. Excessive surveillance: Some governments have been known to implement extensive surveillance systems and gather data on their citizens, often invading their privacy and violating their right to freedom from unwarranted intrusion. 2. Censorship: The government may control the flow of information by censoring the media, limiting internet access, and suppressing dissenting opinions. This can infringe upon the freedom of speech and prevent the public from accessing a diverse range of information and perspectives. 3. Economic intervention: Over-regulation and excessive interference in business and market affairs can stifle entrepreneurship, innovation, and competitiveness in the economy. This can lead to inefficiencies, lack of growth, and limited choices for consumers. 4. Social controls: Governments may intrude into people's personal lives by regulating or enforcing specific moral or social values. This can be seen in the enforcement of personal dress codes, limiting reproductive rights, or making decisions on behalf of individuals based on a one-size-fits-all policy. 5. Centralized decision-making: Having too much control may lead to a top-down approach in governance, making it harder for regional and local governments to adapt to the needs and context of their communities. While the government plays an essential role in maintaining order, establishing justice, and ensuring that public goods and services are provided for, it becomes problematic when it extends its control excessively, limiting individual freedoms, and stifering social and economic growth. It is crucial to strike a balance between government authority and the protection of individual rights and liberties to maintain a healthy and functioning democracy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We were with the Frankfurt Zoological Society orangutan team deep in the Sumatran jungle at the site where Bobo the endangered Sumatran orangutan was to be released. I was standing with the CNN team about 10 feet from the orangutan's crate, watching in anticipation as an Indonesian man was standing on top about to open it. He lifted one wall of the crate and Bobo slowly walked out. The orangutan was very calm as he exited the crate. The first thing he did was look over to where we were standing. That also happened to be the direction where our tech expert John had placed our gopro camera just a few feet away. It was an incredible sight and a great shot. Read more: 'We knew this was going to be a trip like no other' I was actually a bit nervous seeing Bobo look at us. FZS Indonesia Director Peter Pratje warned us not to get too close to the 11-year-old male orangutan. Sumatran orangutans can be very strong and unpredictable. We had no idea what to expect. Did we make him feel threatened? Would he charge a group of onlookers with cameras? Luckily for us, the answer was no. He turned away from us and walked into the jungle. The islands of Sumatra and Borneo are the only two places on earth where wild orangutans roam free. It's illegal to have one as a pet because it's an endangered species, but they're sold on the black market for thousands of dollars. Pet orangutans are hunted and captured as very small babies from remote areas of the rainforest. It's a brutal process. Mother orangutans often fight to protect their babies, like any mother would, so the mother is often killed in the process. It's a cruel way to get a cute pet for only a few years. Most orangutans are too much for people to handle as they grow into adolescence, so the owners seldom keep their pets. That's exactly what happened to Bobo. He was five years old when his owner gave him up. Bobo was then brought to Peter Pratje and his team at the Frankfurt Zoological Society. Read more: Why you should care about the Sumatran rainforest. When the FZS obtains a former pet orangutan like Bobo, the only life these animals have ever known is captivity. So the FZS team has to erase all the captive behavior the orangutan learned as a pet and replace it with wild orangutan behavior. It takes many years to individually model this behavior to these orangutans to replicate the lessons that a mother orangutan would've taught her baby. Each orangutan has to learn everything from finding food to climbing a tree. Climbing is very important for Sumatran orangutans. They share the same habitat as Sumatran tigers, so to keep from becoming a tiger's dinner, orangutans must live most of their lives in trees. After Bobo left his crate, he was supposed to climb the tree in front of him to a platform Peter and his team had constructed. But he didn't. Frustratingly, Bobo wasn't using his training. He remained on the ground, walking around, as we followed him for more than half an hour. Read more: Orangutans stressed by eco-tourists. After a release, members of the FZS orangutan team usually follow the newly wild orangutan for several weeks during the day for until they're sure the orangutan can survive on its own. Several members of the team were following Bobo that day trying to coax him into the trees with fruit. Nothing worked. Minutes ticked by. Finally, Peter theorized that Bobo was staying on the ground because there were so many people around him walking on the ground. Bobo has been modeling the behavior of human trainers for years, so maybe he wanted to be like us and stay on the ground. We didn't want to hurt Bobo's chances of survival, so we decided to leave him and the FZS trackers to go about their day. It was too early to tell how Bobo will be able to survive in the rainforest by himself. We would have to wait and get an update from Peter later. Walking back to the camp, we were all feeling a sense of awe and hope for the future of Sumatran orangutans and for endangered species worldwide. If this species can be brought back from the brink of extinction, could this be a model for other species? What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"This article narrates the release of Bobo, an endangered Sumatran orangutan, back into the wild and highlights the situation of orangutans and the efforts to conserve them. 1. The release event: The narrator talks about witnessing the release of Bobo, an 11-year-old male Sumatran orangutan, into the Sumatran jungle by Frankfurt Zoological Society (FZS) orangutan team. The orangutan exited his crate calmly and observed his surroundings before venturing into the jungle. 2. Orangutan habitat: The article mentions that Sumatra and Borneo are the only two places on Earth where wild orangutans roam free. 3. Illegal pet trade: The author highlights the illegal pet trade in orangutans, explaining how baby orangutans are captured in cruel ways and sold on the black market for thousands of dollars. Orangutans become difficult to handle as they grow, causing owners to give them up. 4. Rehabilitation process: The FZS team works to erase all captive behavior learned by orangutans and replace it with wild orangutan behavior, mimicking the lessons a mother would teach her baby. This includes finding food and tree climbing, vital skills for survival in the wild. 5. Bobo's release and adaptation: After Bobo's release, he didn't initially climb trees or use his training. The team followed Bobo, trying to coax him into trees with fruit. Eventually, they theorized that he remained on the ground because of the presence of humans; hence, they decided to leave him to adapt on his own. 6. Conservation prospects: The release of Bobo and the work of the FZS create a sense of hope for the future conservation of Sumatran orangutans and endangered species worldwide. The efforts to rehabilitate and reintroduce orangutans into the wild could be a model for other species' conservation as well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The Mozarts' first London lodgings were above a barber's shop in Cecil Court, near St Martin-in-the-Fields. Letters of introduction from Paris proved effective; on 27 April 1764, four days after their arrival, the children were playing before King George III and his 19-year-old German queen, Charlotte Sophia. A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \\"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\\".Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th. This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June, at Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens. Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as \\"a way to earn the love of this very special nation\\". Wolfgang was advertised as \\"the celebrated and astonishing Master Mozart, a Child of Seven Years of Age...\\" (he was in fact eight), \\"justly esteemed the most extraordinary Prodigy, and most amazing Genius, that has appeared in any Age\\". On 8 July there was a private performance at the Grosvenor Square home of the Earl of Thanet, from which Leopold returned with an inflammation of the throat and other worrying symptoms. \\"Prepare your heart to hear one of the saddest events\\", he wrote to Hagenauer in anticipation of his own imminent demise. He was ill for several weeks, and for the sake of his health the family moved from their Cecil Court lodgings to a house in the countryside, at 180 Ebury Street, then considered part of the village of Chelsea.

By the summer of 1906, Mahler had been director of the Vienna Hofoper for nine years. Throughout this time his practice was to leave Vienna at the close of the Hofoper season for a summer retreat, where he could devote himself to composition. Since 1899 this had been at Maiernigg, near the resort town of Maria Wörth in Carinthia, southern Austria, where Mahler built a villa overlooking the Wörthersee. In these restful surroundings Mahler completed his Symphonies No. 4, No. 5, No. 6 and No. 7, his Rückert songs and his song cycle Kindertotenlieder (\\"Songs on the Death of Children\\").Until 1901, Mahler's compositions had been heavily influenced by the German folk-poem collection Des Knaben Wunderhorn (\\"The Youth's Magic Horn\\"), which he had first encountered around 1887. The music of Mahler's many Wunderhorn settings is reflected in his Symphonies No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4, which all employ vocal as well as instrumental forces. From about 1901, however, Mahler's music underwent a change in character as he moved into the middle period of his compositional life. Here, the more austere poems of Friedrich Rückert replace the Wunderhorn collection as the primary influence; the songs are less folk-related, and no longer infiltrate the symphonies as extensively as before. During this period Symphonies No. 5, No. 6 and No. 7 were written, all as purely instrumental works, portrayed by Mahler scholar Deryck Cooke as \\"more stern and forthright ..., more tautly symphonic, with a new granite-like hardness of orchestration\\".Mahler arrived at Maiernigg in June 1906 with the draft manuscript of his Seventh Symphony; he intended to spend time revising the orchestration until an idea for a new work should strike. The composer's wife Alma Mahler, in her memoirs, says that for a fortnight Mahler was \\"haunted by the spectre of failing inspiration\\"; Mahler's recollection, however, is that on the first day of the vacation he was seized by the creative spirit, and plunged immediately into composition of the work that would become his...

They were carrying the usual rope, and it was hanging down from the basket of the balloon. At the end of the rope they had tied a metal box. This could hold water, or it could be empty. So they were able to change its weight. It was for use over the sea. They were also carrying some bags of sand. After the sun rose, the balloon went higher. It went up to 3,000 meters, and the air was very cold. The water in the balloon became ice. Snow fell past the men's basket, and they could see more snow on the ground. The men tried to throw out some more sand, but it was hard. They tried to break the icy sand with their knives, but it was not easy. The work was slow and they were still falling, so they had to drop some whole bags of sand. One of them fell on an icy lake and made a black hole in the ice. At last they pulled the box into the basket. It was still snowing; so they climbed up to get away from the snow. They rose to 5,100 meters! Everything became icy.

Please answer a question about the following article about Pacific War: Thus, only in 1944 did the U.S. Navy begin to use its 150 submarines to maximum effect: installing effective shipboard radar, replacing commanders deemed lacking in aggression, and fixing the faults in the torpedoes. Japanese commerce protection was \\"shiftless beyond description,\\"[nb 14] and convoys were poorly organized and defended compared to Allied ones, a product of flawed IJN doctrine and training – errors concealed by American faults as much as Japanese overconfidence. The number of U.S. submarines patrols (and sinkings) rose steeply: 350 patrols (180 ships sunk) in 1942, 350 (335) in 1943, and 520 (603) in 1944. By 1945, sinkings of Japanese vessels had decreased because so few targets dared to venture out on the high seas. In all, Allied submarines destroyed 1,200 merchant ships – about five million tons of shipping. Most were small cargo-carriers, but 124 were tankers bringing desperately needed oil from the East Indies. Another 320 were passenger ships and troop transports.

This is especially important if the gloves are made from delicate materials like leather or wool. Step 2: Prepare the cleaning solution For most gloves, you can use a mild detergent in lukewarm water. Fill a sink or basin with water, add a few drops of the mild detergent, and mix it well to create a soapy solution. If your gloves are made of leather or other delicate materials, you might want to use a specialized cleaning solution or leather cleaner. Step 3: Spot test for colorfastness Dip a small, inconspicuous area of the glove (like the inside of the wrist) into the soapy solution to test for colorfastness. If the dye from the gloves runs or the color changes, you may want to consider a different cleaning method or solution. Step 4: Clean the gloves Submerge the gloves in the soapy solution and gently massage them, focusing on any particularly dirty areas. Be careful not to be too rough, as this may damage the gloves. Avoid exposing leather gloves to water for prolonged periods, as this can damage the material. Step 5: Rinse Drain the soapy water and fill the sink or basin with clean water. Rinse the gloves thoroughly, making sure to remove all soap residue. If the gloves are leather, you can use a damp cloth to wipe away excess cleaner instead of fully submerging them in water during the rinsing process. Step 6: Remove excess water Gently remove the excess water from the gloves by pressing them between your palms. Do not wring or twist the gloves, as this can cause damage or misshapen them. Step 7: Dry the gloves Lay the gloves flat on a clean towel and gently shape them back to their original form. Allow them to air dry at room temperature, away from direct sunlight or heat sources. Do not use a dryer or heater, as high temperatures can cause the gloves to shrink or lose their shape. Step 8: Optional conditioning for leather gloves For leather gloves, you may want to apply a leather conditioner once they are dry, to maintain their softness and prevent cracking.

Question: Given the following passage \\"Constantius, renewing his previous policies favoring the Arians, banished Athanasius from Alexandria once again. This was followed, in 356, by an attempt to arrest Athanasius during a vigil service. Athanasius fled to Upper Egypt, where he stayed in several monasteries and other houses. During this period, Athanasius completed his work Four Orations against the Arians and defended his own recent conduct in the Apology to Constantius and Apology for His Flight. Constantius's persistence in his opposition to Athanasius, combined with reports Athanasius received about the persecution of non-Arians by the new Arian bishop George of Laodicea, prompted Athanasius to write his more emotional History of the Arians, in which he described Constantius as a precursor of the Antichrist.\\", answer the following question.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the name of the album that had a 100 million dollar promotional campaign? Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary. In February 2014, another new U2 song, the single \\"Invisible\\", debuted in a Super Bowl television advertisement and was made available in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS. Bono called the track a \\"sneak preview\\" of their pending record.On 9 September 2014, U2 announced their thirteenth studio album, Songs of Innocence, at an Apple product launch event, and released it digitally the same day to all iTunes Store customers at no cost. The release made the album available to over 500 million iTunes customers in what Apple CEO Tim Cook called \\"the largest album release of all time.\\" Apple reportedly paid Universal Music Group and U2 a lump sum for a five-week exclusivity period in which to distribute the album and spent US100 million on a promotional campaign.

To break down this command and understand how to classify, let's take a closer look at these guidelines and logical operations to interpret it. Let's break down the command step by step: 1. { all_rows ; location ; china }: This command is selecting all rows in the table where the 'location' column value is 'china'. 2. { filter_eq { filter_eq { all_rows ; location ; china } ; authors ; yuan } }: This command is filtering the rows from the above command where the 'authors' column name is 'yuan'. This command returns only the rows for author 'yuan' from the location 'china'. 3. { only { filter_eq { filter_eq { all_rows ; location ; china } ; authors ; yuan } }: This command is checking if there is exactly one row in the view. It only returns true if there is exactly one row for author 'yuan' from the location 'china'. 4. { eq { hop { filter_eq { filter_eq { all_rows ; location ; china } ; authors ; yuan } ; name } ; didactylornis } }: This command compares the 'name' column value from the record of author 'yuan' from 'china' to 'didactylornis'.

Is The Ordovician Period started at a major extinction event called the Cambrian-Ordovician extinction events some time about 485.4 ± 1.9 Ma. a good answer to this question? OPTIONS: (1). yes (2). no","completion":"Yes, your answer is mostly correct, but it requires a bit more elaboration to provide a more detailed and comprehensive response. The Ordovician Period is a geologic period that occurred approximately 485.4 million years ago, following the Cambrian Period and preceding the Silurian Period. It is in fact characterized by a series of extinction events called the Cambrian-Ordovician extinction events that led to the end of the Cambrian Period and the beginning of the Ordovician Period. The Cambrian-Ordovician extinction events were not an isolated occurrence, but rather a series of smaller extinction events that happened over a short span of time. These events were marked by significant changes in the Earth's climate, alterations in sea levels, and shifting continental arrangements. They also had a profound impact on marine life, leading to the extinction of certain trilobite species and the emergence of new brachiopod and echinoderm lineages. While the exact causes of these extinction events remain uncertain, several factors have been suggested. These include global cooling and glaciation episodes, changes in atmospheric composition, oceanic anoxia, and changes in marine ecosystems driven by the origin and diversification of large predators. The combination of these factors led to a cascade of effects on organisms, resulting in increased extinction rates and eventually the emergence of new lineages and ecosystems during the Ordovician Period. In conclusion, you are correct that the Ordovician Period started with the Cambrian-Ordovician extinction events around 485.4 million years ago. To provide a more detailed answer, you can also describe the series of smaller extinction events that led to significant changes in the Earth's climate, sea levels, and biodiversity. It is also important to mention the various factors that have been proposed as possible triggers for these extinction events and their effects on the marine organisms of that time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

So the equation becomes: -10 = -5*j Now, to find the value of j, we can follow these steps: 1. Isolate the term containing j on one side of the equation. In our case, we already have the term like that: -5*j. 2. Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of j. The coefficient of j is -5, so we divide both sides of the equation by -5: -10 / -5 = -5*j / -5 This simplifies to: 2 = j So, the value of j is 2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Skull - A skull is an object, and its appearance is dependent on the material it is made of and its surface properties. It may or may not reflect light based on these factors. 2. Haze - Haze is a collection of atmospheric particles that can scatter light. Haze, by itself, is not an object, it is a weather condition. Thus, it is not relevant to the question. 3. Coal - Coal is usually black and has a matte surface. It does absorb most visible light but might still reflect a small amount back to the viewer. 4. Smooth - Smooth is a descriptor of a surface's texture and does not determine how something looks when it doesn't reflect light. A smooth surface can reflect light or not, depending on the material it is made of and other factors. 5. Mold - Mold is a type of fungus, and its appearance is dependent on the species and its growth conditions. Some molds appear black and absorb light, while others have different colors and reflect light. 6. Cracks - Cracks are imperfections or discontinuities in a surface. They can appear dark or not depending on the material and the lighting conditions. They do not provide enough information to determine if they reflect light or not. 7. Black - An object that appears black absorbs all visible light and reflects very little to none of it back. This option is the closest match to the description of an object that doesn't reflect light. 8. Barrel - A barrel is an object, and its appearance is dependent on the material it is made of, its surface properties, and its color. It may or may not reflect light based on these factors.

They founded several of the kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England, and their name is the root of the name \\"England\\". The name comes from the district of Angeln, an area located on the Baltic shore of what is now Schleswig-Holstein. - Ireland (Ulster-Scots: ) is an island in the North Atlantic. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest on Earth. - English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and is now a global \\"lingua franca\\". Named after the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to England, it ultimately derives its name from the Anglia (Angeln) peninsula in the Baltic Sea. It is most closely related to the Frisian languages, although its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages in the early medieval period, and later by Romance languages, particularly French. English is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60 sovereign states. It is the most commonly spoken language in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand, and is widely spoken in some areas of the Caribbean, Africa, and South Asia. It is the third most common native language in the world, after Mandarin and Spanish. It is the most widely learned second language and an official language of the United Nations, of the European Union, and of many other world and regional international organisations. It is the most widely spoken Germanic language, accounting for at least 70% of speakers of this Indo-European branch. - An author is narrowly defined as the originator of any written work and can thus also be described as a writer (with any distinction primarily being an implication that an author is a writer of one or more major works, such as books or plays). More broadly defined, an author is \\"the person who originated or gave existence to anything\\" and whose authorship determines responsibility for what was created. The more specific phrase published author refers to an author (especially but not necessarily of books) whose work has been independently accepted for publication by a reputable publisher , versus a self-publishing author or an unpublished one . - Karl Julius Ploetz ( 8 July 1819 -- 6 February 1881 ) was a German author of scholarly works , most notably his Epitome of History published in the English language in 1883 . Ploetz was born in Berlin . He is credited with the idea of arranging historic data by dates , geographic location , and other factors . As later used in the English language , Encyclopedia of World History credited with being one of the most complete and comprehensive academic tools available before the electronic revolution . His work was a compilation of factual world events designed to help the students and the general reader . The first English translation was in the U.S. in 1883 by William H.

The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The Baltic Sea ( ; ) is a sea of the Atlantic Ocean, enclosed by Scandinavia, Finland, the Baltic countries, and the North European Plain. It includes the Gulf of Bothnia, the Bay of Bothnia, the Gulf of Finland, the Gulf of Riga, and the Bay of Gdask. The sea stretches from 53°N to 66°N latitude and from 10°E to 30°E longitude. A mediterranean sea of the Atlantic, with limited water exchange between the two bodies, the Baltic Sea drains through the Danish islands into the Kattegat by way of the straits of Øresund, the Great Belt, and the Little Belt. - Frisia or Friesland is a coastal region along the southeastern corner of the North Sea in what today is mostly a large part of the Netherlands, including modern Friesland, and smaller parts of Germany. Frisia is the traditional homeland of the Frisians, a Germanic people that speaks Frisian languages, which together with English form the Anglo-Frisian language group. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe.

Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world.

The Frisian languages is the closest living language group to English languages, and are together grouped into the Anglo-Frisian languages. However, modern English and Frisian are not mutually intelligible, nor are Frisian languages intelligible among themselves, due to foreign influences. The three Frisian languages have been heavily influenced by and bear similarities to Dutch, Danish, and/or Low German, depending upon their location. Additional shared linguistic characteristics between the Great Yarmouth area, Friesland, and Denmark are likely to have resulted from the close trading relationship these areas maintained during the centuries-long Hanseatic League of the Late Middle Ages. - A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas.

The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation. Humanitarian assistance has been exempted from the economic sanctions, but Beasely said import restrictions has made it more complicated to bring in aid, and made...

Fungi communicate with their own and related species as well as with non fungal organisms in a great variety of symbiotic interactions, especially with bacteria, unicellular eukaryote, plants and insects through biochemicals of biotic origin. The biochemicals trigger the fungal organism to react in a specific manner, while if the same chemical molecules are not part of biotic messages, they do not trigger the fungal organism to react. This implies that fungal organisms can differentiate between molecules taking part in biotic messages and similar molecules being irrelevant in the situation. So far five different primary signalling molecules are known to coordinate different behavioral patterns such as filamentation, mating, growth, and pathogenicity. Behavioral coordination and production of signaling substances is achieved through interpretation processes that enables the organism to differ between self or non-self, a biotic indicator, biotic message from similar, related, or non-related species, and even filter out \\"noise\\", i.e. similar molecules without biotic content. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\".

It's hard to focus on the story, right? Well, that's sort of what \\"noise\\" is for fungi. When they are trying to communicate or understand messages from their environment, there may be other, similar chemical molecules that could be confusing, but aren't actually important messages. These unimportant molecules are kind of like the background noise when you're trying to listen to your story. They're not part of the essential conversation or message fungi need to understand. So, just like you focus on the story and ignore the other sounds, fungi have a process to \\"filter out\\" these \\"noise\\" molecules that don't contain any important information."},{"prompt":"Read the bio below and try to give details on mike battle 's: - finalyear - statlabel - draftyear - number - position - statvalue - college - draftpick - birth date - draftround - nfl - birth place - debutyear Bio: michael leonard battle -lrb- born july 9 , 1946 in south gate , california -rrb- is a former american football player in the american football league -lrb- afl -rrb- . and the national football league -lrb- nfl -rrb- . a safety , he played college football at the university of southern california , and played professionally for the afl 's new york jets in 1969 , and for the jets of the nfl in 1970 . he appeared in the movie \`\` c.c. and company '' -lrb- 1970 -rrb- , which starred joe namath , then starting quarterback of the new york jets .

The seventh and eighth major Nine Inch Nails studio-releases, Ghosts I–IV and The Slip, were released in March and May 2008 respectively. Both albums feature contributions from live-band member Alessandro Cortini. Since the release of Ghosts I–IV, a 25-date tour was announced in several North American cities. Cortini and Freese returned as members from the previous tour, while Robin Finck rejoined the band. The lineup was initially to include Rich Fownes, but before any scheduled performances it was revealed that Justin Meldal-Johnsen would instead be contributing on bass guitar. Supporting acts for the tour include Deerhunter, Crystal Castles, Does It Offend You, Yeah?, Ghostland Observatory, A Place to Bury Strangers, and White Williams. In early June, a tour EP was released for free on the Nine Inch Nails website featuring four songs from the supporting artists and one from Nine Inch Nails. The files are DRM-free MP3s that are fully tagged, and included with the download are desktop wallpapers and a printable tour poster. The band headlined the 2008 Lollapalooza festival, the 2008 Virgin Festival, and the first Pemberton Music Festival. In May 2008, Nine Inch Nails announced that premium seating for all the upcoming 2008 tour shows would be offered in a pre-sale for fans who registered at the official Nine Inch Nails website.

It seems like you are interested in recording audio or video for a certain duration. Here is a more in-depth explanation of the factors you will need to consider. 1. Recording device and media: The choice of recording device will depend on the type of recording (audio or video) and the quality desired. Ensure that your device has enough storage capacity to handle the recording. Use an appropriate recording format like MP3, WAV, or AIFF for audio and MP4, MOV, or AVI for video recordings. 2. Recording duration: Determine the maximum length of your recording. This will impact the file size and storage requirements. For instance, if you want to record up to 30 minutes, you would need about 30MB of storage for an audio recording in MP3 format at a standard bitrate (128 Kbps). Likewise, a 30-minute video recording would require around 1.8GB of storage in Full HD resolution at 30 frames per second. 3. Recording environment: Identify the best location for your recording. Choose an environment with minimal background noise and optimal acoustics. For video recordings, ensure the area is well lit and has a backdrop that complements the subject matter. 4. Audio quality: If you are recording audio, make sure to use a good quality microphone. Experiment with microphone placement to find the best audio capture. For video recordings, consider using a dedicated microphone for better audio quality, as built-in microphones on cameras can be of varied quality. 5. Video quality: Select the correct resolution and frame rate for your video recording. Higher resolutions and frame rates will result in larger file sizes and increased storage requirements. Aim for at least 720p resolution for a decent quality video recording. Adjust your camera settings accordingly, and make sure the camera is steady and focused throughout the recording. 6. Post-processing: Once your recording is complete, you may need to edit your audio or video to remove unwanted sections, adjust volume levels, or add any visual or sound effects. Use a suitable editing software to enhance your recording as needed. Remember to save your final output in a format that can be easily shared or accessed by your target audience. 7. Backup and storage: Always make a backup of your original recording. Store your backup separately from the main copy, either on a different device or using a reliable cloud storage service. This will help in case any data is lost, corrupted, or accidentally deleted. Following these steps and considering these factors should help you make a successful recording that meets your requirements and time limitations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Puskar, AP) Story Highlights Team in Tustin, Calif., was allegedly running program months before Saints scandal was revealed Kids were paid between 20 and 50, according to a coach, parents and players \\"Maybe I did give (a player) money to go to the snack bar,\\" says the coach who has been suspended Last March, the NFL announced its investigation into the New Orleans Saints bounty scandal. A renewed inquiry is underway into whether a California youth football team of 10- and 11-year-olds was offering cash bounties for knocking opponents out of games months before the NFL story broke. The national governing body for Pop Warner football says it has reopened an investigation into an alleged 2011 bounty system operated by the Tustin Junior Pee Wee Red Cobras. National Pop Warner has suspended the coach of the team and the president of the league, pending results of the investigation. TheOrange County Register reported Sept. 21 that two of the Tustin coaches offered players cash, usually between 20 and 50, for big hits and knocking opponents out of games. The article said its accounts were based on interviews with an assistant coach, a parent and players, including signed statements by two of the kids. Tustin league president Pat Galentine, who had been an assistant coach with the Red Cobras last year, denied in the article that there was a bounty program. Darren Crawford, coach of the Red Cobras in 2011, said the allegations were falsely made by \\"disgruntled\\" parents who forced their children to lie. \\"Maybe I did give (a player) money to go to the snack bar,\\" Crawford told The Register. The Orange Empire Conference investigated and decided not to hand out punishments, saying it found no evidence of a bounty system. Pop Warner, the national body based in Langhorne, Pa., wants to know more. \\"In light of new information and players coming forward who did not participate in the league investigation, National Pop Warner will intervene to further investigate the alleged bounty program in Tustin Pop Warner,\\" Pop Warner executive director Jon Butler said in a statement. \\"We will assign a local designee who is not affiliated with the association to lead the investigation and will work closely with the Wescon Region and Orange Empire Conference to ensure the safety of our participants and the integrity of the Pop Warner program. We take this matter very seriously and have asked Tustin Pop Warner head coach Darren Crawford and Tustin president Pat Galentine to step down until this situation is finalized.\\" The Wescon Region is an administrative region covering Arizona, Hawaii, southern California and southern Nevada. USA Football, a national youth football group endowed by the NFL and the NFL Players Association, issued a statement saying it has no affiliation with the Tustin league or the team that allegedly offered bounties. \\"USA Football rebukes any activity in which youth football coaches would encourage their players to injure an opponent or reward players for doing so. Any intentional action that attempts to inflict harm on a participant goes against football's inherent values of teamwork, discipline and sportsmanship,\\" said the statement from USA Football, based in Indianapolis. The Red Cobras were undefeated during the 2011 regular season. According to TheRegister, which did not name the players because of their ages, one of the players on whom a bounty was placed, an 11-year-old running back from the Santa Margarita Stallions, suffered a concussion while playing against the Red Cobras in a game last November. Assistant coach John Zanelli said the player who made the hit was paid by Crawford after the game. \\"This kid speared him. Hit him right in the head,\\" the father of the injured player said. Parents and players alleged that Crawford and assistant coach Richard Bowman offered bounties during three playoff games last season, but Zanelli said talk of cash rewards became covert after the hit on the Santa Margarita player. \\"They started concealing the program,\\" he said. The Red Cobras won their next game and lost in the national semifinals to end the season. Zanelli and other parents from the Tustin team left to start a team in a rival league. Jeff Wright, a Tustin board member, told The Register he believes they created the bounty story to use as leverage in trying to form their own team. Pop Warner reports that more than 250,000 youngsters play nationally in its football leagues. The governing body is named after Glenn \\"Pop\\" Warner, whose legendary college football coaching career ran from the late 1800s into the 1930s. Before this season, Pop Warner issued new rules aimed at protecting players from head injuries, including: ||||| Four months before the world heard about the New Orleans Saints' bounty scandal, two Pop Warner football coaches in Tustin began offering cash to their 10- and 11-year-old players for making big hits and knocking opponents out of games, according to an assistant coach, a parent, interviews with players and signed statements by two players. Tustin Red Cobras head coach Darren Crawford and assistant coach Richard Bowman, whose powerhouse squad went undefeated during the 2011 regular season, told their team to target specific players on the youth football teams from Yorba Linda, Santa Margarita and San Bernardino, said then-assistant coach John Zanelli and three players interviewed by the Register. All the other coaches and Tustin Pop Warner league officials deny a bounty program took place. Crawford said they did target opposing players but never told their team to injure them and never offered any payment for hitting or injuring them. One of the targeted players, an 11-year-old running back from the Santa Margarita Stallions, suffered a concussion after he was hit by a Red Cobras player in the Pop Warner Orange Bowl last November. The player who delivered the hit was paid by Crawford after the game, Zanelli said. The Register is not naming any of the players because of their ages. Tustin league president Pat Galentine, who was an assistant coach for the 2011 Red Cobras, emphatically denied any mention of money by Crawford or Bowman. \\"At no time was a bounty program ever discussed or was there an exchange of money for anything,\\" Galentine said. However, the parent of one of the Red Cobras players said money was paid to his son after the playoff game against Yorba Linda. \\"My son said he had won the prize,\\" said the father, whose name is not being used to protect the identity of his son. \\"He had a good, clean hit. The kids voted his play as the play of the game. He showed me one 20 bill. He said the coaches, plural, gave it to him.\\" That parent said he had told Galentine about his son receiving money in a phone call Friday morning. But when reached by The Register, Galentine said he was having difficulty with his phone and didn't hear what the parent said. Reached by phone this week, Crawford and Bowman denied the existence of a bounty program. Crawford, still a football coach in the Tustin Pop Warner program, said the parents who made the allegations are \\"disgruntled\\" and that they forced their children to lie. Bowman, who is taking a year off from coaching, said the parents and players are lying. \\"It's amazing what disgruntled parents will put their kids through,\\" Crawford said. Late Friday, Crawford said he is having trouble remembering whether he gave any player money after the Yorba Linda game. He said, \\"Maybe I did give him money to go to the snack bar.\\" But he was sure he didn't give any money as a part of a bounty program. Crawford said he knows for sure he did not give any player money after the Santa Margarita or San Bernardino games. Officials from the Orange Empire Conference, which oversees Pop Warner football in this region, investigated the allegations, interviewing coaches, parents and players from the Red Cobras and decided not to hand out any punishments or sanctions. O.E.C. commissioner Robert T. \\"Bobby\\" Espinosa said he found \\"no evidence\\" of a bounty program after hearing and reading statements from six parents and four players that alleged Crawford and Bowman offered between 20 and 50 during three playoff games at the end of the 2011 Junior Pee Wee football season. Two players who allegedly took money from the coaches did not agree to be interviewed by the O.E.C. The father of one of those players, the same father who told The Register his son had been paid, was among the parents interviewed by Espinosa. Zanelli said he was in the room when that father told Espinosa his son had been paid. Some parents of the targeted players are outraged. Tara Yocam, the mother of a targeted Santa Margarita player, said, \\"The (Tustin) coaches' behavior is appalling. I wouldn't allow my son to play for those Neanderthals. They're low-lifes. I'm embarrassed for them. It's immature parenting, trying to win at all cost. Where is the sense of right and wrong? It shows a complete lack of integrity.\\" Bitterness, accusations and bad blood are not uncommon in Pop Warner football, or other youth sports. In Tustin, both Bowman and Zanelli (who are on opposite sides of the bounty allegations) acknowledge each of them was suspended by their league for confrontations they've had with other parents. Allegations that coaches paid children to knock others out of the game make this case unique. An official at Pop Warner's national office in Pennsylvania said he was made aware of the Tustin allegations, but because the incidents occurred at Southern California games, it was the O.E.C.,'s responsibility to conduct a hearing and hand out punishment if necessary. Josh Pruce, Pop Warner's national director of scholastics and media relations, said he can't remember a bounty scandal ever happening in their program. \\"There shouldn't be that issue in Pop Warner football,\\" Pruce said. \\"There is no place for it. The kids are out there to learn football. There is no place for a bounty system.\\" Zanelli, three players and two parents met with The Register last Sunday and offered detailed descriptions of the Red Cobras' bounty program. They said Crawford was stung by his team's loss to Saddleback Valley in the 2010 Pop Warner Orange Bowl, and was determined to win the Pop Warner Orange Bowl in the 2011 season, advance through the playoffs and win the Pop Warner Super Bowl in Florida. Zanelli and two of the players said the first mention of money came during a team huddle near the end of football practice on Monday, Oct. 24, 2011. When Crawford first mentioned he would pay money for big hits and knocking opponents out of games, many of the Tustin Red Cobras shouted excitedly, energized by the prospect of earning cash, the players said. \\"We were like, 'OK! We're going to go hit them! Wow!'\\" one player said. A second player said, \\"When we were after practice, getting our gear off, we were guessing who was going to get the money.\\" That week the Red Cobras were preparing for their second playoff game of 2011. They would be facing a good team from Yorba Linda. During that week's practice, Crawford told the players to target particular players on the Yorba Linda team. \\"Crawford was saying, basically, they were going to give kids cash for the biggest hits in the game, and Bowman said if they hit certain players, they would get more money,\\" Zanelli said. \\"One was No. 42, and there were a couple of others as well.\\" \\"As the practices went on that week, Bowman in particular would reiterate (the bounty program) to the kids time and again,\\" Zanelli said. During an Oct. 27 film session at Crawford's house, Crawford explained how the winners of the cash would be determined, three players said. Crawford told the team that they could all vote, and the player with the most votes would get money. Crawford told them the most money could be won if the opponents' best player had to leave the game, they said. Galentine, who said he attended every film session, said the coaches made no mention of money or bounties. On game day, Oct. 29, the Red Cobras were going through their pre-game tackling drills. If a player executed a good warm-up hit, Bowman would yell, \\"'That will get you money,'\\" a player said. After the game, which the Red Cobras won 28-6, Zanelli and the players said Crawford gathered the team on the sideline and asked for a show of hands to vote for the best and second-best hits of the game. Then Crawford asked the assistant coaches to pitch in to pay the players who won. Zanelli said he and another assistant coach did not contribute to the bounty fund. \\"It wasn't right,\\" Zanelli said. Zanelli and one of the players said they saw Crawford, who was standing near the Tustin sideline after the conclusion of the Yorba Linda game, give cash to the player who got the most votes. The players said they were caught up in the competitive spirit and didn't consider whether it was right or wrong to accept money for great hits or even hurting an opposing player. One player said: \\"I was so excited, I didn't think that much about it.\\" The next week, before the playoff game against Santa Margarita, the Tustin coaches targeted at least three opposing players, Zanelli and the players said. At the Oct. 31 practice, the numbers of the Santa Margarita targets were taped to a Tustin tackling sled. \\"It was a matter of knocking them out of the game,\\" one of the players said. \\"Now that I look back, I know it was wrong.\\" The players said there was now so much talk among the Red Cobras about the money that Crawford told them, \\"Don't go bragging about this to anybody.\\" On Nov. 4, the Red Cobras played Santa Margarita in the Pop Warner Orange Bowl at Laguna Hills High School. The winner would be one victory away from qualifying to go to Florida. In the days leading up to the game, Zanelli said he told Crawford he didn't think the bounty program was a good idea. He said Crawford told him, \\"I hear you. I'll talk to Rich (Bowman).\\" After that, Zanelli said, Bowman was more subdued during practice drills. Still, Zanelli and the players said, several Santa Margarita players were targeted, including the quarterback and the running backs. And on game day, during pre-game warm-ups, Bowman tried to get the players fired up by yelling, \\"Do you want that money?\\" Tustin had a 32-6 lead in the fourth quarter, but some of its best players were still in the game. On an off-tackle play, a Santa Margarita running back and a Tustin defender collided. It was so violent, Zanelli recalled, \\"There was a gasp from the crowd.\\" A videotape of the game shows a helmet-to-helmet collision and the 11-year-old Santa Margarita player goes down. The stadium announcer says, \\"A big hit\\" with emphasis onbig. The Santa Margarita player is seen lying on the ground. The Tustin player who made the hit tries to help him up, but the Santa Margarita player wobbles and falls again. According to witnesses and participants, a doctor ran onto the field along with Santa Margarita coaches, and the game was delayed several minutes until the player was helped off the field. Reggie Scales, the father of the injured player, was one of the coaches who went on the field to help. Scales said the doctor diagnosed his son with a mild concussion, and the boy did not return to the game. Scales said his son had headaches for more than a month after the hit. \\"This kid speared him. Hit him right in the head,\\" Scales said. \\"It was a helmet-to-helmet hit.\\" After the game, the Tustin players didn't vote for the best hit. As coaches and kids walked to the postgame awards ceremony, Zanelli said he saw Crawford give money directly to the player who made the game's big hit. Another player said he was told by Crawford that he also would be receiving money for a big hit, but the coach never gave him the money. Tustin now had to beat a San Bernardino team in the Wescon Regional Finals to determine the Junior Pee Wee champion for the western United States and the right to go to Florida. The bounty program became \\"more subdued, covert,\\" in the week leading up to that game, Zanelli said. Zanelli and some players said that the talk of money was only between Crawford, Bowman and a few of the star players on the team. \\"They started concealing the program,\\" Zanelli said. On Nov. 11, Tustin beat San Bernardino 34-0. Zanelli and the players interviewed said they didn't know whether money was handed out after that game, but Zanelli said Crawford told the coaches there would be no such program in Florida. On Dec. 4, the Tustin Red Cobras beat the Worchester (Mass.) Vikings 40-6. Then, in the semifinal game on Dec. 7, the Red Cobras were beaten by the Beacon House (Washington, D.C.) Falcons 12-8. Tustin's season was over. In the aftermath, Zanelli and six other parents from the Tustin team left Pop Warner and, with parents of 15 other boys, formed a team that now plays in a rival league. But not without a fight. The Tustin board wouldn't allow Zanelli's new team to play under the Tustin umbrella. Jeff Wright, a Tustin board member, said he believes Zanelli, parents and players made up the story of the bounty program to use as leverage in an effort to force the league to allow them to form their own team. Zanelli also took to the league allegations about the coaches falsifying the weights of the players (players were required to weigh just under 100 pounds at the end of the season) and the coaches fighting during their trip to Florida. The league investigated and agreed with some of Zanelli's allegations and suspended Bowman for half a season and put Crawford on probation. For almost six months of haggling between the league and Zanelli, \\"He never mentioned the bounty,\\" Wright said. Zanelli acknowledged that initially he kept quiet about the bounties. He said he felt bad that he, as an assistant coach, hadn't done more to stop it. And he had another motivation for staying silent for as long as he did. \\"I was concerned the bounty would bring down the entire Tustin organization,\\" Zanelli said.

A former assistant coach alleged in a letter this spring to national and local Pop Warner officials that other team coaches ran the bounty program as their team, based in the Orange County city of Tustin, made a playoff run in late 2011. That was months before the National Football... ||||| Sometimes, to dominate the ultracompetitive world of Junior Pee Wee football, you change the game. And many of those changes have little to do with what happens on the field. The Tustin Red Cobras reached the 2011 Pop Warner Super Bowl in Kissimmee, Fla. Now, two members of the coaching staff and a parent of one of the players said some of the team’s coaches changed, bent and broke rules regarding sign-ups and the team’s roster – and encouraged the mostly 10- and 11-year-old boys to use weight-loss techniques described by a professional trainer as life threatening. On Thursday, National Pop Warner announced it will send an independent investigator to Tustin, and, until the investigation is complete, the organization will suspend the head coach, Darren Crawford, and president, Pat Galentine, of Tustin Pop Warner. \\"They cheated in order to get to Florida,\\" said a Red Cobras parent who did not want her name used to protect the identity of her son. \\"This is a powder keg of crap.\\" Her point of view is shared by a group of former Red Cobras who have now formed their own team in another league. The most outspoken in that group are former Red Cobras assistant coach John Zanelli and former Red Cobras equipment manager Paul Bunkers. On Sunday, Sept. 23, the Register reported allegations that last season Tustin coaches paid cash to some players on their youth players for big hits and more cash for knocking star players on opposing teams out of games. Seven sets of Red Cobras parents and players have confirmed that coaches Crawford and Richard Bowman targeted opposing players, offered cash incentives and paid several players for hard hits in games against youth teams from Yorba Linda, Santa Margarita and San Bernardino. Crawford and Bowman said they've never given cash to players or encouraged them to make hits on or injure opponents for money. The coaches said the allegations were made by a disgruntled parent who persuaded other parents and players to lie. Zanelli and Bowman have been suspended by Pop Warner in the past year. But Zanelli and Bunkers (who has not been suspended) are not alone in their claims. The Register contacted more than 20 coaches, former coaches, parents, attorneys, medical experts and players to report this story. Many coaches and players repeated allegations of bounties paid to Red Cobra players for clean football plays – and plays that put kids out of games. Earlier this year, Zanelli and Bunkers were among six parents and four players interviewed by officials from the Orange Empire Conference, which is the governing body over 28 Pop Warner organizations in Southern California. Despite the parents' and players' claims, the OEC found no evidence of a bounty program. The OEC, however, did look at other allegations by Zanelli, Bunkers and others, and found some of them to be true. Crawford was placed on probation for misreporting a player's weight. The OEC suspended Bowman for half a season for a physical altercation with another parent while the team was in Florida. This week, there has been a media frenzy that has enveloped the Red Cobras program with \\"Today,\\" \\"Good Morning America,\\" ESPN, CNN, \\"John and Ken\\" on KFI Radio, and several local television news outlets scrambling to get quotes from the Red Cobras players and parents. Jeoffrey Robinson, an attorney representing Crawford, told NBC, \\"Mr. Crawford has stated he may have made errors in judgment unrelated to a bounty program and is willing to make any amends possible to make himself a better coach. I'm hoping if nothing else that these accusations will help all of us to focus on what we say to young kids, how we try to motivate them, and what can we do to make sure they play safely themselves.\\" Crawford could not be reached for comment on this story. Bowman said, \\"No comment.\\" Attempts to reach Steve McGinnis, the president of OEC, were unsuccessful. ••• Before the 2011 season began, the Tustin organization, which includes teams for players from ages 7 to 14 in six tackle-football divisions, changed its sign-up rules in an effort to build a super team, Zanelli said. In 2011, in the Junior Pee Wee division, Tustin fielded three teams. In the past, Tustin had allowed any Junior Pee Wee player to pick any of the three coaches in the division. That's similar to how many Pop Warner leagues operate, splitting up the best players who sign up so all the teams in the division have a similar shot at winning. But not in 2011 in Tustin. Instead of players picking coaches the coaches picked the players, and they shifted talent to the Red Cobras squad. \\"They changed the rules so people couldn't end up on the team randomly,\\" Bunkers said. Tustin capped its Red Cobras roster at 22 players, which is also a strategic advantage. In Pop Warner, every player must play a minimum of eight offensive or defensive plays in the every game. By capping its roster, Tustin limited its number of \\"must play\\" players and maximized the playing time for more talented starters. In Yorba Linda and Santa Margarita, for example, the Junior Pee Wee rosters had 28 or 29 players, so more \\"must play\\" players had to be on the field for more significant time. (Many Pop Warner teams use \\"must play\\" players as wide receivers and position them where they aren't likely to be involved in the action. But because Tustin won by such lopsided scores, the \\"must play\\" Red Cobras players got a lot of playing time, and were not always stuck at wide receiver.) One of the best players on the 2011 Tustin team does not live in Tustin. He played in Anaheim Pop Warner in 2009, but his parents asked for and received a waiver from Anaheim Pop Warner, allowing him to jump leagues. That player, who became a star on the 2011 Tustin team, was 10 years old when the season began, so he was allowed, per Pop Warner's weight-limit rules, to weigh 105 pounds at the start of the season. A 10-year-old, 100-pound-plus player with speed is like gold in Junior Pee Wee football. Pop Warner rules also allow \\"older/lighter\\" players to play, and these players also can be valuable on the field. At the Junior Pee Wee level, older/lighter players are smaller (85 pounds or lighter) sixth graders who can play with bigger fifth graders (who weigh up to 105 pounds). It is the goal of every ultracompetitive Pop Warner team to fill its roster with older/lighter players. In Santa Margarita, for example, 15 of the 29 players were older/lighter. In Tustin, 11 of 22 were older/lighter. In some cases, this rule allows seventh graders to play with fourth graders, and the Red Cobras had one of each. The problem in Tustin was that one of the older/lighter players wasn't always as light as he needed to be. In Zanelli's chronology filed with the OEC he referred to that 11-year-old as \\"Player X.\\" Player X's father did not return a phone call to discuss this story. The chronology said Player X weighed more than 85 pounds on Aug. 1, 2011, the first day of football practice. He still weighed more than 85 pounds on Aug. 12, the day each player is officially certified by the league. At this point, Player X could have been immediately moved up to a bigger division, Pee Wee, where he would play with heavier kids. But Player X was a key piece of the Red Cobra's formula to get to Florida, and the team sought – and received – a waiver from OEC that gave Player X until Aug. 27 to lose the required weight, according to Zanelli's chronology. Many Pop Warner families are familiar with extreme weight-loss efforts by the children near the cutoff limit. Many boys in Pop Warner diet and, in some cases, take diuretics to lose weight. Brad Davidson, owner of Stark Training in Irvine and the trainer of professional athletes like Sam Baker who was raised in Tustin and is now playing for the Atlanta Falcons and former Laker Matt Barnes, said extreme dieting for children is \\"crazy.\\" \\"At that age, the stress that dieting puts on the body is unbelievable,\\" Davidson said. \\"You're stripping the body of electrolytes. The body becomes massively dehydrated. Strength and coordination will be affected. When you lose too many electrolytes, you can die. \\"What's more important, a Pee Wee football game or your kid's health? They are putting these kids' lives in danger.\\" In the case of Player X, Zanelli's chronology says the 11-year-old wore a plastic suit to try to sweat off the weight. He sat in saunas. His teammates said he sucked on Skittles candy to create saliva so he could spit more often. On Aug. 27, the day of Red Cobras' first regular season game, Player X said he was injured, did not get weighed and did not play. Pop Warner rules allow players to remain eligible even as they gain one pound a week, up to nine pounds total, over the course of the season. So by the third game of the season, the weight requirement for Player X was 87 pounds. At each weigh-in, the player is allowed eight extra pounds for his pads. So the scale had to read 95 pounds (the boy's weight plus pads) or less for Player X to be eligible. On Sept. 10, Player X showed up for the pre-game weigh-in as the Red Cobras prepared to play Santa Ana. Crawford and Bowman had arranged for him to wear shoulder pads with holes drilled in them and thigh pads that had been cut in half to make them lighter. Player X made the weight. After the weigh in, Player X went into a bathroom so he could change into his heavier, safer pads. Player X played in that day's game and the Red Cobras won 27-6. It is unclear if Player X was ever certified by the OEC to play in games. It is clear he did not start the season at the proper weight, Zanelli said. ••• On Sept. 17, the morning of the Red Cobras' game against Lakewood, Player X complained of chest pains and was taken to a hospital, Zanelli's complaint said. Player X missed the game against Lakewood. \\"I told his dad to play in the right weight division,\\" Bunkers said. \\"This isn't worth it.\\" Another parent said: \\"I felt sorry for that kid. I talked to his mother and said, 'I can't believe you're allowing him to do this.' \\" If Player X wasn't able to slip away to the bathroom without being noticed, he would play games in the illegally altered pads, Zanelli said. By the time the playoffs rolled round, the weight limit had risen to 94 pounds (102 in pads). Player X was still at the edge of the weight limit. Before the playoff game against Yorba Linda, Player X weighed in successfully with his illegally altered pads. After the weigh-in his teammates formed a human ring around Player X so officials couldn't see him change into his safer pads, said one parent. In the second playoff game against Santa Margarita, it was Player X who delivered the big hit of the game that gave the opposing running back a mild concussion. It was Player X, Zanelli said, who got paid after the game. By the time the team got to Florida, the weight rules changed. The players didn't wear pads during weigh-ins. Player X spent time in the sauna before the first game. At the first weigh-in, he was too heavy. He left the facility and again sat in a sauna, Zanelli said. When he returned, a second scale was found, and he was allowed to be weighed a second time. This time, Player X made the weight, Zanelli said. The Red Cobras eventually lost in the semifinals of the Super Bowl tournament to a team from Washington, D.C. But they finished the season with a 12-1 record. Bunkers said the Red Cobras coaches had gone too far to achieve their goal. \\"The goal should be for the kids to have fun,\\" Bunkers said. \\"But egos get in the way. Some guys are reliving their childhoods through their kids.\\" Register columnist Frank Mickadeit contributed to this report. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"A youth football team in Tustin, California, is being investigated for allegedly rewarding their players (aged 10 and 11) with cash for big hits and causing injuries to opponents during games.

Bad taste: Crass game Cards Against Humanity. Billed as ‘a party game for horrible people’, it is the latest craze being played at dinner parties across the land. Cards Against Humanity is a game in which players are encouraged to be as ‘despicable’ and offensive as they possibly can. Critics have slammed the US creators who admit their aim was to tarnish Britain’s most sacred institutions. The card game mocks the Royal Family, politicians and the Hillsborough disaster in which 96 Liverpool football fans died. It also insults dead reality TV star Jade Goody and missing youngster Madeleine McCann. The McCanns’ spokesman, Clarence Mitchell, said: ‘The offensiveness of this speaks for itself. For the makers of the game to make light of a missing child is beyond offensive. They should reconsider what they’re doing and all Madeleine references should be cut out of future editions. It is deeply offensive.’ In the game, one player asks a question from a black card and everyone else answers with their ‘funniest’ white card. It is the nature of the questions and answers on the cards, that make the game so controversial. Each black card is either a question, or a phrase where the key words have been left as blank. At first they might seem innocuous, such as: ‘What’s that smell?’ However, another card reads: ‘In Michael Jackson’s final moments he thought about...’ The players then respond from the selection of answers from white cards they have in their hand. These include ‘Madeleine McCann’, ‘Jade Goody’s cancerous remains’ and ‘Hillsborough’. One card reads ‘Queen Elizabeth’s immaculate a***’ and another says: ‘Leaked footage of Kate Middleton’s colonoscopy.’ Other cards include ‘Auschwitz’, ‘Kids with bum cancer’ and ‘Chunks of dead prostitute’. The person who creates the ‘funniest’ or most offensive answer wins a point. Missing Madeleine McCann is mocked in the dinner party card game. Ingrid Seward, editor of Majesty magazine, said: ‘It’s in extreme bad taste. It’s not satire, it’s very unfunny whether you’re a monarchist or not.’ Steve Rotheram, MP for Liverpool Walton and Hillsborough campaigner, said: ‘It is hard to understand the mentality of those who have produced such a disgusting and offensive game. I hope people refrain from becoming involved in such a despicable activity.’ However, the creators remain unapologetic. Eli Halpern, 27, project leader of the British version, said: ‘One card is “Queen Elizabeth’s immaculate a***”. That was our mission statement, to take the most sacred thing in the UK and tarnish it. Reality television show star Jade Goody, who died from cancer, is also a target in the 'offensive' game. ‘The British have a different humour from Americans. We sent a survey out on the internet with a list of the US cards and asked people to cross out the ones they didn’t understand. Then I had meetings in pubs to discuss the cards we should include in the British version. ‘Hillsborough seemed fair game because it was historic. When we were testing that card we never hit a raw nerve or got any complaints.’ Cards Against Humanity was invented by eight childhood friends from Chicago in 2009. Fellow inventor Ben Hantoot said: ‘We had no idea how it would take off. This was a game we made up on New Year’s Eve to entertain ourselves.’ The UK version also includes references to David Cameron and Ed Balls, J. K. Rowling, Boris Johnson and England’s dislike of ‘the bloody Welsh’. Mr Hantoot said: ‘We’ve not had to withdraw any cards. “Jade Goody’s cancerous remains” is a cringer which came up during one of our play tests and remains one of the most popular cards. ‘Madeleine McCann was the riskiest one because we don’t have anything like that in the US version. That was the untested one but people love it. Our goal is to be as funny as possible and sometimes things that are really offensive are also really funny.’ The eight inventors of the game are all now reportedly millionaires. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Cards Against Humanity, a party game described as being for \\"horrible people,\\" has faced criticism for its offensive content.

Dr. Bandy X.

Trump is going to get worse and will become uncontainable with the pressures of the presidency,” Lee told Politico. ADVERTISEMENT Lee edited “The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump,” a collection released last October of testimonials from more than two dozen psychiatric experts assessing Trump’s mental state. The White House has in recent weeks brushed aside questions about Trump’s physical and mental fitness. On Wednesday, a reporter asked press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders if Americans should be “concerned about the president’s mental fitness” after Trump tweeted that he has a “much bigger & more powerful” nuclear launch “button” than North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Sanders said there should be concern over Kim’s mental fitness. Some used Trump's tweet to renew discussion over the 25th Amendment, which allows for the vice president and the majority of the Cabinet to declare the president \\"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\\" and remove him. It has never been invoked. In December, Trump appeared to slur his words during a speech announcing the U.S. would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The White House blamed the issue on a dry throat. Trump is scheduled for his first physical exam as president on Jan. 12. His military physician will make the results public. ||||| Lawmakers concerned about President Donald Trump’s mental state summoned Yale University psychiatry professor Dr. Bandy X. Lee to Capitol Hill last month for two days of briefings about his recent behavior. In private meetings with more than a dozen members of Congress held on Dec. 5 and 6, Lee briefed lawmakers — all Democrats except for one Republican senator, whom Lee declined to identify. Her professional warning to Capitol Hill: “He’s going to unravel, and we are seeing the signs.” Story Continued Below In an interview, she pointed to Trump “going back to conspiracy theories, denying things he has admitted before, his being drawn to violent videos.” Lee also warned, “We feel that the rush of tweeting is an indication of his falling apart under stress. Trump is going to get worse and will become uncontainable with the pressures of the presidency.” Lee, editor of “The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump,” which includes testimonials from 27 psychiatrists and mental health experts assessing the president’s level of “dangerousness,” said that she was surprised by the interest in her findings during her two days in Washington. “One senator said that it was the meeting he most looked forward to in 11 years,” Lee recalled. “Their level of concern about the president’s dangerousness was surprisingly high.” The conversation about Trump’s fitness to serve is ongoing — and gaining steam after Trump’s tweet this week taunting the leader of North Korea with my-nuclear-button-is-bigger-than-yours bravado.

The tweet resuscitated the conversation about the president’s mental state and the 25th Amendment, which allows for the removal of the president from office if the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet deem him physically or mentally “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.” The amendment is purposefully set up to require a high burden of proof, and there is no evidence that Vice President Mike Pence or the majority of Trump’s Cabinet have turned on him. But Trump’s Tuesday night nuclear taunt managed to cause alarm even within his own party. If there was mounting concern before the New Year about Trump’s mental state among Democrats on the Hill, the tide had been moving in the opposite direction among Republicans. In the final weeks of 2017, with a tax bill sailing toward passage and enough federal court judicial nominees pushed through to successfully reshape the judiciary, Republicans, in general, were moving toward a state of at least semi-acceptance of their unorthodox president. “The tendency was anti-alarmism among Republicans,” said Bill Kristol, editor at large of The Weekly Standard and one of Washington’s leading conservative voices. That made Trump’s sudden fit of saber-rattling “more jolting,” according to Kristol — and it reopened the national conversation about the president’s mental stability. “I was focused on Iran, and talking to people in the administration about serious policy,” Kristol added, “and then to see in the middle of what might be a serious policymaking process, Trump’s just flipping out.” On Wednesday, Kristol tweeted: “I trust @VP has asked his Counsel to prepare a draft document transferring power in accord with Sec. 4 of 25th Amendment in case it’s suddenly needed, & that he’s discussed this with COS Kelly.” A spokeswoman for Pence did not respond to a request for comment. Richard Painter, who served as chief White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush, tweeted on Tuesday of the president’s comments about North Korea, “This Tweet alone is grounds for removal from office under the 25th Amendment. This man should not have nukes.” White House officials shrug off any conversation about the president’s mental state eventually driving him out of office as nothing more than a liberal fantasy and a longtime hobby horse of the die-hard “Never Trumpers.” Asked about the president’s mental state on Wednesday, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders insisted there is nothing to worry about. “The president and the people of this country should be concerned about the mental fitness of the leader of North Korea,” she said during the daily press briefing. “This is a president who is not going to cower down.” Facing renewed questions about his own mental capacity, Trump on Wednesday also turned the tables on his former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, painting him as the one who is unhinged. “When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind,” the president said in a statement, reacting to an explosive new book on his campaign and early presidency by Michael Wolff, \\"Fire and Fury: Inside the White House.\\" Some legal experts warned the conversation about Trump’s fitness could be dangerous to democracy. “The 25th Amendment would require, for mental incapacity, a major psychotic break,” said former Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz. “This is hope over reality. If we don’t like someone’s politics we rail against him, we campaign against him, we don’t use the psychiatric system against him. That’s just dangerous.” Nonetheless, the president’s Twitter feed continues to reignite questions about his fitness for office. On Wednesday, Lee and two other medical professionals released a statement following Trump’s late night Tweet baiting Kim Jung Un into a potential nuclear war. “We write as mental health professionals who have been deeply concerned about Donald Trump’s psychological aberrations,” the statement read. “We believe that he is now further unraveling in ways that contribute to his belligerent nuclear threats. ... We urge that those around him, and our elected representatives in general, take urgent steps to restrain his behavior and head off the potential nuclear catastrophe that endangers not only Korea and the United States but all of humankind.” The statement, released on behalf of the National Coalition of Concerned Mental Health Experts, was signed by more than 100 medical professionals. Sanders declined to comment on the statement. But Lee’s campaign on Capitol Hill is far from over. Later this month, she has been invited to speak in front of another group of lawmakers, hosted by Connecticut Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro at her home. And she has been invited to speak at a town hall by Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, who has proposed a bill to set up a commission to evaluate the president’s fitness for office. Raskin’s bill would create a body in Congress to evaluate the president’s fitness. “The judgment [about the president’s mental state] is not mine to make,” the freshman congressman said in an interview. “The judgment constitutionally is to be made by the vice president and the Cabinet, or the vice president and a new body. We have an institutional responsibility to set that body up.” Over the past few months, Raskin said he has seen “a rising chorus of questions about this.” A bill that was at first viewed as a lark, with few co-sponsors, now has 56 co-sponsors. “Lawmakers, the media and lots of people in the public have been calling me about my bill,” he said. “The tweet yesterday set off alarm bells across the country. I’m trying to reassure people that our Constitution has a provision to deal with this.” Some Trump allies have begun to worry about the conversation gaining steam. After The New York Times reported last November that Trump was denying the veracity of the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape — which he had previously acknowledged and apologized for — one former campaign aide called the story a “shot across the bow to invoke the 25th Amendment.” Trump allies outside the administration also expressed concern that the president was left unstaffed during his Mar-a-Lago vacation last week — when he sat for an interview with The New York Times that was not planned for or cleared with his top aides. “Why was he there with no senior staff?” said one former aide. “It’s like he has nothing to do with running the government.” ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"In December, more than a dozen lawmakers met with Dr. Bandy X.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"What drove the revolution?\\" Context: \\"Alexis de Tocqueville described the French Revolution as the inevitable result of the radical opposition created in the 18th century between the monarchy and the men of letters of the Enlightenment. These men of letters constituted a sort of \\"substitute aristocracy that was both all-powerful and without real power\\". This illusory power came from the rise of \\"public opinion\\", born when absolutist centralization removed the nobility and the bourgeoisie from the political sphere. The \\"literary politics\\" that resulted promoted a discourse of equality and was hence in fundamental opposition to the monarchical regime. De Tocqueville \\"clearly designates ... the cultural effects of transformation in the forms of the exercise of power\\". Nevertheless, it took another century before cultural approach became central to the historiography, as typified by Robert Darnton, The Business of Enlightenment: A Publishing History of the Encyclopédie, 1775–1800 (1979).\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The revolution, as described by Alexis de Tocqueville in the context of the French Revolution, was driven by a confluence of factors that ultimately stemmed from the growing tension and opposition between the monarchy and the men of letters of the Enlightenment. This tension can be analyzed through various dimensions, such as the rise of public opinion, the influence of the literary politics in promoting a discourse of equality, and the cultural transformations that occurred during this period. First and foremost, the radical opposition between the monarchy and the men of letters of the Enlightenment was the result of the absolutist centralization of power, which effectively removed the nobility and bourgeoisie from the political sphere. Consequently, these men of letters, who constituted a \\"substitute aristocracy,\\" found themselves in a paradoxical situation where they were both all-powerful and without real power. This perceived power stemmed primarily from the rise of public opinion, as their ideas and writings began to shape the mindset of the people and cast doubt on the legitimacy of the monarchical regime. The influence of literary politics played a crucial role in driving the revolution as well. As intellectuals and philosophers disseminated their ideas on equality and human rights, they fostered a discourse that was fundamentally opposed to the monarchical system. Writers such as Voltaire, Rousseau, and Montesquieu questioned the foundations of the ancien régime and inspired new ideas about governance, social justice, and the role of the individual in society. This contestation of traditional values and norms created an environment of dissent and a desire for change, eventually culminating in a revolutionary movement. In addition, the cultural effects of the transformation in the exercise of power significantly contributed to the unfolding of the revolution. The emergence of the public sphere, where people could openly discuss and debate ideas, provided a fertile ground for the spread of Enlightenment principles and ideologies. Literary and cultural productions, such as the Encyclopédie edited by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert, played a significant role in disseminating knowledge and challenging the accepted norms of the time. As historian Robert Darnton argued in his work \\"The Business of Enlightenment: A Publishing History of the Encyclopédie, 1775-1800\\" (1979), the cultural approach to the historiography of the French Revolution became increasingly central in understanding the underlying causes and motivations of this transformative period. To conclude, the revolution, in the context of the French Revolution, was driven by the interplay between the radical opposition of the monarchy and the men of letters of the Enlightenment, the rise of public opinion, the influence of literary politics, and the cultural effects of the transformation in the forms of power. These factors converged to create a climate of discontent and an appetite for change, which ultimately led to the dismantling of the ancien régime and the birth of a new political and social order in France."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Leonard Guy Ford Jr. (February 18, 1926 - March 14, 1972) was an American football player from 1944 to 1958. He played college football for the University of Michigan and professional football for the Los Angeles Dons, Cleveland Browns and Green Bay Packers. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1976 and the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1996. Ford was an all-city athlete at his high school in Washington, D.C., and attended Morgan State University after graduating in 1944. By 1947, Ford had grown to 215 pounds, 25 pounds heavier than he had weighed in 1945. Led by All-American halfbacks Bob Chappuis and Bump Elliott, the undefeated 1947 Michigan team has been selected as the best team in the history of Michigan football. Nicknamed the \\"Mad Magicians\\", the Michigan squad finished with a 10-0 record, capped by a 49-0 victory in the Rose Bowl over USC on New Year's Day. Ford started only one game in 1947, as Bob Mann was the starting left end in eight of Michigan's 10 games. Even with reduced playing time, Ford caught a 35-yard touchdown pass in the first game of the season and had two receptions for 82 yards in the 55-0 win over Michigan State. He scored again in a game against Pitt. Ford's defensive performance was credited with shutting down Ohio State in the final game of the 1947 season. After the Wolverines' 21-0 victory over the Buckeyes, The Michigan Daily wrote: \\"For the defense it was big Len Ford, who sparked a forward wall that never let the Bucks threaten. His end was practically impregnable. He smashed Ohio interference time and again, he continually harassed Dick Slager and Pandel Savic, the Ohio passers, and he made life miserable for Pete Perini, blocking one punt and rushing the Buckeye punter on nearly all of his kicks.\\" Michigan finished first in the AP Poll and won the 1947 college football national championship, sharing the honor with Notre Dame, which had been first in the polls before the Rose Bowl. After the 1947 season, the Associated Press (AP) selected Ford as a third-team All-American end and named teammate Bob Mann as a second-team All-American end. The AP also named Ford a second-team all-Big Nine Conference end. In the summer of 1948, he accepted an invitation to play for the college team in the College All-Star Game, a now-defunct annual matchup between the champion of the professional National Football League (NFL) and a selection of the country's best college players.

In today's rapidly changing economic landscape, job loss is becoming an increasingly common occurrence for many people. There are numerous reasons for job loss, such as downsizing, economic downturns, technological advancements and automation, and even poor job performance. Regardless of the cause, it is essential for individuals who have lost their jobs to receive support and assistance in finding a new one. Below we outline various ways to assist those who have experienced job loss. 1. Emotional Support: Losing a job can be a distressing and disorienting experience. Providing emotional support, such as a listening ear and empathic understanding, can help to alleviate some of the stress and anxiety that comes with job loss. Encourage them to talk about their feelings and remind them that their worth is not solely tied to their occupation. 2. Networking: Networking can be a powerful tool in finding new job opportunities. Encourage job seekers to reach out to their existing network of contacts—friends, family members, colleagues, and former employers—for potential job leads, informational interviews, and referrals. Additionally, they may consider joining professional organizations and attending industry events to expand their network and discover new opportunities. 3. Resume and Cover Letter Assistance: Ensuring that a person's resume and cover letter are up to date and appealing to potential employers is critical. Offer to review their resume, providing feedback and suggestions for improvement. Help them tailor their resume and cover letter to align with the specific requirements of each job they apply for to increase their chances of success. 4. Job Search Strategies: Guide job seekers in identifying the most effective job search strategies for their particular situation. This may include participating in job fairs, searching online job boards and company websites, utilizing social media platforms like LinkedIn, and contacting recruitment agencies or headhunters. 5. Skills Assessment and Training: Encourage individuals to assess their current skills, identify gaps, and determine which skills are in high demand in their desired industry. They may need to update their skills through training courses, workshops, or certification programs to make themselves more marketable to potential employers. 6. Interview Preparation: It is crucial for job seekers to hone their interview skills in order to increase their chances of being hired. Provide them with resources to practice common interview questions and help them develop clear, concise, and impressive responses. Also, discuss appropriate attire, body language, and follow-up communication protocol. 7. Financial Support and Unemployment Benefits: Depending on the circumstances, some individuals may be eligible for unemployment benefits or other financial assistance programs. Help them navigate the process of applying for such support and offer resources on budgeting and managing finances while they search for a new job. 8. Mental Health and Self-care: Remind individuals to prioritize self-care and maintain a balanced lifestyle during the job search process. Encourage them to stay physically active, maintain social connections, practice stress-management techniques, and seek professional help if needed. In conclusion, losing a job can be a challenging experience, but with the right support and resources, individuals can successfully transition to new opportunities.

Zac is a lonely, highly strung city trader on the edge of a psychological breakdown. He has lost everything—his job, his girlfriend Eva (Sophia Di Martino from \\"Flowers\\") and, most devastatingly, his weird and wayward younger sister Alice, the only family he had left. Alice is now a missing person, having disappeared on a narrow boat trip along with her kindred drifter and boyfriend Toby.

In 2014, the Paris Motor Show welcomed 1,253,513 visitors, making it the most visited auto show in the world, ahead of Tokyo and Frankfurt. - Lexus originated from a corporate project to develop a new premium sedan, code-named F1, which began in 1983 and culminated in the launch of the Lexus LS in 1989. Subsequently, the division added sedan, coupé, convertible, and SUV models. Until 2005 Lexus did not exist as a brand in its home market and all vehicles marketed internationally as Lexus from 1989-2005 were released in Japan under the Toyota marque and an equivalent model name. In 2005, a hybrid version of the RX crossover debuted, and additional hybrid models later joined the division's lineup. In 2007, Lexus launched its own F marque performance division with the debut of the IS F sport sedan, followed by the LFA supercar in 2009. - A concept car (also known as concept vehicle, show vehicle or prototype) is a car made to showcase new styling and/or new technology. They are often shown at motor shows to gauge customer reaction to new and radical designs which may or may not be mass-produced. General Motors designer Harley Earl is generally credited with inventing the concept car, and did much to popularize it through its traveling Motorama shows of the 1950s. - An electric vehicle (EV), also referred to as an electric drive vehicle, uses one or more electric motors or traction motors for propulsion. An electric vehicle may be powered through a collector system by electricity from off-vehicle sources, or may be self-contained with a battery or generator to convert fuel to electricity. EVs include road and rail vehicles, surface and underwater vessels, electric aircraft and electric spacecraft. - A nameplate identifies and displays a person or product's name. Nameplates are usually shaped as rectangles but are also seen in other shapes, sometimes taking on the shape of someones name. The primary use of nameplates is for informative (as in an office environment, where nameplates are mounted on doors or walls in order to identify employees) and commercial purposes (as in a retail environment, where nameplates are mounted on products to identify the brand). Whereas name tags tend to be worn on uniforms or clothing, nameplates tend to be mounted onto an object (e.g. cars, amplification devices) or physical space (e.g. doors, walls, or desktops). Nameplates are also distinct from name plaques. Plaques are items of larger dimensions that are designed to communicate more information than a name and title.

Boehner, R-Ohio, said last week that cutting funding for the mission was an option that the Republican-controlled House will consider when it takes up a defense appropriations bill this week.

All I can say about yesterday’s developments is that they seem potentially disastrous and also indicative to me of something truly weird going on underneath all of this. Benedict XVI has claimed that his almost unprecedented resignation came about simply because of his physical infirmity in the face of what appears to be a growing vortex of sexual and financial scandal inside the Vatican. He said he would quietly disappear to serve the church through prayer and meditation. But we now realize he’s going nowhere. He’s staying in the Vatican’s walls, and retaining the honorific “His Holiness.” He will keep white robes. His full title will be Pope Emeritus. Far from wearing clerical black, returning to the title of Bishop of Rome, and disappearing into a monastery in Bavaria, he’s going to be a shadow Pope in the Vatican. And this, we are told, was his decision: The Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said Benedict himself had made the decision in consultation with others, settling on “Your Holiness Benedict XVI” and either emeritus pope or emeritus Roman pontiff. Lombardi said he didn’t know why Benedict had decided to drop his other main title: bishop of Rome. If you were trying to avoid any hint of meddling, of a Deng Xiao Peng-type figure pulling strings behind the scenes, you would not be doing this. The only thing the Pope will give up, apparently, are his red Prada shoes. He has some fabulous brown leather artisanal ones to replace them. But this is what really made me sit up straight, so to speak: Benedict’s trusted secretary, Monsignor Georg Gänswein, will be serving both pontiffs — living with Benedict at the monastery inside the Vatican and keeping his day job as prefect of the new pope’s household. Asked about the potential conflicts, Lombardi was defensive, saying the decisions had been clearly reasoned and were likely chosen for the sake of simplicity. “I believe it was well thought out,” he said. So Benedict’s handsome male companion will continue to live with him, while working for the other Pope during the day. Are we supposed to think that’s, well, a normal arrangement? I wrote a while back about Gänswein’s intense relationship with Ratzinger, while noting Colm Toibin’s review of Angelo Quattrochi’s exploration of Benedict, “Is The Pope Gay?”. Here’s Toibin getting to some interesting stuff: Gänswein is remarkably handsome, a cross between George Clooney and Hugh Grant, but, in a way, more beautiful than either. In a radio interview Gänswein described a day in his life and the life of Ratzinger, now that he is pope: The pope’s day begins with the seven o’clock Mass, then he says prayers with his breviary, followed by a period of silent contemplation before our Lord. Then we have breakfast together, and so I begin the day’s work by going through the correspondence. Then I exchange ideas with the Holy Father, then I accompany him to the ‘Second Loggia’ for the private midday audiences. Then we have lunch together; after the meal we go for a little walk before taking a nap. In the afternoon I again take care of the correspondence. I take the most important stuff which needs his signature to the Holy Father. When asked if he felt nervous in the presence of the Holy Father, Gänswein replied that he sometimes did and added: ‘But it is also true that the fact of meeting each other and being together on a daily basis creates a sense of “familiarity”, which makes you feel less nervous. But obviously I know who the Holy Father is and so I know how to behave appropriately. There are always some situations, however, when the heart beats a little stronger than usual.’ This man – clearly in some kind of love with Ratzinger (and vice-versa) will now be working for the new Pope as secretary in the day and spending the nights with the Pope Emeritus. This is not the Vatican. It’s Melrose Place.

Options: - city - state - front of casino - rome - public place","completion":"A big fountain was the center piece of the renovation, it had all been paid for by a grant to the city. Among the given options, \\"city\\" is the most suitable answer to the question. A grant in this context is typically issued by a government or organization to fund projects that are public in nature, aiming to bring about benefits to the community. A fountain taking center stage in a renovation effort generally suggests a visually captivating and pedestrian-friendly public space designed for the enjoyment of the city's residents and visitors. The fountain, as the centerpiece of the renovation, suggests that the focus of the project was on revitalizing or enhancing an urban area, such as a city park, town square, or commercial district. This type of project is typically funded by a city or local government in order to revitalize certain parts of their locality, draw more people to the area, promote positive community engagement, and generally improve the overall quality of life for the citizens. In contrast, \\"state\\" could be a plausible but less-suited option because the funding scope of a state-level public project is usually much broader. While the state government could still potentially provide a grant for this fountain, it would typically do so in a larger urban planning context or under a more comprehensive program, rather than focusing solely on a single renovation project. \\"Front of casino\\" is not a suitable answer because it implies that the fountain is privately funded as part of a commercial establishment. This would contradict the premise that the project was funded through a grant, which generally implies a public or community-oriented undertaking. \\"Rome\\" is not an appropriate answer because it does not provide any indication of a grant source or the type of public project the grant was funding.

He needs to determine the properties of these samples. In which sample less rocks would have chemical reactions, sample A or sample B? Hint: Rainfall in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Sample B, from the Atacama Desert, would have fewer chemical reactions occurring in the soil compared to sample A from the Amazon Rainforest. This is because the Atacama Desert receives one of the lowest rainfall levels in the world, which reduces the amount of rainwater passing through the soil to react chemically with the particles. In contrast, the Amazon Rainforest receives one of the highest rainfall levels globally, meaning that more rainwater passes through the soil and reacts chemically with the particles. High rainfall also increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions, exposing new surfaces, which in turn increases the rate of weathering.

Its most striking feature is the great Norman screen, running up without buttresses or projections to the parapet and hiding the bases of the square, richly decorated towers of the west front. The plain centre of the screen is the work of Remigius, the first bishop. The rest of it is relieved with rich arcading of Late Norman and Early English periods. The wooden spires which crowned the towers were removed in 1807. In 1192 Hugh of Avalon determined to rebuild the Norman building of Remigius, which an earthquake had shaken. To him we owe the choir and eastern transept. His successors completed the western transept and began the west end of the nave. So much money had to be spent in rebuilding the central tower, which fell in 1239, that the canons could not rebuild the nave entirely, but had to incorporate the Norman end by Remigius. Unfortunately the axis of the west front does not correspond to that of the nave, which is too wide for its height. The low vaulting is a serious defect in the choir built by St. Hugh, but of the superb beauty of the Angel Choir, which encloses his shrine, there can be no doubt.

Summarize the following: The tongue's unique texture and large surface area makes it host to millions of bacteria, which can travel to the teeth and gums and cause cavities and gingivitis. The teeth gather plenty of bacteria themselves, but unlike the teeth, the tongue is not a smooth surface. It follows that even more bacteria accumulate in the taste-buds and small pits on the tongue. Just rinsing the mouth with water is insufficient to remove the bacteria on the tongue, primarily because the bacteria gather in what is called a \\"biofilm\\"-- a sticky, gooey, living layer of bacteria. It must be disrupted by rubbing or scraping to fully remove it. The bacteria that live on the tongue cause a chemical reaction that produces volatile sulfur compounds, which results in bad breath. Tongue brushing can also remove traces of odorous foods like garlic and onions, which can also improve your breath. Many people with bad breath are not aware that they have it. Its a good idea to practice good oral hygiene, including regularly cleaning the tongue, in order to reduce the chance that you are one of them. Certain foods and health conditions can cause a colored or filmy appearance on the surface of the tongue. Brushing the tongue can eliminate this problem. Foods containing dyes like cupcakes, lollipops, or popsicles can temporarily dye the surface of the tongue. Brushing the tongue can reduce the coloration of the tongue, making it less noticeable to others. Some illnesses like oral thrush or syphilis can cause a buildup of bacteria or fungi on the tongue that cause a filmy, white appearance. In some cases, the white film cannot be brushed off. Be sure that you see your doctor if you suspect that your filmy tongue is caused by an illness. Certain medications like antibiotics or Pepto-Bismol as well as certain illnesses can also cause a startling discoloration of the tongue called \\"black hairy tongue,\\" which is caused by an overgrowth of yeast in the mouth. The condition is not serious and the discoloration can be brushed off with a toothbrush or washcloth, although it might be a good idea to see your doctor to determine the cause.

Now, they no longer are waterproof which defeats the entire purpose of using them. Urine flows straight through the pad onto the sheet. I washed them per manufacturers instructions.

Article: A New Jersey landlord has filed a complaint against the family of Jahi McMath alleging they have not paid rent at an apartment there for two months as they watch over the brain-dead Oakland teen after her release from a nearby hospital, according to court records obtained Tuesday. The family's attorney, however, said the rent has been paid and he expects the matter to be resolved by Wednesday. Parkside Realty, which operates Countryside Apartments, alleges Jahi's parents, Marvin and Nailah Winkfield, did not pay rent in December and January, and owe the landlord 3,375 in unpaid rent, late charges, and attorney fees, New Jersey court records show. Jahi McMath (Omari Sealey) \\"The purpose of the attached complaint is to permanently remove you and your belongings from the premises,\\" the complaint reads, adding that the family can present its case at a Feb. 27 court hearing. The complaint was filed on Jan. 26 in the Superior Court of New Jersey in Somerset County, where the family is listed as living. The case is active, according to the court's website, but family attorney Christopher Dolan said it is being withdrawn. Dolan called it an \\"administrative error\\" but would not elaborate. \\"Somebody didn't pay the rent. The rent's been paid,\\" Dolan said by phone Tuesday evening. Parkside Realty's attorney did not return a message left Tuesday. Advertisement According to court records, Jahi's family moved into the Somerset apartment on Aug. 15, 2014. In October, the family said they moved Jahi from a New Jersey hospital into a nearby apartment, but did not say exactly where. Her mother, Nailah Winkfield, and her stepfather, Marvin Winkfield, and Jahi's younger sister, along with nurses, have lived in the home, where Jahi is hooked up to various machines to feed her and keep her organs functioning. The rest of the McMath family remains in the family's home in Oakland. Jahi was 13 in December 2013 when she was declared brain-dead after complications following a nose and throat surgery at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland. The family won a court battle to move Jahi out of the hospital in January 2014, taking her to a facility in New Jersey. Unlike California, New Jersey has a law allowing parents and guardians to reject a doctor's diagnosis of brain death on religious grounds. Last year, Dolan asked an Alameda County Superior Court judge to hear evidence from doctors who believe Jahi has some brain function and should not be considered brain-dead. Dolan later withdrew his request. At the time, he said he would instead challenge the state to amend or revoke Jahi's death certificate, in the hopes she could return to Oakland. Donations to Jahi's family have poured in since her story made national headlines. As of Tuesday, a gofundme.com page created by Nailah Winkfield had raised 62,863, with donations as recent as four days ago. Since moving Jahi to New Jersey, the family has struggled financially and lived through the winter storms and blizzard that swept through the East Coast, Dolan said. \\"They are basically broke. They are struggling to get by on a regular basis,\\" Dolan said. \\"They are trying to care for their daughter and keep their sanity.\\" David DeBolt covers breaking news.

Here are the differences: 1. In Sentence 1, Phil is \\"racing\\" in the British League, whereas in Sentence 2, Phil is \\"walking\\" in the British League. The activities (racing and walking) are different. 2. In Sentence 1, it mentions Phil started racing in 1971 \\"with\\" the Crewe Kings, suggesting that they are a team or group he was a part of. In Sentence 2, it says Phil \\"made\\" the British League with the Crewe-kings in 1971, which could imply creating or founding the league alongside the Crewe-kings. So, although both sentences share the fact that the Crump family had a home in Bristol and 1971 is mentioned as an important year, the meanings of the sentences are not the same due to the differences in Phil's involvement and actions related to the British League and the Crewe Kings."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question given this paragraph: Radioactivity involves the release of particles and/or energy from the nucleus of an atom.

Hospira, the only U.S. manufacturer of sodium thiopental, stopped making the drug in 2011. The European Union has outlawed the export of any product that could be used in an execution; this has prevented executioners from using EU-manufactured anesthetics like propofol which are needed for general medical purposes.

A good place to stay can often make a holiday. Whether you are looking for a classy hotel or a night under the stars, we can guide you through your different options. Bed and Breakfast An English invention, bed and breakfasts offer exactly what they suggest, a bed for the night and breakfast in the morning. People who hate the anonymity of hotels but want more luxury than a hostel often choose to stay at bed and breakfasts. \\"B&B's\\", usually someone's private home, are often found in the countryside. Hostels For those traveling on a tight budget, hostels are the best accommodation option. Informal places usually with a friendly youthful vibe , they offer dormitory beds for rent. Bathrooms are usually down the hall. Remember to check reviews by previous guests online before you book your hostel. Couch Surfing An unusual but interesting option, couch surfing is a growing trend among young internationals. The idea is that you become a member of the online couch-surfing community (www. couchsurfing. com) and then when you travel, look up other members in that country and ask to stay on their couch . Most hosts will suggest sightseeing trips and take you out in the evening, making it a great way to see things that aren't in your guidebook. And remember, it may be free but don't forget to offer to buy your host a drink or dinner. Camping Sleeping under the stars! For budget travelers staying at camping grounds is the cheapest way to travel. The drawback is that you have to carry a tent with you. Camping grounds can be found across Europe, America and Australia. However, if you intend on camping in busy cities, check first where the nearest campsite is.

Cons: - It compromises the card owner's security since the real pin is visible to anyone who finds the card. - If someone with malicious intent finds the card, they will have full access to the card owner's account. Solution 2: Put a sticker with fake pin # on debit card Pros: - It protects the card owner's security since the fake pin is not the actual pin needed to access the account. - If someone finds the card and tries to use the fake pin, they are likely to have the card eaten by the ATM after three incorrect attempts. Cons: - The user has to remember the real PIN and not rely on the fake sticker.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the court that exiled people? Athenian slaves were the property of their master (or of the state), who could dispose of them as he saw fit. He could give, sell, rent, or bequeath them. A slave could have a spouse and child, but the slave family was not recognized by the state, and the master could scatter the family members at any time. Slaves had fewer judicial rights than citizens and were represented by their master in all judicial proceedings. A misdemeanour that would result in a fine for the free man would result in a flogging for the slave; the ratio seems to have been one lash for one drachma. With several minor exceptions, the testimony of a slave was not admissible except under torture. Slaves were tortured in trials because they often remained loyal to their master. A famous example of a trusty slave was Themistocles's Persian slave Sicinnus (the counterpart of Ephialtes of Trachis), who, despite his Persian origin, betrayed Xerxes and helped Athenians in the Battle of Salamis. Despite torture in trials, the Athenian slave was protected in an indirect way: if he was mistreated, the master could initiate litigation for damages and interest (δίκη βλάβης / dikē blabēs). Conversely, a master who excessively mistreated a slave could be prosecuted by any citizen (γραφὴ ὕβρεως / graphē hybreōs); this was not enacted for the sake of the slave, but to avoid violent excess (ὕβρις / hubris).Isocrates claimed that \\"not even the most worthless slave can be put to death without trial\\"; the master's power over his slave was not absolute. Draco's law apparently punished with death the murder of a slave; the underlying principle was: \\"was the crime such that, if it became more widespread, it would do serious harm to society?\\" The suit that could be brought against a slave's killer was not a suit for damages, as would be the case for the killing of cattle, but a δίκη φονική (dikē phonikē), demanding punishment for the religious pollution brought by the shedding of blood.

Question: Given the following context: Antoine's marriage to Marie of Lorraine was unhappy and yielded only two daughters. Monaco's constitution confined the throne to members of the Grimaldi family alone, and Antoine was thus keen for his daughter Princess Louise-Hippolyte (Illustration 11) to wed a Grimaldi cousin. However, the state of the Grimaldi fortunes, and the lack of (the politically necessary) approval from King Louis XIV, dictated otherwise. Louise-Hippolyte was married to Jacques de Goyon Matignon, a wealthy aristocrat from Normandy. Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as sovereign of Monaco in 1731 but died just months later. The King of France, confirming Monaco's subservient state to France, ignored the protests of other branches of the Grimaldi family, overthrew the Monégasque constitution, and approved the succession of Jacques de Goyon Matignon as Prince Jacques I.Jacques I assumed the name and arms of the Grimaldi, but the French aristocracy showed scant respect towards the new prince who had risen from their ranks and chose to spend his time absent from Monaco. He died in 1751 and was succeeded by his and Louise-Hippolyte's son Prince Honoré III.Honoré III married Catherine Brignole in 1757 and later divorced her. Before his marriage, Honoré III had been conducting an affair with his future mother-in-law. After her divorce Marie Brignole married Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé, a member of the fallen French royal house, in 1798. Ironically, the Grimaldi fortunes were restored when descendants of both Hortense Mancini and Louis I married: Louise d'Aumont Mazarin married Honoré III's son and heir, the future Honoré IV. This marriage in 1776 was extremely advantageous to the Grimaldi, as Louise's ancestress Hortense Mancini had been the heiress of Cardinal Mazarin. Thus Monaco's ruling family acquired all the estates bequeathed by Cardinal Mazarin, including the Duchy of Rethel, and the Principality of Château-Porcien.

The Thompson would fire through the majority of the magazine after you took your finger off the trigger. When the range officer was told he told us to point the gun down and keep trying. We then watched them hand the same broken firearm to multiple other people who were also experiencing the same problem. Before we left the store we had to talk to several employes before they would finally take it off the shelf and have their smith work on it. It's unfortunate that a range would behave in such an unsafe manner, I can think of few things more scary then putting an uncontrollable automatic weapon in the hands of someone that has never handled a gun. It didn't help that no refund was offered even when we informed them of just how dissatisfied we were. I would be very very concerned shooting in this environment.","completion":"To determine if the review is positive or negative, I will analyze its content step by step: 1. The reviewer mentions malfunctioning firearms, which is a negative experience. 2. The report about the Thompson gun firing uncontrollably is also negative. 3. The range officer's response to the issue raised is unsatisfactory and alarming, which is negative. 4. The fact that the broken firearm was provided to multiple people shows negligence, which is negative. 5. The reviewer had to talk to several employees to get the firearm checked, indicating poor customer service, another negative point. 6. The mention of unsafe behavior at the range is a strong negative. 7. The reviewer did not receive a refund despite being dissatisfied, adding a further negative aspect. 8.

Question: What is the name of the person who must remain handcuffed to his father? Answer the above question based on the context below: Fifteen disparate African American men board a bus in Los Angeles bound for Washington, D.C., where they plan on attending the Million Man March. Other than their race, destination, and gender, the men have nothing in common: George is the trip organizer; Xavier is an aspiring filmmaker hoping to make a documentary of the March; Flip is the vain but charismatic and openly homophobic and sexist actor; Kyle and Randall are a homosexual couple; Gary, a biracial police officer; Jamal is a former gang banger turned devout Muslim who has evaded prosecution for the murders he committed; Evan Jr., is a petty criminal who has been permitted to break probation to attend the march on the condition that he remain handcuffed to his father, Evan Sr. As the bus travels across country, Xavier conducts interviews with the various attendees, allowing them to express their views on race, religion, and politics. The interviews often provoke outbursts from other men on the bus, invariably leading to many political confrontations. Jeremiah, the eldest member of the group, is an 80-year-old former alcoholic who lost his job and family, has found new meaning in life and is energized by the Million Man March, and embraces his African heritage; his philosophies on the black experience and stories of precolonial Africa serve to unite the men and ease tensions and the infighting among them. En route the bus breaks down and the men are forced to board another bus, driven by an ethnically Jewish white man named Rick. A couple of the passengers harass Rick as a white man, and Rick ultimately refuses to drive any further, citing the group's prejudice and his opposition to antisemitic remarks made by the leader of the march, Louis Farrakhan. George, himself a bus driver, accuses Rick of cultural racism, but begrudgingly agrees to cover for Rick who leaves.

Can someone who has never heard of the person you are reporting on get a clear picture of the person from your report? If you think you need to explain your subject more, take the time to do it. You've spent a lot of time on your report already, so it's worth a little more time to make it the best it can be. After you're done writing your paper, read it out loud to catch mistakes. This will help you to catch areas of your writing that are awkward or confusing. When reading over your report you also want to make sure that the grammar and spelling is correct.

It was manufactured by Ovaltine. It has been sold as \\"PDQ Chocolate Flavor Beads\\" and \\"PDQ Choco Chips.\\" \\"Egg Nog Flavored PDQ\\" and \\"Strawberry PDQ\\" were also available. These flavored beads and chips were used to mix with milk or to sprinkle over ice cream. Hypothesis: PDQ Chocolate was relatively unknown in 1975.","completion":"While the context provides useful information about PDQ Chocolate, its popularity, and its various flavors, it does not definitively support or refute the hypothesis that PDQ Chocolate was relatively unknown in 1975. However, we can engage in a deeper analysis of the context provided and make a few inferences to conjecture the plausibility of the hypothesis. First, let us consider the available information about PDQ Chocolate's popularity. The context mentions that the product was a popular drink mix in the 1960s and 1970s. This spans a considerable time, suggesting that PDQ Chocolate was well-known and well-used during that period, which would include 1975. Given this information, it appears that the hypothesis, which states PDQ Chocolate was relatively unknown in 1975, contradicts the information provided about the popularity of the product during that era. Second, the context indicates the different iterations and variations of the product, including PDQ Chocolate Flavor Beads, PDQ Choco Chips, Egg Nog Flavored PDQ, and Strawberry PDQ. The presence of multiple flavors could suggest a degree of success for the product, as companies typically introduce new flavors to capitalize on a well-performing product. While it does not directly confirm or deny the hypothesis, this observation indicates that the product range might have been familiar within the consumer market during the 1960s and 1970s, which would also encompass the year 1975. Lastly, the context highlights that Ovaltine, the manufacturer of PDQ Chocolate, was involved in producing these products. Ovaltine is a well-known brand with a rich history, and it is reasonable to assume that PDQ Chocolate would have benefited from the brand recognition associated with Ovaltine. However, the context does not specify whether PDQ Chocolate significantly contributed to Ovaltine's overall success or held a prominent position in its product lineup during that time. Taking all these factors into consideration, it appears that the provided context does not fully support the hypothesis that PDQ Chocolate was relatively unknown in 1975. On the contrary, the context strongly suggests that PDQ Chocolate was a popular drink mix in the 1960s and 1970s, a timeframe that includes 1975. Nevertheless, without further information, we cannot definitively refute the hypothesis. It would be necessary to investigate additional data about the sales, marketing reach, and customer preferences during 1975 to draw a more concrete conclusion about PDQ Chocolate's relative popularity or obscurity during that specific year."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Even if the Republicans — who have a majority in both the House and Senate — approve a bill, it faces almost certain defeat in the upper chamber where Democrats hold enough seats to prevent Republicans, even if they all vote together, from reaching the 60 votes needed for passage. Earlier in the week, the president had called for Congress to quickly approve sweeping immigration legislation. But in a Friday tweet the president said, \\"Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November.

WASHINGTON — Legal experts cast doubt Tuesday on a list of questions the special counsel purportedly wants to ask President Donald Trump, saying they would expect the veteran prosecutor to ask more and more pointed questions. The New York Times published the list of 44 questions it said special counsel Robert Mueller plans to pose to Trump as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The newspaper reported that the list was compiled by Trump's lawyers based on questions that were read to them by special counsel investigators. The largely open-ended questions range from queries about Trump's firing of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey, to general inquiries into what Trump knew about alleged coordination between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. While the list reflects the general line of questioning the special counsel's investigation is believed to be focused on, legal experts said the questions published are not what Mueller — or any prosecutor for that matter — would ask an interview subject. \\"It doesn't sound like questions that a prosecutor would typically ask, unless it was just a very general information-gathering type of inquiry, and they'd not limit themselves to only those question and reserve the right to ask follow-up questions,\\" said Eric Jaso, a partner at the Spiro Harrison law firm who served as an associate independent counsel during the Whitewater investigation of former President Bill Clinton. The questions, Jaso said, were likely written by Trump's own lawyers, based on a conversation with the special counsel about topics he wants to query. \\"If Mr. Mueller is going to interview the president, I suspect that he's going to ask rather pointed questions rather than having questions that would allow the president to basically give a narrative and potentially go far afield from the topics that they're trying to focus on,\\" Jaso said.

He is tired of the controversy: The passage does not provide any information on whether Trump is tired of the controversy. C. He is dodging the issue: The passage does not specifically state that Trump is dodging the issue, but it does indicate that legal experts believe the questions published are not what Mueller would ask, possibly allowing Trump to avoid directly addressing certain topics.

Democracy activists said this amounted to a \\"fake democracy\\". When the guidelines were announced last August there were weeks of street protests and some violent clashes. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's second highest government official, put forward the reform package. \\"These proposals are in strict compliance with the Basic Law [Hong Kong's constitution] and the relevant decisions of [China's] standing committee of the National People's Congress,\\" Ms Lam said. \\"At the same time they fully take into account the views expressed by various sectors of the community,\\" she said. Hong Kong's leader will be chosen by the general population of more than five million eligible voters in the 2017 elections for the first time. However, the process prior to that was outlined by Ms Lam: Pro-democracy protesters have said this process allows Beijing to eliminate unwanted candidates and does not amount to universal suffrage. Hong Kong protests: Has Beijing won? Hong Kong's democracy debate Thousands of people barricaded parts of Hong Kong for more than two months in protest when the guidelines were first announced last year. But China has repeatedly made it clear that no concessions will be given. In December, Hong Kong police dismantled the last of the protest camps. The electoral proposal is due to be voted on in the legislature in the summer, and needs a two-thirds majority in the 70-member Legislative Council to be passed. The 27 pan-democratic lawmakers have mostly vowed to veto it. Many of them walked out of the chamber after the proposal was announced. \\"We will launch a campaign to oppose the proposal and we will ask the Hong Kong public to continue to seek true universal suffrage,\\" Civic Party lawmaker Alan Leong said. The government will have to win over at least four of them to get the proposal through. Speaking beforehand, the city's leader, Chief executive CY Leung, warned that if the proposal was vetoed this time, it would be a number of years before it was discussed again. That would mean the current system, under which the chief executive is elected by a 1,200-member election committee, would remain in place. China governs Hong Kong, a former British colony, under the \\"one country, two systems\\" principle. The system has allowed the city a high degree of autonomy and civil rights, including freedom of assembly and free speech. Hong Kong's mini-constitution says the ultimate aim is to elect the chief executive \\"by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee\\".

Last year, lots of people in Hong Kong protested on the streets because they wanted a fair election. But China has said they won't change their mind. The plan for the election will be voted on, but some members of Hong Kong's government might not support it because they want a more fair election. Right now, Hong Kong's leader is chosen by a smaller group of people, and if the plan isn't accepted, that might not change for a long time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Well, a new study suggests that you may not really be yawning because it’s contagious, or you’re bored or tired. You’re actually yawning because your brain is too hot. A group of researchers at the University of Vienna tested subjects in Austria and Arizona and tracked their activity, finding that that the only significant predicator of yawning was temperature: subjects were much more likely to yawn at higher temperatures. Other factors like sex, season, age, humidity, time spent outside, and hours of sleep the night before did not have a significant effect on the likelihood of a subject’s yawning. Ultimately, it appears that yawning is related to regulating brain temperature and creating a state where arousal in a yawner can be achieved. The idea is that if it’s hot, but still cool enough so that a large intake of air will bring your body temperature down, you’re in perfect storm territory for yawns. The study builds on research that shows that in both rats and humans, yawns are preceded by intermittent rises in brain temperatures, and that brain temperature decreases immediately afterward.

Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Major General A. D. McIntosh (Thomas Browne Henry) discovers that the government's missing spacecraft, piloted by Colonel Bob Calder (William Hopper), has been located off the coast of Italy. As McIntosh flies to Italy, Pepe (Bart Braverman), a little boy who lives in the fishing village of Gerra, finds a metal capsule that has washed up on the beach. Upon opening the capsule, he finds a jelly-like glob inside and sells it to Dr. Leonardo (Frank Puglia), a visiting zoologist who is studying sea creatures. Meanwhile, Leonardo's medical-student granddaughter Marisa (Joan Taylor) is summoned to town to take care of the injured Calder and his companion, Dr. Sharman. When Calder regains consciousness, he finds Sharman in the last throes of the fatal disease that decimated his crew. That night, after Marisa returns home to the trailer that she shares with her grandfather, a small creature hatches from the glob and Leonardo locks it in a cage. By morning, the creature has tripled in size, and McIntosh arrives in Gerra, accompanied by government scientist Dr. Justin Uhl, and meets with Calder and Signore Contino, a representative of the Italian government.

Niels Bohr introduced the first quantized model of the atom in 1913, in an attempt to overcome a major shortcoming of Rutherford's classical model. In classical electrodynamics, a charge moving in a circle should radiate electromagnetic radiation. If that charge were to be an electron orbiting a nucleus, the radiation would cause it to lose energy and spiral down into the nucleus. Bohr solved this paradox with explicit reference to Planck's work: an electron in a Bohr atom could only have certain defined energies En Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): Who modeled the molecule in 1918, challenging Rutherford's model?","completion":"The answer to this question is Niels Bohr's work on the atomic model in 1913, which brought significant changes to the field of atomic physics, challenging the classical understanding of the atom. However, the mention of \\"1918\\" in your question does not pertain to any particular individual who modeled the molecule in that specific year. Bohr drew upon Ernest Rutherford's work regarding the positively charged nucleus with orbiting electrons, but he addressed the limitations of Rutherford's model by incorporating Max Planck's quantum theory. This allowed Bohr to establish the quantization of energy levels, which prevented electrons from spiraling into the nucleus, a shortcoming in Rutherford's model. While Niels Bohr's work focused on the atom, it inspired further research on more complex molecular structures. However, the question of who specifically modeled the molecule in 1918 is not tied directly to a specific individual or discovery. Instead, the key development was Bohr's 1913 atomic model, and subsequent advancements in atomic and molecular theory would be made by various scientists throughout the years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is not about sports, business, or science/technology. Instead, it is about a political leader's suggestion for providing support and consolation to the families affected by the tragedy. The Beslan school massacre took place in the town of Beslan, North Ossetia, Russia in September 2004, when a group of armed terrorists took over 1,000 hostages, mostly children, on the first day of the school year. This took place in School Number One (SNO) and lasted for three days. The tragedy ended on September 4 with nearly 334 people killed, among them 186 children. The attack horrified the world and left a deep impact on the lives of the people who grieved for the innocent victims. The Greens leader, Bob Brown, proposed that Australia should send 400 personalized stuffed koalas as a way to show support for the grieving families who lost their loved ones in this horrific event. The gesture of sending stuffed koalas, an iconic Australian symbol, serves as an expression of empathy, compassion, and solidarity from the people of Australia to the victims' families. It aims to provide a small token of comfort and open a path of healing for those who were left with immeasurable pain and sorrow. In addition to extending support and comfort, the proposal is also indicative of international cooperation and the importance of standing together against acts of terrorism and violence around the world.

Additionally, you might also shave your armpits, if you plan to wear a sleeveless top. However, it's up to you whether or not you want to take this extra step, as more and more girls are choosing not to shave their body hair. Since you are biologically a male, shaving will help your look be more convincing. At the same time, your preferences are what's important. Jeans paired with a top or t-shirt is a common outfit for girls. Similarly, leggings and an oversized shirt can be a cute look that will be easy to imitate. With the right accessories, you can make a simple, unisex style look very feminine. For example, you might belt a long t-shirt over a pair of leggings. Then, drape a few long necklaces around your neck, put on a bracelet, and carry a purse. Alternatively, wear a pair of skinny jeans with a flowy top, a necklace, and a big bracelet. Additionally, wearing a dress or skirt will make your disguise more convincing, as boys don't usually wear dresses. Pick a dress that fits your shape well, and pair it with tights to make your legs look more girly. If you're worried about people figuring out you're biologically a boy, start with a long dress that covers most of your legs. For example, you might wear a maxi dress, which typically goes down to the floor. You can cover broad shoulders with long sleeves, a cardigan, or a light jacket. Since girls come in all shapes and sizes, you don't need to wear a bra. However, it's an option if you'd like to appear like you have breasts. Choose a bra with the cup size you'd like to have, then stuff it with tissue or padding. If you want to wear this disguise often, you can purchase breast forms so that you don't have to stuff your bra. Breast forms are realistic faux breasts that are usually made from silicone. They can help you get the look and feel of natural breasts. Try on different bras until you find one that fits you well. You don't need long hair to look like a girl, but it can help make your disguise more convincing. Depending on your current hairstyle, you may be able to use styling products like gel to create a typical girl hairstyle. Otherwise, wear a wig that gives you the style you want. You can also accessorize your hair with a headband, hair wrap, or hat to make yourself look more like a girl. Apply foundation to help conceal your face stubble and darker areas around your eyes. Then, use blush to add more color to your cheeks and lipstick to make your lips look more defined. Finally, use a bright eyeshadow, eyeliner, and mascara to make your eyes pop. Don't apply too much makeup because you don't want it to be cakey. It's better to go with less so your look is more natural. If your skin looks darker where your facial hair grows, using a concealer or foundation in a shade lighter than your normal foundation on just the darker areas can even them out. Watching makeup tutorials online can help you create the look you want. so your nails will look the part. To look more like a girl, you might paint your nails or apply fake nails, depending on what kind of style you want to create. However, don't feel like this is necessary. The easiest option is to trim your nails short and keep them clean. Remember, not all girls wear nail polish, just as some boys love to paint their nails.

Title: The Da Vinci Code Movie plot: Jacques SauniÃ¨re (Jean-Pierre Marielle), the Louvreâs curator, is pursued through the Great Gallery by an albino Catholic monk named Silas (Paul Bettany), who demands the location of the Prioryâs âkeystoneâ to find and destroy the Holy Grail. SauniÃ¨re gives him a false lead and is murdered, the police finding his body posed like the Vitruvian Man. Police captain Bezu Fache (Jean Reno) summons American symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) to examine SauniÃ¨reâs body.

The corporation, which has operated in the United Kingdom under the terms of a Royal charter since 1927, has produced television programmes from its own since 1932, although the start of its regular service of television broadcasts is dated to 2 November 1936. The domestic TV BBC television channels are broadcast without any commercial advertising and collectively they account for more than 30% of all UK viewing. The services are funded by a television licence. The BBC operates several television networks, television stations (although there is generally very little distinction between the two terms in the UK), and related programming services in the United Kingdom. As well as being a broadcaster, the corporation also produces a large number of its own programmes in-house, thereby ranking as one of the world's largest television production companies. Baird Television Ltd. made Britain's first television broadcast, on 30 September 1929 from its studio in Long Acre, London, via the BBC's London transmitter, using the electromechanical system pioneered by John Logie Baird. This system used a vertically-scanned image of 30 lines – just enough resolution for a close-up of one person, and with a bandwidth low enough to use existing radio transmitters. Simultaneous transmission of sound and picture was achieved on 30 March 1930, by using the BBC's new twin transmitter at Brookmans Park. By late 1930, 30 minutes of morning programmes were broadcast Monday to Friday, and 30 minutes at midnight on Tuesdays and Fridays, after BBC radio went off the air.

Premise: Even if people are randomly divided into groups, the groups will automatically discriminate against each other. Hypothesis: If people are split up, the groups will be against each other. Does the premise entail the hypothesis? OPT: (A). yes; (B). it is not possible to tell; (C). no;","completion":"The premise does entail the hypothesis. Answer: (A). Yes. To elaborate, the premise presented argues that if people are divided into groups on a random basis, these groups will exhibit discriminatory behavior against the other groups. The hypothesis presents a similar idea, suggesting that the division of people into separate groups inevitably leads to opposition. This premise and hypothesis rely on the assumption that humans have an intrinsic tendency to discriminate against those who aren't part of their group, regardless of the criteria behind the group formation. This phenomenon is known as \\"ingroup bias\\" or \\"ingroup favoritism,\\" a term that refers to the preference individuals have for the members of their own group over those from a different group. This pattern emerges from evolutionary psychology, as it was advantageous to have a tighter connection with one's own social group to enhance cooperation and, ultimately, increase the chances of survival. In social psychology, research has supported this tendency to display discriminatory behavior in minimal group studies. One well-known example of this is the Robbers Cave Experiment by Muzafer Sherif and his colleagues (1954). They divided a group of boys into two separate groups and observed the increased hostility and competition among the groups, despite having been originally formed without any pre-existing basis for conflict. Several other studies, such as the Minimal Group Paradigm studies conducted by Henri Tajfel and his colleagues, also demonstrate the presence of ingroup favoritism and outgroup discrimination. These studies further established that even in the absence of competition or conflict, individuals tended to favor their own group members over the outgroup members when distributing resources or making judgments. However, it is important to note that the premise and hypothesis lack nuance in acknowledging that the degree of discrimination among different groups can vary. Various factors can impact the extent of discriminatory behavior, including the salience of the group distinctions, cultural contexts, and previous experiences that individuals have with members of the outgroup. To sum up, the premise entails the hypothesis, but it is important to recognize that the strength of the discrimination may vary depending on various factors. The tendency to discriminate based on group membership has been observed in various social psychological studies and is acknowledged as an inherent aspect of human behavior."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

This article: Administration of Nuffield's donation was the responsibility of the University, as the college did not become an independent body until after the Second World War. A sub-committee, consisting of three heads of Oxford colleges (Sir William Beveridge from University College; Alfred Emden from St Edmund Hall; and Linda Grier from Lady Margaret Hall), was appointed to choose the architect; Emden appears to have played the major part in the group's work. Eight architects were initially asked to compete, including Louis de Soissons, Vincent Harris, Austen Harrison, Charles Holden, Edward Maufe, and Hubert Worthington. All but Holden and Maufe submitted photographs of their work, and the sub-committee then recommended Harrison, a decision confirmed after he was interviewed on 17 June 1938. At that time, Harrison had never worked in Britain: although he had qualified there, he had practised in Greece and Palestine. Indeed, the college seems to have been his only project in the country, and remains his best known work, along with his later University of Ghana. Harrison was not given any restrictions or limitations on style; Nuffield agreed to Harrison's appointment, but was not consulted on the architectural style of the college before Harrison started work. When Nuffield's donation was announced, it was reported that the \\"general idea\\" was that the college buildings should be sited behind gardens, similar to the memorial gardens at Christ Church, Oxford, so that those entering Oxford from the west would be faced with a \\"beautiful vista of well-planned gardens seen through railings\\"; this idea did not form part of Harrison's designs. After Harrison's preliminary studies, it became clear that the proposed site could not contain a college and an institute for social science research as planned; Nuffield agreed to provide an additional plot of land on the opposite side of Worcester Street. Harrison proposed to build the college on the main site, with the institute on the second site.

Katie claims an evil presence has been haunting her since she was a child, so Micah sets up a camera in their bedroom to record any paranormal activity that occurs while they sleep. Katie hires psychic Dr. Fredrichs, who reveals that Katie is being haunted by a demon that feeds off of negative energy and is intent on tormenting Katie. He advises them not to communicate with the demon and to contact demonologist Dr. Johann Averies if needed. Katie seems interested, but Micah does not take this seriously. The camera manages to capture many strange occurrences, which are minor at first, such as noises, flickering lights, and doors moving on their own. On the thirteenth night they were awoken at the sound of a screeching demon downstairs. During the fifteenth night, Katie, in an apparent trance, stands beside the bed and stares at Micah for two hours before going outside. Micah tries to convince Katie to go back inside, but she refuses and appears to remember none of it the next day. One day Micah brings home a Ouija board, which infuriates Katie. When they leave the house, the camera records an unseen force moving the planchette to form an unknown message on the Ouija board, which then spontaneously catches fire. Katie sees the video and pleads with Micah to contact the demonologist, but again he refuses. During the seventeenth night, Micah sprinkles baby powder in the hallway and bedroom.

If a particular boulder weighs 800 pounds on Planet X, then it will weigh _____ on planet Z. (A) less (B) more Answer:","completion":"To find out the weight of the boulder on Planet Z, we need to follow these steps: 1. Determine the relationship between the masses of the two planets. 2. Use the relationship to find the weight of the boulder on Planet Z. Step 1: Relationship between the masses: Given that Planet X has 10% more mass than Planet Z. Let the mass of Planet Z be Mz, then the mass of Planet X is 1.1Mz (10% more mass than Planet Z). Step 2: Find the weight on Planet Z: Weight is proportional to the mass of the object and the mass of the planet (W = G * m * M, where W is the weight, G is the gravitational constant, m is the mass of the object, and M is the mass of the planet) Let Wz be the weight of the boulder on Planet Z and Wx be the weight of the boulder on Planet X. We know that Wx is 800 pounds and the mass of Planet X is 1.1Mz. Wx = G * m * (1.1Mz) = 800 pounds We want to find Wz. Wz = G * m * Mz To find Wz, we can set up the following proportion: Wz / Wx = Mz / (1.1Mz) Wz / 800 = Mz / (1.1Mz) Now, we can solve for Wz: Wz = 800 * (Mz / 1.1Mz) Wz = 800 * (1 / 1.1) Wz ≈ 727.27 pounds So, the boulder will weigh approximately 727.27 pounds on Planet Z.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: There are several types of radioactive decay, including alpha, beta, and gamma decay. In all three types, nuclei emit radiation, but the nature of the radiation differs. The Table below shows the radiation emitted in each type of decay. You can watch a video about the three types at this URL: http://www. youtube. com/watch?v=3koOwozY4oc . Q: What is emitted by nuclei in alpha, beta, and gamma decay? A: Answer:","completion":"In radioactive decay processes, unstable atomic nuclei lose energy by emitting radiation. There are several types of radioactive decay, with alpha, beta, and gamma decay being the most common. Each type emits different particles or radiation, which ultimately causes the nucleus to transform and reach a more stable, lower-energy state. The following is a detailed examination of what is emitted in alpha, beta, and gamma decay: 1. Alpha Decay: In alpha decay, the nucleus emits an alpha particle, which consists of two protons and two neutrons. This alpha particle is the same as a helium-4 nucleus. When a nucleus undergoes alpha decay, its atomic number (number of protons) decreases by two, and its mass number (total number of protons and neutrons) decreases by four. For example, uranium-238 (with 92 protons and 146 neutrons) undergoes alpha decay to form thorium-234 (with 90 protons and 144 neutrons), releasing an alpha particle in the process. 2. Beta Decay: Beta decay can occur in two forms: beta-minus and beta-plus decay. Both forms involve the transformation of particles within the nucleus. In both cases, a nucleon (proton or neutron) changes its type, resulting in the emission of either an electron (beta-minus) or a positron (beta-plus). - Beta-minus decay: A neutron is converted into a proton, and an electron (called a beta-minus particle) is emitted in the process. The atomic number of the nucleus increases by one, but the mass number remains the same. An example of beta-minus decay is the transformation of carbon-14 (with 6 protons and 8 neutrons) to nitrogen-14 (with 7 protons and 7 neutrons). - Beta-plus decay: A proton is converted into a neutron, and a positron (called a beta-plus particle) is emitted in the process. The atomic number of the nucleus decreases by one, and the mass number stays constant. An example of beta-plus decay is the transformation of sodium-22 (with 11 protons and 11 neutrons) to neon-22 (with 10 protons and 12 neutrons). 3. Gamma Decay: Gamma decay involves the emission of gamma rays, which are high-energy electromagnetic radiation. Unlike alpha and beta decay, gamma decay does not involve a change in the composition of the atomic nucleus; rather, it involves a change in the energy state of the nucleus. When a nucleus is in an excited, higher-energy state, it can emit a gamma photon to transition to a lower, more stable energy state. For instance, after undergoing alpha or beta decay, the nucleus might still be in an excited state. The subsequent emission of gamma radiation allows the nucleus to reach its ground (stable) energy state. In summary, alpha decay emits an alpha particle (two protons and two neutrons), beta decay emits either an electron (beta-minus) or a positron (beta-plus), and gamma decay emits high-energy gamma photons. Each type of decay transforms the atomic nucleus in different ways, but the ultimate goal is to achieve a more stable, lower-energy state."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

An aircraft carrier is a kind of ship that planes can fly from and land on--like an airport on the sea. It stands for a country's military strength . It plays an important role in modern wars. In August last year, the air craft carrier began its trial run at Dalian Port in Liaoning. The carrier was at first called the Varyag. It was built in the former Soviet Union. However, the Soviets failed to finish the ship. China bought the Varyag in 1998. Now after 10 trial runs, the aircraft carrier, renamed Liaoning, is in active service. Liaoning is about 300 meters long and 70 meters wide. It can take 30 planes and hold 2,000 soldiers. According to Xinhua News, Liaoning will be used for scientific research and military training. The aircraft carrier will help protect our country and promote world peace. The BBC said that Liaoning coming into service \\" marks China as a rising power\\". ,.

Please answer the following question: Information: - An oblast is a type of administrative division of Belarus, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Ukraine, and the now-defunct Soviet Union and Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The term is analogous to \\"state\\" or \\"province\\". - In geography, regions are areas that are broadly divided by physical characteristics (physical geography), human impact characteristics (human geography), and the interaction of humanity and the environment (environmental geography). Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human geography, where jurisdiction areas such as national borders are defined in law. - Local government is a form of public administration which, in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state. The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions. - Ukraine (tr. ) is a sovereign state in Eastern Europe, bordered by Russia to the east and northeast, Belarus to the northwest, Poland and Slovakia to the west, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova to the southwest, and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south and southeast, respectively. Ukraine is currently in territorial dispute with Russia over the Crimean Peninsula which Russia annexed in 2014 but which Ukraine and most of the international community recognise as Ukrainian. Including Crimea, Ukraine has an area of , making it the largest country entirely within Europe and the 46th largest country in the world. It has a population of about 44.5 million, making it the 32nd most populous country in the world. - Kobeliaky is a city in Poltava Oblast, Ukraine. Population is . - Kobeliatskyi Raion ( Ukrainian : ; translit . : Kobeliats'kyi Raion ) is a raion ( district ) in the central Ukrainian province of Poltava . The raion 's administrative center is the city of Kobeliaky , which has a separate administrative status within the oblast ' . Important rivers within the Kobeliatskyi Raion include the Dnieper and Vorskla rivers . The raion was officially founded on March 7 , 1923 . - A school district is a form of special-purpose district which serves to operate local public primary and secondary schools, for formal academic or scholastic teaching, in various nations. - A district is a type of administrative division that, in some countries, is managed by local government. Across the world, areas known as \\"districts\\" vary greatly in size, spanning entire regions or counties, several municipalities, subdivisions of municipalities, school district, or political district. - A raion (also rayon) is a type of administrative unit of several post-Soviet states (such as part of an oblast). The term is from the French \\"\\"rayon\\"\\" (meaning \\"honeycomb, department\\"), which is both a type of a subnational entity and a division of a city, and is commonly translated in English as \\"district\\". - The post-Soviet states, also collectively known as the former Soviet Union (FSU) or former Soviet Republics, are the 15 independent states that emerged from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in its dissolution in December 1991, with Russia internationally recognised as the successor state to the Soviet Union. On March 11, 1990, Lithuania was the first to declare its independence, with Estonia and Latvia following suit in August 1991. All three Baltic states claimed continuity from the original states that existed prior to their annexation by the Soviet Union in 1944 and were admitted to the United Nations on 17 September 1991. The remaining 12 republics all subsequently seceded. 12 of the 15 states, excluding the Baltic states, initially formed the CIS and most joined CSTO, while the Baltic states focused on European Union and NATO membership. - Poltava Oblast (translit. \\"Poltavska oblast\\"; also referred to as Poltavshchyna \\"\\") is an oblast (province) of central Ukraine. The administrative center of the oblast is the city of Poltava. - An administrative division, unit, entity, area or region, also referred to as a subnational entity, constituent unit, or country subdivision, is a portion of a country or other region delineated for the purpose of administration. Administrative divisions are granted a certain degree of autonomy and are usually required to manage themselves through their own local governments. Countries are divided up into these smaller units to make managing their land and the affairs of their people easier. For example, a country may be divided into provinces, which, in turn, are divided into counties, which, in turn, may be divided in whole or in part into municipalities; and so on. What is the relationship between 'kobeliaky raion' and 'poltava oblast'? Answer:","completion":"Kobeliaky Raion is a district (raion) within Poltava Oblast in central Ukraine. The relationship between Kobeliaky Raion and Poltava Oblast is that of an administrative subdivision. Poltava Oblast is a larger administrative division (comparable to a province or state) and serves as the overall governing regional entity. Within Poltava Oblast, there are multiple districts (raions), one of which is Kobeliaky Raion.

They generally offer thrifty options for lodging, eating, entertainment, and airline tickets. You can find many of these places by choosing “everywhere” as your destination on a travel website. Another smart option is to identify a high traffic place, like Paris, and then travel to a smaller city outside of it. This is called “secondary” travelling. Most places have a tourist off-season when fewer people come and prices drop. For the Caribbean, this is usually April to August. Europe's off-season is January to March. Visitors to Africa find better prices from May to September. You can also contact your accommodations directly prior to booking and ask them when their off-season begins and ends. Off-season often coincides with less than ideal weather, so make sure that you consider this when packing your bags. If you plan to eat out, look up menus for restaurants at your destination. Or, go online and find the average cost of staple groceries, such as milk, for that area. If you are going to drive, search online for gas and toll costs for your destination. You can also buy museum or other tickets in advance, so that you'll know how much you are spending for entertainment. Start by choosing your destination and the number of days that you'd like to travel. Then, estimate how much you'll need to buy a flight. Use the information that you've gathered on food, entertainment, and other expenses to determine a daily cost of living. Add up all of your costs until you have a total estimate for the trip. If you divide your total trip estimate by the number of days you are travelling, you'll know the cost per day. This will help you to determine if you can afford a longer trip or if you need to cut it short. Look over your trip costs and see if there are areas where you can cut costs, such as eating in more instead of dining out. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"The article focuses on strategies for identifying and selecting bargain travel spots and managing travel expenses.

Arthur Booth will serve no additional jail time as part of his guilty plea but will spend time in a drug treatment program, his attorney said. Booth was given a suspended sentence, meaning he might be sent to prison if he violates probation. \\"He's doing well, he's optimistic, he's very grateful to be given a second chance,\\" attorney Alexander Strassman said.

This time you're charged with a burglary,\\" said Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Mindy Glazer, during a hearing, Thursday. Judge Glazer never expected a middle school reunion would occur while on the job. \\"Mr. Booth, I have a question for you,\\" she asked 49-year-old Arthur Booth. \\"Yes, ma'am?\\" he responded. \\"Did you go to Nautilus for middle school?\\" \\"Oh, my goodness,\\" said Booth, as he covered his mouth in shock. Booth, now a suspected burglar, was reunited with his middle school classmate decades later in the court of law. When realizing who his judge was, he broke down in tears. \\"Sorry to see you there,\\" said the judge. \\"I always wondered what happened to you, sir.\\" \\"Oh, my goodness!\\" Booth said again. \\"This was the nicest kid in middle school.\\" Again, Booth, could only reply, \\"Oh, my goodness!\\" as he wept. On June 29, Booth was allegedly seen leaving the scene of a burglary at Northwest North River Drive and 36th Street in Hialeah. Police said Booth failed to pull over as they tried to conduct a traffic stop. According to the police report, \\"Mr. Booth drove his vehicle onto the median and drove onto the oncoming traffic lanes. Mr. Booth then bailed from his vehicle.\\" In bond court, Glazer said Booth's alleged behavior was not the childhood classmate she remembers. \\"He was the best kid in middle school,\\" she said. \\"I used to play football with him, all the kids, and look what has happened. I'm so sorry to see you there. Mr. Booth, I hope you're able to change your ways, good luck to you.\\" Once again, Booth could only respond, \\"Oh, my goodness,\\" as he wiped tears from his eyes. As Booth continued to cry, Glazer delivered a message she hopes will help turn his life around. \\"What's sad is how old we've become. Good luck to you, sir.

Oh my goodness,” is all inmate Arthur Booth could say. Glazer recognized her former middle school classmate as he appeared before her facing burglary charges. “I’m sorry to see you and I always wondered what happened to you,” she told him. Well, on Tuesday afternoon, Glazer met with Booth once again under better circumstances. He was released from jail after nearly 10 months. He caught a break and was released on a court program. Glazer stood by waiting – along with his family – to greet Booth as he walked out of jail. “Take care of your family. Try to get a job. Stay clean,” Glazer told Booth. “You’re going to do something good for somebody else.” “You better believe it. You better believe it,” Booth responded. The two hugged, with big smiles on both their faces. “She’s an inspiration and a motivation to me right now. Mindy is incredible,” Booth said. “Cause I know where I could’ve been, but I’m not giving up on life. It’s just a new lease on life for me right now.” “He had a good judge who wanted to give him a chance,” Glazer said.” This is a group effort to see you succeed. Don’t let us down.” “I won’t.

Keep in mind the importance of family, traditions, and various social norms that exist in Indian society. Step 3: Identify factors that are unique to India or more prevalent in India. By considering the cultural context of India, we can identify factors that might be more common or unique to India. Examples may include societal pressures related to marriage, the caste system, regional disparities, and political corruption. Step 4: Analyze any specific factors that may trigger sadness in India. Once the general and culturally unique factors have been identified, we can delve into the specific issues that might make Indians sad. Some of these factors could be the difficulty of accessing quality education, healthcare, or employment opportunities. Additionally, religious, caste, or gender-based discrimination might lead to sadness. Step 5: Create a comprehensive list of the factors that make Indians sad. After identifying and analyzing the various factors, compile a comprehensive list of the things that make Indians sad. This list can then be presented as the AI's response to the inquiry. Taking into account the steps outlined above, the things that make Indians sad would include, but are not limited to, loss of loved ones, financial difficulties, health issues, stress, relationship problems, societal pressures related to marriage, the caste system, regional disparities, political corruption, difficulty accessing quality education and healthcare, employment challenges, and religious, caste, or gender-based discrimination."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It states that the force will be one-fourth the magnitude as on Earth's surface. Hypothesis: States that objects on Earth have two forces acting on them at all times. By comparing the information in the Premise and Hypothesis, it's clear that the Premise does not provide any information about whether there are two forces acting on objects on Earth. It only discusses the force of gravitational attraction when an object is placed above the Earth's surface.

Question: Drug corporation Reckitt Benckiser was found guilty of marketing false 'variations' and inflated pricing of what identical product? Paracetamol; Nurofen; Anadin; or Ibuprofen? Answer:","completion":"The drug corporation in question, Reckitt Benckiser, was found guilty of marketing false 'variations' and inflated pricing of the identical product named Nurofen. Reckitt Benckiser is a British multinational consumer goods company that produces health, hygiene, and home products. One of the most popular brands under its vast portfolio is Nurofen, an over-the-counter medication primarily known for its ibuprofen content used for relieving pain, reducing inflammation, and lowering fever. The controversy arose when it was discovered that Reckitt Benckiser was misleading consumers by marketing and selling different versions of Nurofen which were labelled to target specific types of pain such as migraines, tension headaches, period pain, and back pain. These 'variations' of Nurofen were priced differently and often at a significantly higher price compared to regular Nurofen, giving consumers the perception that the specific-pain range was specialized in treating the type of pain it was labelled for. However, upon further investigation, it was revealed that these variations contained exactly the same active ingredient, Ibuprofen lysine (342mg). Whether it was Nurofen Back Pain, Nurofen Migraine Pain, Nurofen Period Pain, or Nurofen Tension Headache, the active ingredients were identical, and there was no specific formulation in these products that made them target the specific pains they were marketed for. Reckitt Benckiser's marketing strategy was deemed misleading by authorities, and they were found guilty because they were essentially charge consumers more for a perception of specialization that did not exist. The identical composition of these drugs meant that they were no more effective in treating the specific ailments they were advertised to address than regular, and cheaper, Nurofen. This unethical approach sparked a hefty fine and a significant amount of backlash for Reckitt Benckiser, as these practices violated consumer trust and contravened fair marketing and pricing norms. This case against Reckitt Benckiser serves as a cautionary tale for pharmaceutical and consumer goods companies on the price and reputational damage that can follow such misleading labeling and marketing tactics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Benjamin did not know any people there. Though Benjamin was generally quite sociable, he found himself rather uneasy and out of his comfort zone this particular evening. He hadn't known that Donald, his roommate and close friend, had managed to encircle himself with such a diverse and eclectic group of intriguing individuals. A keen observer of human nature, this party was the perfect place for Benjamin to put his observational skills to the test. Upon entering the grand, high-ceilinged party hall, Benjamin felt the palpable shift from his everyday life into this world that was so clearly Donald's domain. Resplendent chandeliers cast a warm, inviting glow upon the guests, whose appearances ranged from the impeccably dressed to the fantastically bohemian. Conversations varying from philosophy and poetry to business strategies buzzed in different corners of the grand hall. However, Benjamin's lack of acquaintance made him feel alien in this elaborate tableau. Sticking close to Donald, Benjamin moved through the sea of strangers, attempting to acclimate to this hitherto unknown realm. Donald, comfortable in his element, flowed from group to group like a seasoned diplomat, enthralling his audience irrespective of the topic. Left to his own devices, Benjamin found himself at a loss, only picking up fragments of discussions from the party’s many clusters of conversation. Realizing he needed to take some initiative, Benjamin adopted the role of an eager listener. He started shadowing Donald not just physically but conversationally too. He would keep an ear out for engaging topics and tried to subtly contribute when he could. He read about most subjects, be it politics, literature, sports or pop-culture and used it to his advantage. Soon, he could sense a drop in his anxiety as he realised that he was quite capable of holding complex conversations with people much more experienced and exposure-wise potent than him. As the evening passed, Benjamin discovered more layers to Donald's life that he was clueless about. He was amazed to uncover facets of their friendship that spanned more than their shared apartment. Donald's rich and varied interests, represented by the party's eclectic group, challenged Benjamin in a way he hadn't anticipated. While Donald had a novel ready to narrate about seemingly every individual present, he seemed to carry an affectionate patience for Benjamin's more reserved nature. Slowly, with Donald’s help and his own efforts, Benjamin started to feel more at ease. He found some common ground with a group of foreign film enthusiasts, and before he knew it, he was partaking in an animated discussion about international cinema. The initial unease gradually gave way to a buzzing energy, as Benjamin found himself amongst new friends with shared interests. In retrospect, Benjamin realized that sticking to Donald was a lifeline at the beginning of the party, but by the end of the night, he found himself navigated through the party’s uncharted territory. The party turned out to be a night of unexpected evolution for Benjamin, shifting from an outsider to an active participant in the melting pot of discussions, marking his first successful voyage into Donald’s diverse world of connections."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Mars Was Not Always Bitterly Cold Scientists at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have reported evidence that Mars was warmer and wetter long ago than it is today. The Caltech scientists say they have directly _ the temperature of Mars four billion years ago. At least, they established the surface temperature on part of the planet at that time. The researchers say it is the first such evidence to be discovered and presented. The Caltech scientists say carbonate minerals formed on Mars at about eighteen degrees Celsius. They reached the finding after studying a meteorite that had its beginnings near the Martian surface. Today, the average temperature on Mars is sixty-three degrees below zero Celsius. The finding was reported on the website of the National Academy of Sciences. Caltech Assistant Professor Woody Fischer helped to prepare the report. He says eighteen degrees Celsius is not especially cold or hot. He says this makes the finding extremely interesting. Knowing the temperature can give scientists an idea of the climate on Mars long ago. It can also help them decide whether the planet had liquid water. Spacecraft orbiting Mars have shown what appear to be rivers, lakebeds and mineral deposits. These pictures suggest that, at one time, water did flow there. Mars Rover vehicles and other spacecraft have confirmed the information. Caltech Geology Professor John Eiler was another writer of the report. He says knowing the temperature of Mars from long ago provides valuable information. It shows that early in the planet's history, at least part of Mars could support a climate like that of Earth. The meteorite the scientists examined is one of the oldest known rocks in the world. It is called the Allan Hills meteorite. Its name came from the place in Antarctica where it was found in 1984. The meteorite is believed to have blown loose from the Mars' surface when another space rock struck its \\"home.\\" Options: A From its original place on Mars. B From where it was found on the earth.

See options at the end The man wanted to run the business out of his home office but the Choices: i. office was too large.; ii. business was too large.;","completion":"The man wanted to run the business out of his home office but the business was too large. In this context, the statement implies that the scope and volume of operations that characterize the business venture are too vast to be handled effectively from a home office setup. The term \\"large\\" in this case can imply various aspects of the business such as the number of people involved, the amount of goods or items to be stored or shipped, even the range of services to be coordinated. Home offices generally have limited space and resources compared to a regular business setup which could include several employees, higher capacity infrastructure and certain professional considerations like meeting rooms for clients, among other things. The range of business activities could include manufacturing, retail, hospitality, coaching, consulting and other service-based industries, for which significant space, resources, specialist equipment, local zoning regulations, or even legislative conditions might need to be taken into account. For example, if the business involves manufacturing or selling physical products, the man might need storage space for inventory or production operations that his home office cannot accommodate. A large volume of sales would also potentially require a broader logistics operation, including shipment, delivery, or even customer service capabilities beyond what his home office can handle. Similarly, if the business is a restaurant or catering service, the kitchen facilities in a house might not meet the requirements for commercial food preparation in terms of capacity or sanitation regulations. Also, potentially there might be noise and waste by-products generated by the business operations which would disturb the peace and tranquility expected in a residential area. In addition, managing a large number of employees from a home office can prove to be quite challenging given the capacity for only a limited number of people to be physically accommodated in such a space. It may also not provide an adequate degree of professionalism that may be required for dealings with clients, suppliers, or employees. Furthermore, running a large business from home could breach local zoning laws. Many residential areas have regulations that restrict commercial activities to protect the residential character of the neighborhood. There could be restrictions around noise levels, customer footfall, parking space necessities, or even how much of the home can be used for business purposes. Therefore, the scale of the business - its size and depth could make it challenging, impractical and perhaps even illegal to run efficiently and effectively from a home office. Hence, the man desired to operate his business from the home office, but the size of the operations made it infeasible."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Logic test: Janna was playing with her softball and her bowling ball. She noted that the bowling ball had a greater mass than her softball. Which ball had stronger gravity? (A) softballl (B) bowling ball The answer is:","completion":"(B) Bowling Ball To understand why the bowling ball has stronger gravity, we need to analyze the principles involved in the gravitational force between the objects. Newton's law of universal gravitation states that every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Mathematically, it can be represented as: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2 where: F - gravitational force between two objects G - gravitational constant (approximately 6.674×10^-11 N(m/kg)^2) m1 - mass of the first object m2 - mass of the second object r - distance between the centers of the two objects Now, let's consider the two objects in question: the softball and the bowling ball. We know that the bowling ball has a greater mass than the softball, as stated in the problem. With all factors (G and r) remaining constant, we can analyze the effect of the mass on the gravitational force. Using the equation F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2, we can deduce that: - When the mass of one of the objects is increased, keeping all else equal, the gravitational force increases. This means that, since the bowling ball has a greater mass than the softball, it will experience a greater gravitational force, and the gravitational force between the bowling ball and any other object will also be greater than that between the softball and the same object. Therefore, based on Newton's law of universal gravitation and the information given in the problem, the correct answer would be (B) Bowling Ball, as it has a stronger gravitational force due to its higher mass compared to the softball."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: Brush or comb your hair until it’s tangle-free. Pay special attention to the back of your head, since this is the part you will be braiding, and it also is the section of hair that is the most prone to knots. Separate your hair into three sections, with one long, thin rectangular section down the middle of the back of your head, and the rest of your hair on either side. Make sure that the section in the back is parted straight, as the part may be visible. Flip the two side sections of hair over your shoulders and out of your way. Then take the back section of hair and divide it into three strands. These are the strands you’re going to use to create your braid. Do one stitch of a braid by crossing the left strand of hair of the back section over the middle strand. Then cross the right strand of hair over the middle section. Before you make the next stitch, add hair to one of the side strands of the section you’re braiding from one of the loose sections. Then do one stitch of the braid, incorporating this hair. For the next stitch, add hair from the other section of hair into one strand of your braid. For instance, if the last time you added hair from the left section, this time add hair from the right. Create one stitch of the braid. Keep doing a Dutch braid, adding hair alternatively from the right and left sections to one strand of the braid. Keep braiding until the braid reaches the nape of your neck. Use a thin elastic tie rather than a regular hair tie to secure your braid. This tie may be visible, so try to use one that is transparent or that is the same color as your hair. After you’ve finished the braid, take your hair and pull it back into a ponytail. Tuck the braid down so that it is at the bottom of the ponytail, with the rest of your hair around it. Tie with an elastic band, and your hair look is finished! You can also make a messy bun instead of a ponytail if you want a more tousled look.","completion":"To create a Dutch braid down the middle of the back of your head, start by brushing or combing your hair until it is free of tangles, focusing on the back area where knots are more common. Then, separate your hair into three parts: a long, thin rectangular section in the middle of the back of your head, and two side sections. Ensure the middle section's part is straight because it may be visible in the final look. Move the two side sections over your shoulders to keep them out of the way as you work on the central part. Divide the back section into three strands for braiding. Begin braiding by crossing the left strand over the middle one, followed by the right strand over the middle. As you proceed with the next braid stitch, incorporate a small portion of hair from one of the side sections into the braid. Keep alternating between left and right side sections as you add hair to the braid. Continue braiding in this Dutch style, incorporating hair from both sides, until the braid reaches the nape of your neck. Secure the braid with a thin, discreet elastic tie, preferably transparent or matching your hair color. After finishing the braid, gather your hair, including the braid, into a ponytail, with the braid laying at the base of the ponytail surrounded by the rest of your hair. Fasten with an elastic band to complete the look.

Please answer the following question: If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness.

For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as “beeping.” Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better. I used to be terrified of learning to drive, for many reasons, but a large one being that if I got an ice pick headache on the road, I couldn’t guarantee the safety of those around me if I was at the wheel.

The families of two frail and elderly pensioners who died after being urgently moved from their troubled care homes have today criticised the Government's watchdog for the rushed closures. After more than a month of the authorities refusing to identify Alfred Dodd and Winifred Lake, their names were today revealed. The 85 and 91-year-old died days after they were evacuated from private care homes Merok Park in Surrey and nearby Grantley Court in Sutton, respectively. Their families fear the sudden closures caused the dementia sufferers unnecessary stress and anxiety. They want to know why a damning inspection report from health watchdogs went unpublished for eight months. Mr Dodd’s family accuse the","completion":"Care Quality Commission (CQC), the Government's health watchdog, of gross negligence and ineffectiveness in handling the situation. They argue that had the CQC acted promptly and published the scathing inspection report earlier, their loved one might still be alive today. The delay in releasing the report meant that the necessary improvements and interventions were not made in time, resulting in the hasty evacuation of the elderly residents from their care homes. The story of Ms. Lake's family echoes a similar sentiment. They, too, hold the CQC responsible for the untimely closures of the care homes, questioning their competence and transparency in dealing with such sensitive matters. The families argue that the CQC's primary concern should have been the welfare of the elderly patients, which, in their view, was severely compromised. They contend that due care should have been taken to ascertain the potential impact of the swift and abrupt closures on the mental and emotional well-being of these vulnerable dementia patients. Both families are demanding a thorough and impartial investigation into the matter to ascertain the real reasons behind the delays in disclosing the inspection report. They assert that appropriate remedial actions should have been put in place much earlier to ensure that the care homes were safe, secure, and providing a high standard of care to their patients. The families question the role of the CQC in the entire process and demand reassurance that measures will be taken to prevent similar occurrences in the future. Furthermore, due consideration needs to be given to the protocols and processes followed by the CQC when dealing with issues of this nature. Lessons must be learned, and improved systems must be put in place to ensure transparency, timely communication, and the maintenance of the highest standards in care homes across the nation. The families of Mr. Dodd and Ms. Lake seek justice and are now exploring all legal avenues to hold the CQC accountable for the suffering caused due to their perceived negligence. In response to the allegations, the CQC has expressed its condolences to the bereaved families and acknowledged the tragic outcomes of the rushed closures. The organization has committed itself to reviewing the entire process and is prepared to make the necessary changes to ensure such incidents are not repeated in the future. However, the CQC also emphasizes the prioritization of safety and the enforcement of regulations in care homes, even when that means taking difficult decisions such as closing down care homes that are deemed unsafe. In conclusion, the tragic deaths of Mr. Dodd and Ms. Lake have raised crucial questions about the effectiveness of the CQC and the safeguards in place to protect vulnerable elderly residents. The scrutiny and subsequent improvements that will result from this incident will hopefully provide families with greater confidence in the care provided by care homes and those tasked with monitoring and regulating their operations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

To apply this trend to your own home, you can incorporate marble in various ways. Start by identifying areas where the material can make a statement, such as countertops, backsplashes, flooring, or furniture pieces. For countertops, white Carrara marble is a classic choice. It boasts a subtle veining pattern that adds visual interest without overpowering the space. For extra durability, consider using quartz or solid surface materials that mimic the appearance of marble. Marble backsplashes can elevate the look of your kitchen or bathroom, making it a focal point of the room. Opt for a full-height marble backsplash for a dramatic effect, or use smaller tiles or mosaics for a more subtle approach. Regarding flooring, large-format marble tiles can create the illusion of a wider space and exude opulence in entryways, living rooms, and bathrooms. Choose from polished or honed finishes, depending on your preferred level of shine. Furniture pieces featuring marble elements can add a touch of luxury to any space. Consider a marble-topped coffee table, side table, console, or dining table to infuse this sophisticated material into your home. If you do not want to commit to full-scale marble installations, you can still embrace this trend through smaller accessories and accent pieces. Decorative marble trays, bookends, coasters, and lamps can all contribute to a cohesive design theme. Lastly, remember to maintain your marble surfaces properly. This natural stone is porous and can be prone to staining and etching. Regular sealing and gentle cleaning methods are essential to preserve the material's beauty and longevity. In summary, the white-marble trend is popular due to its timeless elegance and versatility in home décor. Marble can be incorporated in various ways, from countertops and backsplashes to flooring and furniture. Additionally, using marble accessories and accent pieces can allow homeowners to adopt the trend without committing to significant renovations. Proper care and maintenance are crucial to maintain the material's allure over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Raymond Chandler: Connecting with Raymond Chandler Watching the video clip, my heart raced. I'd seen the movie before, of course, but never realized what I was looking at: there, in the background of \\"Double Indemnity,\\" was Raymond Chandler. His appearance in the movie he'd help script had gone unnoticed for 55 years, until two separate researchers pointed him out in 2009. And there he was in a hallway as walked past, cigarette in hand, reading. Chandler is one of Los Angeles' greatest writers, but his death in 1959 came before he was much captured on film — this was the first time I'd ever seen him move. It was like history had opened up and I'd reached through a window of time, seen him alive instead of as a name on the spine of a book. With Chandler, I'm always looking to connect, to create a narrative line — because while it's both inspiring and intimidating, we have something in common: our birthday, July 23. Chandler is known for his novels, all featuring hard-boiled detective Philip Marlowe. Marlowe saw a city full of both beauty and betrayal, and to survive he followed his own moral code: He lied to cops, took beatings from bad guys and regularly got and/or rejected the most beautiful woman in the room. Chandler wrote with the bitterness of a brokenhearted romantic: tough yet ready to fall in love again. His prose was indelible. \\"It was a blonde. A blonde to make a bishop kick a hole in a stained glass window,\\" he wrote in 1940's \\"Farewell, My Lovely,\\" his second novel. Chandler's first novel, 1939's \\"The Big Sleep,\\" was made into the classic film noir starring he co-wrote the screenplay of James M. Cain's \\"Double Indemnity,\\" another film noir classic. While Chandler's other films are less well remembered, he was one of a handful of novelists who benefited from a Hollywood feedback loop: His books did well enough for to put him on staff for 1,250 a week, then his movies did well enough to help sell his books. All of this sounds like a pretty decent fate for a writer. I haven't written a book, although I'd like to. And that's one way in which sharing a birthday with Chandler is problematic. He was visionary in his characterizations, dead-on in his take on Los Angeles and wrote brilliant prose. What would it take to be that good? According to Hollywood legend, to finish the script for \\"The Blue Dahlia\\" on tight deadline — before star — Chandler went on a studio-supported bender at home, boozing and dictating to secretaries around the clock. Depending on whom you ask, this was either a brilliant gambit to soak the studio or a desperate act of risky self-destruction. Because Chandler had a difficult relationship with alcohol: He'd drunk so much of it, in fact, that he'd once gotten himself fired. That was in 1932, when he was an oil company executive, before he was a writer. Raymond Chandler, one of our most enduring modern writers, got a late start. When he published his first book, he was 50. Chandler was born July 23, 1888, in Chicago, son of an Irish mother and an American father who soon drifted off. He grew up in the Midwest and then England, dependent on the grudging generosity of his mother's family; after college, he briefly tried writing. He even wrote a handful of book reviews — hey, I write book reviews! — but found the prospects constraining and returned to America. During his passage he met the Lloyds, a wealthy Los Angeles couple; after stops in Nebraska and San Francisco, their friendship drew him to Los Angeles in 1913. With their help, he landed a bookkeeping job at Los Angeles Creamery that allowed him to take over the support of his mother, who joined him in L.A. But he was restless: At age 29 he decided to join the Canadian forces in World War I. After returning to L.A., Chandler got a job at the Dabney Oil Syndicate. It was 1920, and oil was at the fresh edge of a long and massive boom, allowing him to quickly rise to the rank of executive. He was quietly dating a friend of the Lloyds, Cissy Pascal, a former dancer and model. As Judith Freeman painstakingly documents in her 2007 biography \\"The Long Embrace: Raymond Chandler and the Woman He Loved,\\" he married Cissy in 1924, thinking she was eight years older than he; she was actually 18 years older, a fact he may never have discovered. Chandler the-author's-origin story begins in the cracks of his marriage, when as an oil executive his drinking went from congenial to remarked upon. There were girls, secretaries in the office. Weekends would be spent carousing, and Chandler started skipping work, sometimes not appearing at the office until Wednesday. In 1932, at the blistering midpoint of the Depression, the 44-year-old Chandler was fired. He was an unemployed, philandering drunk with zero prospects. And without that massive failure, Raymond Chandler would never have become a writer. If shared birthdays make us look for commonality, this is where that becomes problematic. Like Raymond Chandler, I mucked away my 20s, moved between apartments a lot, enjoy a good drink (not as much as Chandler, of course). But his fall was so drastic, so absolute. If he could look forward to generations of readers, would even Chandler have chosen it? Of course, he was no Faust, and had no promise of anything. He had only the wreckage of his life around him, and the need to become someone new. The legend is that he and Cissy, to whom he'd returned, were on a car trip up the coast, Chandler reading pulpy detective magazines. He decided he could, and would, write those stories. He was a little slow to make a living off the pulps, which didn't pay well, and he got a book deal with Alfred A. Knopf; he earned a decent reputation but sold moderately. He'd published four novels before his publisher allowed a lower-class paperback printing of his first, which to everyone's astonishment sold 300,000 copies. Chandler the successful writer was on his way. \\"The only salvation for a writer is to write,\\" he wrote in 1953's \\"The Long Goodbye.\\" This in one way is the eternal story of Los Angeles, the city of self-invention. But it is also strange and unique to Chandler. He was too old for this youthful city; he was too different, in his English tweeds and with his fragile wife. He was difficult: When they were working on \\"Double Indemnity,\\" he complained that Wilder adjusted the blinds in their office without first asking his permission. Chandler's path from failed ex-oilman to great writer is one that is almost impossible to fathom, nonetheless follow. Did Chandler's talent as a writer come from his mistakes, from his drunkenness and betrayals? Probably not. But it's hard to imagine Marlowe's particular blend of hardness and empathy, his weariness and his doomed morality, coming from a younger writer. And I for one find that heartening; I have a birthday coming up, after all. So does Chandler. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"The author ponders the connection they feel with Raymond Chandler, the iconic writer of hard-boiled detective novels, as they share the same birthday and similar struggles; examining the challenges, successes, and self-invention of Chandler's life, the author wonders if his fall laid the groundwork for his prominent writing career."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Using the advanced medical equipment on board his ship, Tetrax finds the DNA signature of the Omnitrix's creator, Azmuth, and tracks him to a prison facility called Incarcecon. During the journey, Tetrax hopes Ben would stop being a hero when the Omnitrix stop the countdown and Azmuth would shut it up for good. Ben is upset that he'll never be a hero again. After staging a breakout, they free a female Chimera Sui Generis (Vilgax's species) named Myaxx, who is Azmuth's assistant; she had switched her DNA signature for Azmuth's when he refused to give her credit for helping to create the Omnitrix. Myaxx is also unable to disarm the self-destruct, which will not only kill Ben, but most of the universe's inhabitants, including Earth itself, but Myaxx knows how to find Azmuth, and leads them to the planet he's hiding out on: Xenon. Vilgax, who has also picked up on the Omnitrix's self-destruct signal, picks up Sixsix (an alien who also appeared in 'Hunted' and tracks Ben).

It's the early evening and the last child has been picked up by her mother. Anne is relaxing on the playground carousel when someone pulls up on a motorcycle, wearing a black motorcycle helmet. She is startled as the stranger pulls out a kukri and starts spinning the carousel. The kukri is held up in the air and the terrified woman goes around until she's struck with it. Judd Austin (Leonard Mann) is the cop assigned to the case. He is called to the scene and when he gets there, he sees the girl decapitated, with her head in a bucket of water nearby. The distraught director of the center tells the officer that Anne worked there during the day and was attending night classes at Wendall College. At the hospital, Judd and his partner Taj (Joseph R. Sicari) discuss a similar case from the previous week; another girl was found decapitated and her head in a pond. They begin to question if there's any connection between the two murders. At Wendell, the administrator Miss Helene Griffin (Annette Miller) tells Judd that Anne was close to a girl named Kim Morrison (Elizabeth Barnitz). When asked if Anne had a boyfriend, Kim tells the officer that the murdered girl was indeed involved with someone but she doesn't know who it was. She assumes the man must have been married as he was depressed. Judd enters Professor Millett's anthropology class to speak with him about his murdered student in French.

Question: What had drinks that were served by girls? Context: In addition to the classical restaurants, Paris has several other kinds of traditional eating places. The café arrived in Paris in the 17th century, when the beverage was first brought from Turkey, and by the 18th century Parisian cafés were centres of the city's political and cultural life. The Cafe Procope on the Left Bank dates from this period. In the 20th century, the cafés of the Left Bank, especially Café de la Rotonde and Le Dôme Café in Montparnasse and Café de Flore and Les Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers. A bistro is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial atmosphere. Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied the city; \\"bistro\\" means \\"quickly\\" in Russian, and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners. A brasserie originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1867; it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage, particular German costumes for beer.

Es ist jedoch auffällig, dass weder der Rat der Europäischen Union noch die Europäische Kommission in der Vergangenheit gewillt waren, sich konkret zu diesem Punkt zu äußern. Dies kann verschiedene Gründe haben. Zum einen kann die Zurückhaltung auf politische Erwägungen zurückzuführen sein. In vielen Fällen sind die betroffenen Mitgliedstaaten und Institutionen darum bemüht, ihre Verhandlungspositionen und Interessen zu wahren, sodass eine konkrete Stellungnahme zu den verschiedenen Methoden des Artikels 287 möglicherweise als Schwäche interpretiert werden könnte. Zum anderen kann auch die Komplexität der verschiedenen Methoden dafür verantwortlich sein, dass sich die beteiligten Akteure nicht eindeutig positionieren wollen. Die im Artikel 287 festgelegten Verfahren beruhen oft auf dem Grundsatz der gegenseitigen Achtung und Zusammenarbeit, sodass es in bestimmten Situationen schwierig sein kann, einen Konsens darüber zu erzielen, welche Methode am besten angewendet wird. In vielen Fällen ist es daher wahrscheinlich, dass der Rat und die Kommission eine allgemeinere Haltung einnehmen, anstatt sich konkret auf verschiedene Methoden des Artikels 287 festzulegen. Dies könnte auch dazu beitragen, dass die beteiligten Mitgliedstaaten und Institutionen größeren Spielraum für Verhandlungen und diplomatische Lösungen haben.

However, we can attempt to analyze the particular sentence and draw some conclusions based on the given information. Here is the sentence in question: \\"As an engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and the elements which contributed to it.\\" From this sentence, it seems that the reviewer found the movie to be engrossing, which generally indicates a positive feeling. The term \\"engrossing\\" implies that the movie immerses and captures the attention of the viewer, reflecting an engaging and well-crafted story. This suggests that the film was effective in conveying the weight and importance of a significant historical event. Moreover, the sentence also emphasizes that the story illustrates the horrifying nature of the event and the contributing elements surrounding it. This showcases the film's effective storytelling that not only piques the viewers' interest but also educates them about the key causes and aspects related to the event. The detailed portrayal of the event and its associated elements in the movie likely helped create rich and comprehensive accounts that were both enlightening and captivating, as understood from the given sentence. Although the term \\"horrifying\\" signifies a negative aspect, it is referring to the historical event itself and not the movie's quality. In fact, it reveals the movie's ability to evoke strong emotions and successfully convey the gravity and horror of the event, leading the audience to better comprehend the reality and seriousness associated with it. Based on this sentence alone, it seems that the movie was seen positively by the reviewer. The use of words such as \\"engrossing\\" and the allusion to the film's comprehensive and evocative portrayal of a horrifying historical event suggests that the movie effectively accomplished its narrative and emotional goals.

This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the work whose core approaches a five-movement symphony with the chorale finale?, using the article: A composer may also respond to a text by expanding a choral symphony beyond the normal bounds of the symphonic genre. This is evident in the unusual orchestration and stage directions Berlioz prepared for his Roméo et Juliette. This piece is actually in seven movements, and calls for an intermission after the fourth movement – the \\"Queen Mab Scherzo\\" – to remove the harps from the stage and bring on the chorus of Capulets for the funeral march that follows. Berlioz biographer D. Kern Holoman observed that, \\"as Berlioz saw it, the work is simply Beethovenian in design, with the narrative elements overlain. Its core approaches a five-movement symphony with the choral finale and, as in the [Symphonie] Fantastique, both a scherzo and a march.... The 'extra' movements are thus the introduction with its potpourri of subsections and the descriptive tomb scene [at the end of the work].\\"Mahler expanded the Beethovenian model for programmatic as well as symphonic reasons in his Second Symphony, the \\"Resurrection\\", the vocal fourth movement, \\"Urlicht\\", bridging the childlike faith of the third movement with the ideological tension Mahler seeks to resolve in the finale. He then abandoned this pattern for his Third Symphony, as two movements for voices and orchestra follow three purely instrumental ones before the finale returns to instruments alone. Like Mahler, Havergal Brian expanded the Beethovenian model, but on a much larger scale and with far larger orchestral and choral forces, in his Symphony No. 1 \\"The Gothic\\". Written between 1919 and 1927, the symphony was inspired by Goethe's Faust and Gothic cathedral architecture. The Brian First is in two parts. The first consists of three instrumental movements; the second, also in three movements and over an hour in length, is a Latin setting of the Te Deum., what would be the answer ? A:","completion":"After reading the article, the answer to the question \\"What is the name of the work whose core approaches a five-movement symphony with the chorale finale?\\" is Roméo et Juliette by Berlioz.

Their manager prostitutes the beautiful Gong-gil to rich customers, and Jang-saeng sickens of this practice. After Gonggil kills the manager in defense of Jang-saeng, the pair flees to Seoul, where they form a new group with three other street performers.Together the group comes up with a skit mocking some members of the Royal Court, including the king and his new concubine Jang Noksu. After they are arrested for treason, Jang-saeng makes a deal with Choseon, who turns out to be one of the King's servants, to either make the king laugh at their skit or to be executed. They perform their skit for the king, but the three minor performers are too terrified to perform well. Gong-gil and Jang-saeng barely save themselves with one last joke at the king, who laughs and then makes them part of his Court. The King falls for the effeminate Gong-gil, whom he calls to his private chambers often to perform finger puppet shows. Jang-saeng becomes jealous of this relationship. Meanwhile, the King becomes more and more unstable. He makes the clowns perform a skit depicting how his mother, the favorite concubine of the former king, was forced to take poison after being betrayed by other jealous concubines. The King then slaughters these concubines at the end of the play. Jangs-aeng asks Gong-gil to leave with him and the gang at once before the King kills them too during one of his homicidal fits. Gong-gil, who initially sympathized with the King, begs the tyrant to give him his freedom but his pleas fall on deaf ears.The king's main concubine, Jang Noksu, becomes enraged by the attention the king has been lavishing on Gong-gil. The Counsel Members tries to have him killed during a hunting trip, resulting in the death of one of the members of the street performing team.

Summarize the following: Shyness doesn't necessarily equate to being introverted or not liking yourself. It simply means that for some reason you get embarrassed when the spotlight hits you. What's the root of your shyness? It's generally the symptom of a larger problem. Here are four possibilities: You have a weak self-image. This happens when we evaluate ourselves and that voice in our heads is negative. It's tough to stop listening to it, but at the end of the day it's your voice and you can tell it what to say. You have issues believing compliments given to you. Whether or not you think you look good, someone did, and that's why they told you so. You wouldn't call them a liar would you? Lift your chin, say \\"thank you\\" and accept it. Don't try to tell the person who paid you a compliment that they're wrong. You are preoccupied with how you come off. This happens when we focus too much on ourselves. Because we spend all day monitoring our actions and making sure we don't mess up, we assume everyone else is too. We'll talk about turning the focus on others if this sounds like you. You are labeled as shy by others. Sometimes, when we're little, we're shy. Unfortunately, people latch onto that and treat us as such, even when our personalities grow out of it. It's possible that others have lumped you into this category and you're trying to accommodate them. The good news? You only have to accommodate yourself.Whatever your reason, it's doable to get over it. They're all ways of thinking and thinking is the one thing you have control over. Yes! One of the first steps to overcome your shyness is try to accept your shyness and be comfortable with it. The more you will resist it unconsciously or consciously, longer it will prevail. If you are shy then accept it and embrace it totally. One way it could be done is by saying to yourself repeatedly 'Yes I am shy and I accept it'. Do you become shy in front of new audiences? When learning a new skill? When venturing into a new situation? When surrounded by people you know and admire? When you don't know anyone somewhere? Try to pinpoint the thoughts that go through your head right before the shyness hits. Odds are not all situations make you shy. You're okay being around your family, right? How are they that different than the strangers around you? They're not -- you just know them better and what's more, they know you. It's not you, it's just the situations you're in. This proves that it's not a global, 100% of-the-time thing. Excellent. Order them so that those things that cause you the least anxiety are first and those that cause you the most anxiety are last. When you put things in concrete terms, it feels like a task you can tackle and tackle successfully. Make them as concrete as possible. \\"Talking in front of people\\" may be a trigger, but you can get more specific. Talking in front of those who have more authority than you do? Talking to those you find attractive? The more specific you are, the easier it will be to identify the situation and work through it. Once you have a list of 10-15 stressful situations, start working through them, one-by-one (after you read the article, of course). The first few \\"easier\\" situations will help build your confidence so that you can continue moving to more difficult situations on your list. Don't worry if you have to go backwards on the list sometimes; take it at your own pace, but make an effort to push yourself.","completion":"The statement being summarized discusses the nature of shyness and its potential roots, ultimately providing advice on how to overcome this issue. According to the text, shyness doesn't necessarily imply introversion or a lack of self-appreciation. Instead, it means that one tends to feel uncomfortable when in the limelight. The root of such a trait could be traced back to a larger issue, with four likely possibilities explored. Firstly, a weak self-image could be the driving factor behind such shyness. It forms when we self-evaluate and are guided by a negative inner voice. Although challenging, it needs to be remembered that it's up to us to control this voice and determine its narrative. Secondly, difficulty accepting compliments could also contribute to the problem. Doubting the positive things people say about us may hinder self-confidence, hence, it's better to acknowledge such praises rather than challenge or disregard them. Thirdly, excessive self-consciousness, such as obsessing over our own actions and impressions, can induce shyness. The constant scrutiny of one's own actions could create a misperception that everyone else is doing the same, thus fueling anxiety. Finally, being labeled as shy by others might also play a role. We may get boxed into a category at a young age and continue to act in accordance with these labels into adulthood. However, this summary highlights the importance of acting true to oneself rather than conforming to others' expectations. As per the text provided, overcoming shyness is indeed achievable as it mainly deals with one's thinking patterns, and that's within our control. The first step is to acknowledge and embrace your shyness rather than resisting it. Following that, you should identify specific situations that trigger your shyness. This is crucial because not all circumstances make us shy – we usually feel comfortable around familiar people like family. Once you’ve identified these situations, arrange them in order of decreasing anxiety levels. This tasking approach will help to solve the issue effectively. The next step advocated in the document is to work through the list, tackling easier situations first to build confidence before moving onto challenging ones. And even if you must revisit previous issues, the key idea is to keep pushing forward at your own pace."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Charney declined to comment on the suit filed by Kimbra Lo in L.A. County Superior Court on Wednesday. The complaint marks the second suit filed this month accusing him of sexual assault. The complaint says Charney began sending Lo \\"sexual text messages\\" in July 2010, and that he called her and said \\"he was masturbating on the phone while they spoke.\\" According to the suit, Lo ignored his calls and messages until Charney offered her a modeling and photography job in December, inviting her to meet him in his home to discuss the position. After she arrived, Charney, wearing only a towel, \\"violently kissed her\\" and forced her to perform sexual acts, the suit alleges. Afterward, Lo's mother called Charney and told the company founder and majority owner to stay away from her daughter, \\"whereupon Charney begged forgiveness and admitted he had a problem,\\" according to the suit, which was first reported by the New York Times. Three other women filed the suit along with Lo, saying in the court document that American Apparel improperly forced them to sign confidential arbitration agreements with the company before they would be hired, and that the company had initiated arbitration proceedings with them, but details as to what dispute the arbitration matters were dealing with weren't made public. Earlier this month, former American Apparel employee Irene Morales sued Charney in New York state court, saying he had attempted to force her to perform oral sex on him in his New York apartment in 2008, when she was 18, and sexually harassed her for months, including demanding that she send him explicit photographs, e-mails and text messages. American Apparel has said in court papers that Morales sued \\"after making a number of extortion-like threats to expose the company to a threatened avalanche of litigation and negative publicity.\\" The company has asked the court to send her case to confidential arbitration. In recent years, Charney has been named a defendant in several sexual harassment suits, but none has gone to trial. American Apparel's board of directors has publicly stood behind him. The company has said in court papers that Charney seeks to foster a \\"sexually charged workplace\\" in an effort to stimulate creativity.

Question: Where did the new method for producing high-brightness blue LEDs come from? Context: In the late 1980s, key breakthroughs in GaN epitaxial growth and p-type doping ushered in the modern era of GaN-based optoelectronic devices. Building upon this foundation, Dr. Moustakas at Boston University patented a method for producing high-brightness blue LEDs using a new two-step process. Two years later, in 1993, high-brightness blue LEDs were demonstrated again by Shuji Nakamura of Nichia Corporation using a gallium nitride growth process similar to Dr. Moustakas's. Both Dr. Moustakas and Mr. Nakamura were issued separate patents, which confused the issue of who was the original inventor (partly because although Dr. Moustakas invented his first, Dr. Nakamura filed first).[citation needed] This new development revolutionized LED lighting, making high-power blue light sources practical, leading to the development of technologies like BlueRay, as well as allowing the bright high resolution screens of modern tablets and phones.[citation needed] Answer:","completion":"The new method for producing high-brightness blue LEDs came from Dr. Moustakas at Boston University who patented a method using a new two-step process.

Which one of the following options would the answer to this be?","completion":"A: A caul is a thin, filmy membrane that covers or partially covers a newborn baby's head and face when it is born. This membranous layer is part of the amniotic sac, which is responsible for protecting and cushioning the fetus during pregnancy. A caul is relatively rare and occurs in about 1 in every 80,000 births. It is sometimes referred to as a \\"veil\\" in various cultural and historical contexts. There are two types of cauls: the \\"en-caul\\" and the \\"veil\\". The en-caul, or the entirely enclosed caul, occurs when the baby is born with a significant part of the amniotic sac still intact, fully enveloping the newborn's body. This type of caul is largely associated with premature births. On the other hand, a veil is when the membrane simply covers the baby's head and face, but not the entire body. In some cases, a small piece of the membrane covering a baby's face can lead to breathing issues, but it can be easily remedied after birth. Throughout history and across various cultures, the caul has held different beliefs and superstitions. In some instances, it was thought that the occurrence of a caul indicated good fortune and that the child would possess special gifts or grow to be extraordinarily lucky. In medieval times, it was believed that a child born in caul would never drown. Consequently, such membranes were considered to be valuable talismans by sailors who sought to secure themselves against water dangers. Cauls were sometimes preserved as tokens of protection or good luck, and in certain cultures, they were sold for their perceived supernatural abilities. For example, in the book \\"Great Expectations\\" by Charles Dickens, a caul was auctioned off within the story and treated as a prized possession. While the caul holds no medical significance, it remains a fascinating curiosity that is still the subject of folklore, literature, and different cultural beliefs. The phenomenon's rarity contributes to its enduring intrigue and mythological associations across societies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Now, at Hamilton Central School in New York, even little kids like you, around 6 years old, are trying to stay healthy and not get sick. They are bringing things like hand sanitizer, tissues, and water bottles to school with them. Hand sanitizer is like magic soap that helps get rid of germs on your hands, and tissues help you blow your nose when you're sick. Water bottles help them drink more water and stay healthy. Sometimes, the school might decide to send kids home if too many of them get sick. Ms. Jessica Poyer, who teaches first grade at this school, is worried about the swine flu because she wants to keep her students and her own kids healthy and safe. But she also doesn't want all the kids to miss school. Sometimes, even if a child is sick, their parents still send them to school, but this can make other kids sick too. That's why it's important to stay home when you're feeling sick, so you don't spread germs to your friends."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Background: Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse (; 15 October 1881 - 14 February 1975) was an English author and one of the most widely read humorists of the 20th century. Born in Guildford, the son of a British magistrate based in Hong Kong, Wodehouse spent happy teenage years at Dulwich College, to which he remained devoted all his life. After leaving school, he was employed by a bank but disliked the work and turned to writing in his spare time. Context: There had been films of Wodehouse stories since 1915, when A Gentleman of Leisure was based on his 1910 novel of the same name. Further screen adaptations of his books were made between then and 1927, but it was not until 1929 that Wodehouse went to Hollywood where Bolton was working as a highly paid writer for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). Ethel was taken with both the financial and social aspects of Hollywood life, and she negotiated a contract with MGM on her husband's behalf under which he would be paid 2,000 a week. This large salary was particularly welcome because the couple had lost considerable sums in the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The contract started in May 1930, but the studio found little for Wodehouse to do, and he had spare time to write a novel and nine short stories. He commented, \\"It's odd how soon one comes to look on every minute as wasted that is given to earning one's salary.\\" Even when the studio found a project for him to work on, the interventions of committees and constant rewriting by numerous contract authors meant that his ideas were rarely used. In a 2005 study of Wodehouse in Hollywood, Brian Taves writes that Those Three French Girls (1930) was \\"as close to a success as Wodehouse was to have at MGM. His only other credits were minimal, and the other projects he worked on were not produced.\\" Wodehouse's contract ended after a year and was not renewed. At MGM's request, he gave an interview to The Los Angeles Times. Wodehouse was described by Herbert Warren Wind as \\"politically naive [and] fundamentally unworldly,\\" and he caused a sensation by saying publicly what he had already told his friends privately about Hollywood's inefficiency, arbitrary decision-making, and waste of expensive talent. The interview was reprinted in The New York Times, and there was much editorial comment about the state of the film industry. Many writers have considered that the interview precipitated a radical overhaul of the studio system, but Taves believes it to have been \\"a storm in a teacup\\", and Donaldson comments that, in the straitened post-crash era, the reforms would have been inevitable. Wind's view of Wodehouse's naivete is not universally held. Some biographers suggest that his unworldliness was only part of a complex character, and that in some respects he was highly astute. He was unsparing of the studio owners in his early-1930s short stories set in Hollywood, which contain what Taves considers Wodehouse's sharpest and most biting satire. Question: Did Hollywood get upset about what he said Answer:","completion":"Yes, Hollywood was indeed upset about the remarks made by Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse (P.G. Wodehouse). His public declaration of Hollywood's inefficiencies, arbitrary decision-making process, and what he perceived as wasteful use of expensive talent was not taken lightly by the movie industry. Wodehouse's comments were shared widely after he gave an interview to The Los Angeles Times, in which he openly criticized the Hollywood system and the way things operated there. His remarks were so impactful that they were later reprinted in The New York Times, drawing significant attention and causing quite a stir in the film industry. There was ample editorial commentary that followed, discussing and debating the state of the film industry based on Wodehouse's observations. This response indicates the kind of disruption and unrest his comments stirred among Hollywood's top brass and within the industry in general. However, some writers and researchers consider the entire episode as just \\"a storm in a teacup\\", suggesting that the effect and influence of Wodehouse's critiques may have been exaggerated. Brian Taves and Francis Donaldson, for instance, think that the change in the studio system had been inevitable due to the economic challenges faced post the Wall Street Crash of 1929, and Wodehouse's comments just served as a catalyst or an excuse to revamp the system. Nevertheless, Wodehouse's remarks didn't play well with the studio owners and those in high places in Hollywood. Wodehouse was known for his biting satire and was unyielding in his criticism, as seen in his early-1930s short stories which contained scathing remarks about Hollywood. Therefore, it can be assumed that his public critique probably didn't endear him to the film industry, reinforcing the idea that what he said caused significant offense and displeasure among Hollywood's elite. His contract with the studio ended after a year and was not renewed, which could be seen as the studios' indirect reaction to his critiques."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: One day in 1924, five men who were camping in the Cascade Mountains saw a group of huge apelike creatures coming out of the woods. They hurried back to their wooden house and locked themselves inside. While they were in, the creatures threw rocks against the house. Several hours later these strange hairy giants went back into the woods. After the men returned to the town and told the people about their adventure, _ . These were the people who remembered hearing tales about footprints of an animal that walked like a human being. The five men, however, were not the first to have seen these creatures called Bigfoot. Long before their experience, the local Native Americans were certain that a group of apelike animals had been living in the _ mountain for centuries. In 1958, some workers, who were building a road through the jungles of Northern California, often found huge footprints in the earth around their camp. Then in 1967, Roger Patterson, a man who was interested in finding Bigfoot, went into the same jungles with a friend. While riding, they were suddenly thrown off from their horses. Patterson saw a tall apelike animal standing not far away. He managed to take photos of the hairy creature before it disappeared in the jungles. When Patterson's photos were shown to the public, not many people believed his story. Richard Brown, an experienced hunter, discovered a similar creature. He saw the animal clearly through the telescopic lens of his rifle . He said the creature looked more like a human being than an animal. Later many other people also found deep footprints in the same area. In spite of regular reports of sightings and footprints, most experts still do not believe that Bigfoot really exists .

The outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party’s conservative and moderate wings. The compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide 25 billion in funding for Trump’s much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Republicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Party leaders, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have lobbied lawmakers this week in hopes of securing their support for the legislation. “We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,” Ryan said Wednesday before Trump announced he would sign an executive order to end breaking up families. The president’s policy retreat followed a withering attack by Republican and Democratic officials who characterized the family separations as inhumane. The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited. “It’s about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,” Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota.

First, we are going to subtract 1985 from both sides of the equation to get rid of it on the right side. It's like when you have 5 apples and I take away 2, you are left with 3, right? So, 4929 minus 1985 is 2944. So, our equation now looks like this: 2944 = 92*p. Now the next part is a little like sharing candies. Imagine you have 92 candies and you want to share them equally among some friends, but you don't know how many friends (that's our p). And you know that when you shared all the candies, they turned out to be 2944 candies in total. To find out the number of friends (p), we will divide the total number of candies (2944) by the number of candies each friend got (92). When you do this division, 2944 divided by 92, you get 32. So, P is 32. This means if you had 32 friends, and you gave each friend 92 candies, you would give out a total of 2944 candies!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Ranveer Singh Bhavnani (born 6 July 1985) is an Indian actor who appears in Hindi films. He is the recipient of several awards, including two Filmfare Awards, and is among the highest-paid actors in the country. After completing a bachelor's degree from Indiana University Bloomington, Singh returned to India to pursue his career in films. He made his acting debut in 2010 with a leading role in Yash Raj Films' romantic comedy Band Baaja Baaraat. In January 2010, Singh was called for an audition by Shanoo Sharma, the head of the casting division for Yash Raj Films. They informed him that it was for a lead role in their film titled Band Baaja Baaraat, a romantic comedy set in the world of wedding planning. Aditya Chopra, the vice president of the company, later saw the audition tapes on video and was impressed by Singh's acting, and decided that he fit the part of Bittoo Sharma, the hero of the film. However, the director Maneesh Sharma needed some more convincing and he was called for a few more auditions over the next two weeks until they were completely convinced of his caliber. After the two weeks of testing, Singh was confirmed for the role of Bittoo, with Anushka Sharma playing the female lead. Singh described the role of Bittoo Sharma as a typical Delhi boy. To prepare for the role, he spent time with students at the Delhi University campus. Prior to the release of the film, trade analysts were skeptical of the film's commercial potential, citing the middling response to Yash Raj Films' last few productions, the lack of a male star and the fact that the female lead, Anushka Sharma, was by then an \\"almost-forgotten\\" actress. However, Band Baaja Baaraat went on to become a sleeper hit. Singh's portrayal of Bittoo was praised, with Anupama Chopra of NDTV writing that Singh was \\"pitch perfect in the role of the uncouth but good-hearted small town slacker who is a bit of a duffer when it comes to matters of the heart.\\" The film earned approximately Rs214 million (US3.3 million) at the domestic box office. At the 56th Filmfare Awards, Singh won the award for Best Male Debut. Following Band Baaja Baarat, Singh signed on for Ladies vs Ricky Bahl, a romantic comedy produced by Chopra and directed by Maneesh Sharma. He played a conman Ricky Bahl who cons girls for a living but finally meets his match. The film co-starred Anushka Sharma, Parineeti Chopra, Dipannita Sharma and Aditi Sharma. According to Singh, the title character had various avatars in the film, including a chirpy, entertaining side and a sinister side. Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India wrote, \\"Ranveer is, well Ranveer: your average Joe kind of hero who looks convincing enough as Sunny, Deven, Iqbal, Ricky, his sundry avatars.\\" Commercially, Ladies vs Ricky Bahl earned Rs370 million (US5.7 million) domestically.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What did he give him","completion":"Unfortunately, you did not provide an article for me to reference and quote.

This data could be organized into different categories or fields in a structured database such as SQL. Let's look at each piece of data and its possible categorization in detail: 1. Entity Type: The sentence provides information about different geographical entities. These could be classified as \\"Country\\", \\"State\\", and \\"City\\". - Country: \\"US\\" We could store this to the 'Country' field in our database. It is useful for identifying the global location of the place. - State: \\"Indiana\\" This piece of information could be stored in the 'State' field of a database. This information narrows down the specific area within the country where the named city is found. - City: \\"Attica\\" This fits into the 'City' field of our database and can give a more precise location within the state. - County: \\"Fountain County\\" This information could help further refine the location and could be stored in a 'County' field. 2. Relationship Data: \\"Attica is part of Fountain County, Indiana, US.\\" The phrase indicates a hierarchical or geographical relationship among the entities named. A 'Relationship' field could capture this information as: - City-County relationship: \\"Attica is part of Fountain County\\" - County-State relationship: \\"Fountain County is in Indiana\\" - State-Country relationship: \\"Indiana is in the US\\" 3. Contextual Data: This sentence doesn't openly provide any additional context outside of geographic information, such as population data or historical significance. If this context were provided, it may also be categorized for a more enriched database. In summary, the sentence provides structured data about geographical entities, namely a city (Attica), a county (Fountain County), a state (Indiana), and a country (US). This data can be stored in database fields in a structured format, including information about their relationships. A well-structured database could then use this data to provide rich geographic mapping, data analysis, or information look-up services."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. What is the relationship between 'bavaria' and 'parliamentary republic'? A:","completion":"Bavaria, as a federal state of Germany, is part of the larger Federal Republic of Germany, which is a parliamentary republic. The relationship between Bavaria and a parliamentary republic lies in the fact that Bavaria is governed within the political framework of the parliamentary republic system of Germany. In a parliamentary system, like the one in Germany, the executive branch derives its legitimacy from and is accountable to the legislature, also known as the parliament. Germany has a clear differentiation between the head of government (Chancellor) and the head of state (President), with the head of government holding real power. Bavaria, being one of the 16 constituent states in Germany, follows a similar structure at the state level. It has its own parliament called the Landtag of Bavaria, along with a Minister President who serves as the head of government in the state. The Minister President is elected by the members of the Bavarian parliament and is responsible for executing state law and representing the state within Germany's federal political system. In summary, the relationship between 'Bavaria' and 'parliamentary republic' is that Bavaria is a federal state within the Federal Republic of Germany, which is a parliamentary republic, and Bavaria itself is governed within this parliamentary framework at the state level with its own elected representatives and head of government."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: If your friend has been saying or doing concerning things, let them know that you’ve noticed and that you’re worried about them. Avoid getting upset or emotional when you do this as it may cause them to feel worse. Just tell your friend what you are concerned about in a straightforward manner. For example, you might say something like, “John, I’ve noticed that you stopped coming to game nights and that you are spending most of your time alone. I’m worried about you.” Some examples of concerning behavior may include withdrawing, acting sad, self-harming, using drugs, gambling, or having unsafe sex. It’s important not to put too much pressure on your friend to talk, but letting them know that you’re there for them if they need you can help to reassure them. Offer to help them in any way that you can. Try saying something like, “I’m here for you if you ever want to talk,” or, “Let me know if there’s anything I can do to help.” to your friend if they want to talk with you. Give your friend your undivided attention if they want to talk, such as by putting away your phone and shutting off the TV or your computer. Face them and make eye contact with them. While your friend is talking, pay close attention to what they say and nod to show you are hearing them. You can also rephrase what they say now and then to show you’re paying attention. For example, you might say something like, “It sounds like you’re saying that you haven’t felt happy in a while. Is that right?” with your friend to gain insight into what they’re feeling. Empathy is a way of understanding other people’s feelings by putting yourself into their shoes. Try to imagine how you’d feel if you were going through what your friend has experienced or described. You might feel sad, angry, confused, lonely, or all of these things at once. Be sensitive to your friend’s emotions as you listen and respond to them. For example, if your friend shares with you that they have been feeling depressed since the death of a family pet, imagine how you might feel if your pet died. If you have had an experience that is similar to your friend’s experience, sharing it with them might help them to feel better. However, make sure to share the story in a shortened version so you don’t end up turning the spotlight onto yourself. Remember that the point of sharing the story is to help your friend feel validated and less alone in their experience. For example, if your friend shares with you that they are having trouble with schoolwork and worried about failing, you might say something like, “I struggled a lot with math last year and I thought I was going to fail. I had to get tutoring after school a few days per week for a while.” Or, if a friend shares with you that they’re feeling depressed and don’t know what to do about it, you might say, “I felt really lost, too, when I went through a depressive episode a couple of years ago. I don’t know if it would help you, but therapy really helped me.” Unsolicited advice is not usually received well, so it’s best to avoid advising your friend about what they should do. Instead, focus on listening to them and only offer advice if they directly ask you for it. And if you do make a suggestion, make sure to maintain a non-judgmental and somewhat uncertain tone. For example, if your friend asks what they should do about a conflict with another friend, you might say something like, “I don’t know if this will help you, but I usually find it’s best to talk to someone when I’m having an issue with them.” Summary:","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of being aware of concerning behavior in friends and how to address it effectively. It suggests calmly pointing out the noticed behavior without getting emotional, and offering support by letting the friend know you are there for them without putting pressure on them to talk. It's crucial to give undivided attention and practice active listening by rephrasing what they've said and showing empathy for their experience. Sharing a related personal experience can help validate the friend's feelings and make them feel less alone. It's best to avoid unsolicited advice and only offer it if asked, while maintaining a non-judgmental and uncertain tone. Overall, the focus should be on understanding and supporting the friend's emotions and needs."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

A topiary is a tree or bush that is trained into a shape. Growing a topiary garden takes both time and skills. A topiary gardener should make a drawing first. The drawing shows the final shape that the gardener likes. The gardener then chooses a bush for the topiary. It may be one that just planted or one that is already in place. In June of the plant's first year, the gardener looks for new leaves. When the leaves grow, it's time to shape the bottom of the bush. It needs about five years. The top is not _ during this time. In the fifth year, the bush grows tall enough for shaping. Then the gardener begins to shape the whole bush. Once a topiary has been started, it needs care all year. In the summer it must be cut many times to keep its shape. This cutting also helps the bush grow. In the winter the bushes don't grow. The gardeners have to brush snow off the plants, or snow may hurt some parts of them. Topiary gardening is a very old art. The Romans did it in the first century. In the sixteenth century, people in Europe liked topiaries too. By the late 1600s, topiaries were also grown in America. Today it's popular in many parts of the world. Question: The topiary gardening first began _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"in Rome\\"? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the answer \\"in Rome\\" is correct. Topiary gardening first began in ancient Rome during the first century. It was a popular art form that was later adopted by Europeans in the sixteenth century and eventually made its way to America by the late 1600s. Today, topiary gardening remains popular in many parts of the world. The process of creating topiaries involves the careful shaping and pruning of trees or bushes to achieve intricate and visually appealing forms, often resembling animals or other recognizable shapes. Topiary gardening requires a significant amount of time, patience, and skill to master. A gardener must first create a detailed drawing of the desired final shape, then choose an appropriate plant for the topiary. The shaping process typically begins in the plant's first year and continues for about five years, starting from the bottom of the bush and gradually moving upward. Throughout the seasons, topiaries require constant maintenance and care. During the summer months, the plants must be pruned and cut frequently to maintain their shape and encourage healthy growth. In the winter, gardeners should take care to remove snow from the topiaries to prevent damage to the plants. Overall, topiary gardening is a timeless art form that originated in Rome and continues to captivate people worldwide. Its unique combination of horticultural technique and artistic expression makes it a rewarding and fulfilling endeavor for skilled gardeners and a visual treat for all who encounter these living sculptures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For instance, it could be referring to a season of a particular sport like basketball or ice hockey in some countries. Moreover, this time frame might represent a specific period of tourism in a region, a seasonal migration of species, or even an academic year.

The sporf is no innovation; back in 1940 the \\"sporf\\" was born. It took me until 2015 to notice this one thanks to its rather pleasant design. The sporf is a little like most strategy documents that I come across. It is one implement designed to serve a multitude of goals, but with one fatal flaw: you can only ever use one part of the sporf / strategy at any one time. With the sporf, things would get messy trying to use the spoon and knife and the same time. The knife and fork work quite well in sequence but physics prevents me using both at the same time as I can with the older technologies of knife and fork.

Sportsmail brings you more…. Where did he come from? Ayoze Perez celebrates scoring the winner for Newcastle against Tottenham on his first start for the club. Newcastle moved quickly to beat off interest from a host of Spanish clubs and signed the 21-year-old from Tenerife for £1.5m in June. Why was there so much interest? Well, 16 goals in Spain’s second tier alerted the Magpies and many others but the player preferred to test himself in the Premier League. He left White Hart Lane and headed straight back to his homeland for an awards ceremony, where he is up for the best breakthrough player prize for last season. He has also now broken into Spain’s Under-21 side. How has he done at Newcastle? After seven substitute appearances he had yet to break his duck before his headed winner at Spurs. He did, however, score a sublime solo effort for the Under-21s, weaving his way between four defenders before slotting home. Striker Perez, 21, signed in June from Spanish club Tenerife, scoring 16 goals in the Spanish second tier. And that won him a start? Not really, although it did put him to the front of the queue should Papiss Cisse have got injured. And that is exactly what happened, the Senegal striker failing a fitness test just two hours before the game. Alan Pardew must have been delighted with him? He was, and here’s what he said: ‘He’s a really great individual talent. He hasn’t quite got the strength and power that you associate with the Premier League but that will come to him. He has worked really, really hard. The players love him so they were really made up that he scored the winner.’ Does he speak any English then? Sportsmail tried to grab a few words with him outside of the ground, and this is what we got. ‘I am very happy. I hope I can play good for Newcastle and score many goals.’ The Toon Army will certainly be hoping he is good to his word. Highlights:","completion":"1.

Question: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him. Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump...

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who died of consumption? from the following article ? Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and Françoise-Clémence, née Collin. Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice, always considered himself a true Parisian. Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption on the first anniversary of his marriage. The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil, 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris. When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano. His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty, a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training. Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, \\"It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart.\\" The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel, in a programme that included Mozart's Piano Concerto in B♭ (K450), and Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto. Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher...

What is the missing first step of the following process: - Preheat the oven to desired baking temperature - Grease your preferred cake pan with crisco or butter or other non-stick spray - Add eggs and vegetable oil to the dry ingredients - Stir or whisk until all the dry flour has been absorbed - Pour the batter into the greased cake pan - Place cake pan into the oven for the required time - When a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean, the cake is done baking - The answer to this question is:","completion":"The first step missing in the provided process is the preparation of the dry ingredients, specifically the cake batter mix. This is crucial because the quality of your cake largely depends on how well you mix your dry ingredients before adding any form of liquid to it. In baking a cake, the dry ingredients typically include flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt, sometimes combined with spices, cocoa powder, or other flavoring agents depending on the type of cake you're baking. In many recipes, these ingredients need to be thoroughly mixed to leave no lumps and achieve a smooth texture. This step often takes place after you have preheated the oven and greased the cake pan, but before you add the eggs and vegetable oil. So, the first step missing in this case is: \\"In a large bowl, combine your dry ingredients. This usually includes flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Depending on the type of cake you're baking, you may also add specific flavorings or spices at this stage. Use a whisk or a spoon to mix these ingredients together until they’re fully combined and free of any lumps.\\" This step is important because it ensures that all of the ingredients distribute evenly throughout the batter. This contributes to the cake rising evenly, having uniform texture, and being flavored consistently throughout. Furthermore, mixing the dry ingredients separately helps prevent over-mixing once the wet ingredients are added, which can result in a tougher cake. This initial step is also an opportunity for bakers to maximize flavor infusion into the dough or batter. For example, if you're producing a spice cake, the various spices would be added in this step, allowing the spice flavors to evenly distribute throughout the entire cake batter. So, the process with the missing first step would be: 1. In a large bowl, combine your dry ingredients: flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt, along with any desired spices or flavors. Mix these together until they are fully combined and free from lumps. 2. Preheat the oven to the desired baking temperature. 3. Grease your preferred cake pan with Crisco, butter, or another non-stick spray. 4. Add eggs and vegetable oil to the dry ingredients. 5. Stir or whisk until all the dry flour has been absorbed. 6.

Question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: Why might someone have a hard time seeing through a clear medium? Possible A: obscure, see-through, opaque, thick, misunderstood Why is \\"thick\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Thick\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it refers to the density or amount of a material present in a medium, making it difficult for light to pass through. When a clear medium is thick, the greater amount of molecules in it can result in more scattering, absorption or reflection of light, causing it to be harder to see through. In some cases, it might also refer to the thickness of an object, like a glass window, which can distort or obscure the view through it. For example, if you have two glass panels of different thicknesses, the thicker one might be harder to see through due to the distortion and bending of light as it passes through the denser material. Similarly, if you have a thick layer of water or a transparent gel, the denser medium might make it difficult for light to pass through clearly, making it harder for someone to see through. So, \\"thick\\" serves as an answer that addresses the physical properties of a clear medium, which can impact its transparency and the ability for someone to see through it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: No. 20 Lady Vols need to regroup quickly after stunning loss or risk falling out of Top 25 In Tennessee's first season without Pat Summitt, the Lady Vols soon could drop out of the Top 25 for the first time in over a quarter-century. The No. 20 Lady Vols began the post-Summitt era Friday with a stunning 80-71 loss at Chattanooga. Now they don't have much time to recover from their first season-opening loss since 1999, as they continue their road trip Sunday at No. 22 Georgia Tech. A loss to the Yellow Jackets likely would drop the Lady Vols out of the Top 25 for the first time since February 1985. \\"That's just the nature of this game and the nature of our schedule,\\" said Tennessee coach Holly Warlick, who stumbled out of the gate in her head coaching debut after spending the last 27 seasons as an assistant on Summitt's staff. \\"It's extremely hard. With five new players, it is what it is. There's nothing we can do about it. We've got to roll up our sleeves and get back to work.\\" Summitt, who announced last year she had early-onset dementia, stepped down in April after collecting 1,098 wins, eight national titles and 18 Final Four appearances in 38 seasons. Summitt remains on staff as head coach emeritus, attends most of the Lady Vols' practice and watched Friday's game from the stands. The transition figured to cause some growing pains. Tennessee's No. 20 preseason ranking was its lowest position in the Top 25 since 1985. The Lady Vols don't return a single player who started an NCAA tournament game last season during their run to a regional final. Their roster includes five newcomers - four freshmen and a junior-college transfer. But nobody expected this kind of start. Tennessee committed 26 turnovers and had only six assists against Chattanooga. The Lady Vols had 17 turnovers in the first half alone. They never led in the second half and never cut Chattanooga's advantage below six points over the last 13 minutes. \\"We have to learn from this,\\" said Tennessee junior guard Meighan Simmons, one of only three upperclassmen on the roster. The biggest lessons came when Tennessee was on defense. Tennessee spent the preseason adjusting to an uptempo style designed to utilize Tennessee's speed and compensate for its relative lack of size. The Lady Vols believed their energy would harass opposing offenses and force turnovers. \\"We're not going to outscore anybody,\\" Warlick said. \\"We're not going to outshoot them. We've got to get them to turn the ball over to get easy looks.\\" While Tennessee struggled to take care of the ball all night, Chattanooga collected 17 assists and committed only 13 turnovers. The Lady Mocs scored 52 points and shot 56.3 percent from the floor in the second half. \\"Our defense was non-existent,\\" Warlick said. That defense will have to play much better for the Lady Vols to avoid their first 0-2 start since 1970. Georgia Tech went 26-8 and reached a regional semifinal last year and should get an emotional lift Sunday from playing the first women's game at the new McCamish Pavilion. The Yellow Jackets had to play their home games off campus last season. \\"As long as we learn from this, it's OK,\\" Warlick said. \\"If we keep making the same mistakes, we're not going to get any better.\\" There's one history lesson that could encourage Tennessee. When the Lady Vols last dropped a season opener back in 1999, they lost only three more times the rest of the season and went on to reach the NCAA final. Summary:","completion":"In their first season without Pat Summitt, the No. 20 Lady Vols are at risk of dropping out of the Top 25 after a shocking 80-71 loss to Chattanooga. With little time to recover and their next game against No. 22 Georgia Tech, a loss could see them fall from the rankings for the first time since 1985. Amidst a transition and a roster with five newcomers, the team is experiencing growing pains, which were evident as they committed 26 turnovers and displayed weak defense. Coach Holly Warlick remains optimistic, stating that if they learn from their mistakes, they can improve."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Question: Where could you find out more about a type of lizard?

In the notes of one his students for a 1927 class, Whitehead was quoted as saying: \\"Every scientific man in order to preserve his reputation has to say he dislikes metaphysics. What he means is he dislikes having his metaphysics criticized.\\" In Whitehead's view, scientists and philosophers make metaphysical assumptions about how the universe works all the time, but such assumptions are not easily seen precisely because they remain unexamined and unquestioned. While Whitehead acknowledged that \\"philosophers can never hope finally to formulate these metaphysical first principles,\\" he argued that people need to continually re-imagine their basic assumptions about how the universe works if philosophy and science are to make any real progress, even if that progress remains permanently asymptotic. For this reason Whitehead regarded metaphysical investigations as essential to both good science and good philosophy.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What are the last names of the people who discover Elspeth is lonely? Theodore Honey, an eccentric \\"boffin\\" with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, is working on solving a difficult aviation crash problem. A widower with a 12-year-old daughter, Elspeth, Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada. He theorizes the accident happened because of the tailplane's structural failure, caused by sudden metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. To test the theory in his laboratory, a rear airframe is being vibrated at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles. It is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure. Despite the fact that his theory is not yet proven, he decides to warn the aircrew and Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale, a fellow passenger. After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly and seriously damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory and save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press. Teasdale and an airline stewardess Marjorie Corder both take a liking to Mr. Honey and Elspeth, who they discover is lonely and isolated from her schoolmates. Teasdale speaks to Honey's superiors on his behalf, claiming she believes in him. Corder, meanwhile, has stayed on with Honey and his daughter as a nurse. Having now observed Honey's many qualities beyond his minor eccentricities, and after becoming very close to Elspeth, she decides to make the arrangement permanent by marrying the engineer.

Answer the following question: We all present these glossy lives to the world; coffee cups presented to dewy sunrises, champagne in airport lounges, luxurious restaurants that cost more than they should and share the blue skies days of exploration. I’m as guilty as anyone. But, what about behind those scenes? Those days where the wind is so strong you can’t instastory for talking (I’m looking at you Cornwall), when travel mistakes happen (like in Vienna where I accidentally booked our trip a day short) or when everyone asks you what your next trip will be and you sheepishly have to answer ‘er, not sure’. So I thought I’d get a few things off my chest, and confess a few of the reasons why I probably shouldn’t be calling myself a travel blogger. And yes, these are all very much first world problems. 1. I hate photographs of myself. Ironic, no? Especially when one of the first rules of blogging is all about the cult of personality. I just don’t like them. I wish I did, but there are few times that I fancy a photo and even less when I like the result. 2. We nip into a MacDonalds at least once every trip. It has now become a tradition between nicer restaurants to nip in and order a Big Mac and fries at some point of our trip – but especially in Europe for some reason. Why do their MacDonalds meals taste better? 3. Pastels aren’t really my shade. Again, I wish I could be super girly, twirling in gossamer skirts painted in spring shades but I’m just not. My colour palette is decidedly autumnal/jewel hued and usually sticks to a scarf draped around my neck in a hopefully fashionable manner. And I’m totally ok with that. 4. I once travelled all the way to New Zealand and back (stopping in 3 countries enroute) without a lens cap on my brand new, fairly expensive camera. This is in no way a #humblebrag about the trip, but a comment on how impractical I can be – and how careful I also am.

Despite its low budget and seemingly outlandish premise, the film delivers an engaging and surprisingly heartwarming experience. The movie is set in the mysterious depths of the swamp, home to an unlikely band of creatures who find themselves unwittingly united against a common threat. The team of swamp dwellers consists of a humanoid alligator, a sassy talking frog, a lovable swamp monster, and a wise-cracking, insect-eating plant. Director Archie Reynolds skillfully combines elements of horror, comedy, and friendship to create a one-of-a-kind film that will have you rooting for our unlikely heroes. One aspect of the movie that stands out is the practical effects and attention to detail. Reynold's team has shown that even with a limited budget, creative design and use of modest resources can bring to life a unique world with compelling characters. You can't help but applaud the creativity and craftsmanship of the team behind Swamp Creatures Unite! Another strength lies in the character development throughout the film. While our four main creatures may seem like stereotypical monsters at first glance, Reynolds has packed each character with depth and backstory that unfolds as they venture through various obstacles in the swamp. The audience is drawn into the struggles of these characters and becomes invested in their journey, cheering them on in their humorous and unpredictable battle against their foes. The film also boasts an unexpected original score that brings attention to its cinematic quality. Composer Belle Anderson blends classical and electronic sounds perfectly, giving ear-pleasing melodies that support the narrative. The score adds a unique layer of charm from start to finish. While Swamp Creatures Unite! might not possess the blockbuster feel of a mainstream Hollywood film, it certainly delivers on entertainment. Fans of cult classics and offbeat cinema will find themselves enamoured with this quirky story of friendship, adventure, and, most importantly, heart. A must-watch for anyone seeking a refreshing cinematic experience, Swamp Creatures Unite! leaves viewers yearning for more tales from the depths of the swamp."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hippolytus of Rome (170 - 235 AD) was one of the most important 3rd-century theologians in the Christian Church in Rome, where he was probably born. Photios I of Constantinople describes him in his Bibliotheca (cod. 121) as a disciple of Irenaeus, who was said to be a disciple of Polycarp, and from the context of this passage it is supposed that he suggested that Hippolytus so styled himself. However, this assertion is doubtful. The facts of his life as well as his writing were soon forgotten in the West, perhaps by reason of his criticism of the bishops of Rome and because he wrote in Greek. Pope Damasus I dedicated to him one of his famous epigrams, making him, however, a priest of the Novatianist schism, a view later accepted by Prudentius in the 5th century in his \\"Passion of St Hippolytus\\". In the Passionals of the 7th and 8th centuries he is represented as a soldier converted by Saint Lawrence, a legend that long survived in the Roman Breviary. He was also confused with a martyr of the same name who was buried in Portus, of which city he was believed to have been a bishop, who was put to death by drowning in a deep well. According to Prudentius' account, Hippolytus was dragged to death by wild horses, a striking parallel to the story of the mythological Hippolytus, who was dragged to death by wild horses at Athens. He described the subterranean tomb of the saint and states that he saw there a picture representing Hippolytus' execution. He also confirms August 13 as the date on which a Hippolytus was celebrated but this again refers to the convert of Lawrence, as preserved in the Menaion of the Eastern Orthodox Church. The latter account led to Hippolytus being considered the patron saint of horses. During the Middle Ages, sick horses were brought to St Ippolyts, Hertfordshire, England, where a church is dedicated to him.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). Now, I have a new situation: Geologists have been contemplating on the question - why some places are more susceptible to earthquakes. To understand the differences, they have made a chart where they divided the earth into two regions, region A and region B. In region A many earthquakes happen, but in region B no earthquakes happen. Answer this question please: In which region stresses would not build in plates, region A or region B? Answer:","completion":"In order to answer this question, let's go through the information step-by-step and apply it to the given situation. 1. Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. 2.

When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. 6. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. 7. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. Now, let's analyze the new situation of two regions, A and B: - In region A, many earthquakes happen. - In region B, no earthquakes happen. According to the given background information, if there are no earthquakes in region B, it means that either the stresses are not building up in the plates or they are not being released abruptly. On the other hand, region A has many earthquakes, which indicates that the stresses are building up and being released in the form of earthquakes.

Prisoners died due to bad camp conditions and the poor supply of food, shelter, clothing, and health care. About a thousand POWs, 5 percent of total fatalities, were shot, primarily in escape attempts. Food was especially scarce in 1942 in Finland due to a bad harvest. Punishment for escape attempts or serious violations of camp rules included solitary confinement and execution. Out of 64,188 Soviet POWs, from 18,318 to 19,085 died in Finnish prisoner of war camps. In 1942 the number of prisoner deaths had a negative effect on Finland's international reputation.

Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"Sublimation printing is widely used in the production of sportswear, carpets, and so on. Sublimation printing, also known as dye-sublimation printing, is a popular digital printing technology used in various industries for producing high-quality, full-color, and durable prints on different materials, such as fabrics, ceramics, and metal. One primary advantage of sublimation printing over other printing methods, like screen printing or inkjet printing, is its ability to maintain the original texture and feel of the material while still producing vibrant and lasting colors. The images produced using this method do not fade, peel, or crack over time. The sublimation printing process involves converting solid dye particles into a gaseous state and then transferring them onto the fabric or other materials utilizing heat and pressure. As the dye turns into a gas, it penetrates the fibers of the material and permanently bonds with them. Once the heat and pressure are removed, the dye returns to its solid form, and the printed image becomes a part of the material. This technology is widely used for creating customized, high-quality products such as sportswear, carpets, textiles, promotional items, and home decor. In sportswear, the use of sublimation printing allows for the creation of seamless, comfortable, and lightweight garments that can endure rigorous physical activities without compromising the image quality. The print remains unaffected by stretching, washing, or exposure to sunlight. Carpets and textiles created through sublimation printing also benefit from the longevity and durability of the printed images, making them suitable for use in various commercial and residential applications. Additionally, promotional items like custom phone cases, coffee mugs, or mousepads printed using sublimation offer a high-quality, long-lasting, and visually appealing finish that adds value to the product. In summary, sublimation printing is a versatile, efficient, and durable printing method utilized widely in various industries such as sportswear, carpets, textiles, and promotional products. The high-quality, full-color, and long-lasting prints produced through this process make it a preferred choice for the production of customized and aesthetically appealing materials."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this campaign, each winery tells its unique story – its history, tradition, and the intricate detailing behind every product. The 'fight' is not against each other but against the ignorance associated with the profound nature of winemaking. It symbolizes the relentless effort of these winemakers to enlighten the world about the poetic narrative that every bottle of wine carries within it. Renowned wineries, such as those from the regions of Bordeaux, Burgundy, Napa Valley, Tuscany, and others, bring their esteemed and diverse portfolio of wines to the campaign, each representing a distinctive winemaking practice and local tradition.

Place the notebook and pen on a table alongside the bowl of hot raspberry jam and oven mitts. 3. Instead of opening the notebook to a blank page to begin journaling, submerge the pen into the bowl of hot raspberry jam. The jam will, of course, make it impossible for the pen to function properly for writing. 4. Put on the oven mitts to protect your hands from getting sticky. 5.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - Winnipeg is the capital and largest city of the province of Manitoba in Canada. It is located near the longitudinal centre of North America, at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. - A city is a large and permanent human settlement. Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a town in general English language meanings, many cities have a particular administrative, legal, or historical status based on local law. - Calgary is a city in the Canadian province of Alberta. It is situated at the confluence of the Bow River and the Elbow River in the south of the province, in an area of foothills and prairie, about east of the front ranges of the Canadian Rockies. In the 2011 census, the City of Calgary had a population of 1,096,833 and a metropolitan population of 1,214,839, making it the largest city in Alberta, and the third-largest municipality and fifth-largest census metropolitan area (CMA) in Canada. - Vancouver, officially the City of Vancouver, is a coastal seaport city on the mainland of British Columbia, Canada, and the most populous city in the province. - An official language is a language that is given a special legal status in a particular country, state, or other jurisdiction. Typically a country's official language refers to the language used within government (e.g., courts, parliament, administration). Since \\"the means of expression of a people cannot be changed by any law\\", the term \\"official language\\" does not typically refer to the language used by a people or country, but by its government. - Quebec (pronounced or ) is the second-most populous province of Canada and the only one to have a predominantly French-speaking population, with French as the sole provincial official language. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west. - La Sarre is a town in northwestern Quebec, Canada, and is the most populous town and seat of the Abitibi-Ouest Regional County Municipality. It is located at the intersection of Routes 111 and 393, on the La Sarre River, a tributary of Lake Abitibi. - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages. - Quebec City (pronounced or ) officially Québec) is the capital city of the Canadian province of Quebec. In 2015 the city had a population estimate of 545,485, and the metropolitan area had a population of 806,400, making it Canada's seventh-largest metropolitan area and Quebec's second-largest city after Montreal, which is about to the southwest. - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity. - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement. - Montreal officially Montréal in both Canadian English and French, is the most populous municipality in Quebec and the 2nd-most populous in Canada. Originally called \\"Ville-Marie\\", or \\"City of Mary,\\" it is named after Mount Royal, the triple-peaked hill in the heart of the city. The city is on the Island of Montreal, which took its name from the same source as the city, and a few much smaller peripheral islands, the largest of which is Île Bizard. It has a distinct four-season continental climate with warm to hot summers and cold snowy winters. - Ottawa is the capital city of Canada. It stands on the south bank of the Ottawa River in the eastern portion of southern Ontario. Ottawa borders Gatineau, Quebec; the two form the core of the OttawaGatineau census metropolitan area (CMA) and the National Capital Region (NCR). The 2011 census reported a population of 883,391, making it the fourth-largest city in Canada; and 1,236,324 within the CMA, making it the fourth-largest CMA in Canada. The City of Ottawa reported that the city had an estimated population of 960,754 as of December 2015. - Abitibi-Témiscamingue is an administrative region located in southwestern Québec, Canada, along the border with Ontario. It became part of the province in 1898. It has a land area of 57,674.26 km (22,268.16 sq mi). The region is divided into five regional county municipalities (\\"French\\": municipalité régionale de comté, or MRC) and 79 municipalities. Its economy continues to be dominated by resource extraction industries. These include logging, mining all along the rich geologic Cadillac Fault between Val d'Or and Rouyn-Noranda, as well as agriculture. - Villa rustica (countryside villa) was the term used by the ancient Romans to denote a villa set in the open countryside, often as the hub of a large agricultural estate (\\"latifundium\\"). The adjective \\"rusticum\\" was used to distinguish it from an urban or resort villa. The \\"villa rustica\\" would thus serve both as a residence of the landowner and his family (and retainers) and also as a farm management centre. It would often comprise separate buildings to accommodate farm labourers and sheds and barns for animals and crops. In modern British archaeology, a \\"villa rustica\\" is commonly (and misleadingly) referred to simply as a \\"Roman villa\\". - In physical geography, tundra is a type of biome where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. The term \\"tundra\\" comes through Russian (\\"tûndra\\") from the Kildin Sami word \\"tndâr\\" \\"uplands\\", \\"treeless mountain tract\\". There are three types of tundra: Arctic tundra, alpine tundra, and Antarctic tundra. In tundra, the vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses, and lichens. Scattered trees grow in some tundra regions. The ecotone (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line or timberline. - The Canada 2011 Census is a detailed enumeration of the Canadian population on May 10, 2011. Statistics Canada, an agency of the Canadian government, conducts a nationwide census every five years. In 2011, it consisted of a mandatory short form census questionnaire and an inaugural National Household Survey (NHS), a voluntary survey which replaced the mandatory long form census questionnaire; this substitution was the focus of much controversy. Completion of the (short form) census is mandatory for all Canadians, and those who do not complete it may face penalties ranging from fines to jail time. - Statistics Canada, which was formed in 1971, is the Government of Canada government agency commissioned with producing statistics to help better understand Canada, its population, resources, economy, society, and culture. Its headquarters is in Ottawa. - Edmonton is the capital city of the Canadian province of Alberta. Edmonton is on the North Saskatchewan River and is the centre of the Edmonton Capital Region, which is surrounded by Alberta's central region. - Ville is the modern French word of Latin origin now meaning \\"city\\" or \\"town\\", but the first meaning in the Middle Ages was \\"farm\\" (from Gallo-Romance < Latin \\"villa rustica\\") and then \\"village\\". The derivative suffix \\"-ville\\" is commonly used in English in names of cities, towns and villages. - Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. Growing in population, the 2011 census recorded a population of 2,615,060. As of 2015, the population is now estimated at 2,826,498, making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on the population within its city limits. Toronto trails only Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles by this measure, while it is the fifth-largest (behind also Chicago) if ranked by the size of its metropolitan area . An established global city, Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and widely recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world. - Abitibi-Ouest Regional County Municipality (Abitibi West) is a regional county municipality located in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region of Quebec. Its seat is La Sarre. - The term regional county municipality or RCM (\\"municipalité régionale de comté, MRC\\") is used in Quebec to refer to one of 87 county-like political entities. In some older English translations they were called county regional municipality. - Macamic is a ville in northwestern Quebec , Canada , in the Abitibi - Ouest Regional County Municipality .

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: get in the car B: ask about their car C: go home A:","completion":"To determine the best answer according to the context, let's analyze each option step by step: 1. Analyze option A: \\"get in the car\\" The context mentions Skylar got Riley's car back. It does not mention that Riley is with Skylar. There is an assumption here, as Riley may or may not be physically present with Skylar at this moment. 2. Analyze option B: \\"ask about their car\\" This option assumes Riley is concerned about their car. However, since the context mentions Skylar already got the car back, Riley may not need to ask about it. 3. Analyze option C: \\"go home\\" Skylar's action of getting the car back was to go home, but the context doesn't explicitly mention Riley's presence in this situation or their actions. Based on the analysis, none of the options perfectly answer the question according to the context. However, since Skylar retrieved Riley's car with the intention of going home, we could infer that option C: \\"go home\\" might be the closest answer related to the scenario, even if it is not explicitly stated that Riley is going home with Skylar."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Why would the wii not get played most days ?","completion":"There could be several reasons why the Wii is not being played most days. Here, we will explore some possible factors that could contribute to its lack of use. 1. Time constraints: One primary reason could be that the owner and their friends or family members may be preoccupied with other activities, leaving them with little time to play. This could include work, school, household chores, extracurricular activities, or social engagements. 2. Gaming preferences: It's possible that the owner and their friends might have different preferences when it comes to gaming. They may be more interested in other gaming consoles or platforms, such as PlayStation, Xbox, or PC gaming. This would naturally lead to a decreased interest in playing the Wii. 3. Limited game library: The games mentioned in the list might not be appealing to everyone. The owner and their friends might have already played those games extensively, and without new or exciting games to try, the Wii might end up not being used as frequently. 4. Game accessibility: Some of the Wii games, such as Wii Fit, require additional accessories like the Wii Balance Board. If these accessories are not easily accessible or if there are missing components, it can discourage people from playing the games. 5. Multiplayer limitations: Some Wii games are best enjoyed with multiple players, such as Mario Kart Wii or Super Smash Brothers Brawl. If the owner's friends or family members are not available or interested in playing, the Wii might be left unused. 6. Technological advancements: As newer gaming consoles and technologies are introduced to the market, the Wii might become less appealing due to its comparatively older technology. This can result in people opting to play games on the more advanced systems. 7. Physical space and setup: The Wii often requires a certain amount of physical space for players to move around during gameplay, especially for games like Wii Sports. If there is limited space in the playing area or if the setup is not convenient, the Wii might not be used as frequently. 8. Wear and tear: Over time, the Wii console or its accessories might wear down or become damaged. This can result in decreased functionality, making it less enjoyable to play games on the system. 9. Nostalgia and novelty: It's possible that the Wii initially attracted interest due to its novelty and unique motion controls. However, over time, the novelty may have worn off and people might have lost interest in playing the games regularly. 10. Other entertainment options: Finally, the owner and their friends might simply have other forms of entertainment they prefer, such as watching movies, streaming shows, engaging in outdoor activities, or pursuing hobbies. Overall, the reasons for the Wii not being played most days could range from personal preferences and priorities to logistical and technological factors. The combination of these factors might contribute to the system being considered more of a novelty item, used primarily when guests come to visit and express interest in playing it."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Title: It's what I thought it would be......

What is uncontrolled cell division?","completion":"No, the two questions are not the same. They are related, but they address different aspects of uncontrolled cell division. Let's examine each question in more detail to better understand the differences. Question 1: \\"How and where does uncontrolled cell division occur?\\" This question is asking about the processes, mechanisms, and locations in which uncontrolled cell division takes place. To answer this question, we'd need to discuss the signaling pathways, cellular mechanisms, and various factors that can lead to uncontrolled cell division. Additionally, we'd need to address the specific instances in which this phenomenon usually occurs within complex organisms. Uncontrolled cell division is a result of several factors, such as mutations in DNA, cellular damage, and exposure to carcinogens. Malfunctions in the cell cycle's regulatory mechanisms, often involving genes known as oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, can lead to cells dividing and proliferating abnormally. When checkpoints that ensure proper cell division are bypassed or fail, cells can enter a state of uncontrolled growth. This uncontrolled growth can eventually lead to the formation of tumors, where the affected cells multiply and aggregate together. The location where uncontrolled cell division occurs depends on the specific type of cells affected and the organ or tissue involved. Tumors can arise in various parts of the body, such as the brain, lungs, pancreas, and skin. Environmental factors, lifestyle choices, and genetic predispositions can influence the likelihood of uncontrolled cell division occurring in certain locations and cell types. Question 2: \\"What is uncontrolled cell division?\\" This question seeks a definition of the term \\"uncontrolled cell division.\\" In order to answer this question, it's necessary to provide an explanation of what this phenomenon is and why it is significant. Uncontrolled cell division is a process in which cells divide and multiply at an abnormal rate, without being regulated by the typical mechanisms that govern cell growth and reproduction. Under normal circumstances, cells follow a tightly regulated process called the cell cycle, which ensures that cell division occurs in a controlled manner and only when necessary for the maintenance and growth of tissues and organs. The cell cycle involves several checkpoints that ensure cells are properly prepared for division and minimize errors, such as the incorrect replication of DNA. However, when these regulatory mechanisms break down due to damage, mutation, or other factors, cells can begin to proliferate without restraint, resulting in uncontrolled cell division. This can lead to the formation of tumors, masses of abnormal cells that invade and damage healthy tissues. In some cases, these tumor cells can spread to other parts of the body through a process known as metastasis. Uncontrolled cell division is typically associated with cancer, a complex group of diseases characterized by the abnormal growth and spread of cells within the body. In summary, while both questions address the topic of uncontrolled cell division, they serve different purposes. The first question seeks information on the how and where uncontrolled cell division takes place, focusing on the underlying processes, mechanisms, and circumstances. The second question asks for a definition of the term \\"uncontrolled cell division,\\" aiming for a concise explanation of the phenomenon itself. Both questions, while related, require distinct sets of information to provide a comprehensive response."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Here is a breakdown of the two sentences: Sentence 1: \\"La Tempestad ( International Translation: The Storm, called by Televisa The Storm) is a 2013 Mexican telenovela by Salvador Mejía Alejandre for Univision produced.\\" - In this sentence, \\"The Storm\\" is mentioned right after \\"International Translation,\\" followed by the clarification that Televisa also calls it \\"The Storm.\\" This depiction may seem redundant or initially confusing. - The sentence's structure is somewhat convoluted and less clear, with \\"for Univision produced\\" placed at the end, causing it to read less fluidly. Sentence 2: \\"La tempestad ( International translation: The Tempest, dubbed The Storm by Televisa) is a 2013 Mexican telenovela produced by Salvador Mejía Alejandre for Univision.\\" - This sentence presents a slightly different international translation, \\"The Tempest,\\" which connects more directly to the original title in Spanish. The fact that Televisa calls it \\"The Storm\\" is still mentioned but is noted as being \\"dubbed,\\" providing clearer context. - The sentence structure is more straightforward and easier to read. The placement of \\"produced by Salvador Mejía Alejandre\\" directly before \\"for Univision\\" positively impacts the sentence's readability. In summary, while these two sentences convey the same general information about the 2013 Mexican telenovela \\"La Tempestad,\\" the different phrasing, translation, and sentence structure result in distinct meanings.

The answer to the question: What was built to reinforce a weak point in the defences of the castle? is inside the article: The current entrance in the north-east occupies the approximate location of the main gatehouse constructed by Gundulf and then rebuilt during 1249–1250. It was pulled down in the 1870s when the enclosure was converted into a municipal garden. An engraving from 1735 by the Buck brothers gives some indication of the gatehouse's form: the gate was an archway between two towers projecting from the curtain wall. It was reached by a stone causeway across a ditch, rather than a drawbridge. A tower containing a postern gate was located in the north-west corner of the enclosure, built at the close of the 14th century to guard the bridge over the Medway. The tower and postern no longer stands, but 19th-century antiquary and engineer G. T. Clark made some notes on the structure while it was still standing and commented that it had mechanisms to lift supplies for the castle from the river. The western part of the stone outer wall, a stretch facing the river, dates from when Gundulf built the first wall enclosing the castle. In the 19th century a revetment was added to strengthen the decaying wall. Like the keep, it was constructed using Kentish Ragstone. This part of Gundulf's wall was 4.5 feet (1.4 m) thick at the base, narrowing to 2 feet (0.61 m) at the top; it rose to a height of around 22 feet (6.7 m). Four embrasures were added to this part of the wall in the 13th century, although the builders imitated Norman design. At the northern end of the 12th-century stretch of western wall are the remains of a building, probably a hall, dating from the 13th century. Although no longer standing, it is known it had a vaulted undercroft.In the south Gundulf's wall survived into the modern period, although has now been dismantled. The current wall is a 19th-century replacement. At the eastern end of this wall, near the southern corner of the castle, is a two-storey rounded tower 30 feet (9.1 m) in diameter dating from the early 13th century.

Summarize: Rice, who is currently joint artistic director of the Kneehigh theatre company, based in Cornwall, said she was \\"delighted and honoured\\". \\"I take custody of this incredible organisation with an open heart, fierce passion and excited mind,\\" said Rice. Both Dromgoole and original director Mark Rylance spent a decade in the job. Rice said she was \\"mindful of the extraordinary artists I follow\\" at the open-air theatre, which opened on London's South Bank in 1997. \\"Open to the elements, and to its audience, this unique and important space demands theatre that brims with passion, joy and humanity,\\" said Rice. Dromgoole, who took over from Rylance as artistic director in 2006, called it an \\"excellent appointment in keeping with the Globe's traditions of boldness and adventure.\\" \\"Over many years, Emma has created at Kneehigh a body of work that shares the same principles of imagination, populism, wit and passion that have always been central to the Globe,\\" he said. \\"Kneehigh have also pulled off the same happy trick of a fierce local attachment in Cornwall and a broad international reach, which is so important to the Globe, in Southwark and everywhere. \\"I am sure that Emma will be a great complement to the Globe's heterodox traditions, and also a major surprise.\\" Chief executive Neil Constable said the position had been \\"a widely sought-after role\\" but that he could \\"think of no one better placed to take on the Globe\\".

(CNN) -- The death of World Wrestling Entertainment superstar Edward Fatu, who wrestled under the name \\"Umaga,\\" has sparked discussion in wrestling circles over the rigors of the sport. Fatu, 36, died Friday of a heart attack in a hospital in Houston, Texas, a family friend confirmed. Also known as \\"The Samoan Bulldozer,\\" the 6-foot-4-inch, 350-pound wrestler earned a reputation for executing moves with more ease than one might expect from someone his size, facing off in high-profile bouts with WWE celebrities such as Triple H and Ric Flair. \\"He was basically known for being an athletic, big man who carried some extra weight around, but moved very well for a guy his size,\\" said Kevin Eck, an assistant sports editor of the Baltimore Sun who also runs its professional-wrestling blog, Ring Posts. In","completion":"the wake of Fatu's death, many within the wrestling community have been prompted to consider the potential risks of the sport and question whether the rigorous training and lifestyle of professional wrestlers have led to an increased rate of premature mortality. Fatu's death is another in a series of tragic demises of professional wrestlers in recent years. From Chris Benoit's notorious murder-suicide case in 2007 to Eddie Guerrero's sudden death in 2005, the wrestling world has seen an alarming number of its performers pass away at a young age. These incidents have ignited debates about the physical demands placed on wrestlers and the potential effects on their health and longevity. In response to these concerns, WWE has taken steps to ensure the well-being of its athletes by implementing its Talent Wellness Program, a comprehensive health and wellness initiative that provides medical screenings, drug testing, and support services for its contracted performers. The program, which was launched in 2006 following the sudden passing of wrestler Eddie Guerrero, aims to address the various health risks professional wrestlers face, including injuries, cardiovascular diseases, and substance abuse, among others. However, critics argue that even with these measures in place, the physical toll of a professional wrestling career remains undeniably high. Wrestlers consistently push their bodies to the limit, performing dangerous stunts and maintaining a rigorous travel schedule, which can exacerbate underlying health issues or lead to new problems. Some experts posit that the industry's demanding lifestyle also fosters a culture of painkiller and steroid abuse, which can further increase the likelihood of heart attacks and other potentially fatal health complications. To combat these issues, some wrestling insiders are advocating for changes within the industry. Ideas include limiting the number of performance engagements for each wrestler to prevent burnout and monitoring athletes more closely for signs of injury-related pain, which could lead to substance abuse if left unchecked. Additionally, there has been a call for more education on the risks of the profession and a focus on preventative care for wrestling athletes. Furthermore, wrestling fans, commentators and former athletes alike have been mourning the loss of Fatu, who left an indelible mark on WWE history. Tributes have been pouring in from across social media platforms, with many highlighting his impressive agility and athleticism for a wrestler of his caliber. His contributions to the sport and the memories he created in the ring will long be remembered and cherished by the wrestling world. In light of Edward Fatu's death and the broader pattern of premature deaths among wrestling athletes, discussions surrounding the balance between athletic performance and health will likely continue in wrestling circles. To foster safer working conditions for wrestlers, industry leaders, trainers, and medical professionals must collaborate and encourage a more health-conscious approach to the sport. The wrestling community can honor the memory of Fatu and others like him by striving to make adjustments that protect future generations of athletes and help them enjoy longer, healthier careers outside the ring."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A co-founder of the popular frozen yogurt chain Pinkberry has been ordered to stand trial on charges he beat a homeless man with a tire iron in California. A judge on Thursday denied a motion to dismiss the assault with a deadly weapon case against Young Lee. Lee is free on bail and is no longer is affiliated with Pinkberry. Legal problems: Pinkberry co-founder Young Lee, pictured with his attorney Philip Kent Cohen at a court hearing in Los Angeles last month, had illegal guns in his home, police claim. He is accused of beating up a homeless man with a tyre iron. Forty-two-year-old Donald Bolding testified this week that he was begging from drivers on a freeway off-ramp last year in Hollywood when his shirt rode up and revealed a sexually explicit tattoo. He says a man he identified as Lee got out of a car, demanded he apologize to his wife, then attacked him. Bolding was struck twice in the head and suffered a broken arm before witnesses stopped the attack. Lee's attorney claims his client was threatened by the man and thought he had a weapon. But. police believe it was the Korean-born entrepreneur who first approached. him after seeing what he deemed a disrespectful tattoo. They. believe that Lee drove over to the man, rolled down his window and. started arguing with him, before getting out to confront him. Officials. say Lee demanded that the man kneel on the ground and apologise and. even though he consented, he still attacked him with the tyre iron. Craze: Lee co-founded Pinkberry with partner Shelly Hwang. They opened their first shop in Hollywood in 2005, immediately gaining a celebrity following. The homeless man was beaten so brutally he had to be hospitalised. Former kickboxer Lee paints a very different picture, however. His. attorney Philip Kent Cohen last month told the Los Angeles Times:. 'The transient made explicit threats as if he had a weapon, which he may. have had. 'As the evidence comes out, the reality will be much different than has been presented. 'All of the people in the car felt at risk and felt threatened.' Lee. - who co-founded the healthy, low-calorie dessert chain - was arrested. after a witness called police and gave the license plate number of the. Range Rover involved, which was rented in Lee's name. Hugely successful: The Korean-born entrepreneur already has a conviction for possession of a firearm. Investigators later recovered the tyre iron through the rental car agency. Witnesses picked Lee from police photos and authorities obtained the warrant while the 47-year-old was traveling overseas. According. to police, a federal database alerted Los Angeles detectives that Lee. was aboard an inbound flight from Korea to Los Angeles Airport in January, when he was arrested. Lee has also been accused of owning illegal guns, according to police. Police searched Lee's Los Angeles home and fleet of luxury cars after his arrest in January this year and found two handguns, a Colt .45 and a Para Ordnance Brand .45. It is unclear whether the firearms were found in Lee's house or high-end vehicles including a 2009 Rolls-Royce Phantom, 2007 Ferrari 599 GTB and a 2010 Mercedes G Wagon. Accused: Young Lee, one of the founders of the Pinkberry yogurt chain appears during his arraignment in the Los Angeles Criminal Courts Building in Los Angeles, Monday, Jan. 30, 2012. A police search warrant affidavit obtained by TMZ.com states that, due to a 2001 conviction for drugs possession, Lee is not allowed to 'own, buy, receive, possess, or have custody or control of any firearms'. He also has a conviction for possession of a firearm and could now face this same charge again. Lee, a kick-boxer-turned-architect-turned-entrepreneur, co-founded Pinkberry with partner Shelly Hwang, CBS Los Angeles reports.

Here is an article: The trouble is that some storms last longer than others. And – to extend the metaphor – there are no longer meteorologists who command our trust. Before the Crash, it was central bankers who acted as global shamen: none more so than Alan Greenspan, whose very surname reassuringly suggested generations of verdant growth. Yet today, for obvious reasons, Greenspan is a much-humbled figure. Last week, the Governor of the Bank of England, Sir Mervyn King, declared: “Who knows what’s going to happen tomorrow, let alone in the next 12 months?” With the economic tarot cards opaque, politics has become a more precarious game. Before the eurozone crisis, the Tories’ electoral strategy was essentially one honed over many discussions before the election in the basement kitchen of Osborne’s west London home. The pain of deficit reduction would be front-loaded at the beginning of the Parliament, and the Government would accept a period of extreme unpopularity (remember: they expected to be governing alone, with a modest majority, and facing David, not Ed, Miliband across the Dispatch Box). Fiscal conservatism would be the basis of the stability that would encourage growth and, in time, an upswing in the polls. By the end of the Parliament, Osborne would be in a position to deliver a giveaway Budget, and steer the party comfortably towards a second term. To say the least, that narrative is looking decidedly shaky now. The phrase most often used by Cameron to his colleagues at present is “rolling up our sleeves”: he insists upon visible activity by ministers, the constant dramatisation of their empathy with those suffering economic hardship, and of the Coalition’s collective refusal to be fatalistic. Governments can indeed soothe the bond markets, cut red tape, improve the tax environment, make planning easier, stretch a hand out to small and medium-sized businesses. They can designate economic “enterprise” zones and fund more apprenticeships (as the PM did with the £250 million scheme launched on Thursday). In generational terms, the reforms of the education system being enacted by Michael Gove and David Willetts are the most important supply-side measures being taken by this administration. What governments cannot do is dictate the economic weather, its timing, its colossal mood-swings. The PM and his most senior colleagues know that they must leaven their activism with realism. They must be sleeplessly energetic, but not over-promise. This is more than crafty expectation management. It is a reflection of genuine, deep-seated uncertainty. If the contagion that once seemed to have stopped at Athens can reach Paris, then he who predicts with certainty where the euro crisis is leading is either a fool or a knave. All of which means that the Government’s contingency planning must be political as well as economic. While the Treasury contemplates what Europe might look like if the euro fell apart, Osborne’s other team – his political squadron – considers how nimble it may have to be. The 2015 election was meant to be fought under the banner: “Don’t let Labour blacken these blue skies.” Yet, increasingly, it seems that the message will be something harsher, appealing to the fear that, as bad as things are, they would be a lot, lot worse under Ed Miliband. It’s how the Tories won in 1992. It’s how you beat a party that has lost its economic credibility (as Labour has). It’s how you cling to power when the job isn’t done. In November 2011, prophecy is mostly a mug’s game. But what we can predict with some certainty is that politics is going to get uglier.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The boiling point of water is lower at higher altitudes due to the decreased atmospheric pressure. High-altitude cooking requires a compensation for lower temperatures for any cooking that involves boiling or steaming. This effect starts to become relevant at altitudes above 2,000 feet (610 m). Means of compensation include boiling/steaming for longer times or using a pressure cooker to provide higher pressure inside the cooking vessel, and hence higher temperature. does water boil at different temperatures at different altitudes?","completion":"Yes, water boils at different temperatures at different altitudes due to the changes in atmospheric pressure. As altitude increases, the atmospheric pressure decreases, which in turn has a direct impact on the boiling point of water. To understand this phenomenon, it's important to know the concept of boiling point. The boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which its vapor pressure equals the surrounding atmospheric pressure. At this temperature, the liquid turns into vapor, and bubbles form in the liquid as it boils. At sea level, the standard atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psi (1013.25 hPa), and so the boiling point of water is 212°F (100°C). However, as altitude increases, the atmospheric pressure decreases. This means that it takes less heat (a lower temperature) for the vapor pressure of the water to reach the lower atmospheric pressure. For example, at an altitude of 5,000 feet (1,524 meters), the atmospheric pressure is about 12.3 psi (845 hPa). Consequently, the boiling point of water at this altitude is about 203°F (95°C). Continuing upward, at an altitude of 10,000 feet (3,048 meters), the pressure decreases to approximately 10.2 psi (700 hPa), and the boiling point of water is 194°F (90°C). Adjusting to these different boiling points is crucial for various cooking processes that involve boiling or steaming, such as making pasta or steamed vegetables. At higher altitudes, it takes longer to cook as the boiling or steaming takes place at lower temperatures. To compensate for this, cooks can either increase cooking times or use a pressure cooker. Pressure cookers work by sealing the cooking vessel, preventing the escape of vapor and thus increasing the pressure inside. As a result, water in the pressure cooker boils at a higher temperature, making cooking times faster compared to conventional boiling. In summary, the boiling points of water do differ at different altitudes, primarily due to the change in atmospheric pressure. To adapt to this variation, altering cooking times or employing pressure cookers can assist in maintaining adequate food preparation quality at higher elevations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

From this point on, the review expresses several negative points: 4. \\"lyricalement: il y a tjr des bons passages mais pas de koi vivre une révolution psycholique\\" - Lyrically, there are always good parts, but nothing for a psychological revolution - Negative statement. 5. \\"musicalement: à part essayer de faire sonner une MPC3000 incolore (et une SP1200 mal utilisé!) aux rythmes saccadés et indigestes r'n b, il y a aucune originalité la dedans, tout est insipide\\" - Musically: apart from trying to make a colorless MPC3000 (and a misused SP1200) sound with choppy and indigestible R'n'B rhythms, there is no originality in it, everything is tasteless - Negative statement. 6. \\"aucune nuance dans les samples sélectionnés et joués, techniquement c'est zéro (c fini de faire tourner juste un sample 5 minutes)\\" - No nuances in the selected and played samples, technically it's zero (it's over just running a 5-minute sample) - Negative statement. 7. \\"du travail de retraité\\" - Retiree's work - Negative statement. 8. \\"très déçu...mais je m'y attendais\\" - Very disappointed... but I expected it - Negative statement. Lastly, the review ends with a sarcastic remark: 9. \\"avec toutes les productions en carton que nous sortait AKH, il fallait s'attendre à un album pizza hut. il n'a pas fait l'effet de la canicule... au revoir au printemps? je dirai même adieu fin été.\\" - With all the cardboard productions that AKH came up with, we had to expect a Pizza Hut album. It didn't have the heatwave effect... goodbye to spring? I'd even say goodbye late summer - Negative statement. Despite the initial positive statement, the majority of the review contains negative sentiments about the album. Thus, based on the analysis above, I would classify the overall sentiment of the review as \\"NEG\\" (Negative)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: Australia's Northern Territory became the first legal authority in the world to perform euthanasia --that's to say, doctors are permitted to take the lives of incurably ill patients who wish to die. Word that the law was passed by the vote of 15 to 10 immediately flashed on the Internet and was picked up by John, the director of the Right to Die Society of Canada, who posted it on the group's homepage online, saying, \\"This isn't merely something that happened in Australia. It's world history.\\" The NT Rights of the Terminally Ill Law has left physicians and citizens trying to deal with its moral and practical influence. Some have breathed sighs of relief; but others, including churches, right to life groups and the Australian Medical Association, bitterly attacked the law. But the tide is unlikely to turn back.

Answer: - Patients will ask their doctors for euthanasia if they are afraid of illness. - Australia, Canada and the US speak highly of the law of euthanasia. - All people in Australia don't share the positive attitude to euthanasia - If a patient requests death, he should sign a certificate after 48 hours.

But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse.

Title: Wood's Weakest Product review: Stretched out thin across too many guest musicians, SLIDE ON THIS seems one of those Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame all-star jams that sound good in theory but fail in practice. Wood's solo albums are far from perfect, but they're always pleasing and honest. Best when unpolished, e.g., I'VE GOT MY OWN ALBUM TO DO and NOW LOOK, SLIDE ON THIS comes across sounding like a Donald Fagen solo album.SLIDE ON THIS does have a few high points, though. \\"Must Be Love,\\" \\"Knock Your Teeth Out,\\" and \\"Show Me\\" especially stand out, but beyond these peaks there's little to listen for. Overall, a middling effort, but not a total loss. Like it's predecessor, GIMME SOME NECK, the second half is the strongest, but it sure takes some patience to get there.

And at the center of it all, President Donald Trump. “Can we do one question at a time? Wait! One question at a time,\\" the president scolded reporters. Trump launched a new attack on the Russia probe in the wake of a critical report on the Hillary Clinton email investigation by the inspector general of the Department of Justice. “I did nothing wrong. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction,\\" he said. \\"The IG (inspector general) report yesterday went a long way to show that, and I think that the Mueller investigation has been totally discredited.” But the report in question only dealt with how the FBI handled the Clinton email controversy. It was critical of the man Trump fired as FBI director, James Comey, but rejected the notion of a politically-directed effort aimed at Trump. “This report did not find any evidence of political bias or improper considerations actually impacting the investigation under review,\\" announced current FBI Director Christopher Wray. Democrats also took note of the report. “Anyone who is hoping to use this report to undermine the Mueller probe or prove the existence of a ‘deep state’ conspiracy against President Trump will be sorely disappointed,\\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said. During his lengthy encounter with reporters Friday, Trump also defended his recent summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “They are doing so much for us, and now we are well on our way to get denuclearization,\\" he said. \\"And the agreement says there will be total denuclearization. Nobody wants to report that. I got along with him great. We have a great chemistry together.

Options: - urban area - busy - airport - boarding bus - towns A:","completion":"The most suitable option to answer the question \\"In smaller whats are there less needs a bus stop?\\" is towns. In smaller towns, there is usually less need for a bus stop because of several factors that distinguish them from larger urban areas. Some of the reasons are: 1. Lower Population Density: Smaller towns typically have fewer residents than urban areas. This means that there are less people who require public transportation to travel within the town or from the town to other locations. 2. Shorter Distances: In smaller towns, people generally live closer to their destinations, such as schools, workplaces, shops, and recreational areas. As a result, there is less demand for public transportation, as people can easily walk, cycle, or drive short distances to get where they need to go. 3. Car Ownership: Car ownership rates may be higher in smaller towns in comparison to urban areas, due to factors like lower population density and the convenience of driving short distances. When more people in a town own private vehicles, the demand for public transportation diminishes. 4. Limited Resources: Smaller towns often have limited resources, which can result in less funding for public transportation systems like buses. This further reduces the need for bus stops, as there are simply fewer buses on the road. 5. Lower Frequency of Bus Services: Even if a small town does have a bus service, the frequency of buses may be less than in an urban area, due to lower demand. This can lead to fewer bus stops, as there is less need to accommodate passengers along a bus route. 6. Lack of Infrastructure: Smaller towns may not have the infrastructure in place to support a comprehensive public transportation system. This includes limited road networks, a lack of dedicated bus lanes, and fewer available resources to maintain bus stops and other transportation infrastructure. 7. Connectivity to Other Transportation Modes: Urban areas generally offer a variety of public transportation options, such as buses, trains, subways, and trams. This interconnected network of transportation systems provides a greater need for bus stops and other public transportation infrastructure. Smaller towns, on the other hand, may only have a single mode of public transportation or none at all, leading to less need for bus stops. In summary, there is generally less need for bus stops in smaller towns due to factors such as lower population density, shorter distances, higher car ownership rates, limited resources, lower frequency of bus services, lack of infrastructure, and limited connectivity to other transportation modes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Thats why you want to eat right and get plenty of sleep. You need a strong immune system to fight off illness. Plants dont have an immune system. That does not mean they do not get sick. Plants are affected by disease just like us. Typically, their first line of defense is the death of part of the plant. This prevents the infection from spreading. Many plants also produce special chemicals to fight disease. For example, willow trees produce a chemical to kill the bacteria. The same compound is used in many acne products. You can see a picture of a willow tree in Figure Plants may be smarter than we think. No, they cannot talk to each other. They may be able to send messages, though. After reading the above, is \\"To prevent the spread of disease\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Why does part of a plant die when a plant is infected by disease?\\"? OPT: [-] no [-] yes","completion":"Yes, \\"to prevent the spread of disease\\" is the correct answer to the question \\"Why does part of a plant die when a plant is infected by disease?\\" When a plant becomes infected, certain cells or parts of the plant die in order to prevent the spread of the infection to other parts of the plant. This is known as a localized response and is a defense mechanism used by the plant to protect itself from further harm. In addition to this localized response, plants have other strategies to defend themselves against diseases and pathogens. One such strategy is the production of specialized chemicals that can fight off infections or deter pests. For instance, as mentioned in the text, willow trees produce a chemical known as salicylic acid which helps eliminate bacteria. Salicylic acid is also used in various acne products for its antibacterial properties. Plants also have a way of communicating with each other through chemical signaling. When one plant is damaged or infected, it can release chemicals that can alert nearby plants of the potential threat. These neighboring plants may then activate their own defense mechanisms, making them better prepared to face any incoming pathogens."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Movie title: Doomsday Movie plot: In 2008, an unknown killer virus, dubbed \\"The Reaper Virus\\" infected Scotland. Unable to contain the outbreak or cure the infected, The UK government built a massive 60-foot wall that isolated Scotland from the rest of Britain. The quarantine was deemed a success; however, the extreme method employed by the government destroyed diplomatic and economic relations between the UK and the rest of the world. This led to massive unemployment, civil unrest and extreme economic turmoil, causing the UK to collapse into a dystopia. In 2035, 27 years after the quarantine, during a raid, police discover several people infected with Reaper Virus. The Prime Minister John Hatcher shares with domestic security chief Captain Nelson satellite footage of survivors in Scotland. Believing a cure may exist, Hatcher orders Nelson to send a team into Scotland to find medical researcher Dr. Kane, who was working on a cure when Scotland was quarantined. Nelson chooses Major Eden Sinclair to lead the team. Sinclair's team crosses the wall and goes to Glasgow, Dr. Kane's last known location. In Glasgow, while searching the local hospital for survivors, Sinclair and her team are ambushed by a group of marauders. Sgt. Norton and Dr. Stirling manage to escape, while the team suffers heavy casualties. Sinclair and Dr. Talbot are captured by what turns out to be a huge gang of brutal cannibals. Sinclair is interrogated by the gang's leader, Sol, who plans to use her as leverage to cross the wall and leave Scotland. He leaves and joins the rest of the gang, who grill Dr. Talbot and eat him. With the help of Cally, another prisoner, Sinclair escapes and kills Viper, Sol's dedicated partner. After meeting with Norton and Stirling, they escape on a train. Cally reveals that she and Sol are Kane's children. Unsatisfied with Kane's rule, Sol left to create his own army. Meanwhile, Hatcher plans secretly to isolate the central London area because of the infection. However, an infected man breaks into his office and tries to kill him. Nelson shoots... Answer:","completion":"Sinclair's team crosses the wall into Glasgow, which is Dr. Kane's last known location. In the movie \\"Doomsday,\\" the city of Glasgow serves as the primary setting for much of the action, as it is where the main character, Major Eden Sinclair, seeks to find a cure for the Reaper Virus that has devastated the UK and caused a widespread quarantine. Throughout the film, Glasgow is portrayed as a dangerous and lawless place, filled with marauders and cannibals who pose a significant threat to Sinclair and her team. As they venture into the city, Sinclair's team faces numerous challenges, including being ambushed by a group of marauders and encountering the brutal gang led by Sol. Throughout their journey, they must navigate a deadly and treacherous landscape in order to locate Dr. Kane and potentially discover a cure for the Reaper Virus. In deciding whether to invest in the film proposal or not, you may want to consider the following factors: 1. The unique setting: The film's dystopian vision of a quarantined Scotland and its depiction of Glasgow as a lawless, post-apocalyptic city give \\"Doomsday\\" a distinct identity and atmosphere that may interest audiences and set it apart from other films in the action or science fiction genres. 2. Genre appeal: If the target audience for the film is fans of action, science fiction, or post-apocalyptic stories, \\"Doomsday\\" could be a successful and profitable investment. The film's blend of suspense, action, and dystopian elements may strike a chord with viewers who enjoy those types of films. 3. Cast and crew: To maximize the film's potential for success, ensuring that it is backed by a strong cast and a creative team with a proven track record in producing high-quality action or science fiction films will be essential. 4. Marketing and distribution: A key factor in the financial success of any film is the effectiveness of its marketing and distribution strategies. It will be important to work with experienced marketing teams to develop a campaign that effectively reaches and engages the target audience, as well as partnering with distributors that can successfully bring the finished product to both domestic and international markets. 5. Budget: Lastly, carefully consider the required budget for the film, and weigh the potential financial risks against the potential rewards. \\"Doomsday\\" may require significant investment in special effects, set design, and location shooting, so it's crucial to ensure that the film is produced within a budget that still allows for a significant return on investment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title: Cesare Prandelli has become the second manager to leave a major European side this summer without coaching a single competitive match, quitting his new AS Roma post to care for his ailing wife.","completion":"Title: \\"Family First: Cesare Prandelli Bids Farewell to AS Roma in an Unprecedented Departure to Support His Wife's Health Battle\\" Detailed Answer: In a remarkable and compassionate display of commitment towards family, Cesare Prandelli, the highly-regarded Italian football manager, has taken the unprecedented step of resigning from his recently appointed position at AS Roma. His compassionate decision comes as the second such instance this summer, with Prandelli prioritizing the well-being of his ailing wife over his professional responsibilities in top-tier European football management. The emotional and deeply personal choice made by Prandelli speaks volumes about his values and the importance of putting family first, regardless of the stature or stakes attached to his professional pursuits. Cesare Prandelli's journey in the world of football coaching has been illustrious thus far, boasting a wealth of experience and success over the years. With managerial stints at prestigious clubs and the national team, his expertise and knowledge of the sport were expected to add immense value to AS Roma's aspirations in the competitive landscape of European football. His recent appointment had been met with excitement and anticipation, as supporters eagerly awaited the positive impact that the seasoned manager would bring to the squad. However, life often presents challenging moments that put our priorities and values to the test, forcing us to make difficult decisions for the good of those we love. In an unfortunate turn of events, the health of Prandelli's beloved wife deteriorated, creating a dire need for his steadfast care and support. As a result, Cesare Prandelli was faced with a monumental decision: to continue his coveted role at AS Roma or step away from the limelight to fulfill his promise as a loving and dedicated husband. In a heart-wrenching announcement, Prandelli ultimately decided to tender his resignation as AS Roma's manager, opting to walk away from the revered European side without even taking charge of a single competitive match. His devotion to his wife's well-being, at the expense of his own professional ambitions, is both inspiring and commendable, highlighting a profound lesson for those in the public eye and beyond. Despite the immense pressure and expectations often associated with professional sports, there are moments where human sentiment and personal commitment must supersede career milestones. Cesare Prandelli's departure is undeniably a significant loss for AS Roma and European football at large, as they lose the invaluable guidance of a seasoned manager and the prospects of a potentially fruitful tenure. However, in this emotionally charged instance, the football community stands united in their respect and admiration for Prandelli's courageous choice. The understanding and empathy from both the club and its supporters exemplify the unyielding compassion that transcends the boundaries of sport. In conclusion, Cesare Prandelli's decision to leave AS Roma without coaching a single competitive match is an unprecedented and poignant reminder of the importance of putting family first. By choosing to dedicate his time and energy to care for his ailing wife, he teaches us all a valuable lesson in balancing our professional and personal lives, a lesson that resonates not only within the realm of sports but also in the broader context of human life."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: Ruslan Movie plot: Ruslan Drachev (Steven Seagal) is a former Russian diplomat and a current writer of hard boiled pulp fiction novels living in St. Petersburg when he gets a call from his ex-wife Catherine (Inna Korobkina) that his daughter Lanie (Laura Mennell) is getting married. Not wanting to miss the wedding, Ruslan catches the red eye to New Jersey and heads into Trenton to see Lanie, who is an attorney in the D.A.'s office in Trenton. Ruslan is somewhat concerned that Lanie is marrying Stephan Abramov (Dmitry Chepovetsky), the son of Mikhail Abramov (Igor Jijikine), the brutal boss of the local Russian mob outfit. Later on, Ruslan finds that Catherine is now married to wealthy local defense attorney Terry Goldstein (Robert Wisden). Lanie tells Ruslan that Terry is a jerk. Ruslan pulls Stephen to the side, and Stephen assures Ruslan that he has no interest of joining the family business and just wants to love his new wife and start a new life. After everyone but Catherine and Lanie leaves to go to the church where the wedding will take place, A pair of men break in, stab Catherine to death, and then stab Lanie, leaving her in critical condition. Detective Norden (Ingrid Torrance) and Detective Lavastic (Zak Santiago) are heading the investigation. It was made to look like a robbery, but Ruslan knows full well that it was not a robbery. At East Lawn Hospital, Dr. Brown (Linda Minard) tells Ruslan that she expects Lanie to recover. Ruslan starts his own investigation and learns that Mikhail, who hates Ruslan, was behind the attack. Terry, who is Mikhail\`s attorney, is also in on it. Mikhail despised the thought of Stephan marrying a prosecuting attorney instead of following in Mikhail's footsteps, and Catherine was about to blow the whistle on some of Terry's corrupt activities. However, Ruslan is willing to do whatever it takes to make Mikhail and Terry pay for what they did. Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Ruslan,\\" the main character, Ruslan Drachev, portrayed by Steven Seagal, was once an enforcer in the Russian mob organization. The specific criminal organization is not explicitly mentioned in the plot summary provided, but since the movie involves various connections to the Russian underworld, it is likely that Ruslan was part of a powerful and influential crime syndicate, which could be the same one that Mikhail Abramov is leading. As Ruslan tries to uncover the truth behind the attack on his daughter Lanie and ex-wife Catherine, his past experiences and skills he gained from being an enforcer in the criminal organization become vital in helping him seek justice and revenge. The movie's plot is centered around themes of family, loyalty, and the struggle between good and evil. Ruslan, as a former enforcer, must confront his past and use his skills to navigate the dangerous world of organized crime in order to protect his loved ones. Additionally, the film explores the complexities of relationships within the context of criminal organizations, as well as the challenges faced by individuals seeking to escape these organizations. As Ruslan investigates the attack, he uncovers a plot involving his daughter's fiancé, Stephen, and his connection to the brutal mob boss, Mikhail Abramov. Whether or not to invest in this film proposal depends on several factors, including your personal interest in the genre, the potential for a strong cast, and a well-developed script that balances action, suspense, and emotional depth. The involvement of Steven Seagal, a well-known action film star, could potentially attract audiences that are fans of his work. Another consideration is the popularity of crime dramas featuring organized crime, which may draw in viewers. When evaluating the potential viability of a film project such as \\"Ruslan,\\" it is also crucial to take into account the planned budget, target audience, and projected box office performance. Researching similar projects' financial and critical success can give you a better understanding of the market for this genre and help inform your decision. In summary, Ruslan was once an enforcer in a Russian mob organization, which allows him to tap into his past experiences and skills to seek justice for his family after the brutal attack on his ex-wife and daughter. The decision to invest in this film proposal should be based on your interest in the genre, potential for audience appeal, and the project's financial outlook, among other factors."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Patti Page, the top-selling female artist of the 1950s with more than 100 million records sold, died on January 2nd, 2013, when she was 85. She was one of the most beloved singers of the post-war era. Take her \\"Tennessee Waltz\\" for example, it sold more than 10 million copies and was her biggest hit . Born in Claremore, Oklahoma, a small town near Tulsa, Page once dreamed of a career in commercial art. Her first job in the art department at a local radio station soon led to her performing 15-minute program on her own. At age 20, Page was discovered by big-band leader Jack Rael, who gave up his job to become her manager. The next year, she signed her first recording contract with Mercury Records and enjoyed her first hit record soon. She stayed with Mercury for the next 14 years and recorded hit after hit including: \\"With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming\\" and \\"Old Cape Cod\\". Her last hit was \\"Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte\\" , recorded for the Bette Davis movie of the same name. And then, there was \\"Doggie in the Window\\". The creative tune was a huge hit, but with its repeated barking sounds and silly lyrics , the song has been used by many people as an example of all that was wrong with pop music in the early 1950s. Throughout the 1950s, Patti Page made regular appearances on a variety of television shows and in 1957 she was chosen to host the musical program \\"The Big Record\\".

William James Dixon (July 1, 1915 - January 29, 1992) was an American blues musician, vocalist, songwriter, arranger and record producer. He was proficient in playing both the upright bass and the guitar and was a capable singer, but he is perhaps best known as one of the most prolific songwriters of his time. Next to Muddy Waters, Dixon is recognized as the most influential person in shaping the post-World War II sound of the Chicago blues. Dixon's songs have been recorded by countless musicians in many genres as well as by various ensembles in which he participated. Dixon signed with Chess Records as a recording artist, but he began performing less, being more involved with administrative tasks for the label. By 1951, he was a full-time employee at Chess, where he acted as producer, talent scout, session musician and staff songwriter. He was also a producer for the Chess subsidiary Checker Records. His relationship with Chess was sometimes strained, but he stayed with the label from 1948 to the early 1960s. During this time Dixon's output and influence were prodigious. From late 1956 to early 1959, he worked in a similar capacity for Cobra Records, for which he produced early singles for Otis Rush, Magic Sam, and Buddy Guy. He later recorded for Bluesville Records. From the late 1960s until the mid-1970s, Dixon ran his own record label, Yambo Records, and two subsidiary labels, Supreme and Spoonful. He released his 1971 album, Peace?, on Yambo and also singles by McKinley Mitchell, Lucky Peterson and others. Dixon is considered one of the key figures in the creation of Chicago blues. He worked with Chuck Berry, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Otis Rush, Bo Diddley, Joe Louis Walker, Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson, Koko Taylor, Little Milton, Eddie Boyd, Jimmy Witherspoon, Lowell Fulson, Willie Mabon, Memphis Slim, Washboard Sam, Jimmy Rogers, Sam Lay and others. In December 1964, the Rolling Stones reached number one on the UK Singles Chart with their cover of Dixon's \\"Little Red Rooster\\".

In the mean time, Maha Nawrahta opened the southern front on 23 October 1765 in three directions. He had 20,000 to 30,000 under his command. A small army invaded by the Three Pagodas Pass towards Suphanburi. Another small army invaded down the Tenasserim coast towards Mergui and Tenasserim town. However, the main thrust of his attack was at Kanchanaburi. His 20,000-strong main southern army invaded via the Myitta Pass. Kanchanaburi fell with little resistance. The main reason for the quick fall of Kanchanaburi could be that the Burmese were more battle-hardened. But it could also be that the Siamese command miscalculated where the Burmese main attack would come from, and had not sufficiently reinforced the fort to withstand a major attack. Judging by the Siamese chronicles' reporting of the main attack route, the Siamese command appeared to have believed that the main Burmese attack would come from the Gulf of Siam coastline, instead of the most obvious and shortest route via Kanchanaburi. The Siamese sources say that Maha Nawrahta's main invasion route came from southern Tenasserim, crossing the Tenasserim range at Chumphon and Phetburi.

When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. “It is the key to self improvement!”, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don’t quite practice what they preach. Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve.

And the answer is?","completion":"The answer to the trivia question is Charles Darwin. On November 24, 1859, Charles Robert Darwin's groundbreaking work, \\"On the Origin of Species,\\" was published for the first time. Darwin was an English naturalist, geologist, and biologist who is best known for his contributions to the theory of evolution. In full, the book was titled \\"On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life.\\" Through his extensive research and observations, Darwin developed the concept of natural selection as the primary mechanism for evolution. This proposed that organisms with traits best suited for their environment have higher chances of survival and reproduction, thereby passing on their advantageous traits to their offspring. Over time, these adaptations accumulate, leading to the emergence of new species and the extinction of less adapted ones. Darwin's ideas, which were considered radical and controversial at the time, faced considerable religious and scientific resistance. Opponents argued that the theory contradicted the widely-held belief of divine creation. However, the scientific community eventually embraced the concept of evolution as the foundation for understanding biological diversity and the interconnectedness of life on Earth. Today, evolution is regarded as a fundamental concept in modern biology. \\"On the Origin of Species\\" has had a lasting impact on the fields of biology, ecology, and genetics, paving the way for countless scientific discoveries. The importance of Darwin's work cannot be overstated, as it provided a basis for understanding how life forms on Earth have diversified and adapted over millions of years. In honor of Charles Darwin's immense contributions to the scientific community, February 12th is celebrated as International Darwin Day, commemorating the birth anniversary of this pioneering naturalist and his transformative understanding of life on Earth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A cultivated and wealthy man, Coke made the Grand Tour in his youth and was away from England for six years between 1712 and 1718. It is likely he met both Burlington—the aristocratic architect at the forefront of the Palladian revival movement in England—and William Kent in Italy in 1715, and that in the home of Palladianism the idea of the mansion at Holkham was conceived. Coke returned to England, not only with a newly acquired library, but also an art and sculpture collection with which to furnish his planned new mansion. However, after his return, he lived a feckless life, preoccupying himself with drinking, gambling and hunting, and being a leading supporter of cockfighting. He made a disastrous investment in the South Sea Company and when the South Sea Bubble burst in 1720, the resultant losses delayed the building of Coke's planned new country estate for over ten years. Coke, who had been made Earl of Leicester in 1744, died in 1759—five years before the completion of Holkham—having never fully recovered his financial losses. Thomas's wife, Lady Margaret Tufton, Countess of Leicester (1700–1775), would oversee the finishing and furnishing of the house.Although Colen Campbell was employed by Thomas Coke in the early 1720s, the oldest existing working and construction plans for Holkham were drawn by Matthew Brettingham, under the supervision of Thomas Coke, in 1726. These followed the guidelines and ideals for the house as defined by Kent and Burlington. The Palladian revival style chosen was at this time making its return in England. The style made a brief appearance in England before the Civil War, when it was introduced by Inigo Jones. However, following the Restoration it was replaced in popular favour by the Baroque style. The \\"Palladian revival\\", popular in the 18th century, was loosely based on the appearance of the works of the 16th-century Italian architect Andrea Palladio.

Researchers believe peaks and valleys in baby spinach leaves could be a key reason why there have been numerous bacterial outbreaks involving leafy green vegetables Share this article: Nichola Kinsinger, a post-doctoral researher at UC Riverside. RIVERSIDE, Calif. (www.ucr.edu) — Ever wonder what the words triple-washed or pre-washed on a bag of baby spinach mean? Not much according to engineers at the University of California, Riverside. They discovered that small peaks and valleys in baby spinach leaves could be a key reason why there have been numerous bacterial outbreaks involving leafy green vegetables. Currently, disinfectant is put into the rinse water, and not specifically applied to the leaf surface. The researchers in the Bourns College of Engineering found that because of the varied topography of the spinach leaf nearly 15 percent of the leaf surface may reach concentrations as low as 1,000 times that of the bleach disinfectant being used to rinse it. As a result, as the leaves move through the processing facility after being rinsed the bacteria may continue to live, grow, spread, and contaminate other leaves and surfaces within the facility. Following rinsing under the low bleach condition, upwards of 90 percent of adhered bacteria were observed to remain attached to and survive on the leaf surface. “In a sense the leaf is protecting the bacteria and allowing it to spread,” said Nichola M. Kinsinger, a post-doctoral researcher working with Sharon Walker, a professor of chemical and environmental engineering. “It was surprising to discover how the leaf surface formed micro-environments that reduce the bleach concentration and in this case the very disinfection processes intended to clean, remove, and prevent contamination was found to be the potential pathway to amplifying foodborne outbreaks.” Kinsinger will present her research on August 19 at the 250th American Chemical Society National Meeting & Exposition. The talk is called, “Is our salad safe? Efficacy of disinfection techniques to decontaminate spinach leaves and reduce cross-contamination.” Kinsinger is also writing a paper, co-authored by Walker and Madeline Luth, an undergraduate student, about the findings. It will soon be submitted for publication. The Center for Disease Control estimates that 1 in 6 Americans become ill and 3,000 die annually from foodborne diseases. Additionally, this causes and an estimated over 75 billion per year loss for the food industry. Past research has found about 20 percent of single food commodity outbreaks from 2003 to 2008 were attributed to leafy green produce. Contamination of such minimally processed and ready-to-eat produce is of concern since it is frequently consumed uncooked or raw. One of these outbreaks, involving spinach, occurred in California in 2006. In all, 199 people in 26 states were infected with the outbreak strain of E. coli. Three died. Currently, the industry standard is to add 50 to 200 parts per million of bleach to the water used to rinse leafy green vegetables. But that is just a recommendation, not a requirement or regulation, Kinsinger said. For the research, Kinsinger and Walker designed a parallel plate flow chamber system to evaluate in real time the attachment and detachment of pathogens to the spinach in realistic water chemistries and flow conditions. Their work focused exclusively on baby spinach, however the issue of reduced bleach concentration across the leaf surface and other surfaces within the processing facility translates beyond the specific scenarios tested and demonstrates the limitation of bleach disinfection causing significant concern over public health. Future research will focus on a broader range of foods, surfaces in processing facilities and pathogen types, Kinsinger said. Despite their findings, Kinsinger notes that the United States has one of safest food supply system. Still, she says, “I recommend rinsing those leaves.” Kinsinger is a Riverside native who earned her bachelor’s and Ph.D. from UC Riverside. She has a postdoctoral research fellowship through the USDA National Institute for Food and Agriculture under the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative. Luth is a 2015-16 UCR Chancellor Research Fellow.

(Photo: iStock) Labels like “thoroughly washed” and “triple washed” make us feel comfortable chowing down on pre-washed baby spinach straight from the container. But researchers from the University of California, Riverside, say we might want to rethink that habit. They discovered that the small peaks and valleys in baby spinach leaves can harbor bacteria — even during the washing process they often undergo in food-processing plants. This, researchers say, could be an important reason why there have been several outbreaks of E. coli and salmonella in pre-washed baby spinach. The findings were presented Wednesday at the American Chemical Society National Meeting & Exposition. Pre-washed baby spinach is typically treated using a bleach disinfectant. But, researchers discovered, the shape of the baby spinach leaf means that 15 percent of the leaf’s surface may only see a very small percentage of the disinfectant. That remaining bacteria, which can include E. coli, salmonella, and Listeria monocytogenes, can survive, grow, and spread to the other leaves. Here’s the freaky part: After researchers rinsed baby spinach leaves under the typical disinfectant, nearly 90 percent of bacteria were still attached to (and alive on) the leaf’s surface. Related: Why Recent Food Poisoning Outbreaks All Began in This One State While the news is shocking to most people, “this is not a surprise to many of us in the food safety arena,” Mike Doyle, director of the Center for Food Safety at the University of Georgia, tells Yahoo Health. The danger in this bacteria remaining is that it can cause outbreaks of food-borne illness, which he says are more common than we realize. “There are many outbreaks that go unreported or uninvestigated because the CDC can’t investigate them all,” he says. The realization that spinach could cause food-borne illness reached national consciousness in 2006, when nearly 200 people from 26 states were infected with a strain of E. coli contracted from fresh spinach. Three people died from that outbreak. Fresh spinach was also involved in an outbreak in 2012 that infected 33 people in five states. Related: Whole Foods Tops List Of Companies Forced To Recall Food Unfortunately, washing your pre-washed baby spinach before eating it doesn’t make a difference, says Benjamin Chapman, PhD, an assistant professor and food safety extension specialist at North Carolina State University. “Rinsing isn’t going to do a whole heck of a lot for food safety,” Chapman tells Yahoo Health — it just may remove dirt or other physical objects that you can see. Cooking the spinach, however, will kill potentially harmful bacteria. But what about the whole “triple wash” label? Does that make pre-washed spinach safer? Chapman says there’s some confusion about what it means. Companies don’t triple wash spinach to disinfect it, he explains — they do it to reduce the likelihood of cross-contamination from one piece of spinach to another during the washing process. So, what does this mean for consumers? Experts are mixed. Doyle says he doesn’t eat raw spinach because of the risks, but Chapman eats pre-washed baby spinach out of the bag. “From a health standpoint, eating fruits and vegetables sometimes outweighs the risk,” Chapman says. However, he says he wouldn’t feed raw spinach to a person who is immunocompromised or elderly, just to be safe.

A genetic registry database uses biometrics to classify those so created as \\"valids\\" while those conceived by traditional means and more susceptible to genetic disorders are known as \\"in-valids\\". Genetic discrimination is illegal, but in practice genotype profiling is used to identify valids to qualify for professional employment while in-valids are relegated to menial jobs. Vincent Freeman is conceived without the aid of genetic selection; his genetics indicate a high probability of several disorders and an estimated life span of 30.2 years. His parents, regretting their decision, use genetic selection to give birth to their next child, Anton. Growing up, the two brothers often play a game of \\"chicken\\" by swimming out to sea with the first one returning to shore considered the loser; Vincent always loses. Vincent dreams of a career in space travel but is reminded of his genetic inferiority. One day Vincent challenges Anton to a game of chicken and bests him before Anton starts to drown. Vincent saves Anton and then leaves home. Vincent works as an in-valid, cleaning office spaces including that of Gattaca Aerospace Corporation, a space-flight conglomerate. He gets a chance to pose as a valid by using hair, skin, blood and urine samples from a donor, Jerome Eugene Morrow, who is a former swimming star paralyzed due to a car accident. With Jerome's genetic makeup, Vincent gains employment at Gattaca, and is assigned to be navigator for an upcoming trip to Saturn's moon Titan. To keep his identity hidden, Vincent must meticulously groom and scrub down daily to remove his own genetic material, and pass daily DNA scanning and urine tests using Jerome's samples. Gattaca becomes embroiled in controversy when one of its administrators is murdered a week before the flight. The police find a fallen eyelash of Vincent's at the scene. An investigation is launched to find the murderer, Vincent being the top suspect. Through this, Vincent becomes close to a co-worker, Irene Cassini, and falls in love with her. Though a valid, Irene has a higher risk of heart failure that will prevent her from joining any deep space Gattaca mission. Vincent also learns that Jerome's paralysis is by his own hand; after coming in second place in a swim meet, Jerome threw himself in front of a car. Jerome maintains that he was designed to be the best, yet wasn't, and that is the source of his suffering. Vincent repeatedly evades scrutiny from the investigation, and it is revealed that Gattaca's mission director was the killer, as the administrator was threatening to cancel the mission. Vincent learns the identity of the detective who closed the case, his brother Anton, who has become aware of Vincent's presence. The brothers meet, and Anton warns Vincent that what he is doing is illegal, but Vincent asserts that he has gotten to this position on his own merits. Anton challenges Vincent to one more game of chicken. As the two swim out in the dead of night, Anton is surprised at Vincent's stamina, and Vincent reveals that his trick to winning was not saving energy for the swim back. Anton turns back and begins to drown, but Vincent rescues him and swims them both back to shore using celestial navigation. On the day of the launch, Jerome reveals that he has stored enough DNA samples for Vincent to last two lifetimes upon his return, and gives him an envelope to open once in flight. After saying goodbye to Irene, Vincent prepares to board but discovers there is a final genetic test, and he currently lacks any of Jerome's samples. He is surprised when Dr. Lamar, the person in charge of background checks, reveals that he knows Vincent has been posing as a valid. Lamar admits that his son looks up to Vincent and wonders whether his son, genetically selected but \\"not all that they promised\\", could break the limits just as Vincent has. He passes Vincent as a valid. As the rocket launches, Jerome dons his swimming medal and immolates himself in his home's incinerator; Vincent opens the note from Jerome to find only a lock of Jerome's hair attached to it.

Iran executed a man in a rare public hanging in Tehran on Wednesday morning, local media reported. The man, identified only as \\"Yaqub,\\" was convicted of stabbing a man to death in broad daylight in October, said the official Islamic Republic News Agency. The public hanging, which was attended by the victims' family and large crowds of onlookers, took place in the main square of the affluent northern Tehran neighborhood of Sa'adat Abad. The October murder sparked outrage amongst Tehran residents after videos of the stabbing surfaced on the Internet and were replayed on Iranian state television. The killing took place in front of two police officers, the news agency said. Although executions are common in Iran, public ones are not. A death sentence can be handed down for crimes from murder to adultery. The latest execution brings the total number this year to 20, according to a CNN count from local media reports. On Monday, Iranian authorities hanged seven convicted drug traffickers in the city of Kermanshah, the news agency said. Amnesty International says Iran only trails China in the number of executions worldwide. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"1. A man known only as \\"Yaqub\\" was publicly executed in Tehran on Wednesday morning, as reported by local media. The execution was due to Yaqub's conviction for a murder committed in October, where he stabbed a man to death during daylight hours. This particular crime was very public, and sparked outrage throughout the city. 2. The execution was held in the main square of an affluent neighborhood called Sa'adat Abad, located in northern Tehran. The victim's family and large crowds attended the public execution, which is a rarity in Iran. 3. The murder for which Yaqub was convicted was especially shocking because not only did it take place in broad daylight, but also because it happened in front of two police officers. Videos of the incident had circulated widely on the Internet and were also replayed on Iranian state television, further fueling public outrage. 4. Executions in Iran are common, but public ones are not. A wide range of crimes can lead to a death sentence in Iran, extending from murder to adultery. 5. With this execution the total number of executions in Iran this year to date has risen to 20, according to counts from CNN's local media. It's mentioned that just a few days prior, on Monday, seven convicted drug traffickers were hanged in the city of Kermanshah. 6. The article concluded by citing Amnesty International's statistics to illustrate that Iran ranks second in the world after China regarding the number of executions carried out."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context: In 1878 a hardened American gunfighter arrives in a small town in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies, a place that doesn't understand or appreciate the brutal code of the American Wild West. Gunslinger Sean Lafferty, known as the Montana Kid, has a bounty on his head for killing eleven people across the western United States. He arrives in town on his horse, riding backwards, bound, with a noose around his neck, and dragging the broken tree branch over which a group had tried to hang him on the American side of the border. After being helped off his horse by a young Chinese girl named Adell, he begins to explore the town, starting with the town general store. After leaving the store, he finds his horse gone and accuses Jack, the blacksmith, of stealing it, even though Jack was simply replacing the horse's damaged shoes. After unsuccessfully trying to intimidate the blacksmith, the Montana Kid decides to call him out. Since the blacksmith has no gun, though, Sean can't shoot him because the Kid lives by a code of ethics that prevents him from killing unarmed men. When she witnesses this, Jane Taylor, one of the townsfolk, says the Kid can have her broken gun (to fix and give to Jack) if he builds her a windmill. Sean proceeds to go with her and stays in a sod house at her farm, alternately working on the windmill and repairing the gun. After a few days, however, the Kid begins to develop feelings toward Jane while also becoming friends with the townsfolk. In the meantime, a roaming band of American bounty hunters crosses into Canada and heads for the town to claim the price on Sean's head. They terrorize a camp of Chinese railroad workers to find out his whereabouts. Guess a valid title for it!

But this is because i have not been able to try anything because of all of the moms and dads and their offspring in the place. I have tried on THREE separate occasions to go in and try the coffee and waffles only to find all of the tables and the chairs at the bar occupied. I am always reassured by the staff that a table will soon open up, but I have waited up to 20 minutes only to find families camping at the tables. The last straw occurred on my visit on Tuesday, December 28th. Of course, all of the tables were occupied by \\"breeders\\" and their children, so we were going to take 2 of the chairs at the bar. Just as we were going to sit down, a woman puts her kids in the chairs to watch the waffles being made.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: The final large reception room on the first floor is the Hondecoeter Room (16), so named because of the three huge oil paintings by Melchior d'Hondecoeter (1636–1695), depicting scenes of birds in courtyards, which are fitted into the neo-Carolean panelling. The panelling was introduced to the room by the 3rd Earl Brownlow in 1876, when it was furnished as the principal dining room of the mansion. The room was initially created as a library in 1808 from the upper part of the earlier kitchen which had originally risen two stories. The West staircase (14) was originally a service stairs, and would have been plainer in decor, but by the late nineteenth century it was in regular use by the family.Either side of the Marble Hall, lie the Great Staircase (2) and the Tapestry Room (11), which contains a collection of early eighteenth century Mortlake tapestries. The Great Staircase to the east of the Marble Hall is unusually placed at Belton, as in a house of this period one would expect to find the staircase in the hall. The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall. Thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house. The Great Dining Room, now the Library, has been greatly altered and all traces of Carolean decoration removed, first by James Wyatt in 1778 when it was transformed into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling, and again in 1876, when its use was again changed, this time to a library. The room contains some 6000 volumes, a superb example of book collecting over 350 years. When Lord Tyrconnel died in 1754 a catalogue of his library identified almost 2,300 books. Almost all of these remain in the Belton library today. Rupert Gunnis attributed the carved marble chimneypiece depicting two Roman goddesses to Sir Richard Westmacott.Leading from the Library is the Queen's Room, the former \\"Best Bed Chamber\\".
