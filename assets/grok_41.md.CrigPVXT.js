The paragraph describes morning glory as the common name for over 1,000 species of flowering plants in the family Convolvulaceae. It further explains that these plants belong to several genera. Therefore, it is evident that morning glory refers to a group of flowering plants, and as flowers are the reproductive structures of flowering plants (also known as angiosperms), it is accurate to say that morning glory is a flower. Moreover, it should be noted that flowering plants are recognized by their unique characteristic of producing flowers during their reproductive cycle. As morning glory collectively refers to over 1,000 species of these plants, it implies that each of these species produces flowers that exhibit variations in their physical appearance, structure, and even blooming habits. In summary, the provided information confirms that morning glory is a flower, specifically referring to various species of flowering plants in the family Convolvulaceae.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Among the tropical oceans, the western Indian Ocean hosts one of the largest concentration of phytoplankton blooms in summer, due to the strong monsoon winds. The monsoonal wind forcing leads to a strong coastal and open ocean upwelling, which introduces nutrients into the upper zones where sufficient light is available for photosynthesis and phytoplankton production. These phytoplankton blooms support the marine ecosystem, as the base of the marine food web, and eventually the larger fish species. The Indian Ocean accounts for the second largest share of the most economically valuable tuna catch. Its fish are of great and growing importance to the bordering countries for domestic consumption and export. Fishing fleets from Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna.Research indicates that increasing ocean temperatures are taking a toll on the marine ecosystem. A study on the phytoplankton changes in the Indian Ocean indicates a decline of up to 20% in the marine phytoplankton in the Indian Ocean, during the past six decades. The tuna catch rates have also declined abruptly during the past half century, mostly due to increased industrial fisheries, with the ocean warming adding further stress to the fish species.Endangered marine species include the dugong, seals, turtles, and whales.An Indian Ocean garbage patch was discovered in 2010 covering at least 5 million square kilometres (1.9 million square miles). Riding the southern Indian Ocean Gyre, this vortex of plastic garbage constantly circulates the ocean from Australia to Africa, down the Mozambique Channel, and back to Australia in a period of six years, except for debris that get indefinitely stuck in the centre of the gyre.The garbage patch in the Indian Ocean will, according to a 2012 study, decrease in size after several decades to vanish completely over centuries. Over several millennia, however, the global system of garbage patches will accumulate in the North Pacific.In 2016 six new animal... I am facing a new situation today: Two of Earth's oceans provide vast quantities of fish for human consumption. The Indian ocean hosts a large concentration of phytoplankton blooms in summer.

Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which ocean experiences more monsoonal wind forcing? A:","completion":"Based on the background article you provided, the Indian Ocean experiences more monsoonal wind forcing. This is because the strong monsoon winds lead to coastal and open ocean upwelling in the western Indian Ocean, which introduces nutrients into the upper zones where sufficient light is available for photosynthesis and phytoplankton production. This results in one of the largest concentrations of phytoplankton blooms in summer, supporting the marine ecosystem, including valuable tuna catch.

Article:","completion":"Title: \\"Man of Steel\\" Soars to Record-Breaking June Opening, Leaving Competitors in the Dust \\"Man of Steel,\\" the most recent iteration of the iconic superhero story featuring Superman, has flown to unprecedented heights. The film, which delves into the backstory of the beloved caped crusader, shattered previous records for a June opening weekend, surpassing the impressive 110 million benchmark set by \\"Toy Story 3\\" in 2010. The film's success can be attributed to its phenomenal cast, led by Henry Cavill in the titular role, who fully embraces the complexities of the character. Cavill's performance, which perfectly balances Superman's otherworldly abilities and the vulnerably human aspect of his personality, breathes new life into the storied franchise. Additionally, Amy Adams, known for her diverse and impactful roles, shines as the tenacious reporter Lois Lane, adding depth and nuance to her portrayal of Superman's iconic love interest. The cinematic retelling of Superman's origin story introduces audiences to a particularly fascinating aspect of the character's mythology. It explores the rich history and culture of Superman's home planet, Krypton, as well as the struggle between nature and nurture in shaping the superhero's identity. Furthermore, the film delves into the poignant and morally complex relationship between Superman and his biological father, Jor-El, who chose to send his son to Earth in the hopes of saving both their race and humanity. \\"Man of Steel\\" left its competitors far behind, with the R-rated comedy \\"This is the End\\" claiming the second spot in box office revenue with 32.8 million.

The coming together of an exceptionally talented cast with intriguing, hero-centric narratives is a winning formula that's clearly resonating with audiences. In sum, the groundbreaking success of \\"Man of Steel\\" demonstrates the enduring appeal of iconic superheroes and their stories. Its impressive cast, led by Henry Cavill as the charismatic and complex Superman, elevates the film above other summer blockbusters, and the exploration of the character's origins adds an exhilarating layer to the time-honored tale.

Here is an article: Wall Street started the week substantially higher Monday morning before losing its grip on those opening gains and finishing just barely above the break-even mark. The initial advance of more than 200 points on the Dow Jones industrial average did not seem to stand on firm footing, with little other than relief after four weeks of declines supporting the move. That proved insufficient, and by the close the Dow Jones industrial average was up just 37 points at 10,855, the Nasdaq 4 points higher at 2,345 and the S&P 500 was unchanged at 1,124. Twin concerns over Europe’s sovereign debt crisis – the ECB reported it purchased another €14.3 billion in Greek, Irish, Portuguese, Spanish and Italian debt last week – and the shaky footing of the U.S. economy remain in focus. On the latter point, investors are worried that a rocky economy could mean bullish earnings forecasts will need to be drastically reduced, and stocks have been trading to that effect during the market’s four-week losing streak. Several names that have been battered recently were on the mend Monday though, including Hewlett-Packard. The tech heavyweight, which dropped more than 20% late last week on news it may bail on the PC business and will shut down its Palm devices unit, gained 3.6%. One beaten-down corner of the market that got little relief was the banking sector. Bank of America shares slumped 7.9%, while JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup each lost more than 2%. The threat of recession is particularly troubling for a banking industry that is still hurting from the after-effects of the last downturn driven by the collapse of the housing bubble. In a note Monday, HSBC’s chief U.S. economist Kevin Logan warns that the ongoing de-risking on fears of a recession could turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy. “Attempts to reduce risk do not necessarily lead to recession,” Logan writes. “But, in a weak economy already hobbled by lackluster growth in consumer spending, a downward shift by both businesses and consumers to lower risks and reduce spending could be enough to tip the economy into recession.” HSBC still expects weak, but positive, U.S. growth for the back half of 2011 and into 2012, but warns that the risk of recession is clearly rising. That risk is something that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is likely to discuss Friday, when he delivers a hotly-anticipated speech in Jackson Hole, Wyo. Opinions on whether another round of quantitative easing is forthcoming vary, but few seemed inclined to make big bets on the market either way heading toward the speech Monday.

Keep in mind that arbitration provisions in wills have dubious legal authority in some states. If you intend to follow the provision, be aware that the other party to the dispute may object or refuse to submit to arbitration. b). In some states, even the arbitration agreement may designate arbitration as an arbitrator. Your family law needs to be defined in the course of negotiation. c).

Remember, having that special meeting is often the only way for everyone to agree in difficult situations. d) Lastly, make sure to write down important details like names, addresses, and the contact information of any helpers like lawyers.

Evidence of Deception: The coworker later posted pictures on social media from a party, which contradict the severity of the alleged injury. This gives the narrator a strong reason to believe they were lied to and their coworker's absence was not justified. 4. Betrayal of Trust: As teammates and presumably friends, there is an expectation of trust and support. The coworker failing to be truthful and abandoning the team during a difficult time can be seen as a betrayal, thus intensifying the narrator's anger."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Iran has rejected Obama's offer to discuss their nuclear programme saying the U.S. was proposing talks while 'pointing a gun at Iran.' The refusal came as state television broadcast footage allegedly extracted from a CIA drone captured in 2011.

View from the sky: Iran's state TV has broadcast footage allegedly extracted from a CIA drone captured in 2011. Location: The black and white footage shows an aerial view of an airport and a city, said to be Kandahar in Afghanistan. Claims: Tehran has long claimed it managed to reverse-engineer the RQ-170 Sentinel and that it is capable of launching its own production line for the unmanned aircraft. Tehran has long claimed it managed to. reverse-engineer the RQ-170 Sentinel and that it is capable of launching. its own production line for the unmanned aircraft. The drone was used for covert. surveillance such as the operation to spy on the Pakistan compound of. Osama Bin Laden before he was killed in a U.S. raid in May. The TV also showed images purported to be the Sentinel landing at a base in eastern Iran. Narrating the video, the. Revolutionary Guard's air space chief, General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, says. in one part that only after Iran captured the drone did it realise it 'belongs to the CIA.' Iranian officials have said the drone. came down over eastern Iran in December 2011, hundreds of miles from the cluster of. nuclear sites in the central and north-west of the country. On display: The captured RQ-170 Sentinel reconnaissance drone which Iran claims it tricked into landing in the country. Paraded for the cameras: Iranian Revolutionary Guard's General Amir-Ali Hajizadeh (left) inspects the U.S. RQ-170 drone. Malfunction: U.S. officials claim the drone broke down, but cannot explain how it was still in relatively pristine condition when found by the Iranians. Iran claims it 'took control of the drone and landed it' but US officials have said it malfunctioned and had to land. 'This aircraft has carried out many operations in the countries around Iran,' the narrator says. 'In the operations taken place in Pakistan, this aircraft guided many of the clashes ... Iran believes it can 'mass produce' the captured drone by 'reverse engineering' the aircraft. When the drone went missing President Obama made it clear the U.S. wanted the top-secret aircraft back. 'We have asked for it back. We'll see how the Iranians respond,' Obama said during a White House news conference. But in a later interview Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made it clear his country would not grant the U.S. request. Graphic: The RQ-170 was reportedly used to watch former Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden during the Navy SEAL mission that killed him. 'The Americans have perhaps decided to give us this spy plane,' Ahmadinejad said. 'We now have control of this plane.' Speaking through an interpreter, Ahmadinejad said: 'There are people here who have been able to control this spy plane, who can surely analyze this plane's system also. … In any case, now we have this spy plane.' At the time Obama wouldn't comment on what the Iranians might learn from studying the downed aircraft. Defense. Secretary Leon Panetta said it's difficult to know 'just frankly how. much they're going to be able to get from having obtained those parts.' Request: President Obama during a 2011 White House news conference when he asked for the drone back. Panetta said the request to return the drone was appropriate. 'I don't expect that that will happen,' he said. 'But I think it's important to make that request.' Former U.S. Vice-President Dick Cheney blasted Mr Obama for his soft approach in trying to get the surveillance plane back, insisting he should have ordered an airstrike over Iran instead. He told CNN: 'The right response would have been to go in immediately after it had gone down and destroy it. 'You can do that from the air and, in effect, make it impossible for them to benefit from having captured that drone, but [Obama] asked nicely for them to return it, and they aren't going to.'

Premise: \\"Arch how are you doing tonight\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"How are you drinks treating you tonight Arch?\\" true?","completion":"In order to assess whether the hypothesis \\"How are your drinks treating you tonight, Arch?\\" is true based on the given premise \\"Arch, how are you doing tonight?\\", we need to analyze the similarities and differences between the two statements, as well as the context and intent behind the statements. First, let's break down the given premise \\"Arch, how are you doing tonight?\\" in terms of its components: 1. The addressee of the question is Arch. 2. The speaker is asking about Arch's well-being. 3. The time frame referred to is the current evening or nighttime. Now, let us analyze the hypothesis \\"How are your drinks treating you tonight, Arch?\\" by examining its components: 1. The addressee of the question is still Arch. 2. The speaker is asking about the effect of drinks on Arch's well-being. 3. The time frame referred to is the same, being the current evening or nighttime. Both the premise and the hypothesis seem to share similarities in addressing Arch and referring to the current evening or nighttime. However, the primary difference lies in the nature of information being asked. The premise is a general inquiry about Arch's well-being while the hypothesis is more specific, asking about the impact of drinks on Arch's well-being during that night. In order to examine the truthfulness of the hypothesis based on the given premise, we need to consider the context and intent behind the statements. If the conversation revolves mainly around a social gathering where alcohol is being consumed, and the speaker is aware that Arch is consuming drinks, then the hypothesis might be seen as a logical extension of the premise, with the statement being more specific yet still pertaining to the same general context. In such a context, it could be considered true when compared to the more general inquiry about Arch's well-being. However, if there is no mention or indication of Arch consuming drinks, or the context of the inquiry is unrelated to the consumption of beverages, then the hypothesis would not be true in comparison to the given premise. It would be inaccurate to suggest that the effect of drinks on Arch's well-being is being inquired about when the premise is simply asking about Arch's well-being during the same time frame. Thus, while the hypothesis shares some similarities with the given premise, such as addressing Arch and referring to the same time frame, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is universally true based on the premise alone. The context and intent behind the statements play a crucial role in determining the relationship between the two, and in cases where the hypothesis is found to be true in relation to the premise, it can mostly be attributed to a contextual extension of the general inquiry presented by the premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. One of the key components to a healthy and fulfilling relationship is offering your partner support for their personal endeavors. Your partner was a model before they met you and, if they continue their career, understand they will sometimes have to sacrifice spending time with you to further their career. Ask them how work is going. Listen to them vent or talk about upcoming jobs they’re excited for. On the flip side, don’t get angry if your partner decides to leave modeling to follow another career path. Most models don’t spend their entire lives modeling. Getting angry over their decision to leave may communicate that you’re only with their for their fame and hurt your relationship. If your partner has gained considerable fame, your relationship will inevitably end up within the public eye. Once things start getting serious between the two of you, sit down with them to discuss your privacy as a couple. It’s okay if you’re fine with the spotlight, but it’s also okay if you want more privacy. One point to consider is whether you’re okay with being photographed with your partner while on dates and attending events. Do you want to be mentioned on their social media and in interviews? Being a model requires a lot of traveling to different job locations and events. You won’t always be able to accompany your partner to different areas, so you will have to discuss whether you’re okay with long distance relationships and how you’ll communicate during these periods. Web messenger clients like LINE and Telegram are great for keeping in touch over long distances, since they don’t require specific network signals to function. Facetime and Skype can help you talk in a more face to face manner. Setting aside time to spend together will strengthen your relationship, especially if you’re indulging in a common interest. Cook meals with your partner. Cuddle together as you watch a television show or movie you both love. Take dancing classes together to learn a fun new skill. Enjoy your time with each other as much as you can to keep your relationship strong. Fame aside, your partner is still a regular person and will appreciate being treated that way. Don’t let their fame go to your head. Always remember who they are and what you love about them as a person, whether it’s their passion for a particular hobby or a charming personal quirk. Summary:","completion":"Support your partner's modeling career, communicate effectively, respect their decisions, maintain privacy if needed, and cherish the time spent together to ensure a healthy and fulfilling relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: what is scurvy disease? Would \\"In infants, scurvy is sometimes referred to as Barlow's disease, named after Sir Thomas Barlow , a British physician who described it.\\" be a reasonable answer?","completion":"Scurvy, a disease caused by a deficiency in vitamin C (ascorbic acid), is a condition primarily associated with malnutrition resulting from inadequate intake or absorption of vitamin C. The statement \\"In infants, scurvy is sometimes referred to as Barlow's disease, named after Sir Thomas Barlow, a British physician who described it,\\" is accurate, as Barlow's disease is an alternative name specifically for the infantile form of this condition. Vitamin C plays a crucial role in the body's collagen synthesis (a structural protein found in connective tissues) and contributes to various essential metabolic reactions. When the body does not receive an appropriate amount of this vital nutrient, it leads to several complications, including scurvy. While scurvy is more commonly associated with sailors during the Age of Exploration, who endured long voyages without access to fresh fruits and vegetables, it can still occur in modern times. The risk factors for developing scurvy include inadequate dietary intake of vitamin C, alcoholism, elderly individuals living in isolation, restrictive diets, malabsorption syndromes, and certain underlying health conditions that hinder the absorption of nutrients. The symptoms of scurvy vary based on the stage and severity of the disease but typically start with fatigue, weakness, and irritability. As the condition progresses, one may develop more severe manifestations such as: 1. Anemia: Vitamin C deficiency impairs iron absorption, leading to reduced red blood cell production. 2. Swollen, bleeding gums: The weakened collagen synthesis causes gums to become soft, inflamed, and vulnerable to bleeding. 3. Bruising and petechiae: Blood vessels become fragile due to the lack of collagen, resulting in tiny spots of bleeding under the skin called petechiae and increased susceptibility to bruising. 4. Joint pain and swelling: Weakness in the connective tissues contributes to pain and inflammation in the joints. 5. Poor wound healing: The impaired collagen synthesis hinders the healing process of injuries and other skin issues. 6. Hyperkeratosis: Dry, thickened, bumpy skin that develops as a result of abnormal keratin production due to vitamin C deficiency. In infants specifically, scurvy (Barlow's disease) can present with unique symptoms such as pseudoparalysis, during which the baby appears reluctant to move uncomfortable limbs due to pain and tenderness in bones and joints. Other signs include irritability, poor weight gain, and delayed developmental milestones. Diagnosis and treatment of scurvy involve assessment of the patient's dietary and clinical history, physical examination, and sometimes blood tests to measure vitamin C levels. Treatment is simple and effective, consisting of oral or intravenous vitamin C supplementation until symptoms resolve, followed by maintaining a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables to ensure adequate vitamin C intake and prevent the recurrence of scurvy. In conclusion, scurvy is a disease resulting from a deficiency of vitamin C, with symptoms varying based on its stage and severity. Barlow's disease is an accurate term for the infantile form of scurvy, and Sir Thomas Barlow was instrumental in describing this condition. To avoid scurvy, it is crucial to consume a balanced diet with adequate amounts of vitamin C found primarily in fruits and vegetables."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A compass is a simple geometrical tool that has been utilized for centuries by mathematicians, architects, engineers, and artists. It is designed specifically to draw circles with precision and accuracy and can also be used for a variety of other geometric constructions. A compass typically consists of two legs joined at one end by a hinge, allowing the legs to be adjusted apart or together. One leg features a sharp metal point, called the needle or spike, which serves as the center or pivot point. The other leg has a lead or graphite tip, the pencil, which is used to trace the circle's circumference. In some compass models, the pencil-end can be replaced with a pen, stylus, or piece of charcoal for different drawing applications. To draw a circle using a compass, you should follow these steps: 1. Loosen the hinge mechanism, if necessary, and adjust the legs of the compass to the desired radius (distance between the needle point and the pencil lead). 2. Tighten the hinge mechanism to maintain the compass's chosen width and to ensure a consistent radius while drawing. 3. Place the needle point on the paper or drawing surface where you want the center of the circle to be. 4. Apply gentle pressure on the needle point to keep it in position, and gently press the pencil lead against the drawing surface. 5. Holding the compass vertically, rotate the compass around the needle point, allowing the pencil to trace a circle. Ensure that both legs remain fixed at the hinge and pressure is consistent throughout, so the circle remains unbroken and accurate. 6. Complete the rotation to finish the circle. In addition to drawing circles, a compass can be used to draw other geometric shapes and constructions such as arcs, bisected angles, and equilateral triangles. It also plays a vital role in constructing loci and accurate scaled drawings. In summary, the compass is the go-to math instrument for drawing circles and constructing various geometric shapes. Its simple design and functionality make it an essential tool for students, professionals, and enthusiasts in various fields of science, engineering, and art."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question 2: What happens in aquarius ascendant when the 7th house lord is in the 8th house with kethu and moon is in the 7th house? Select from: - no; - yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Step 1: Understand the terms and concepts in the questions. - darakaraka: In Vedic Astrology, darakaraka is the planet that holds the lowest degree in a person's chart, signifying marriage and spouse. - 7th house lord: The 7th house lord is the ruling planet of the 7th house in a person's horoscope, symbolizing partnership and marriage. - Aquarius ascendant: A person's rising sign, or ascendant, is the zodiac sign that was rising on the eastern horizon at the time of their birth. Aquarius ascendant refers to them having Aquarius as their rising sign. - 8th house: The 8th house in astrology represents transformation, change, mysterious events, and unexpected occurrences. - Kethu: Ketu is a shadow planet in Vedic astrology, signifying spirituality, detachment, and liberation. - Moon in the 7th house: The moon's placement in the 7th house shows an emotional connection to the spouse/partner and influences relationship dynamics. Step 2: Compare darakaraka with the 7th house lord. Darakaraka is the planet holding the lowest degree in a person's chart, which pertains to marriage and spouse, while the 7th house lord is the ruler of the 7th house in the horoscope, which primarily signifies partnership and marriage. Main difference: Darakaraka can be any planet in a person's chart, depending on the degree, while the 7th house lord is a specific planet ruling the 7th house. Answer 1: Darakaraka is different from the 7th house lord because it can be any planet holding the lowest degree in a person's chart related to marriage and spouse, whereas the 7th house lord is the specific planet ruling the 7th house, primarily signifying partnership and marriage. Step 3: Analyze the effects of the 7th house lord in the 8th house with Ketu and the Moon in the 7th house in Aquarius ascendant. In Aquarius ascendant, when the 7th house lord is in the 8th house with Ketu, it indicates transformation and mysterious events related to partnership and marriage. The presence of Ketu could signify spiritual growth and detachment from materialistic desires in relationships. With Moon being in the 7th house, it shows an emotional connection to the spouse, and the relationship might be influenced by emotional fluctuations. This placement can nurture a deep bond, but there can be emotional volatility and vulnerability attached. Answer 2: In Aquarius ascendant with the 7th house lord in the 8th house with Ketu and Moon in the 7th house, the native may experience transformation, detachment and mysterious elements in their partnerships, while also having a strong emotional bond with their spouse, emotional fluctuations and vulnerability in their relationship. Step 4: Determine if the answers to both questions would be the same. The first question deals with the difference between darakaraka and the 7th house lord, whereas the second question refers to the effects of specific astrological placements in Aquarius ascendant. Although both questions are related to astrology and partnerships, they are addressing different aspects.

After rescuing the EU officials and destroying the cyborgs, ESWAT return to Olympus, where Briareos is confined to hospital until he recovers, while Deunan continues ESWAT work. When Deunan's commanding officer Lance introduces her to her new partner, Tereus, she is shocked as her partner resembles Briareos' human form.Deunan confronts Lance for an explanation, and is given the tour of the new Bioroid production facility. During the tour, Hitomi, a bioroid that Deunan befriended during those events, is mentioned to now be a minister of political affairs. Here it is shown that Tereus is actually a Bioroid; a prototype for a whole new production line of Bioroids to be soldiers without negative emotions to impact their judgment in fighting. As his physical and mental strength was found to be most desirable in ESWAT, Briareos' DNA was used mostly in Tereus' design. Reluctantly, Deunan is partnered up with Tereus to evaluate his performance. While departing, Deunan encounters Hitomi and Hitomi gives her a ride home.

Samantha, a new transfer student, is beautiful, smart and dead-set on becoming valedictorian of their graduating class. For the first time, David strives to defy mediocrity and to make an impact on his school life. Introducing smart techniques, Samantha urges her classmates to form a study group to ace the upcoming history final exam, which will determine the top student of their class. Determined to impress Samantha, David joins the study group despite the reluctance of his best friend, Mike, who believes that studying is a waste of time. As the days pass, David struggles to keep up with the study group, while Samantha's dedication to her studies catches the attention of other members of the group. Feeling the pressure to succeed, David, along with the critical nature of his demanding father Jim Miller, who is also the school principal, decides to take a risky move – he decides to cheat on the history test.

(b). positive.","completion":"The sentiment of the given sentence: \\"lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny -- er , comedy -- like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank\\" is (a). negative. The statement portrays a negative sentiment for several reasons. Firstly, the use of the word \\"misogyny\\" stands out. Misogyny refers to prejudice against women, and this has negative connotations. It is clear that the speaker is addressing a specific negative trait attributed to Lawrence's style. Secondly, the phrasing of \\"er , comedy\\" suggests a sarcastic tone, as if comedy is not the predominant element in Lawrence's style. Instead, it implies that his trademark is more about misogyny than comedy. Sarcasm is often used to convey an unfavorable perception or to emphasize negativity. Additionally, the similes used to describe the way Lawrence presents his comedy contribute to the negative sentiment. The imagery of a \\"human volcano\\" implies an uncontrollable and destructive force. Similarly, the comparison to an \\"overflowing septic tank\\" paints a picture of something unpleasant and repulsive. Both examples indicate a negative evaluation of Lawrence's performance or style. In summary, the choice of words in the sentence, such as \\"misogyny,\\" the sarcastic tone, and the unappealing similes used to describe Lawrence's style, convey a negative sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer a question about the following article about Space Race: In simple terms, the Cold War could be viewed as an expression of the ideological struggle between communism and capitalism. The United States faced a new uncertainty beginning in September 1949, when it lost its monopoly on the atomic bomb. American intelligence agencies discovered that the Soviet Union had exploded its first atomic bomb, with the consequence that the United States potentially could face a future nuclear war that, for the first time, might devastate its cities. Given this new danger, the United States participated in an arms race with the Soviet Union that included development of the hydrogen bomb, as well as intercontinental strategic bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of delivering nuclear weapons. A new fear of communism and its sympathizers swept the United States during the 1950s, which devolved into paranoid McCarthyism. With communism spreading in China, Korea, and Eastern Europe, Americans came to feel so threatened that popular and political culture condoned extensive \\"witch-hunts\\" to expose communist spies. Part of the American reaction to the Soviet atomic and hydrogen bomb tests included maintaining a large Air Force, under the control of the Strategic Air Command (SAC). SAC employed intercontinental strategic bombers, as well as medium-bombers based close to Soviet airspace (in western Europe and in Turkey) that were capable of delivering nuclear payloads. ICBMs is an abbreviation for what?","completion":"ICBMs is an abbreviation for Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles. These are long-range missiles that are capable of delivering nuclear weapons over great distances, typically thousands of miles. They played a significant role in the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, as both superpowers sought to develop increasingly advanced and capable delivery systems for their nuclear arsenals. ICBMs were seen as a strategic deterrent, as their ability to strike targets far away from their launch sites made them a key component of each country's nuclear arsenal, ensuring a devastating retaliatory strike if one side were to launch a nuclear attack on the other."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Q: A disaccharide is a pair of monosaccharides. disaccharides are formed via dehydration synthesis, and the bond linking them is referred to as a glycosidic bond (glyco- = “sugar”). three disaccharides (shown in figure 2.19) are important to humans. these are sucrose, commonly referred to as table sugar; lactose, or milk sugar; and maltose, or this?

Passport photos should be a good representation of what you usually look like so that you don’t get detained. Do not wear a hat or any other head covering unless you already do so on a daily basis for religious purposes. If you do wear a head covering, for a U.S. passport, your face has to be visible. The covering can’t hide your hairline or cast shadows over any part of your face. If you usually wear makeup, go ahead and put it on as usual. If you never wear makeup, you probably don’t want to put on a ton of it for the photo. You won’t look like yourself, and you could get detained. Wear a little oil-absorbing powder to prevent shine if you want to. This will be most useful on your forehead or nose. Even if you don’t usually wear makeup, you may want to put a bit of concealer or powder over any dark circles under your eyes. These dark places can cause a glare (and make you look sick or tired). Remember that you may need to use your passport for many occasions other than traveling. (For example, sometimes you can use it to get a background check when you apply for a job.) Try to wear solid colored clothing in muted tones. Wear something flattering and reasonably comfortable. Don’t wear anything too flashy, or it will cause people to look at your outfit instead of your face. Pay most attention to your shirt, since that’s what will be in the photo. Scoop or v-necks work nicely.If it’s too low cut or if it’s a tank top, you might look naked, so check the neckline. Since you will be in front of a white or black background, avoid those colors. Choose colors that flatter your skin tone. Wear a minimal amount of jewelry. Uniforms or anything that resembles a uniform (including camouflage) are not allowed unless they are religious attire that you wear every day. Some people have reported that the passport office rejected their photo because it looked too much like previous photos (which means that the passport office couldn’t confirm that it was a recent picture), so you should dress a bit differently than you did in your last photo if this is an update.","completion":"For a passport photo, make sure you look like yourself and don't wear anything fancy or unusual. Keep your hair normal and don't wear a hat, unless it's for religion and you wear it every day. You can wear makeup if you usually do, but don't put too much. Wear simple clothes with nice colors, but not white or black, as the background will be the same. Don't wear uniforms or too much jewelry.

Freda Green thought the battle was over when her husband returned from the Vietnam War. But more than seven years after his death in 2003, she says the U.S. Defense Department is demanding she repay more than 41,000 in benefits the government shelled out as part of an insurance policy he paid into. \\"They gave me 45 days to pay it back,\\" said Green, 74, who claims the federal government began garnishing her benefit payments when she couldn't pay it all back at once. \\"They said 45 days, and two weeks later they started taking it out of my check,\\" she said. Green says 577 is now being deducted from her military benefit check each month. The reason: She got remarried last year. It is a confusing section of a federal law that affects some 57,000 military spouses -- and their children -- who receive military benefits and are now being forced to pay Uncle Sam back after walking down the aisle again, according to Norb Ryan, a retired Navy vice admiral and president of the Military Officers Association of America. \\"Here we are taxing the groups that have done the most for this country,\\" said Ryan. \\"If I were in the Pentagon, I'd be awfully embarrassed by this situation.\\" A Pentagon spokesman declined to comment on Green's case. Green's first husband, Jerry, a 33-year Air Force veteran who served during World War II, Korea and Vietnam, elected to pay monthly premiums on an insurance policy for supplemental survivor benefit coverage, she said. The program is a Department of Defense plan, similar to an annuity, that provides the benefit to the surviving spouse. When her husband died from heart and lung problems that the Air Force determined were military-related, Green had to choose between collecting his pension or a separate monthly benefit from the Veterans Administration. She chose the latter. In addition to the monthly benefit, the Pentagon sent her more than 41,000 from the government-sponsored insurance policy her husband purchased. Green said she received the lump-sum check shortly after his death. It prompted her to call the Defense Department for an explanation, she said. \\"I called Air Force finance, and they said, 'No. That's your money.' I was afraid the money wasn't mine and they made a mistake.\\" The letter from the Air Force reads: \\"Because Jerry died from 100 percent service connected disabilities, all of the money he paid for survivor's benefits is to be refunded.\\" \\"That's what they told me,\\" she recalled. Green said she then cashed the check, paying more than 6,000 in taxes. In 2009, a federal judge ruled survivors could get both of the original benefits if they remarry after the age of 57. Green -- who was remarried last April -- then became entitled to collect her husband's pension in addition to the separate Veterans Administration benefits. Uncle Sam is now paying both, but wants the 41,000 back from the supplemental insurance policy, plus 6% interest -- all because of her marriage. A bill that Rep. Joe Wilson, R-South Carolina, introduced last week is meant to fix the issue. \\"A cost of war is not just guns and ammunition and tanks and airplanes,\\" said Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida. \\"A cost of war is taking care of veterans and also taking care of the deceased service members widows, widowers, and orphans.\\" The issue may be cost. In congressional testimony, Pentagon officials have opposed eliminating the offset because they believe it would create an inequity as some spouses would receive two benefits while others would receive only one. Ryan said it will cost more than 600 million each year to fully cover all 57,000 remarried military spouses. \\"The military gave her the money back when he died,\\" said Suzanne Gerstner, a spokeswoman for Gold Star Wives of America, a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping military widows. \\"Now they want it back.\\" Gerstner also said it is unfair that Green, and others like her, have to repay the full amount, including the 6,000 she lost in government taxes. \\"She paid taxes (and) she's going to pay taxes again,\\" Gerstner said. \\"This isn't right under anybody's book.\\" Green says Congress needs to change the law. \\"They need to fix it now,\\" she said, saying she feels as though Pentagon and elected officials are \\"waiting for the military widows to die off.\\" Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Freda Green, a 74-year-old widow of a Vietnam War veteran, is being forced to repay the U.S. Defense Department over 41,000 in benefits granted as part of an insurance policy following her husband's death in 2003. After Green remarried last year, 577 began being deducted from her military benefit check each month due to a confusing federal law. This law affects around 57,000 military spouses and their children, who are now required to pay the U.S. government back after remarrying. A bill introduced by Rep. Joe Wilson aims to address the issue, but Pentagon officials have opposed eliminating the offset, believing it would create inequity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - The Schutzstaffel (SS; also stylized as with Armanen runes literally \\"Protection Squadron\\") was a major paramilitary organization under Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP; Nazi Party) in Nazi Germany. It began with a small guard unit known as the \\"Saal-Schutz\\" (Hall-Protection) made up of NSDAP volunteers to provide security for party meetings in Munich. In 1925, Heinrich Himmler joined the unit, which had by then been reformed and given its final name. Under his direction (192945), it grew from a small paramilitary formation to one of the most powerful organizations in Nazi Germany. From 1929 until the regime's collapse in 1945, the SS was the foremost agency of surveillance and terror within Germany and German-occupied Europe. - Joachim Peiper ( German pronunciation : ( joaxm pap ) ; 30 January 1915 -- 14 July 1976 ) , also known as Jochen Peiper , was a field officer in the Waffen - SS during World War II and personal adjutant to Reichsführer - SS Heinrich Himmler between November 1940 and August 1941 . Peiper fought on both the Eastern Front against the Red Army and the Western Front against the Western Allies , and he won the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords for extreme battlefield bravery and outstanding military leadership . By 1945 , he was an SS - Standartenführer and the Waffen - SS 's youngest regimental colonel . Peiper was convicted of war crimes committed in Belgium and imprisoned for almost 12 years . He was accused of war crimes in Italy , but Italian and German courts concluded that there was insufficient evidence to warrant prosecution . After his release from prison , Peiper worked for both Porsche and Volkswagen , before moving to France , where he translated books from English to German under the nom de plume Rainer Buschmann . Peiper was murdered in France in July 1976 , when he was shot by unknown assailants who then burned his house to the ground using Molotov cocktails . - Adjutant is a military rank or appointment. In some armies, including most English-speaking ones, it is an officer who assists a more senior officer, while in other armies, especially Francophone ones, it is an NCO (non-commissioned officer), normally corresponding roughly to a staff sergeant or warrant officer. - Reichsführer-SS was a special title and rank that existed between the years of 1925 and 1945 for the commander of the Schutzstaffel (SS). \\"Reichsführer-SS\\" was a title from 1925 to 1933, and from 1934 to 1945 it was the highest rank of the SS. The longest serving and by far most noteworthy \\"Reichsführer-SS\\" was Heinrich Himmler. - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II. - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - The National Socialist German Workers' Party (abbreviated NSDAP), commonly referred to in English as the Nazi Party, was a political party in Germany that was active between 1920 and 1945 and practised the ideology of Nazism. Its precursor, the German Workers' Party (\\"Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; DAP), existed from 1919 to 1920. - Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (\\"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator of the German Reich, he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was central to the Holocaust. - Sergeant (abbreviated to Sgt and capitalised when used as a named person's title) is a rank in many uniformed organizations, principally military and policing forces. Its origin is the Latin \\"serviens\\", \\"one who serves\\", through the French term \\"sergent\\". - In politics and military planning, a war effort refers to a coordinated mobilization of society's resourcesboth industrial and humantowards the support of a military force. Depending on the militarization of the culture, the relative size of the armed forces and the society supporting them, the style of government, and the popular support for the military objectives, such war effort can range from a small industry to complete command of society. - The Waffen-SS (Armed SS) was the armed wing of the Nazi Party's SS organisation. Its formations included men from Nazi Germany, along with volunteers and conscripts from both occupied and un-occupied lands. - Heinrich Luitpold Himmler (7 October 1900 23 May 1945) was \\"Reichsführer\\" of the \\"Schutzstaffel\\" (Protection Squadron; SS), and a leading member of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) of Nazi Germany. Nazi leader Adolf Hitler briefly appointed him a military commander and later Commander of the Replacement (Home) Army and General Plenipotentiary for the administration of the entire Third Reich (\\"Generalbevollmächtigter für die Verwaltung\\"). Himmler was one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany and one of the people most directly responsible for the Holocaust. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability.

Step 1: We have the equation r1^2 = πr2^2. Step 2: We want to determine either r1 or r2 in terms of the other variable. Let's solve for r2, so we have a clear relationship between r1 and r2: Divide both sides by π: r1^2 / π = r2^2. Step 3: Take the square root of both sides to get the expression for r2: r2 = sqrt(r1^2 / π). Now we have a relationship between the side of the square (r1) and the radius of the circle (r2).

Sentence 1: For unto everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall have but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath. This sentence can be interpreted as a general statement about the distribution of resources or possessions. It suggests that those who already have something (in this context, it could be wealth, knowledge, or any other resource) are likely to receive more, while those who don't have anything are at risk of losing even the little that they possess. This is often referred to as the Matthew effect in sociology and economics. The first sentence does not provide any specific information about the timing (\\"when\\") of the events mentioned. Sentence 2: That which will be given to everyone that hath will be given to them very soon. This statement focuses on the timing of the events mentioned in the first sentence. It asserts that the act of giving resources or possessions to those who already have something will happen in the near future (implied by \\"very soon\\"). However, this specific information about the timing is not provided in Sentence 1.

When habitats such as soil, oceans, and trees are systematically destroyed or modified, the plants and animals that rely on these habitats for food, shelter, growth, and reproduction are severely affected. The worst that can happen when habitats are destroyed is that plants and animals B) become extinct. Extinction is the complete and permanent loss of a species from our planet. When humans change forests into parking lots, grasslands into neighborhoods, or beach land into resorts, they alter the delicate balance of ecosystems and displace countless species. This often forces plants and animals to either adapt to new conditions or perish. Furthermore, when humans turn oceans into chemical dumps, the pollution disrupts marine ecosystems, kills off numerous aquatic species, and contaminates the food chain. This harmful chain reaction impacts not only the plants and animals living in these habitats but also the humans who depend on them for food and other resources. Some organisms are able to adapt and survive in the face of these rapid changes, but many others cannot. When the death rate surpasses the birth rate, extinction becomes a real possibility. As mentioned in the example of the dusky seaside sparrow, these birds were not able to adapt when their habitat on Florida's east coast was suddenly developed. Consequently, more sparrows died than were born, and by 1987 the species became extinct. Thankfully, various conservation efforts are underway to help protect and preserve the natural habitats of plants and animals. Many states have set aside land for nature preserves, where species can continue to live in their natural surroundings. Others have created man-made habitats, such as artificial reefs, which provide a home for hundreds of fish and other marine life. In addition, the federal government has enacted legislation to protect habitats and the species that depend on them. This law ensures that the impacts of development projects, such as highways, dams, or power plants, are carefully studied and that the projects may not proceed if they threaten endangered plants and animals. While we were too late to save the dusky sparrow, these ongoing conservation efforts offer hope for the preservation of other plant and animal species. It is crucial that we continue to work towards protecting and preserving natural habitats to prevent further extinctions, safeguard biodiversity, and maintain a healthy, balanced ecosystem for both humans and wildlife."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He was the Ambassador to 1975, but back home in 1898, in New Jerusalem, Utah, they all thought he was Ambassador to France. When he disappeared, Mama and I came back through the triple-bolted door that led from our apt in 1975 to our horsebarn in 1898. We returned to the dusty streets of New Jerusalem, and I had to keep on reminding myself that I was supposed to have been in France, and 'polly-voo' for my chums, and tell whoppers about the Eiffel Tower and the fancy bread and the snails and frogs we'd eaten. I was born in New Jerusalem, and raised there till I was ten. Then, one summer's day, my Pa sat me on his knee and told me we'd be going away for a while, that he had a new job. 'But what about the store?' I said, scandalised. My Pa's wonderful store, the only General Store in town not run by the Saints, was my second home. I'd spent my whole life crawling and then walking on the dusty wooden floors, checking stock and unpacking crates with waybills from exotic places like Salt Lake City and even San Francisco.

He'd blown into town on the weekly Zephyr Speedball, and skinny Tommy Benson had hauled his three huge steamer trunks to the cowboy hotel.

Background: Katherine Harris (born April 5, 1957) is an American politician, elected in 1998 as Secretary of State of Florida and in 2002 to the United States House of Representatives from Florida. A Republican, Harris won the 2002 election to represent Florida's 13th congressional district, serving for two terms, from 2003 to 2007. Harris lost her campaign in 2006 for a United States Senate seat from Florida. In 1994, Harris was noted for the most expensive campaign for the Florida Senate to date, winning her seat that year in her entry into electoral politics. Context: In 2002, Harris ran against Sarasota Attorney Jan Schneider for the congressional district vacated by retiring Republican Rep. Dan Miller, winning by 10 percentage points in this solidly Republican district, a victory helped with one of the biggest first term campaign fund raising efforts in the history of this district and substantial support from the Bush family. Harris considered running for the seat of retiring Senator Bob Graham in 2004 but was reportedly dissuaded by the Bush White House to allow Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Mel Martinez to run instead. Martinez went on to narrowly beat challenger Betty Castor. Harris ran for re-election to her House seat in 2004; she was re-elected with a margin almost identical to her first win. In a 2004 speech in Venice, Florida, Harris claimed that a \\"Middle Eastern\\" man was arrested for attempting to blow up the power grid in Carmel, Indiana; Carmel Mayor James Brainard and a spokesman for Indiana Gov. Joe Kernan said they had no knowledge of such a plot. Brainard said he had never spoken to Harris. During a 2004 campaign stop in Sarasota, a local resident, Barry Seltzer, \\"tr[ied] to 'intimidate' a group of Harris supporters\\" by menacing Harris and her supporters with his automobile. Witnesses described Seltzer as having swerved off the road and onto the sidewalk, directing it at Harris and her supporters. Nobody was injured in the incident. Seltzer, who claimed he was \\"exercising [his] political expression,\\" was eventually arrested and charged with assault with a deadly weapon. Question: When did she join congress.

Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Power of Style By VANESSA FRIEDMANJUNE 10, 2014 THIS WEEK’S PUBLICATION of Hillary Rodham Clinton’s “Hard Choices” has proved a predictably exciting opportunity for Clintonologists, 2016 election obsessives and pundits everywhere to revisit all sorts of issues that otherwise may have been considered, if not resolved, at least over — from the questions surrounding the couple’s marriage to Mrs. Clinton’s relationship with President Obama to the whole hair brouhaha. As it happens, the latter was brought up by the author herself, who got a fair amount of prepublication mileage from joking about an alternative title that had been suggested by a Washington Post reader: “The Scrunchie Chronicles: 112 Countries and It’s Still All About My Hair.” The subtext being, of course, the shared joke about how absurd it is for anyone to be talking about her hair instead of serious stuff, like, say, Benghazi, and how they wouldn’t do it if she were a man, and yada yada yada. This “ain’t it ridiculous we care about what power women wear, not what they do” attitude is, as it happens, also being parodied in a new blog called ladypockets.com that uses the tropes of women’s mags to mock both the forms themselves and the idea that anyone should pay attention to such things. It features, for example, a section called “Color Guide: Charcoal + Lavender” as seen on Maria Shriver, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Senator Tammy Baldwin; “Get the Look!” featuring Julia Gillard, the former Australian prime minister; and “Who Wore It Best?” comparing blue jackets on Senator Dianne Feinstein and former Senator Olympia Snowe. And it is, to be fair, very funny. Indeed, it’s easy, both while reading the blog and listening to Mrs. Clinton, to want to join in with the laughter and eye-rolling, and cry: “Yes! It is ridiculous. Why don’t we stop all this nonsense?” Because we shouldn’t. Because when you think about it, it isn’t nonsense at all. When you think about it, who better, really, to use as role models than women like Hillary Rodham Clinton and Julia Gillard and Kirsten Gillibrand? And while their lessons are primarily professional, there is no reason they should not be extended to appearance, too — especially when it comes to appearance in the workplace, or the public space. After all, whether or not we like it or want to admit it, appearance matters. (Simply consider the no-bald-president-except-Eisenhower rule, and the recent research about C.E.O.s being taller than 90 percent of the population.) And it matters increasingly in the world of Instagram and Pinterest, where pictures are beamed round the Internet, and judgments made, long before position papers are read. We are all, to varying degrees, public people now. So, where better to look for examples of how to function in that context than women who have presumably had to think through how their image affects perception and relationships in traditionally all-male environments; who have been widely photographed and have had almost every wardrobe choice recorded; who lead busy lives and need clothes that are functional and comfortable? Who have, to a certain extent, made the decisions for us? It certainly makes more sense, when you think about it, than, say, using Jennifer Lawrence or Nicole Kidman or Rihanna as a model — especially if the “you” looking at them is over 25 and not involved in pop culture. It really makes no sense at all, when you think about it, that we are supposed to take our dressing cues from 20-something celebrities (or celebrities who may be closer to 30-something or even 40-something but who have been made to look 20-something thanks to airbrushing and other sorts of photo magic), most of whom are, in fact, not even dressing themselves and certainly are not dressing themselves for pitching a new client or negotiating a deal or teaching or — well, anything other than stalking the red carpet or making charity trips to India. Even the women who have become fashion icons because of a noncelebrity public role — Michelle Obama, the Duchess of Cambridge — are largely women in symbolic positions for whom dressing is a mode of diplomatic expression. Do the same rules apply to those who have a more palpable professional voice? Arguably not. By contrast, much could be learned from the wardrobe strategy of, say, Christine Lagarde, of the International Monetary Fund; or Sheryl Sandberg, of Facebook; or Indra Nooyi, of PepsiCo; or Mary Barra, of General Motors. But though they all dress very well, they barely utter a sartorial word — most probably because of the fear of not being taken seriously. And in doing so, they perpetuate the problem. The way to neuter the issue is not to pretend it doesn’t exist, but to embrace it and move on. The irony is that, when it comes to men, this is exactly what occurs. Bill Clinton, as you may remember, famously answered the boxers-versus-briefs question on MTV without blinking; President Obama discussed his suit choices with Michael Lewis in a profile in Vanity Fair. It doesn’t detract from the big issues surrounding what said world leaders do. It simply acknowledges a basic human reality: everyone gets dressed, and there is reason behind the reality we see. Much is made of the clothing double standard, and how it is unfair to women in power because they are constantly critiqued while men are allowed to get away with wrinkles and gray hair and the same suit (or what looks like the same suit) for days in a row. But the real double standard in the dressing issue is why world leaders and captains of industry are expected to set, and feel the responsibility for setting, the sartorial standards for only one sex. Deciding what to wear in the morning can be, depending on the agenda of the day, if not a hard choice, at least a complicated one. I can’t be the only woman who thinks it would be nice to have some help in making it. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article discusses the attention given to the appearance and clothing choices of powerful women such as Hillary Clinton, Julia Gillard, and Kirsten Gillibrand. The author argues that it's not ridiculous to care about what these women wear, as appearance matters in the world of social media and public perception. These women could serve as role models for other working professionals, especially when considering wardrobe choices for functioning in traditionally male-dominated environments. The author suggests that powerful women should embrace the importance of their appearance and use it to their advantage, rather than avoid discussing it out of fear of not being taken seriously."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If the author was going for horror, he's really missed the mark. The dialogue is laughable. There is barely any tension in the plot. If they made a movie out of this book, the audience would think it was a comedy. Good concept, but unfortunate results. Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","completion":"The review in question is primarily negative in nature. The reviewer conveys numerous criticisms of the book and indicates dissatisfaction with several aspects of it. To truly understand the review, let's dissect its key points and phrases. 1. \\"Laughing out loud!\\": The title of the review itself, though implying humor, can be seen as ironic, since it doesn't align with the book's intended purpose of being a horror novel. 2. \\"This is one of the silliest books I have ever read!\\": The reviewer expresses a strong negative opinion about the book, labeling it as \\"silly.\\" This term implies a lack of seriousness, depth, or thought put into the book. 3. \\"If the author was going for horror, he's really missed the mark.\\": Here, the reviewer points out the book's failure to meet the expectations of its genre. The writer is essentially saying that even though the book is supposed to evoke horror, it does not do so successfully, which is a fundamental flaw. 4. \\"The dialogue is laughable.\\": The reviewer is critical of the book's dialogue, insinuating that it is poorly-written or unsuitable for the story. The use of \\"laughable\\" here implies that the dialogue is ridiculous or nonsensical. 5. \\"There is barely any tension in the plot.\\": Another critical point is made about the plot lacking tension, which is essential in a horror novel. A lack of tension often makes the story less engaging and can detract from the intended atmosphere. 6. \\"If they made a movie out of this book, the audience would think it was a comedy.\\": The reviewer draws a comparison that highlights the book's failure to convey horror. Instead of achieving its intended purpose, the book has inadvertently taken on comedic characteristics, which is the opposite effect the author was presumably aiming for. 7. \\"Good concept, but unfortunate results.\\": Despite the numerous criticisms, the reviewer acknowledges the potential of the book's concept. However, this comment does not offer any actual positivity for the final outcome of the story, and the reviewer regards it as \\"unfortunate.\\" In summary, the review is mostly negative, pointing out the book's shortcomings in terms of its genre, dialogue, and plot. While the reviewer acknowledges the potential of the book's concept, it appears that the book's execution failed to live up to the expectations. As a result, this detailed examination of the review leads us to classify it as negative."},{"prompt":"Q:Gametes then unite in fertilization and form a diploid zygote, and diploid zygote forms multicellular embryo in venter.

In this case, the subject is \\"the cost\\" or \\"maliyet\\" in Turkish, and the verb is a passive one, \\"estimated\\" or \\"tahmini olarak.\\" - Numbers usually come before nouns in Turkish, so \\"7 billion\\" will be \\"7 milyar\\" and \\"9 billion\\" will be \\"9 milyar.\\" - In Turkish, currency comes after the number, so \\"euros\\" will be \\"euro\\" and come after \\"7 milyar\\" and \\"9 milyar.\\" Taking these points into account, we can build the translated sentence: \\"Maliyet, tahmini olarak 7 milyar ve 9 milyar euro arasında.\\" Here, \\"maliyet\\" (the cost) is the subject, \\"tahmini olarak\\" (is estimated at) is the verb, and the range \\"7 milyar ve 9 milyar euro arasında\\" (between 7 billion and 9 billion euros) is the object that is being described."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: Passage: In 1999, he was signed by Fiorentina for 28 billion lire (€14.46 million), a team looking to expand and bring in better players, in an attempt to keep club captain and talisman Gabriel Batistuta. Despite making regular appearances in his first season for La Viola, Chiesa was fighting for a place with Predrag Mijatović among others, and also had spells where he was out of form, and in the end only managed 6 goals in the league. In the 2000–01 season, Batistuta left for Roma and Fiorentina were plagued with injuries and financial problems. Meanwhile, Chiesa became the main striker for the club under manager Roberto Mancini, supported by playmaker Rui Costa, and scored 22 goals in 30 matches, finishing amongst the top 5 highest scorers in the league and helping Fiorentina to win the 2000–01 Coppa Italia over his former club, Parma, in the final; in the second leg at home, he set up Nuno Gomes's goal in a 1–1 draw, which allowed Fiorentina to clinch the title 2–1 on aggregate. The 2001–02 campaign proved to be a very difficult one: Chiesa started the campaign off strongly, scoring five goals in the first five matches of the season, but was ruled out for the rest of the season after sustaining a serious injury to his knee ligaments against Venezia on matchday five; left without Chiesa to lead the club's attack, Fiorentina were ultimately relegated at the end of the season. As a result of Fiorentina's relegation and financial troubles, Chiesa subsequently moved to Lazio for the following season, where he however failed to play at his personal best.

When a car bomb explodes outside one of Komarov's pharmaceutical companies, and a virus is stolen from inside, an investigation by the FSB ensues headed by FSB agents Sonia Astrova and Andrei Kasanov. Their investigation is obstructed by the Director of the FSB, Anatoly Grishin. A British Embassy worker from Moscow, Sir Nigel Irvine, tracks down Jason Monk, a former CIA operative, who ran double agents in the Soviet Union and convinces him to investigate the incident. Once in Moscow, Jason finds an old friend, Viktor Akopov, who agrees to hide Jason from Komarov's men. Viktor steals a residue sample of the bomb used and his scientist friend Tonkin tells him that the explosive used, Semtex H, has a direct traceable link to the FSB. Tonkin is soon killed by Vladimir Dorganosov, the man who attacked Komarov industries and stole the bioweapon. Sonia and Andrei locate Leonid Zaitzev, a cleaner who worked at the Komarov Industries plant and saw Dorganosov steal the virus. As they question him, Grishin appears, arrests Zaitzev and fires Sonia and Andrei. Zaitzev is later killed by Dorganosov while in custody. Sonia goes home to find Jason waiting for her, and agrees to help him access the FSB network. However, they are shot at by Dorganosov, and a car chase ensues. They go to Andrei's house where they find him already dead. After the chase, Dorganosov demands the rest of his payment from his contractor, who is revealed to be Anatoly Grishin. While they are arguing, Komarov himself arrives and orders Grishin to kill Dorganosov., what would be the answer ?

During the course of the events surrounding the car bomb explosion and the stolen virus, the narrative mainly revolves around Igor Komarov's connection to the incident, as well as the involvement of individuals connected to his interests. There is no mention or implication of any direct involvement by Nikolai Nikolayev in the incident, and the investigation into the explosion and the stolen virus does not mention any connection to Nikolayev.

In April 2007, Becky got something called skin cancer. Skin cancer is a sickness that can make some parts of your body not work like they should. Even though Becky fought hard against the skin cancer, it came back four times. The last time it came back was only a week after she came home from her honeymoon. A honeymoon is a special trip people take after they get married to celebrate. Becky married her husband, Kevin Giddins, who loves her very much. Becky is 32 years old and has had to go through a lot of treatments to help her get better. Doctors had to take out a lump from her breast, half of her left lung, and some parts called lymph glands.

When Lukather's record company, Bop City Records, approached him about recording a Christmas album, he responded with a quip about his suitability for the project. The company wanted him to do the record knowing he would approach the project with a unique angle and produce something different from the typical Christmas album. Lukather recruited keyboardist Jeff Babko and guitarist Larry Carlton, who Lukather had worked with previously, to help arrange the songs. The project was a challenge to Lukather, who had to be creative to turn the traditionally simple songs into something interesting for listeners without altering the fundamental structures. He said of the album, \\"But I never dreamt in a million years that I'd do a Christmas record.\\"The musicians Lukather chose for Santamental, most of whom were involved in the hard-rock genre, lent a heavy feel to the album. Van Halen recorded guitar tracks for \\"Joy to the World\\" after not having been in the studio for some time but immediately made an impression on Lukather with his level of playing. Vai provided guitar work for \\"Carol of the Bells\\" along with Lukather's son Trevor, then 14 years old. Slash, who recorded his part in one take, played on the Lukather/Stan Lynch composition \\"Broken Heart for Christmas\\". Lukather spoke highly of Slash after the project, calling him the \\"Keith Richards of our generation\\". Well-known session guitarist Michael Landau played on the song \\"Look Out For Angels\\", and there is a version of \\"Jingle Bells\\" featuring a big band and sung by Sammy Davis, Jr. Santamental was recorded in six days, after which Lukather proclaimed it \\"his first and last Christmas album\\". contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who recorded guitar tracks for \\"Joy to the World\\" after not having been in the studio for some time?, what is it ?

Sarah ran in, shouting, \\"Look what I found!\\" Over the top of the paper I was reading; came a terrible thing that caused me to jump. It was a snake skin found in our garden. \\"Isn't it beautiful?\\" said my seven-year-old daughter. I opened my eyes widely and looked at the snake skin in fear . I didn't think it was beautiful, but I learned never to appear nonchalant with children. Everything they see for the first time is important to their sense of beauty; they see only excellence in the world. \\"Why does it do this?\\" Sarah asked. \\"Snakes shed their skins because they need to renew themselves,\\" I explained. \\"Why do they need to renew themselves?\\" Sarah asked. \\"We often need to shed our skins, those coatings that we cover ourselves with,\\" I said to my daughter. \\"We leave some things and find other thing unwanted or unnecessary. This snake no longer needs this skin. It is probably too little for him, and he probably doesn't think he looks as smart in it as he once did. \\" As we talked, I knew that she began to understand. Although she couldn't understand clearly, she would know that renewal is part of progress; that we need to take a good look at ourselves, our rooms, schoolwork and spirit, and see what we need to keep and what we need to leave. I was careful to tell that this is a natural way, not one to be forced. \\"Snakes don't peel off their skins when they like them. \\"I explained. \\"It happens as a natural thing of their growth. \\" \\"I see, Dad,\\" said Sarah as she held the snake skin, and then ran off. I hoped she would remember this; we need to throw some away because they are worthless or unnecessary. Then we can store them as memories in our deep hearts. We learn from the reading that _ . A) the girl seemed to understand what her father said B) the girl wasn't interested in the explanation C) the father was good at raising snakes D) the father liked the snake skin better","completion":"In this story, we learn that the girl, Sarah, seemed to understand what her father said (A). When she found a snake skin in their garden, she brought it to her father with excitement and curiosity. As her father carefully explained the concept of renewal and the reasons behind snakes shedding their skins, Sarah appeared to grasp the idea. While she might not have understood every aspect of the explanation, her father hoped that she would remember the underlying message that renewal is a natural part of life and progress. Sarah's father was not only patient in explaining the concept to his daughter, but also took the opportunity to share a deeper life lesson with her. He emphasized the importance of recognizing the need to let go of things that no longer serve us and focusing on personal growth. Although the father may not have been as excited or impressed by the snake skin as Sarah was, he managed to convey genuine interest and support for his daughter's curiosity. Throughout the exchange, the father maintained a calm and open-minded attitude, making sure not to dismiss Sarah's enthusiasm. He understood that children often find beauty and wonder in things that may seem ordinary or even unpleasant to adults. As such, the father acknowledged Sarah's appreciation for the snake skin but ultimately shifted the focus to the valuable life lesson it represented. In conclusion, the story demonstrates the power of effective communication and open-mindedness between parents and their children. It highlights the importance of respecting a child's curiosity and taking the time to explain complex concepts and share wisdom that might inspire personal growth."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

In recent years, many office supply companies have begun to sell adjustable desks.These so-called \\"sit / stand\\" models are equipped with an electric motor that lets them shift from chair height to person height at the push of a button.Unfortunately, sit / stand desks tend to be expensive, hard to find and not very easy to test in person. I discovered that when I worked standing up, my mind was clearer and new ideas kept coming to me.I suspect that this is because when you're standing, you feel a bit unchained from your desk.If I got stuck on a word or sentence as I wrote it, I found myself shaking my arms, bouncing on my feet or stepping away from the desk for a bit -- things I couldn't do in a chair.Often, standing up seemed to relax my mind enough for me to get over creative barriers. There's another thing about standing for a long time: I tend to get hungrier than I do when I sit on a chair.That feels like confirmation of the stand-up advocates' belief that you burn more calories when you stand than when you sit.For this reason alone, I' m hoping that one day mass-market furniture companies can make many low-priced versions of sit / stand desks.We could all work with a bit more standing up.

When there is less sediment available for transport, it directly affects the sediment transport process. Specifically, it influences the initial step where sediment becomes loose from the rest of the soil and starts rolling downhill towards a river.

This direct impact on the process can have consequences on the remainder of the sediment transport steps, such as the sediment settling at the bottom of rivers, lakes, or the ocean, and the distribution of sediment around the world through convection currents.

A bundle branch block can be diagnosed when the duration of the QRS complex on the ECG exceeds 120 ms. A right bundle branch block typically causes prolongation of the last part of the QRS complex, and may shift the heart's electrical axis slightly to the right. The ECG will show a terminal R wave in lead V1 and a slurred S wave in lead I. Left bundle branch block widens the entire QRS, and in most cases shifts the heart's electrical axis to the left. The ECG will show a QS or rS complex in lead V1 and a monophasic R wave in lead I. Another normal finding with bundle branch block is appropriate T wave discordance. In other words, the T wave will be deflected opposite the terminal deflection of the QRS complex. Bundle branch block, especially left bundle branch block, can lead to cardiac dyssynchrony. The simultaneous occurrence of left and right bundle branch block leads to total AV block. can you have a right and left bundle branch block?","completion":"Yes, it is theoretically possible to have both right and left bundle branch blocks, but this condition is extremely rare. This is because the occurrence of both right and left bundle branch blocks simultaneously would lead to a complete blockage of the signal conduction through the bundle branches, effectively causing a total atrioventricular (AV) block. A total AV block is a severe condition where the electrical signals from the atria cannot pass through to the ventricles, resulting in the loss of synchrony between the atrial and ventricular contractions. This can cause severe bradycardia (slow heart rate) or asystole (no electrical activity), leading to inadequate blood flow to the body's organs and tissues and potentially life-threatening consequences. If you are concerned about the possibility of having both left and right bundle branch block, I would advise discussing the matter with a medical professional who can provide a more personalized evaluation of your specific situation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which entity is this text about? Steven Ellison (born October 7, 1983), known by his stage name Flying Lotus or sometimes FlyLo, is an experimental multi-genre music producer, electronic musician, DJ, filmmaker, and rapper from Los Angeles, California. Flying Lotus has released five studio albums--1983 (2006), Los Angeles (2008), Cosmogramma (2010), Until the Quiet Comes (2012) and You're Dead! (2014)--to critical acclaim. His third studio album, Cosmogramma, was released in the UK on May 3, 2010, and in the US on May 4, 2010. In January 2011, Cosmogramma won in the Dance/Electronica Album category in the 10th Annual Independent Music Awards. The multi-award-winning Cosmogramma was a hard-hitting afrofuturistic shrine to soul, hip-hop, jazz and IDM but, with more emphasis on a lyrical message than ever before, it was also a cathartic grieving experience. The album was accompanied by live instrumentation (Thundercat on bass, Miguel Atwood Ferguson on strings, Rebekah Raff on harp) and live vocalists (Thom Yorke, Laura Darlington) - all picked to help communicate the spiritual musical lineage of Ellison's family (Ravi Coltrane, himself, played tenor sax). Stephen Bruner, aka Thundercat, who is featured extensively on Cosmogramma, would later become a large part of future albums by Flying Lotus. In 2010, Flying Lotus collaborated with the Ann Arbor Film Festival in the performance of a live scoring of the 1962 avant-garde film Heaven and Earth Magic. In a post-viewing interview with the audience, Flying Lotus said that he was unsure whether or not a recording of the performance (or a recreation of it) would be publicly released, but he would be enthusiastic toward similar projects in the future. He was chosen by Battles to perform at the ATP Nightmare Before Christmas festival that it co-curated in December 2011 in Minehead, England, UK. In September 2010, Flying Lotus released \\"Pattern+Grid World\\", an 8 track EP featuring Thundercat on bass & art by Theo Ellsworth. The Track Camera Day was used in the Killer Mike song Swimming, which was released as part of the Adult Swim Singles Series. In January 2011, Flying Lotus won the 10th Annual Independent Music Awards for his video \\"MmmHmm\\" in the Short-Form Video category. It was reported in 2011 that Flying Lotus would be collaborating with R&B singer Erykah Badu on new material for her next album, and planned to remix one of Radiohead's songs from The King of Limbs.

Article: The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian. In Darwin's lifetime, Origin was published in Swedish in 1871, Danish in 1872, Polish in 1873, Hungarian in 1873–1874, Spanish in 1877 and Serbian in 1878.

Question: Question: \\"What is Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular?\\" Context: \\"Culturally, an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by the concept of Yiddishkeit, which means \\"Jewishness\\" in the Yiddish language. Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit, in particular, refers to the unique cultural, religious, and historical aspects of Jewishness specific to Ashkenazi Jews. Originating from Central and Eastern Europe, Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit is characterized by the Yiddish language, distinctive religious practices, and a variety of cultural traits such as humor and mannerisms. Although the concept of Yiddishkeit has evolved with modernization, it continues to encompass a broad range of movements, ideologies, and traditions that shape the identity and sense of Jewishness for Ashkenazi Jews."},{"prompt":"Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Giants Tie Mark and Stifle Eagles With 12 Sacks “Sacks come in bunches, man,” Umenyiora said with a heavy dose of understatement. He tried to play down his numbers, but teammates needled him on the sideline in the closing moments of the game. “They were like, ‘It’s like a video game for you out there,’” Umenyiora said. The Giants allowed 97 points in the first two and a half games of the season, but only 3 in the past game and a half. The unit of the first-year defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, who spent the previous eight seasons as an assistant for the Eagles, appeared to take hold at the perfect time. A week earlier, in a 56-21 victory over Detroit, McNabb completed 21 of 26 for 381 yards, with four touchdowns and no interceptions. Against the Giants, McNabb completed 15 of 31 passes for 138 yards. The dozen sacks accounted for 62 yards in losses, leaving the Eagles only 76 net yards passing. The Eagles’ offense was helpless against a Giants defense gaining confidence with nearly every snap. But it was also short-handed because of a slew of injured players, most of them late, surprising scratches from the lineup. Most notably, running back Brian Westbrook, the league leader in yards from scrimmage through three games, did not dress for the game because of a nagging abdominal strain. Left tackle William Thomas’s absence because of a sore knee forced the backup Winston Justice to make his first N.F.L. start. Umenyiora, from the right end position, picked on Justice for most of his sacks, and other defensive linemen took turns pushing, pulling and throwing McNabb to the Giants Stadium turf. Umenyiora had never recorded more than two sacks in a game, and had just one sack in his previous eight regular-season games. Defenders entered the Eagles’ offensive backfield from all directions, but the Giants were surprised that the Eagles left Justice alone to fight off the onslaught. Philadelphia made few attempts to double-team Umenyiora. “Maybe they figured things would go a different way,” said linebacker Mathias Kiwanuka, who often played on the line of scrimmage and had three sacks. “Who knows? The bottom line is, we’ve got Osi on our team.” Still, the score was tighter than the game felt. The Giants’ offense, rewarded frequently with good field position, was consistent only in squandering chances. The Giants scored their only offensive touchdown midway through the second quarter when quarterback Eli Manning arced a pass to the left side of the end zone. The 6-foot-5 receiver Plaxico Burress snagged it over the top of cornerback Sheldon Brown, who is 7 inches shorter. A long first-quarter march ended with a missed 34-yard field-goal attempt by Lawrence Tynes. A second-quarter drive reached Philadelphia’s 15-yard line, but Manning threw an interception into the hands of linebacker Omar Gaither while trying to complete a short pass to tight end Jeremy Shockey. A third-quarter drive reached the 10-yard line, but ended with a field goal and a 10-0 lead with 2 minutes 3 seconds left in the period. That is when the defense took control of the scoreboard. On the next play, McNabb fumbled, the ball appearing to brush fullback Thomas Tapeh’s elbow as McNabb retreated. Mitchell jumped on the loose ball, scrambled to his feet and ran 17 yards into the end zone. “Comfort, confidence,” Mitchell succinctly explained when asked about the transformation of the team’s defense. Tynes missed the extra-point attempt by hitting the upright, leaving the Giants with a 16-0 lead entering the fourth quarter. The Giants’ defense did the rest. The Eagles managed their only points on a 53-yard field goal by David Akers early in the fourth quarter. The next time they got the ball, Kiwanuka and Umenyiora sacked McNabb on consecutive plays — the first setting the team record for sacks in a game, the next giving Umenyiora the individual mark. Strahan’s sack, midway through the second quarter, pushed his career total to 133 ½. That broke the official franchise mark he shared for nearly a year with the former linebacker Lawrence Taylor. Strahan celebrated by pointing two fingers skyward into the darkness as Taylor watched from the sideline. But Taylor’s total of 132 ½ does not include the 9 ½ he notched as a rookie in 1981, because the N.F.L. did not count sacks as an official statistic until 1982. Taylor playfully reminded Strahan that he “has some more work to do.” The best chance for the Eagles to score a touchdown came just before the two-minute warning in the fourth quarter. But on fourth-and-18 from the Giants’ 24-yard line, McNabb was sacked, appropriately and predictably, by Umenyiora. Fans rose to their feet as McNabb fell. A new defense had been christened, and a season was flush with renewed expectations.

In 2003, the village of Carabane's official population count stood at 396 people and 55 households, but it fluctuates with the seasons and sometimes reaches some 1,750 people, according to local sources. Most of the population is Jola. The Jola are very distinct from other major ethnic groups in Senegal by their language, egalitarian society, freedom from political hierarchy, and lack of slavery. Their traditions have persevered because of their independent spirit as well as their geographical isolation. This ethnic group accounts for 80 to 90% of the residents of Basse Casamance, but only 6 to 8% of the total population of Senegal. They are the largest ethnic group in Carabane, followed by Wolofs, Lebous, and Serers (including Niominka fishermen). Manjacks also live on the island, some of whom came from Saint-Louis and Gorée at the time of the first colonization. Two communities from neighbouring countries, one from Guinea (the Susu people) and the other from Guinea-Bissau, have settled on the other side of the island at a distance from the village. There are also seasonal workers who come to fish: Ghanaians, Guineans, and Gambians.The indigenous population was originally animist, but while the fetishes and sacred groves dedicated to initiation rites such as boukout survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane. The 1988 census reported that Muslims account for 94% of the population of Senegal, but only 26.5% of the population of Oussouye Department, where Carabane is located. Still, this department is largely rural, while Carabane has historically supported great ethnic diversity. Islam has not been practiced by Wolof and Serer fishermen since the 19th century, but the colonial administration brought with it many translators, guides, and secretaries from Dakar, many of whom were Muslim.

This unit produced three to four films per year until 1936, migrating to Hungary and then Austria in the face of Hitler's increasing domination of central Europe. With the advent of sound, these productions were made in the German language or, occasionally, Hungarian or Polish. In the U.S., Universal Pictures did not distribute any of this subsidiary's films, but at least some of them were exhibited through other, independent, foreign-language film distributors based in New York, without benefit of English subtitles. Nazi persecution and a change in ownership for the parent Universal Pictures organization resulted in the dissolution of this subsidiary.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: Fascinating movie, based on a true story, about an Australian woman, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) accused of killing her baby daughter. She insists that a dingo took her baby, but the story is highly suspicious. The film is actually about the media circus that took place around the case, the way Australians interpreted what was presented in the media, and the lynch mob mentality that ultimately led to the woman's conviction, based on barely any hard evidence. I love films that question the media, and also films that take a hard look on how people are railroaded by the justice system. I've always thought that juries ought to be showed 12 Angry Men before they go through with their duties. It's not, as has often been said, a liberal movie, but a clinical look at how we as human beings interpret events based so much on our prejudices and a desire for revenge. A Cry in the Dark is likewise clinical. Schepisi is careful not to make the film at all melodramatic.

A friend of the 26-year-old gunman who opened fire on a Seattle university says the shooter is a' sweet kid' but is haunted by his struggle with addiction. One student died and three others were wounded after Aaron Ybarra stormed the campus of Seattle Pacific University Thursday night with a shotgun - and a friend who had dinner with the suspect the night before the rampage says he is 'shocked' the recovering alcoholic is involved. Nate Flesch told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer that he and Ybarra attend the same Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and that the troubled man has been sober for about one year. He spoke with the paper only hours before the suspected shooter was led into court in shackles. Scroll down for video. First court appearance: Shooting suspect Aaron Ybarra, left, is led in chains to a court hearing at a King County Jail courtroom Friday, June 6, 2014, in Seattle. Mourning: Students comfort one another during a prayer service at First Free Methodist Church on the Seattle Pacific University campus in Seattle, Washington June 6, 2014. 'For the past year and a half or so he's been trying to turn his life around,' Flesch said. 'He attends the same (Alcoholics Anonymous) classes as I do in the Lynnwood area. He's a kid that I think has been sober now for a little bit over a year.' Flesch called Ybarra 'socially awkward,' but 'sweet.' 'He's a sweet kid, he's a nice kid, very thankful, very appreciative, and I'm just kind of shocked to hear it was Aaron who was involved in this.' Ybarra would often go to the bar where Flesch works as a bartender and order a soda or juice - never alcohol. The suspected shooter also just started a new job, Flesch told the paper. 'He was. proud that they were starting to like him at his job. They were giving. him more hours, and he was excited that he would have more money. Flesch insists he has no idea 'what set [Ybarra] off,' and that he is 'flabbergasted by the sequence of events. Shell shocked: Two women embrace Friday near a prayer circle on the campus of Seattle Pacific University. Solemn: Students and other supporters form a prayer circle Friday on the campus of Seattle Pacific University. This is Aaron Ybarra, 26, who allegedly opened fire at Seattle Pacific University, killing one and wounding three. 'He was trying to turn his life around, that he was trying to be a better person, and he was kind of working on his social skills, too,' Flesch continued, adding he had lunch with Ybarra the night before the assault. 'It's a little eerie, a little scary,' said Flesch. 'To be honest with you, I'm a little heartbroken. It breaks my heart to see a kid like this, who was turning himself around, kind of just go off the deep end. I don't know what triggered it. 'For this to happen is mind-boggling, and I don't know what else to say.' The friend spoke not long after the identity of the hero who brought the onslaught to an end with a can of pepper spray was identified by police. Hero: Friends have identified Jon Meis, a 26-year-old engineering student, as the hero who stopped the gunman. Students at Seattle Pacific University say Jon Meis saved countless lives when he sprang into action as the shooter stopped to reload his weapon Thursday afternoon. The heroic engineering student reportedly hit Ybarra with the pepper spray as he ran at and tackled him, saving countless lives. Meis, 26, is engaged to be married and has 'everything to live for' friends said. But he risked his life and ended the murderous rampage. 'I'm proud of the selfless actions that my roommate, Jon Meis, showed today taking down the shooter. He is a hero,' tweeted Matt Garcia. Classmate Briana Clarke told the Seattle Times that Meis, who was on duty as a hall monitor, sprayed the attacker in the face, grabbed him around the neck and then wrestled him to the ground. 'There were a lot of shells on the ground..it looked like he was planning to go the distance and Jon stopped him,' another student told KOMO-TV. Several other students then piled on the attacker and held him until police arrived.

He has reportedly confessed to the. shootings and even bragged about the carnage he inflicted on the campus. Authorities say he did not expect to survive the rampage. His Facebook page says he is a former janitor at LA Fitness and attended Edmonds Community College. In the panic, police believed there was a. second shooter and searched for up to an hour, possibly delaying. medical attention for the wounded, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reports.

Seattle Pacific is a small Christian college associated with the Free Methodist Church with a student body just of about 4,370. Medics work on one of the victims from the deadly Seattle Pacific University shooting before taking the subject to the hospital for treatment. Students were evacuated from Otto Miller Hall, where the shooting took place, and led single-file out of the building by armed officers. Students comforted each other as they frantically tried to get in touch with loved ones following the chaos of the shooting. This is believed to be the truck that belongs to the suspect, who is currently being interviewed by police. It is parked on campus near the building where he opened fire. The university was placed on lockdown and. the administrators advised students to stay inside and lock their. windows and doors and close their blinds. Students were sent an email. blast that warned: 'THIS IS NOT A DRILL.' It's unknown whether the gunman is a student at the university or whether the victims were random strangers or targeted.

She is one of 26 bloggers for SPARK, an international group founded in 2010. The group fights the use of the female body as a marketing tool in the media. Alice found out about SPARK when the organization launched a campaign demanding Seventeen Magazine feature a more diverse group of models. She applied to be a blogger for the group in May and won one of the positions. Each month, Alice pitches (...) her girl -and women - centric blog post ideas via online chat to an editor at SPARK. So far, she has written about topics such as female actresses, choosing what to wear, and dealing with anger. Alice said she hopes large companies and media stop editing images of women. Increases in bust size, decreases in waist size, smoothing and whitewashing skin are what Alice notes. \\"We want them to know that these images are bad for our development,\\" Alice said. \\"Three out of four teen girls feel bad about themselves after reading a fashion magazine for three minutes,\\" she said, according to SPARK's research. Alice first felt it necessary to advocate for women in the fifth grade, after seeing a girl's T-shirt with writing on the front that read: \\"Who needs brains when you have these?\\" \\"I was raised with this idea that if you don't like something, you can change it,\\" Alice said. So Alice started following feminist bloggers. Alice juggles class work with blogging and creating videos and serves as editor-in-chief of her school's newspaper. It is amazing that she can handle everything well at the same time. She's also focused on creating projects that aim to inspire girls - like designing a \\"girl power bathroom\\" at her school. The newly designed third-floor restroom is completed with pastel paint color1s and inspirational quotes from women around the world. \\"Sisterhood is powerful,\\" Alice said. \\"It can make you feel less alone.\\" Question: From the article, we can conclude that Alice Wilder _ .

LONDON, England (CNN) -- The British police practice of keeping DNA records of anyone they arrest is a human rights violation, The European Court of Human Rights ruled unanimously Thursday. The European Court of Human Rights says the UK should not be keeping DNA records of everyone they arrest. Two Britons took the case to the court after the police retained their fingerprints and DNA when criminal cases against them ended without conviction. Both then requested that the samples be destroyed, but their request was denied on the basis of a British law authorizing them to be retained indefinitely. The court awarded them 42,000 euros (53,000) to cover their legal costs. \\"It's a shame it had to go all the way to the","completion":"European Court of Human Rights, but this landmark ruling will have a significant impact on the way law enforcement agencies in the UK and across Europe handle DNA and fingerprint data,\\" said a spokesperson for the plaintiffs. \\"The right to privacy is a fundamental human right, and this decision reinforces the principle that individuals who have not been convicted of a crime should not be subjected to intrusive and indefinite retention of their personal information.\\" In response to the ruling, the UK government will now need to reevaluate its policies on the collection and storage of biometric data, including DNA and fingerprints. This may require implementing legislation that sets limits on how long such data can be retained, as well as establishing clear guidelines on when it is appropriate to collect and store such information in the first place. There are several possible approaches the UK government could take to comply with the ruling. One option would involve setting specific retention time limits for DNA and fingerprint data based on the seriousness of the offense, and the individual's prior criminal history. Another option would be to purify the DNA samples after a set period, thereby anonymizing them and ensuring that the samples can only be used for statistical or research purposes, rather than for identifying individuals. To better safeguard individual privacy, the government should also consider revising its policies on collecting DNA and fingerprints. Rather than automatically collecting this information for anyone who is arrested, law enforcement agencies may need to restrict data collection to those who are formally charged with a crime. This would minimize the number of innocent individuals whose information is stored in police databases. Moreover, the government may need to ensure that systems are in place for individuals to request the deletion of their biometric data once they have been cleared of any criminal charges. This would include creating a clear and accessible process for such requests, as well as establishing an independent oversight body to monitor compliance with these new regulations. Finally, it is important for the UK authorities to engage in a broader dialogue with the public about the use of biometric data in law enforcement and the balance between public safety and individual privacy rights. This conversation may involve increased transparency about how DNA and fingerprint data is used, as well as creating opportunities for citizens to express their concerns and contribute to the development of new policies in this area. In summary, the European Court of Human Rights' ruling underscores the importance of safeguarding individual privacy when collecting and retaining biometric data. The UK government must now take necessary steps to revise its laws and practices in line with this decision, ensuring that the rights of its citizens are respected while still maintaining effective policing and public safety measures."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: Tender Mercies Context: Mac Sledge (Robert Duvall), a washed up, alcoholic country singer, awakens at a run-down Texas roadside motel and gas station after a night of heavy drinking. He meets the owner, a young widow named Rosa Lee (Tess Harper), and offers to work in exchange for a room. Rosa Lee, whose husband was killed in the Vietnam War, is raising her young son, Sonny (Allan Hubbard), on her own. She agrees to let Mac stay under the condition that he does not drink while working. The two begin to develop feelings for one another, mostly during quiet evenings sitting alone and sharing bits of their life stories.Mac resolves to give up alcohol and start his life anew. After some time passes, he and Rosa Lee wed. They start attending a Baptist church on a regular basis. One day, a newspaper reporter visits the hotel and asks Mac whether he has stopped recording music and chosen an anonymous life. When Mac refuses to answer, the reporter explains he is writing a story about Mac and has interviewed his ex-wife, Dixie Scott (Betty Buckley), a country music star who is performing nearby.After the story is printed, the neighborhood learns of Mac's past, and members of a local countrywestern band visit him to show their respect. Although he greets them politely, Mac remains reluctant to open up about his past. Later, he secretly attends Dixie's concert. She passionately sings several songs that Mac wrote years earlier, and he leaves in the middle of the performance. Backstage, he talks to Dixie's manager, his old friend Harry (Wilford Brimley). Mac gives him a copy of a new song he has written and asks him to show it to Dixie. Mac tries to talk to Dixie, but she becomes angry upon seeing him and warns him to stay away from their 18-year-old daughter, Sue Anne (Ellen Barkin).Mac returns home to a jealous Rosa Lee and assures her he no longer has feelings for Dixie, who he describes as \\"poison\\" to him.

Please briefly summarize this news article: MSNBC: No shift after Keith Olbermann's exit By Gary Levin, USA TODAY It's not often a network parts ways with its top-rated host, but the abrupt departure of Friday does not signal a philosophical shift for the liberal-leaning news network, despite the impending shift in control of the network's parent to cable giant \\"Absolutely not,\\" MSNBC chief Phil Griffin said in an interview Saturday. \\"We want to tell our audience, 'Hey, our sensibility is not changing; this is who we are, and this is our future.' \\" As evidence, Griffin notes that he replaced Olbermann by reshuffling its prime-time lineup, shifting left-leaning Lawrence O'Donnell's The Last Word to Olbermann's former slot at 8 ET/PT starting Monday and Ed Schultz's The Ed Show to 10; Rachel Maddow remains at 9. He said there are no plans to bring in new hosts. Olbermann, 51, who announced to viewers he'd been \\"told\\" Friday's Countdown show would be his last, was a lightning rod. He drew more viewers, redefined the network and eventually vaulted it ahead of CNN. But he also caused PR nightmares, most recently after anchoring the network's November election coverage, when it was revealed he'd privately donated money to three Democratic congressional candidates — including Tucson shooting victim Rep. Gabrielle Giffords— in violation of NBC policy. (Despite rumors he'd be fired then, he was suspended for two days.) \\"There were many occasions, particularly in the last 2½ years, where all that surrounded the show — but never the show itself — was just too much for me,\\" he told viewers Friday in announcing his exit. Anyone who expects the political rhetoric to be toned down on MSNBC will be \\"rudely surprised,\\" Brent Bozell, founder of the conservative watchdog Media Research Center, told the Associated Press. O'Donnell \\"is every bit as mean-spirited (as Olbermann), but not as creative. I don't think the philosophy of MSNBC will change one iota.\\" Olbermann will be paid for the remainder of his estimated four-year, 30 million contract, which ends in November 2012, in exchange for a promise not to work for a competing TV news organization for an undisclosed length of time. When Olbermann is free to work, his options could include a satellite radio show, a return to sports or another cable network, although Fox News and CNN are unlikely homes. MSNBC said the impending takeover of NBC by cable giant Comcast, expected Friday with new management in place Jan. 31, had no role in Olbermann's ouster, and that the new owners were merely informed of the move after they received regulatory approval early this week. But the departure follows a number of moves made in advance of the takeover, including Thursday's exit by NBC Entertainment president Angela Bromstad, which had been widely expected, as part of a housecleaning that has also seen the departure of NBC Universal TV chief Jeff Gaspin and the company's CEO, Jeff Zucker. That suggests Comcast did not want to be tied to a change it had approved, if not initiated: Comcast late Friday reiterated its pledge \\"not to interfere in NBC News operations.\\" Olbermann has been no stranger to controversy. His early career covering sports at CNN, ESPN and Fox Sports Net included frequent clashes with management for intemperate remarks and often led to forced exits, and his latest job has been his longest-tenured at eight years. After an earlier stint at MSNBC in the late 1990s, he returned in 2003 as host of Countdown, leading the network to embrace a new identity as a liberal-leaning counterpoint to Fox News' successful right-wing tilt. Frequent guest Maddow got her own show that followed Countdown. We've updated the Conversation Guidelines. Changes include a brief review of the moderation process and an explanation on how to use the \\"Report Abuse\\" button. Summary:","completion":"The abrupt departure of top-rated host Keith Olbermann does not signal a philosophical shift for MSNBC, according to its chief Phil Griffin. He assured audiences that the network's sensibility remains unchanged as it reshuffles its prime-time lineup. Despite controversies surrounding Olbermann, his exit is not expected to tone down MSNBC's political rhetoric. The takeover of NBC by Comcast is not considered a factor in Olbermann's departure, and the cable giant reiterated its pledge not to interfere in NBC News operations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The address I had been given was a flophouse called Casa Salvador in the scummy side of downtown, the part where the city's redevelopment (read: \\"gentrification\\") efforts hadn't yet managed to drive out the sundry undesirable elements. I walked inside past the front lobby. I could tell the desk manager wanted to hassle me, but he was too busy arguing with a middle-aged peroxide-blonde woman in a leopard-print top. Her skin was leathery and weather beaten, and I guessed she was the type who was actually a good ten years younger than she looked. I made my way up the narrow staircase that smelled of urine and bleach, going all the way to the third floor. I continued down the dimly lit hallway, past a series of closed doors that muffled the sounds of women faking moans of pleasure. Room 313 was down at the far end of the hall, and its door was already slightly ajar. I knocked anyways, but there was no answer. Pushing the door open just enough to poke my head in, I called, \\"Hello? Is anybody in there?\\" There was no response, so I went in and felt along the wall for the light switch. A single weak bulb came on, lighting up the tiny, sparse room with a dim yellow glow. The room was about 8 feet by 8 feet, and the only furniture was a dingy, unmade bed and a metal foot locker. There were no windows, no closet, and no bathroom. As I stepped all the way in, I noticed a wooden baseball bat propped up beside the door. My watch said 6:20 - twenty minutes late for the interview. I sat on the edge of the bed to wait, hoping that maybe my contact had just stepped out momentarily. After a few minutes, a phone started ringing out in the hallway. I let it ring six times with no one answering before I decided to get it - partly in the off chance it was my contact, but mostly out of morbid curiosity as to what kind of business someone would have calling this dump. Question: How did he feel when he saw the bat? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","completion":"When he saw the wooden baseball bat propped up beside the door, he likely felt a mix of unease, curiosity, and caution. The presence of such an object in this seedy room could imply potential danger or violence, and in such a run-down locale, his instincts may have naturally been on high alert. The bat may have also piqued his interest, prompting him to wonder what its purpose might be in this specific setting and if it held any significance regarding his contact or the transaction he was there for. Given the overall atmosphere of Casa Salvador and the situation he found himself in, the bat could have served as a not-so-subtle reminder of the risks involved in coming to such a place and the potential consequences if things didn't go smoothly. His cautious approach to the situation, as well as his willingness to answer the ringing phone in the hallway, indicate that he was likely uneasy and wished to gather more information to assess the situation and find out whether his contact would eventually arrive. In summary, he likely felt a combination of unease, curiosity, and caution when he saw the bat, as it contributed to the unpredictability and potential danger of the situation in which he found himself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:With an overwhelming variety of educational toys and learning tools in the market, you really wonder if these educational products are really beneficial to children. There have been many educational DVDs in the market that promise to stimulate a child's learning and enhance his or her cognitive skills. Parents feel good about buying these products for their children. After all, these educational tools try to do a parent's job of participating in the child's education, especially when the parent can't be present due to his or her busy schedule. Moreover, children seem to love these DVDs that contain pictures, words, and loads of stories. Some DVDs contain fun, sing-along songs or read-aloud words to help the children learn different concepts and words. Although these are fun for the parents and the children, the question that needs to be asked is whether these DVDs are actually beneficial to the child, as they claim to be. Although parents expected \\"educational\\" products to give their child some educational advantage, research has shown otherwise. Researchers in a recent study concluded that there was indeed no difference between the language and cognitive ability of the infants who were repeatedly exposed to educational DVDs and those who were not exposed to the DVDs. In fact, contrary to expectations, it was found that babies who were exposed to the DVDs at an earlier age had lower overall language scores at a later age. This suggested a damaging effect of such DVDs on younger children. For several years the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended that toddlers under age of 24 months or 2 years should not watch videos or television. However, there are many parents who believe these DVDs really help in stimulating the child and keep him or her entertained. While it may work as a great babysitter, it is important to limit activities like video games, computer games, DVDs or TV programs.

Answer:","completion":"The last step in the process of a tree's life cycle involves the eventual natural death and decomposition of the tree, followed by the regeneration and subsequent continuation of the cycle. After a tree has produced seeds and those seeds have been dispersed by various agents like wind, animals, and water, they grow into new trees, continuing the life cycle of the forest ecosystem. As these new trees mature, they too will produce seeds, ensuring the survival of their species and contributing to the thriving of the entire ecosystem. However, it is essential to consider that trees, like all living organisms, have a finite life span. Over the years, a tree will face various threats like diseases, pests, weather conditions, and competition from other plants for resources like sunlight, water, and nutrients. Eventually, the tree will reach the end of its life due to old age, sickness, or external factors. At this point, the tree's life cycle enters the final stage: decomposition. This process is facilitated by decomposers like bacteria, fungi, and insects, which break down the tree's organic material and return essential nutrients to the soil. This nutrient-rich soil then provides an ideal environment for the growth of new plants, including the germination of seeds from other trees. In conclusion, the last step of a tree's life cycle involves the natural death of the tree and its decomposition, ultimately returning vital nutrients back to the soil. This process promotes the regeneration of new plants and trees, ensuring their species' survival and the continued thriving of the entire forest ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the size of the sign that Trump was approved for by the Mayor Rahm Emanuel's administration? According to Trump, he received approval for a 3,600-square-foot (334.5 m2) sign from Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley's administration in 2009, but renegotiated with Mayor Rahm Emanuel's administration. In October 2013, Trump received approval to erect 20-foot (6.1 m) tall stainless steel letters back-lit with white LED lighting spelling out TRUMP on the 16th floor of the building. He made his impending plans for the sign public in February 2014. According to a city planning department spokesperson, standard protocol for such a sign is to require approval from the local alderman (Brendan Reilly, 42nd ward) and the full Chicago City Council. The five letters span a width of approximately 141 feet (43 m), making the final approved version approximately 2,800 square feet (260.1 m2)—2,891 square feet (268.6 m2) according to some sources—rather than the originally proposed size. The sign is located about 200 feet (61 m) above ground level.Crews began hanging the sign in May 2014. When Chicago Tribune architecture critic Kamin warned Trump that his review of the sign would be unfavorable, Trump responded \\"As time passes, it'll be like the Hollywood Sign\\"; architect Smith distanced himself from the sign saying \\"Just for the record, I had nothing to do with this sign!\\" The controversy surrounding the sign drew attention in the national press and international press as it neared completion and the Associated Press ran a story about Mayor Emanuel's disapproval in mid-June. According to the Mayor's spokeswoman Kelley Quinn, \\"Mayor Emanuel believes this is an architecturally tasteful building scarred by an architecturally tasteless sign\\". Kamin has noted that part of the problem is the architectural traditions of the city: \\"If this sign was in Atlantic City or Las Vegas, nobody would care—but it is in Chicago, and in a part of Chicago full of great buildings from the 1920s to the 1960s and onward\\". Trump and Reilly both pointed out how unbecoming the prior Chicago Sun-Times building signage was. As a result of the fiasco,...

Remembering the \\"we have some planes\\" remark, Boston Center guessed that Delta 1989 might also be hijacked.

The Command Center and FAA headquarters watched it too. During the course of the morning, there were multiple erroneous reports of hijacked aircraft. The report of American 11 heading south was the first; Delta 1989 was the second. NEADS never lost track of Delta 1989, and even ordered fighter aircraft from Ohio and Michigan to intercept it. The flight never turned off its transponder. NEADS soon learned that the aircraft was not hijacked, and tracked Delta 1989 as it reversed course over Toledo, headed east, and landed in Cleveland.

In the late 19th century, the most influential theorists were William James (1842–1910) and Carl Lange (1834–1900). James was an American psychologist and philosopher who wrote about educational psychology, psychology of religious experience/mysticism, and the philosophy of pragmatism. Lange was a Danish physician and psychologist. Working independently, they developed the James–Lange theory, a hypothesis on the origin and nature of emotions. The theory states that within human beings, as a response to experiences in the world, the autonomic nervous system creates physiological events such as muscular tension, a rise in heart rate, perspiration, and dryness of the mouth. Emotions, then, are feelings which come about as a result of these physiological changes, rather than being their cause.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party. Roland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders. His longsword and dagger swung heavy at his waist. He wore them only because, as a knight, he was expected to.

Now we move on to college life once you are admitted to a school. The first thing you need to value is a place to live. Housing policies differ from school to school. Students might have to live in a dormitory, at least for the first year there. Dorms come in all sizes. Some have suites. Six or more students may line in one suite. Other dorms have many rooms along a common hallway, usually with two students in each room . Many students say dormitories provide the best chance to get to know other students. Also, dorms generally cost less than apartments or other housing not owned by the school. Most colleges and universities offer singe-sex dorms, but usually males and females live in the same building. They might live on the same floors and share the same common bathrooms. They may live in the same room only if they are married. Edward Spencer is the associate vice president for student affairs at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. He says it is important to understand the rules of the building in which you will live. He advises students to ask questions before they decide about their housing. For example, if a student requires a special diet, will the school provide it ?How much privacy can a student expect ? Will the school provide a single room if a student requests one ? And what about any other special needs that a student might have? Virginia Tech, for example, had a ban against candles in dorms .

Asphalt: Canadian bitumen does not differ substantially from oils such as Venezuelan extra-heavy and Mexican heavy oil in chemical composition, and the real difficulty is moving the extremely viscous bitumen through oil pipelines to the refinery. Many modern oil refineries are extremely sophisticated and can process non-upgraded bitumen directly into products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, and refined asphalt without any preprocessing. This is particularly common in areas such as the US Gulf coast, where refineries were designed to process Venezuelan and Mexican oil, and in areas such as the US Midwest where refineries were rebuilt to process heavy oil as domestic light oil production declined. Given the choice, such heavy oil refineries usually prefer to buy bitumen rather than synthetic oil because the cost is lower, and in some cases because they prefer to produce more diesel fuel and less gasoline. By 2015 Canadian production and exports of non-upgraded bitumen exceeded that of synthetic crude oil at over 1.3 million barrels (210×10^3 m3) per day, of which about 65% was exported to the United States.

This will cause you no physical harm or lasting effect, but if for any reason you lose control or feel that your mind is leaving your body -- leave the auditorium immediately. The disclaimer is accompanied by a narrator, who advises viewers to take caution regarding their surroundings once the film has begun, and not to engage in conversation with any unknown individuals for the duration of the running time. In the Los Angeles theater The Rex, moviegoers watch the film within a film, The Mommy. The Mommy tells the story of John Pressman (Michael Lerner), an extremely myopic, uncontrolled diabetic who works as an ophthalmologist's assistant and is progressively growing blind. For unstated reasons, his overbearing mother Alice (Zelda Rubinstein) hypnotizes him and induces him to murder people so that he can remove their eyes and bring them back to her. One evening, Johnâagainst his mother's wishesâbarricades himself inside of a movie theater playing The Lost World, where he sets about killing the patrons one by one with a scalpel. Once John's rampage becomes apparent, the surviving moviegoers attempt to flee the now sealed-off theater.

SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea bade farewell to former President Kim Dae-Jung Sunday in a ceremony attended by thousands of citizens, dignitaries and politicians. South Korean Buddhist monks pray in front of a portrait of former president Kim Dae-jung during his funeral Sunday. The solemn Sunday afternoon ceremony was held outside parliament, with a large portrait of Kim placed on a shrine surrounded by flowers. The funeral followed six days of mourning for Kim, who died Tuesday of a heart failure. Kim's age at the time of his death was in dispute, with some reports saying he was 85 while others placing it at 83. Kim's state funeral was the second such ever given in the country, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said. Another president, Park Chung-hee, was also accorded a state funeral after his assassination while in office in 1979. Kim -- who was president from 1998 to 2003 -- won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for trying to foster better relations with North Korea. The watershed moment of his presidency came in June 2000 when he met North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, becoming the first South Korean leader to do so since the Korean War unofficially ended in 1953. But rapproachment talks between the two sides hit a wall after conservative South Korean President Lee Myung-bak took office in early 2008 with a tougher stance toward the North than Kim and his successor, Roh Moo-hyun. Ahead of the funeral, President Lee met with a visiting North Korean delegation, who delivered a message from Kim Jong Il expressing hopes for improved relations between the two countries. Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1. Who's image was being prayed in front of? 2. On what occasion? 3. Where was it at? 4. When had he passed? 5. Of what? 6.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What type of music was \\"Big Fun\\"? is inside the article: Detroit techno is an offshoot of Chicago house music which developed in the early and mid-1980s. One of the earliest hits was \\"Big Fun\\" by Inner City. Detroit techno developed as the DJ The Electrifying Mojo did his radio program, which fused eclectic sounds into the signature Detroit techno sound. This sound, also influenced by European electronica (Kraftwerk, Art of Noise), Japanese synthpop (Yellow Magic Orchestra), early B-boy (breakdancing) Hip-Hop (Man Parrish, Soul Sonic Force) and Italo disco (Doctor's Cat, Ris, Klein M.B.O.), was further pioneered by Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson, known as the Belleville Three. Derrick May a.k.a. \\"MAYDAY\\" and Thomas Barnett released \\"Nude Photo\\" in 1987 on May's label \\"Transmat Records\\", which helped start the Detroit techno music scene. This record was played on Chicago's Hot Mix 5 Radio DJ mix show and in Chicago clubs. A year later, Transmat released \\"Strings of Life\\". Transmat Records also released such as 1988's \\"Wiggin\\". As well, Derrick May had releases on Kool Kat Records and many remixes for underground and mainstream recording artists. Kevin Saunderson's company KMS Records contributed many releases that were as much house music as they were techno. These tracks were well received in Chicago and played on Chicago radio and in clubs.Blake Baxter's 1986 recording, \\"When we Used to Play / Work your Body\\", 1987's \\"Bounce Your Body to the Box\\" and \\"Force Field\\", \\"The Sound / How to Play our Music\\" and \\"the Groove that Won't Stop\\" and a remix of \\"Grooving Without a Doubt\\". In 1988, as house music became more popular among general audiences, Kevin Saunderson's group Inner City with Paris Gray released the 1988 hits \\"Big Fun\\" and \\"Good Life\\", which eventually were picked up by Virgin Records. Each EP / 12 inch single sported remixes by Mike \\"Hitman\\" Wilson and Steve \\"Silk\\" Hurley of Chicago and Derrick \\"Mayday\\" May and Juan Atkins of Detroit.

Context: A federal judge on Thursday rejected efforts by Texas to stop the resettlement of Syrian refugees within its borders. The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council. This was an increase of 2.9 million from 2013. The remaining 5.1 million refugees were registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.

What is the most logical completion of this news story?. (CNN) -- One was the archetypal military strongman, intent on maintaining the social order and saving his country from \\"catastrophe.\\" The other was a charismatic shipyard electrician and trade union leader who was just as determined to lead his countrymen to freedom. Wojciech Jaruzelski and Lech Walesa attend the first multi-party session of the Polish parliament in 1989. Yet nowadays Wojciech Jaruzelski, the last leader of communist Poland, and Lech Walesa both claim, in their different ways, to have played their part in setting Poland on the path to democracy. The rise of Solidarity, the union and social movement which Walesa founded among the dockers of Gdansk in 1980, was crucial to the ultimate collapse of communism in Poland and across the Soviet bloc. Walesa admits the threat of Soviet intervention in the early 1980s was real, but says Solidarity had already won the argument against communism by the time OPTIONS: - CNN imposed martial law. - Gdansk imposed martial law. - Jaruzelski imposed martial law. - Lech Walesa imposed martial law. - Poland imposed martial law. - Polish imposed martial law. - Solidarity imposed martial law. - Soviet imposed martial law. - Walesa imposed martial law. - Wojciech Jaruzelski imposed martial law.","completion":"Correct Answer: Jaruzelski imposed martial law. Explanation: In the story, Wojciech Jaruzelski is mentioned as the last leader of communist Poland. Leaders are usually the ones who have the power to implement big changes, like imposing martial law. So, it makes sense that Jaruzelski would be the one to have done it. None of the other options are right because they either don't have the power to impose martial law or weren't in a position to do so at the time. For example, a news network like CNN just reports the news; it doesn't have the power to change a country's laws. Lech Walesa may have been a leader, but he was leading a social movement for freedom, not controlling the government or the laws. It's like if you're playing a game: only the person in charge of the game can change the rules. In this case, Jaruzelski was the one in charge."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: How much did you loan out? When do you expect the borrower to pay you back? If multiple payments will be made, agree on specific dates for the payments. Especially if you're lending money to a friend or family member, it may seem a little extortionate to charge interest. But there are several good reasons why you may want to charge the person you're giving money to a little bit of interest: If you're giving away money without interest, you're losing money. You're losing purchasing power (the ability to buy and invest with the money you're lending) and inflation is outstripping your money. If you charge someone interest, the borrower may be more likely to pay you back quicker than had you not. Think about it: Interest lasts as long as the life of the loan, so if the borrower holds on to the money longer, they'll end up paying more interest. Don't charge more than 15% or 20%. In fact, interest rates above 15% or 20% might not even be allowed under predatory lending laws. So keep the interest rate at something manageable and both parties will be happy. Include your signature along with your legal name. Have them put down a signature along with a legal name. Although a witness does not make or break the IOU, it's helpful if you ever need to go to court. A witness might be able to prove a binding verbal contract took place. Summary:","completion":"The article discusses the importance of charging interest when lending money, especially to friends or family members. It highlights that lending money without interest can result in a loss of purchasing power and inflation outpacing the loaned amount. Charging interest can encourage the borrower to pay back the loan faster, as the interest accumulates over time. The article recommends not charging more than 15% to 20% interest to comply with predatory lending laws. Finally, it suggests including signatures and legal names in the loan agreement and having a witness available, in case the matter goes to court."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"To answer your question, let's break it down step-by-step and understand the potential effects of a natural disaster on the availability of women for procreation and its influence on the birth and development of children. 1. More natural disasters occurring: This could lead to the loss of lives, including women. Consequently, there may be fewer women available for procreation. 2. Less women available: Having fewer women available for procreation would reduce the overall population growth rate, as there would be fewer potential mothers to give birth. 3. Effect on embryo growth and development (C): If more natural disasters occur and fewer women are available for procreation due to the loss of lives, it would have a \\"less\\" effect on the number of embryos growing and developing into fetuses inside women's wombs. The overall birth rate would decrease. 4. Effect on human growth, development, and sexual maturity: The reduced birth rate resulting from fewer women being available for procreation due to more natural disasters also means there would be fewer infants, children, teenagers, and adults growing and developing. This would lead to a decrease in the number of humans experiencing puberty and reaching sexual maturity. 5. Effect on humans reaching adulthood and possibly procreating: Due to fewer women being available for procreation and the reduced overall population growth rate, there would be \\"less\\" effect on the number of humans reaching adulthood and procreating, continuing the cycle.

The town developed from the mid 12th century onwards, but was not noted until the 13th century. By 1252 it was established as a seaport and became a chartered borough. Melcombe Regis developed separately on the peninsula to the north of the harbour; it was mentioned as a licensed wool port in 1310. French raiders found the port so accessible that in 1433 the staple was transferred to Poole. Melcombe Regis is thought to be the first port at which the Black Death came into England in June 1348, possibly either aboard a spice ship or an army ship. In their early history Weymouth and Melcombe Regis were rivals for trade and industry, but the towns were united in an Act of Parliament in 1571 to form a double borough. Both towns have become known as Weymouth, despite Melcombe Regis being the main centre. The villages of Upwey, Broadwey, Preston, Wyke Regis, Chickerell, Southill, Radipole and Littlemoor have become part of the built-up area. King Henry VIII had two Device Forts built to protect the south Dorset coast from invasion in the 1530s: Sandsfoot Castle in Wyke Regis and Portland Castle in Castletown. Parts of Sandsfoot have fallen into the sea due to coastal erosion. During the English Civil War, around 250 people were killed in the local Crabchurch Conspiracy in February 1645. In 1635, on board the ship Charity, around 100 emigrants from the town crossed the Atlantic Ocean and settled in Weymouth, Massachusetts. More townspeople emigrated to the Americas to bolster the population of Weymouth, Nova Scotia and Salem, Massachusetts; then called Naumking. There are memorials to this on the side of Weymouth Harbour and near to Weymouth Pavilion and Weymouth Sea Life Tower.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Process: - Carbon dioxide passes through stomata in the leaves - Water is absorbed through roots - Chloroplast cells in leaves contain chlorophyll - Chlorophyll absorbs energy from sunlight - Energy splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen - Oxygen gets released into atmosphere - Hydrogen and carbon dioxide used to create glucose - Glucose is food for plants. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more oxygen will be released into the atmosphere happens, how will it affect MORE sugar and oxygen being produced. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that an increase in the amount of oxygen released into the atmosphere will lead to more sugar and oxygen being produced through the process of photosynthesis. To understand whether the perturbation will have a direct or indirect effect on the process, we need to take a closer look at the various stages of photosynthesis and how oxygen release is regulated. Photosynthesis is a complex process in which plants, algae, and certain bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose. This process can be broadly divided into two stages – the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (also known as the Calvin cycle). During the light-dependent reactions, light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll pigments in the chloroplast cells. This energy is then used to split water molecules into hydrogen ions, electrons, and oxygen gas. The generated oxygen is released into the atmosphere, while the hydrogen ions and electrons are used in the subsequent light-independent reactions. Oxygen release is therefore primarily regulated by the rate at which light-dependent reactions occur. In the light-independent reactions, the hydrogen ions, electrons, and carbon dioxide are used to synthesize glucose, which serves as food for the plants. This process relies on various enzymes, including those involved in the conversion of CO2 into glucose. Here, the oxygen levels in the environment may indirectly affect sugar production. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that releasing more oxygen into the atmosphere will lead to an increase in sugar and oxygen production in the plant. However, this supposition may not necessarily be accurate as the primary determinant of sugar and oxygen production is the light-dependent reactions occurring within the chloroplasts. These reactions are largely driven by the availability of light energy and water, factors that are not immediately influenced by an increase in atmospheric oxygen. Additionally, it is essential to note that photosynthesis is finely regulated by various regulatory processes, including feedback inhibition and control of enzyme activities. Increased oxygen levels in the environment can lead to a phenomenon known as photorespiration, wherein oxygen competes with carbon dioxide for the enzyme Rubisco's active site. This results in a decrease in photosynthetic efficiency, as less CO2 is converted into glucose, and more energy is used in the process. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis's proposed direct effect of increased oxygen release leading to more sugar and oxygen produced may not necessarily hold true. While an increase in atmospheric oxygen could have indirect effects on the photosynthesis process, it's essential to consider other factors such as light energy, water availability, and the complex regulatory mechanisms that govern this process. Therefore, the supposed perturbation might not straightforwardly lead to an increase in sugar and oxygen production within plants."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

THE WIGMORE VENUS The morning was so brilliantly fine; the populace popped to and fro in so active and cheery a manner; and everybody appeared to be so absolutely in the pink, that a casual observer of the city of New York would have said that it was one of those happy days. Yet Archie Moffam, as he turned out of the sun-bathed street into the ramshackle building on the third floor of which was the studio belonging to his artist friend, James B. Wheeler, was faintly oppressed with a sort of a kind of feeling that something was wrong. He would not have gone so far as to say that he had the pip--it was more a vague sense of discomfort. And, searching for first causes as he made his way upstairs, he came to the conclusion that the person responsible for this nebulous depression was his wife, Lucille. It seemed to Archie that at breakfast that morning Lucille's manner had been subtly rummy. Nothing you could put your finger on, still--rummy. Musing thus, he reached the studio, and found the door open and the room empty. It had the air of a room whose owner has dashed in to fetch his golf-clubs and biffed off, after the casual fashion of the artist temperament, without bothering to close up behind him. And such, indeed, was the case. The studio had seen the last of J. B. Wheeler for that day: but Archie, not realising this and feeling that a chat with Mr. Wheeler, who was a light-hearted bird, was what he needed this morning, sat down to wait.

Our concierge at the Marriott Chateau Champlain recommended this place saying it wasn't too expensive (after going all out at Au Pied de Cochon the previous evening, I was looking to give my credit card a break) and mentioned the wine pairings, and my lady and I were in. When I checked the menu beforehand I was surprised at her definition of \\"not too expensive,\\" but I have no issues shelling out for good food. As a price measure we skipped apps and started with mains as wine pairings (as others have noted each dish is paired with an accord - classic wine combination, and a discord - a pairing that still works, but its a little funky, meant to get your taste buds working). I would recommend getting half glasses of both the accord and discord (I actually preferred my discord with my fish). The lady got the Surf & Turf, lobster, lobster stuffed pasta and seared sweetbreads (she liked the sweetbreads until I told her what they were [mistake!]). I got the Pomo Dore, seared pike w/ tomatoes, clams and mozzarella. Both dishes were beautifully presented and perfectly composed. The broth in my fish was superb, and the wine pairings really brought my food to a new level. I must admit, though I dine out quite often, I was never much for wine pairings, thinking concept a bit contrived. After Accords, I'm on board. At the (excellent) recommendation of our waiter we shared the San Domingo Dingo, a chocolate and cherries dessert w/ black forest ice cream that was expertly paired (thanks again, mr. waiter) with a delicious dessert wine.

Article: Your skin could be dull because it's covered in dead skin, and it may have accumulated dirt and oil over the course of the day or night. Washing will clear your pores and remove excess oil and dirt. Do not wash your face more than twice a day, however. You may irritate and dry out your skin, which will lead to a dull appearance. Exfoliation removes dead skin cells and smooths out your skin for a brighter appearance. You should exfoliate both your face and body one to three times a week. More often will irritate your skin; less often will cause the build-up of dead skin cells. Use a facial scrub for your face. You can buy a scrub from the drug store or make your own. A good natural scrub is sugar and honey. A number of body scrubs are available for exfoliating below your neck. You may also use a scrub brush for your face. Put a few drops of your cleanser on the bristles and slowly work the brush in a circular motion around your damp face. Rinse afterwards. Use exfoliating gloves on your body. These gloves can be worn in the shower. Lather them up with your favorite body wash and work the soap over your body. Exfoliate before you shave for an extra close and smooth body. Do not use the gloves on your face. Moisturizer will make your skin glow with a healthy shine. That said, you want moisturizer that will work for your particular skin type. Different moisturizers are produced for various skin types and conditions. If you have extremely dry skin, a lotion containing an oil base (either mineral or vegetable oil) will rehydrate your skin. If you have normal skin, find a water-based moisturizer that is not greasy. If you have oily skin that is prone to acne, try a gel or water based moisturizer that will keep your face hydrated without clogging your pores. Many people moisturize their faces but forget about the rest of their bodies! And just like with your face, you want to make sure that you choose a moisturizer that is right for your body. This will be a different type of lotion than your face. You can choose from scented or unscented varieties. Moisturize at least once a day to keep your skin glowing. Body lotion is a basic moisturizer. It is usually made from a mixture of oil, water, and emulsifying wax. It can be used once a day after every shower. Lotion is sufficient for normal to oily skin. Body creams and butters are made of similar ingredients to lotions, but they are often more concentrated. Body creams are recommended for dry or ashy skin. Body oils are the main ingredients of lotion but without the water and wax; they typically contain fewer chemicals than lotions. These also have much better hydrating properties, but too much can appear greasy and clog your skin. While your skin is still damp, apply a few dabs of a cold-pressed oil to your body.

It was one of the last western colonial European powers to give up its overseas territories (among them Angola and Mozambique in 1975), turning over the administration of Macau to the People's Republic of China at the end of 1999. Consequently, it has both influenced and been influenced by cultures from former colonies or dependencies, resulting in immigration from these former territories for both economic and/or personal reasons. Portugal, long a country of emigration (the vast majority of Brazilians have Portuguese ancestry), has now become a country of net immigration, and not just from the last Indian (Portuguese until 1961), African (Portuguese until 1975), and Far East Asian (Portuguese until 1999) overseas territories. An estimated 800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal as the country's African possessions gained independence in 1975. By 2007, Portugal had 10,617,575 inhabitants of whom about 332,137 were legal immigrants.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - A record producer or music producer oversees and manages the sound recording and production of a band or performer's music, which may range from recording one song to recording a lengthy concept album. A producer has many roles during the recording process. The roles of a producer vary. He or she may gather musical ideas for the project, collaborate with the artists to select cover tunes or original songs by the artist/group, work with artists and help them to improve their songs, lyrics or arrangements. - Multimedia is content that uses a combination of different content forms such as text, audio, images, animations, video and interactive content. Multimedia contrasts with media that use only rudimentary computer displays such as text-only or traditional forms of printed or hand-produced material. - Structural film was an experimental film movement prominent in the US in the 1960s and which developed into the Structural/materialist films in the UK in the 1970s. - In music, serialism is a method or technique of composition that uses a series of values to manipulate different musical elements. Serialism began primarily with Arnold Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique, though some of his contemporaries were also working to establish serialism as a form of post-tonal thinking. Twelve-tone technique orders the twelve notes of the chromatic scale, forming a row or series and providing a unifying basis for a composition's melody, harmony, structural progressions, and variations. Other types of serialism also work with sets, collections of objects, but not necessarily with fixed-order series, and extend the technique to other musical dimensions (often called \\"parameters\\"), such as duration, dynamics, and timbre. The idea of serialism is also applied in various ways in the visual arts, design, and architecture, and the musical concept has also been adopted in literature . - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - The Velvet Underground was an American rock band from New York City, active between 1964 and 1973. Formed by singer/guitarist Lou Reed, multi-instrumentalist John Cale, guitarist Sterling Morrison, and drummer Angus Maclise (who was replaced by Maureen Tucker in 1965), the group was briefly managed by the pop artist Andy Warhol, and served as the house band at the Factory and Warhol's \\"Exploding Plastic Inevitable\\" events from 1966 to 1967. Despite achieving little commercial success during its existence, the Velvet Underground is now recognized as among the most influential bands of all time for its integration of rock music with the avant-garde. - Drone music, drone-based music, or simply drone, is a minimal music genre that emphasizes the use of sustained or repeated sounds, notes, or tone-clusters called drones. It is typically characterized by lengthy audio programs with relatively slight harmonic variations throughout each piece. La Monte Young, one of its 1960s originators, defined it in 2000 as \\"the sustained tone branch of minimalism\\". - Downtown music is a subdivision of American music, closely related to experimental music. The scene the term describes began in 1960, when Yoko Ono, one of the early Fluxus artists, opened her loft at 112 Chambers Street to be used as a performance space for a series curated by La Monte Young and Richard Maxfield. Prior to this, most classical music performances in New York City occurred \\"uptown\\" around the areas that the Juilliard School at Lincoln Center and Columbia University would soon occupy. Ono's gesture led to a new performance tradition of informal performances in nontraditional venues such as lofts and converted industrial spaces, involving music much more experimental than that of the more conventional modern classical series Uptown. Spaces in Manhattan that supported Downtown music from the 1960s on included the Judson Memorial Church, The Kitchen, Experimental Intermedia, Roulette, the Knitting Factory, Dance Theater Workshop, Tonic, the Gas Station, the Paula Cooper Gallery, and others. Brooklyn Academy of Music has also shown a predilection for composers from the Downtown scene. - Anthony Schmalz \\"Tony\\" Conrad (March 7, 1940 April 9, 2016) was an American avant-garde video artist, experimental filmmaker, musician, composer, sound artist, teacher, and writer. Active in a variety of media since the early 1960s, he was a pioneer of both structural film and drone music. He performed and collaborated with a wide range of artists over the course of his career, most prominently the 1960s New York experimental music collective Theatre of Eternal Music, also known as The Dream Syndicate. - Inside the Dream Syndicate , Vol. I : Day of Niagara or simply Day of Niagara is a 1965 album by the minimalist music group the Theatre of Eternal Music , aka the Dream Syndicate . Contributors include future Velvet Underground bassist John Cale , original Velvet Underground drummer Angus Maclise , composers La Monte Young and Tony Conrad , and Marian Zazeela . - A poet is a person who writes poetry. Poets may describe themselves as such or be described as such by others. A poet may simply be a writer of poetry, or may perform their art to an audience. - John Davies Cale, OBE (born 9 March 1942) is a Welsh musician, composer, singer-songwriter and record producer who was a founding member of the American experimental rock band the Velvet Underground. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - The avant-garde (from French, \\"advance guard\\" or \\"vanguard\\", literally \\"fore-guard\\") are people or works that are experimental, radical, or unorthodox, with respect to art, culture, and society. It may be characterized by nontraditional, aesthetic innovation and initial unacceptability, and it may offer a critique of the relationship between producer and consumer. - Fluxus is an international and interdisciplinary group of artists, composers, designers and poets that took shape in the 1960s and 1970s. Dutch gallerist and art critic Harry Ruhé describes Fluxus as \\"the most radical and experimental art movement of the sixties\\". Fluxus is known for experimental contributions to different artistic media and disciplines. Fluxus is also known for generating art forms that were new when Fluxus artists created them. These art forms include intermedia, a term coined by Fluxus artist Dick Higgins, concept art, first developed by sometime Fluxus artist Henry Flynt, video art, first pioneered by Nam June Paik and Wolf Vostell. - Video art is an art form which relies on moving pictures in a visual and audio medium. Video art came into existence during the late 1960s and early 1970s as new consumer video technology became available outside corporate broadcasting. Video art can take many forms: recordings that are broadcast; installations viewed in galleries or museums; works streamed online, distributed as video tapes, or DVDs; and performances which may incorporate one or more television sets, video monitors, and projections, displaying live or recorded images and sounds;. - La Monte Thornton Young (born October 14, 1935) is an American avant-garde composer, musician, and artist generally recognized as the first minimalist composer. His works are cited as notable examples of post-war experimental and contemporary music, and were tied to New York's downtown music and Fluxus art scenes. Initially inspired by sources such as Indian classical music, serialism, and jazz, Young is perhaps best known for his pioneering work in Western drone music (originally referred to as \\"dream music\\"), prominently explored in the 1960s with the experimental music collective the Theatre of Eternal Music. He has engaged in musical and multimedia collaborations with a wide range of artists, including Tony Conrad, Pandit Pran Nath, John Cale, Terry Riley, and visual artist Marian Zazeela, with whom he developed the \\"Dream House\\" sound and light installation. - Marian Zazeela (born April 15, 1940) is a light-artist, designer, painter and musician based in New York City. She was a member of the 1960s New York experimental music collective Theatre of Eternal Music, and is known for her collaborative work with minimalist composer La Monte Young. - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores). - Terrence Mitchell \\"Terry\\" Riley (born June 24, 1935) is an American composer and performing musician associated with the minimalist school of Western classical music, of which he was a pioneer. His work is deeply influenced by both jazz and Indian classical music. - Indian classical music is a genre of South Asian music. It has two major traditions. The North Indian classical music tradition is called \\"Hindustani\\", while the South Indian expression is called \\"Carnatic\\". These traditions were not distinct till about the 16th century. There on, during the turmoils of Islamic rule period of the Indian subcontinent, the traditions separated and evolved into distinct forms. However, the two systems continue to have more common features than differences. - Angus William MacLise (March 4, 1938 June 21, 1979) was an American percussionist, composer, poet, occultist and calligrapher, known as the first drummer for the Velvet Underground. - In mathematics, a ratio is a relationship between two numbers indicating how many times the first number contains the second. For example, if a bowl of fruit contains eight oranges and six lemons, then the ratio of oranges to lemons is eight to six (that is, 8:6, which is equivalent to the ratio 4:3). Thus, a ratio can be a fraction as opposed to a whole number. Also, in this example the ratio of lemons to oranges is 6:8 (or 3:4), and the ratio of oranges to the total amount of fruit is 8:14 (or 4:7).

Metallica opted for extensive touring instead of releasing a single or video to promote the album. Metallica spent March to August 1986 touring as the opening act for Ozzy Osbourne in the United States, the first tour Metallica played to arena-sized audiences. During sound checks, the group played riffs from Osbourne's previous band Black Sabbath, which Osbourne perceived as a mockery toward him. Referring to that occasion, Ulrich stated that Metallica was honored to play with Osbourne, who treated the band well on the tour. Metallica was noted by the media for its excessive drinking habit while touring and earned the nickname \\"Alcoholica\\". The band members occasionally wore satirical T-shirts reading \\"Alcoholica/Drank 'Em All\\". The band usually played a 45-minute set often followed by an encore. According to Ulrich, the audiences in bigger cities were already familiar with Metallica's music, unlike in the smaller towns they've visited. \\"In the B-markets, people really don't know what we're all about. But after 45 or 50 minutes we can tell we've won them over.

Plot title: Django Unchained Movie plot: In 1858, Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave, is chained to a bunch of other slaves and being marched to his new owner's estate in Texas by the Speck brothers. At nightfall, a German man in a dentist cart pulls up and hails the Speck brothers. He introduces himself as Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz).Schultz is clearly more intelligent and enlightened than the Specks. He says he is looking for a slave who can identify a band of wanted fugitives known as the Brittle brothers. Django announces that he knows the Brittle brothers and can identify them. Schultz offers to buy Django, but his polite and educated manner rubs the ill-mannered Specks the wrong way, and Ace Speck threatens to shoot him with his shotgun. In response, Schultz lowers his lantern, whips out a revolver, and shoots Ace, then Dicky's horse, causing Dicky to fall off his horse. The horse carcass then lands on and crushes Dicky's leg, leaving him screaming in pain. Crippled, he agrees to sell Django, and Schultz pays the man (for both Django, and the dead Speck's horse), gets an official title to Django, and prepares to ride off.Before Schultz leaves, however, he frees the remaining slaves (clearly, Schultz finds slavery abhorrent) and says that they may either carry the remaining Speck brother back to town, or shoot him and flee.

Putting Biden's exit speech through the politico translator The American Geological Survey can do amazing things with those seismographs that go from all calm to a mass of jagged peaks as they confirm earthquake activity. I wonder whether they had an instrument that measured enormous sighs of relief in Brooklyn, home of the Hillary Clinton campaign, as Joe Biden bade farewell to his presidential ambitions. The mass exhalation of breath of all the Clintonistas must have been quite something. After her rock-solid and statesmanlike performance in the Democratic debate in Las Vegas last week, Clinton's poll position has been consolidated. The only pesky cloud on the horizon was Joe Biden. For all those people who don't quite like Clinton - and you don't have to scratch the surface very hard to find huge numbers of these people - but couldn't bring themselves to vote for the self-styled democratic socialist Bernie Sanders, then the entry of Biden into the race could have shaken things up quite considerably. For a start it would have given Barack Obama a knotty little problem of whom to support. The superbly well-qualified Clinton, or lovable and loyal Biden. It could have certainly taken vital funding away from Clinton towards his camp. Let's take Biden at his word this was all about whether the time he needed to grieve his son Beau would forbid a tilt at the White House. But certainly his supporters and closest advisers were scoping a run - what they would need to do to put an infrastructure in place, whether the \\"bundlers\\" would be able to raise the money to mount a well-financed campaign. If it was a clear cut decision for either Biden or his most senior aides, we would have heard before now what his intentions were. So what are we left with from today's Rose Garden address? Let's play the fun political game of here's what he said, and here's what he meant. \\"I intend to speak out clearly and forcefully, to influence as much as I can where we stand as a party and where we need to go as a nation.... I believe that President Obama has led this nation from crisis to recovery, and we're now on the cusp of resurgence. I'm proud to have played a part in that. This party, our nation, will be making a tragic mistake if we walk away or attempt to undo the Obama legacy. The American people have worked too hard, and we have have come too far for that. Democrats should not only defend this record and protect this record. They should run on the record.\\" Let's put that through the politico-translator app. What comes out? Hillary, if you want me to back you don't go around trash-talking the president's record. He did great things. You were part of it and you agreed with it, so don't go dissing him otherwise you'll have me to contend with. \\"I believe that we have to end the divisive partisan politics that is ripping this country apart. And I think we can. It's mean spirited, it's petty, and it's gone on for much too long. I don't believe, like some do, that it's naive to talk to Republicans. I don't think we should look at Republicans as our enemies. They are our opposition.\\" Translation? Clinton- enough already with the 'Republicans are our enemies'. If you win you're going to have to govern with them, so stop being so bloody divisive. (I think this must be an app from the UK). And then I put this final phrase in: \\"I am absolutely certain that we fully are capable of accomplishing extraordinary things. We can do this. And when we do, America won't just win the future, we will own the finish line.\\" I had to translate this a couple of times because it didn't seem to bear much relationship to what I had typed in. It came out as - I might not be running, but I would have been a great president. But that's not going to happen now - and there is not much left in the road to trip Clinton up - just some Sanders-shaped bumps in her way. Given the troubled and maladroit way the email saga has been handled that can't be entirely ruled out. And if something did go horribly wrong with Clinton's campaign - wouldn't the Democratic Party turn to the vice-president in its moment of need, saying: \\"Come on Joe\\". And he would say \\"You bet\\". No translation needed.

The answer is:","completion":"Luigi Maglione was born on 2nd March 1877 in Casoria, a town in the Kingdom of Italy. He was an Italian national who devoted his life to serving the Roman Catholic Church. Luigi Maglione was ordained as a priest on 25th July 1901, and years later, on 26th September 1920, he was consecrated by Pietro Gasparri. Maglione held various notable positions within the Church throughout his career. He had a distinguished tenure as an apostolic nuncio, serving in Switzerland from 1920 to 1926 and in France from 1926 to 1935. Moreover, he was the Apostolic of Cesarea in Palestina from 1920 to 1935, which demonstrates the extent of his service to the Catholic Church. Luigi Maglione's dedication and hard work earned him recognition from Pope Pius XI, who created him a cardinal on 16th December 1935. Later, on 18th June 1936, he was appointed as the Cardinal-Priest of Santa Pudenziana, a title he would hold until his death. Maglione's coat of arms can be found in a file called \\"Coat of arms of Luigi Maglione.svg.\\" While serving as a cardinal, Luigi Maglione also held other key positions in the Church. He was the Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs from 1939 to 1944, and more notably, he was the Cardinal Secretary of State during the same period. This position made him a significant figure within the Holy See and the Church's administration.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. They are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, when you fry an egg, turning up the heat causes the egg to cook faster. The same principle explains why storing food in a cold refrigerator reduces the rate at which food spoils (see Figure below ). Both food frying and food spoiling are chemical reactions that happen faster at higher temperatures. Paragraph: Ned learned about reactions at a higher temperature for his physics class, while Paul had to learn about reactions at lower temperatures. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person studied about a slower reaction rate?","completion":"Based on the given information, Paul studied reactions at lower temperatures. As mentioned, when the temperature of reactants is lower, their reacting particles exhibit lower average energy, resulting in a decreased rate of collisions and less force during each collision. Consequently, this leads to a slower reaction rate. Conversely, Ned learned about reactions at higher temperatures, which involve faster reaction rates associated with the increased energy of reacting particles and a higher frequency of collisions with greater force. Therefore, the person who studied a slower reaction rate is Paul."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

The Domestic Violence Legal Assistance Program fills the gap of legal resources for domestic violence survivors who can't afford an attorney. Domestic violence survivors in Jackson, Vicksburg, Hattiesburg, Oxford and Pascagoula can all get help. Julia Crockett, deputy director of Central Southwest Mississippi Legal Services Corp., said the program expects to help nearly 1,000 domestic violence victims. Crockett said legal help gives domestic abuse survivors a way to rebuild their lives. \\"They have been made to feel by the abuser that no one is going to help them do anything, so when they come to us they are desperate,\\" she said. \\"Those who need legal help and don't get it feel totally lost. Because then they feel like they are forced to stay in that situation.\\" Crockett said the program, funded by a 300,000 grant from the U.S. Justice Department, has no economic restrictions on who can get help. Legal services typically helps the poor. Gladys Bunzy, who said she was in an abusive relationship with a boyfriend for eight years, said such a program is long overdue and could be a lifeline for those escaping violent relationships. \\"When I finally made up my mind to leave, I had a restraining order put against him and that was 50 but that was 50 well spent to me,\\" said Bunzy, 40. \\"For people who can't afford it, this will be a godsend ... If a woman knows she is going to get some help that will be a burden off her mind, if the law will help her keep that person away from her.\\" Gwen Bouie-Haynes, project director of the Domestic Violence Services Center for Catholic Charities Inc., said often domestic violence survivors do not have the money to seek legal representation. \\"Legal assistance is a major issue for women fleeing a domestic violence situation,\\" she said. \\"Often times women are in need of immediate legal assistance services for the protection of the mother and the child. To get a protective order you need to be represented by an attorney.\\" Crockett said the pilot program was launched in 1998 at the Haven House Family Shelter Inc., a domestic violence shelter for women and children in Vicksburg. The program has helped victims in 90 court cases, and 150 legal counseling sessions have been held there.

The hegemony of a single member state is not incompatible with a genuine confederation. Does the word \\"hegemony\\" mean the same thing in the above two sentences?","completion":"To determine whether the word \\"hegemony\\" means the same thing in both sentences, let's take a step-by-step approach. Step 1: Define the word \\"hegemony\\" Hegemony, in general, means dominance or leadership of one group or state over others. Step 2: Analyze the use of \\"hegemony\\" in the first sentence In the first sentence, \\"To say they have priority is not to say they have complete hegemony,\\" the word \\"hegemony\\" is used to describe a situation where one group or state has complete control or dominance over others. The sentence implies that having priority does not equal total dominance. Step 3: Analyze the use of \\"hegemony\\" in the second sentence In the second sentence, \\"The hegemony of a single member state is not incompatible with a genuine confederation,\\" the word \\"hegemony\\" again refers to the dominance or leadership of one group or state over others. However, the focus of this sentence is on whether hegemony conflicts with the idea of a confederation (a group of states united for a common purpose). The sentence suggests that it's possible for a single member of a confederation to have hegemony while still maintaining a genuine confederation. Step 4: Compare the meanings of \\"hegemony\\" in both sentences In both sentences, the word \\"hegemony\\" refers to the dominance or leadership of one group or state over others. The context may differ – in the first sentence, it's about whether having priority equals complete dominance, and in the second sentence, it's about whether hegemony is compatible with a confederation – but the underlying meaning of the word remains consistent. In conclusion, the word \\"hegemony\\" does indeed mean the same thing in both sentences; it refers to the dominance or leadership of one group or state over others. The difference lies in the context in which it's used, which affects how the concept of hegemony relates to the matters discussed in each sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill? When Richard II was crowned in 1377, he led a procession from the Tower to Westminster Abbey. This tradition began in at least the early 14th century and lasted until 1660. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 the Tower of London was besieged with the King inside. When Richard rode out to meet with Wat Tyler, the rebel leader, a crowd broke into the castle without meeting resistance and looted the Jewel House. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, took refuge in St John's Chapel, hoping the mob would respect the sanctuary. However, he was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill. Six years later there was again civil unrest, and Richard spent Christmas in the security of the Tower rather than Windsor as was more usual. When Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399, Richard was imprisoned in the White Tower. He abdicated and was replaced on the throne by Bolingbroke, who became King Henry IV. In the 15th century, there was little building work at the Tower of London, yet the castle still remained important as a place of refuge. When supporters of the late Richard II attempted a coup, Henry IV found safety in the Tower of London. During this period, the castle also held many distinguished prisoners. The heir to the Scottish throne, later King James I of Scotland, was kidnapped while journeying to France in 1406 and held in the Tower. The reign of Henry V (1413–1422) renewed England's fortune in the Hundred Years' War against France. As a result of Henry's victories, such as the Battle of Agincourt, many high-status prisoners were held in the Tower of London until they were ransomed.Much of the latter half of the 15th century was occupied by the Wars of the Roses between the claimants to the throne, the houses of Lancaster and York. The castle was once again besieged in 1460, this time by a Yorkist force. The Tower was damaged by artillery fire but only surrendered when Henry VI was captured at the Battle of Northampton.

Usher spent the majority of his young life in Chattanooga: his father left the family when Usher was a year old. Usher grew up with his mother, then-stepfather, and half-brother, James Lackey (born 1984). Directed by his mother, Usher joined the local church youth choir in Chattanooga, when he was nine years old. Usher developed a friendship with American record producer, Jermaine Dupri, with whom he co-wrote and produced several tracks for his second album, My Way, released on September 16, 1997. The album's lead single, \\"You Make Me Wanna...\\", reached number one in the United Kingdom, becoming Usher's first record to be top single; the record led to his popularity reaching in the country. It also became Usher's first gold- and platinum-certified single in the United States. The album's second single, \\"Nice & Slow\\", peaked in January 1998 at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Usher his first US number-one single. In February of the same year, the single was certified platinum by the RIAA. My Way has been certified six-time platinum in the United States. \\"You Make Me Wanna...\\" won the Best Male R&B/Soul Single at the 1999 Soul Train Music Awards. In the closing months of 1997, Usher embarked on a series of tour engagements including a spot on Puffy's No Way Out tour, dates with Mary J. Blige, and the opening spot on Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope Tour. Usher's first concert album, Live, was released in 1999, which featured appearances by Lil' Kim, Jagged Edge, Trey Lorenz, Shanice, Twista and Manuel Seal; the album has been certified gold in the United States. Usher made his acting debut on the UPN television series Moesha, which resulted in a recurring role on the series and subsequently his first film role in 1998's The Faculty. Usher's extracurricular activities outside of the recording industry gathered momentum over the following year as he was cast in the soap opera, The Bold and the Beautiful. He completed two more films, She's All That, and his first starring role in Light It Up. He also appeared in the Disney TV movie Geppetto. Usher's third studio album, originally titled All About U, was slated to be released in early 2001. The first single, \\"Pop Ya Collar\\", was released in late 2000 and became a number two hit in the UK but underperformed in the United States. The album was subsequently pushed back and retooled after select tracks were later leaked to the radio and Internet. After having revised and renamed to 8701, the album was released August 7, 2001 (8.7.01). The first two singles \\"U Remind Me\\" and \\"U Got It Bad\\" each topped the Billboard Hot 100 for four and six weeks, respectively. 8701 has been certified four-time platinum in the United States. Usher appeared in the 2001 film Texas Rangers. In February 2002, Usher won a Grammy for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance for \\"U Remind Me\\". The next year, he won the same award for \\"U Don't Have to Call\\", making Usher the only artist aside from Luther Vandross and Stevie Wonder to win this award consecutively. In summer 2002, Usher contributed vocals to P. Diddy's \\"I Need a Girl, Part I\\". The year closed out with a trio of TV series appearances, all in November, on The Twilight Zone, 7th Heaven, Moesha, and American Dreams, the latter in which Usher portrayed Marvin Gaye.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write an article that answers the following question: How many yards was the shortest touchdown?","completion":"Title: The Shortest Touchdown: How Many Yards? Hi there little friends! Today we are going to talk about something exciting that happens in football games. Do you know what a touchdown is? A touchdown is when a player catches or carries the football into the opposite team's end zone. This is how their team gets points and helps them to win the game. Now, let's try to answer an interesting question: How many yards was the shortest touchdown ever? First, let's understand what a yard is. A yard is a unit of measurement that's equal to three feet or 36 inches. It's used to measure distance. In a football field, there are 100 yards from one end zone to the other. The shortest touchdown doesn't need to cover a lot of distance at all. In fact, it happens when the team with the ball is super close to their opponent's end zone. This special touchdown is known as a one-yard touchdown. Let me explain this to you better with a fun example. Imagine you and your friends are playing a game of \\"keep the ball away.\\" You have to run some distance to touch a tree and score a point. But, sometimes you're already near the tree, and only one step takes you to reach it and get the point. That's like scoring a one-yard touchdown in football! So, to answer the question, the shortest touchdown ever was one yard long. It's when the player only needed to take a small step to score those important points for their team. I hope that helps you understand the shortest touchdown in football. Remember, even small distances can make a big difference when playing a game!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Sanborn A:","completion":"Title: The Lost Requiem Genre: Adventure, Drama, Family Act 1: The movie begins with an introduction to our protagonist, Jackson \\"Jack\\" Sanborn, a man in his mid-30s who works as a marine biologist. He grew up in a small coastal town called Oceanview. The town boasts beautiful landscapes and is known for its stunning beaches. Jack's parents passed away in an unfortunate accident when he was only 10 years old. After the incident, he moved to live with his uncle in a big city, and never had any connection to his family or hometown since. In the first act, we see glimpses of Jack's busy life in the city – long hours at work, the chaos of urban life, and the loneliness and emotional detachment from others. However, Jack always felt an urge deep inside to return to Oceanview to search for the family he never had – a driving force that remained constant despite his busy life. One day, Jack receives a mysterious letter from an unknown person residing in Oceanview asking for his help. The person claims his expertise as a marine biologist could help save the endangered species of the beautiful sea near the town. Intrigued by the letter, Jack realizes that it is the perfect opportunity to return to Oceanview to pursue his deep-rooted desires, including starting a family and having a son. Act 2: Upon returning to Oceanview, Jack finds the small town changed, with mysterious occurrences threatening the local marine ecosystems. He meets the letter sender, a marine conservation activist named Sarah, who is leading the fight against a massive corporation trying to exploit the ocean resources for profit without any consideration for the environment or the residents. As Jack starts working with Sarah, they begin discovering clues about a nefarious plot by the corporation that could lead to irreversible environmental damage. As they work together, they also discover a shared history – Sarah's mother was best friends with Jack's parents, and she had always heard stories about young Jack before he left town. As Jack learns more about Oceanview's issues and the wonderful people who live there, he grows increasingly attached to the town and its residents. He starts envisioning a future there, where he can have a son to pass down his love for the ocean and the family legacy. Act 3: In the final act, Jack and Sarah manage to infiltrate the corporation's research facility, expose the corporation's destructive plans, and gather crucial evidence to present before the town council. With the help of the townspeople, they are able to convince the authorities to shut down the corporation's operations, saving the environment and the endangered species. Through their collaborative efforts, Jack and Sarah grow close, sharing their dreams for the future and their common passion for marine life. They decide to settle down in Oceanview, working together to set up a marine research and conservation center to protect the local ecosystem and educate future generations. The movie concludes with the birth of their son, whom they named after Jack's father to honor his legacy. As Jack stands by the window, gazing out over the serene ocean holding his newborn son, he realizes that he has finally found the home he had been longing for all his life. The Lost Requiem delivers a compelling story about the importance of family, community, and the personal quest to fulfill an unfulfilled desire. The movie leaves the audience with a message emphasizing the significance of protecting our environment and cherishing the connections we make in life."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: late afternoon with reflections from the trees and bluffs .","completion":"The sentence you provided: \\"late afternoon with reflections from the trees and bluffs,\\" contains several important words that contribute significantly to its overall meaning and imagery. Here are some of them explained in detail: 1. \\"Late Afternoon\\": This term sets the scene and provides context for the time, alluding to a particular kind of light, potentially golden or fading. It helps to establish the image in the reader's mind of a certain warm color coming from the setting sun and evokes a sense of calmness and tranquillity towards the end of a day. The reference to \\"late afternoon\\" could also suggest the scene is happening at sunset, which often brings with it, beautiful colors and serene imagery. 2. \\"Reflections\\": This word adds a dynamic element to the sentence, suggesting that light from some source- likely the late afternoon sun- is bouncing off and being somewhat mirrored in something else. It can give readers an understanding that the scene is captivating with changing patterns caused by moving reflections. The term often immediately causes people to think of light patterns as seen in water or on a glossy surface, enhancing the visual effect of the sentence. 3. \\"Trees\\": The word 'trees' provides key information about the landscape being described. Trees are typically indicative of a natural, potentially peaceful environment, and may suggest certain textures, patterns, and colors depending on the type of trees and season. It could refer to a green, forested area, which contributes to the scenic beauty. 4. \\"Bluffs\\": Bluffs refer to a type of broad, rounded cliff, usually overlooking a plain or body of water. This word contributes depth to the sentence, suggesting a sense of grandeur, height, and scale. It might make the reader think of standing on a high point looking out over a valley or waterfront, proving to be a crucial landmark for the setting. In conclusion, while every word in a sentence has a role, \\"late afternoon,\\" \\"reflections,\\" \\"trees,\\" and \\"bluffs\\" are of significant importance in this sentence. They contribute heavily to the creation of a picturesque scene, elevating the imagery dimension, and imparting a serene, beautiful ambiance of a late afternoon.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","completion":"Yes, the answer you found on Google provides a brief description of the R4 card, but it does not fully explain what an R4 card is. Allow me to provide you with a more detailed and comprehensive answer. An R4 card, also known as R4 flashcard, R4 DS, or R4 Revolution, is a cartridge that's designed for the Nintendo DS, DS Lite, DSi, and 3DS consoles. This card allows users to play homebrew games, multimedia files, and backup copies of commercial games on their Nintendo gaming consoles. R4 cards are not officially endorsed or supported by Nintendo, and their use may potentially void your console's warranty. The term \\"Slot-1\\" mentioned in the Google answer refers to the game cartridge slot in the DS and 3DS consoles, where game cartridges are normally inserted. An R4 card is considered a second-generation device because it is designed to utilize this Slot-1 instead of the \\"Slot-2\\" (Game Boy Advance cartridge slot) found in the original DS and DS Lite models. One benefit of Slot-1 devices is their compatibility with newer DS models, which have removed the Slot-2 entirely. It is true that second-generation devices like the R4 card do not support Game Boy Advance (GBA) homebrew games. However, they are generally easier to use, more affordable, and have a greater focus on DS and 3DS games and applications. You can download homebrew games, applications, and other multimedia content onto a MicroSD card, which is then inserted into the R4 card. The R4 card is then plugged into the Nintendo console's Slot-1, allowing you to access and play the downloaded content. In summary, the answer you found on Google is correct but incomplete. An R4 card is a second-generation device designed for Nintendo DS, DS Lite, DSi, and 3DS consoles. It allows users to access and play homebrew games and multimedia files stored on a MicroSD card, but it does not support Game Boy Advance homebrew.

While performing the procedure, however, he falls in love with her. As the treatment begins to fail, he determines to save her appearance, regardless of how many women he must kill for her sake. Despite the implication of its American title, the film does not feature an actual vampire. The titular Seddok is actually the brilliant but deranged scientist Dr. Levin, mutated by a chemical formula created using radiation. Dr. Levin studied the effects of radiation on living tissue in post-Hiroshima Japan, and created an imperfect and teratogenic serum, \\"Derma 25\\", which he later refined into the miraculous healing agent \\"Derma 28\\" which he uses to treat the heroine. When his supply of Derma 28 runs out, he realizes he must kill to obtain more, and injects himself with Derma 25 in order to become monstrous and remorseless, so that he may seek these victims without hesitation. Because many of the murders take place near the docks where shiploads of Japanese refugees are arriving, and leave behind the victims' bodies with holes in the neck where Dr. Levin has extracted the glands, the refugees claim that a vampire (whom they call \\"Seddok\\", though this is not a Japanese name) is responsible for the attacks. During a meeting with police, a restored-to-humanity Dr. Levin speculates that the Hiroshima survivors' tales of a mutated killer are due to psychological strain from the radiation damage to their bodies...but also wonders aloud whether the \\"vampire\\" these witnesses describe might simply be a disturbed man wishing to be normal again.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Immanuel Kant, in the Critique of Pure Reason, described time as an a priori intuition that allows us (together with the other a priori intuition, space) to comprehend sense experience. With Kant, neither space nor time are conceived as substances, but rather both are elements of a systematic mental framework that necessarily structures the experiences of any rational agent, or observing subject. Kant thought of time as a fundamental part of an abstract conceptual framework, together with space and number, within which we sequence events, quantify their duration, and compare the motions of objects. In this view, time does not refer to any kind of entity that \\"flows,\\" that objects \\"move through,\\" or that is a \\"container\\" for events. Spatial measurements are used to quantify the extent of and distances between objects, and temporal measurements are used to quantify the durations of and between events. Time was designated by Kant as the purest possible schema of a pure concept or category. How do we process with our minds according to Kant? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"According to Immanuel Kant, our minds process experiences and information through a combination of a priori intuitions and a posteriori knowledge. Time, as previously mentioned, is one of the essential a priori intuitions that Kant believed was fundamental to our understanding of sense experiences and the world around us. To understand how our minds process experiences and information according to Kant, we need to analyze some key concepts he proposed, including the notions of \\"a priori\\" and \\"a posteriori,\\" as well as the distinction between phenomena and noumena. 1. A priori and a posteriori: The a priori refers to knowledge and concepts that are independent of experience, i.e., they are innate and exist prior to any engagement with the external world. These concepts include space, time, and the basic categories of understanding (e.g., causality, substance, quality, etc.). The a posteriori, on the other hand, refers to knowledge that is gained through experience. In Kant's theoretical framework, our minds combine these two types of knowledge to process information and make sense of the world around us. 2. Phenomena and noumena: Kant argued that there is a distinction between phenomena, which are objects as we experience them, and noumena, which are things as they exist independently of our experience. Our minds can only process and comprehend phenomena, using the a priori categories and intuitions as a framework for organizing and understanding these experiences. We can never truly know noumena because they exist outside of our perceptual and cognitive reach. 3. The role of the categorical structure: In Kant's view, the mind processes experiences by applying a categorical structure, which consists of 12 fundamental and interconnected concepts. These categories are pure concepts of the understanding and shape how we process and interpret the information we gain through experience. They provide a universal structure through which we can comprehend and interpret phenomena. In summary, according to Kant, our minds process experiences and information by combining a priori intuitions, such as time and space, with a posteriori knowledge, knowledge gained through experience. This information is then organized and structured using the categorical framework that underlies our understanding of the world. Our minds can only make sense of and interpret phenomena through this systematic mental framework, ensuring that we can never truly know noumena, or things as they exist independently of our experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

LaGuardia: A man of high ideals, charming, and with a burning ambition to make New York City a better place for everyone. - Florence LaGuardia: His supportive, strong, and independent wife whose wisdom often guides Fiorello in his decisions. - Thomas E. Dewey: A rival and the district attorney vying for the mayor's position. - Various other side characters, politicians, family members, citizens, etc. Step 3: OUTLINING THE PLOT Act 1: This will be the introduction phase. The movie begins with the humble origins of Fiorello - a child of immigrants, growing up in New York City witnessing its problems first-hand. His passionate interest in law and public service leads him to stand for the position of Mayor. The viewers are introduced to the then-corrupt political scene of New York. Act 2: In the following act, the audience witnesses the battleground of New York City's politics. Fiorello is successful in his mission and becomes the Mayor, but this victory brings with it enormous challenges of corruption, crime, and injustice. His efforts to clean the city bring him into conflict with Thomas Dewey and his power group. His personal life takes a toll with all the power struggle, but Florence stands firm with Fiorello, her wisdom guiding him through tough times.

He is the eponymous central figure of the Book of Jonah, in which he is called upon by God to travel to Nineveh and warn its residents to repent of their sins or face divine wrath. Instead, Jonah boards a ship to Tarshish. Caught in a storm, he orders the ship's crew to cast him overboard, whereupon he is swallowed by a giant fish. Jonah is regarded as a saint by a number of Christian denominations. His feast day in the Roman Catholic Church is on 21 September, according to the Martyrologium Romanum. In Catholicism, the Book of Jonah is also read aloud in its entirety on Maundy Thursday in a Beneventan chant. On the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar, Jonah's feast day is on 22 September (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian calendar; 22 September currently falls in October on the modern Gregorian calendar). In the Armenian Apostolic Church, moveable feasts are held in commemoration of Jonah as a single prophet and as one of the Twelve Minor Prophets. Jonah's mission to the Ninevites is commemorated by the Fast of Nineveh in Syriac and Oriental Orthodox Churches. Jonah is commemorated as a prophet in the Calendar of Saints of the Missouri Synod of the Lutheran Church on 22 September. Christian theologians have traditionally interpreted Jonah as a type for Jesus Christ. Jonah being in swallowed by the giant fish was regarded as a foreshadowing of Jesus's crucifixion and the fish vomiting Jonah out onto the beach was seen as a parallel for Jesus's resurrection. Saint Jerome equates Jonah with Jesus's more nationalistic side, and justifies Jonah's actions by arguing that \\"Jonah acts thus as a patriot, not so much that he hates the Ninevites, as that he does not want to destroy his own people.\\" Other Christian interpreters, including Saint Augustine and Martin Luther, have taken a directly opposite approach, regarding Jonah as the epitome of envy and jealousness, which they regarded as inherent characteristics of the Jewish people. Luther likewise concludes that the kikayon represents Judaism, and that the worm which devours it represents Christ. Luther's antisemitic interpretation of Jonah remained the prevailing interpretation among German Protestants throughout early modern history. J. D. Michaelis comments that \\"the meaning of the fable hits you right between the eyes\\", and concludes that the Book of Jonah is a polemic against \\"the Israelite people's hate and envy towards all the other nations of the earth.\\" Albert Eichhorn was a strong supporter of Michaelis's interpretation. John Calvin and John Hooper regarded the Book of Jonah as a warning to all those who might attempt to flee from the wrath of God. While Luther had been careful to maintain that the Book of Jonah was not written by Jonah, Calvin declared that the Book of Jonah was Jonah's personal confession of guilt. Calvin sees Jonah's time inside the fish's belly as equivalent to the fires of Hell, intended to correct Jonah and set him on the path of righteousness. Also unlike Luther, Calvin finds fault with all the characters in the story, describing the sailors on the boat as \\"hard and iron-hearted, like Cyclops\\", the penitence of the Ninevites as \\"untrained\\", and the king of Nineveh as a \\"novice\\". Hooper, on the other hand, sees Jonah as the archetypal dissident and the ship he is cast out from as a symbol of the state. Hooper deplores such dissidents, decrying: \\"Can you live quietly with so many Jonasses? Nay then, throw them into the sea!\\" Ask a question about this article.","completion":"What are the different interpretations of Jonah's story by various Christian theologians and how do they connect the story of Jonah to Jesus Christ?"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (Italian: [leo'nardo di ,ser 'pje:ro da (v)'vintSi] ( listen); 15 April 1452 - 2 May 1519), more commonly Leonardo da Vinci or simply Leonardo, was an Italian Renaissance polymath whose areas of interest included invention, painting, sculpting, architecture, science, music, mathematics, engineering, literature, anatomy, geology, astronomy, botany, writing, history, and cartography. He has been variously called the father of palaeontology, ichnology, and architecture, and is widely considered one of the greatest painters of all time. Sometimes credited with the inventions of the parachute, helicopter and tank, he epitomised the Renaissance humanist ideal. Leonardo was born on 15 April 1452 (Old Style) \\"at the third hour of the night\\" in the Tuscan hill town of Vinci, in the lower valley of the Arno river in the territory of the Medici-ruled Republic of Florence. He was the out-of-wedlock son of the wealthy Messer Piero Fruosino di Antonio da Vinci, a Florentine legal notary, and Caterina, a peasant. Leonardo had no surname in the modern sense - \\"da Vinci\\" simply meaning \\"of Vinci\\"; his full birth name was \\"Lionardo di ser Piero da Vinci\\", meaning \\"Leonardo, (son) of (Mes)ser Piero from Vinci\\". The inclusion of the title \\"ser\\" indicated that Leonardo's father was a gentleman. Little is known about Leonardo's early life. He spent his first five years in the hamlet of Anchiano in the home of his mother, and from 1457 lived in the household of his father, grandparents and uncle in the small town of Vinci. His father had married a sixteen-year-old girl named Albiera Amadori, who loved Leonardo but died young in 1465 without children. When Leonardo was sixteen (1468), his father married again to twenty-year-old Francesca Lanfredini, who also died without children. Piero's legitimate heirs were born from his third wife Margherita di Guglielmo (who gave birth to six children: Antonio, Giulian, Maddalena, Lorenzo, Violante and Domenico) and his fourth and final wife, Lucrezia Cortigiani (who bore him another six children: Margherita, Benedetto, Pandolfo, Guglielmo, Bartolomeo and Giovanni). In all, Leonardo had twelve half-siblings, who were much younger than him (the last was born when Leonardo was forty years old) and with whom he had very few contacts, but they caused him difficulty after his father's death in the dispute over the inheritance. Leonardo received an informal education in Latin, geometry and mathematics. In later life, Leonardo recorded only two childhood incidents. One, which he regarded as an omen, was when a kite dropped from the sky and hovered over his cradle, its tail feathers brushing his face. The second occurred while he was exploring in the mountains: he discovered a cave and was both terrified that some great monster might lurk there and driven by curiosity to find out what was inside. Leonardo's early life has been the subject of historical conjecture. Vasari, the 16th-century biographer of Renaissance painters, tells a story of Leonardo as a very young man: A local peasant made himself a round shield and requested that Ser Piero have it painted for him. Leonardo responded with a painting of a monster spitting fire that was so terrifying that Ser Piero sold it to a Florentine art dealer, who sold it to the Duke of Milan. Meanwhile, having made a profit, Ser Piero bought a shield decorated with a heart pierced by an arrow, which he gave to the peasant. Who was his father","completion":"Leonardo da Vinci's father was Messer Piero Fruosino di Antonio da Vinci. He was a wealthy Florentine legal notary.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How many types of gears are used inside a simple manual transmission system of an automobile? How many types of transmission systems can be used in a automobile vehicle? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Choose from: [A]. no [B]. yes","completion":"A. No The two questions are not the same. Let me provide you with detailed answers for both questions separately: 1. How many types of gears are used inside a simple manual transmission system of an automobile? In a simple manual transmission system, also known as a manual gearbox, there are various gear types combined to enable the smooth transfer of torque from the engine to the drive wheels. The primary types of gears used inside a manual transmission system are: a. Input Shaft Gears: The input shaft is connected to the engine's clutch assembly and transfers power from the engine to the gearbox. There are different gears on the input shaft, and they correspond to different gear ratios. b. Output Shaft Gears: The output shaft is connected to the drive wheels. These gears mesh with the gears on the input shaft to enable torque transfer. The output shaft gears are stationary when the transmission is in neutral. When the driver selects a gear, the corresponding output shaft gear meshes with its corresponding input shaft gear, allowing for torque transfer. c. Synchronizers: Synchronizers, also known as synchro rings or baulk rings, are essential for smooth gear shifts. They are cone-shaped clutch-like components that help match the rotating speeds of the input and output shaft gears during gear changes. Synchronizers engage the gears on the input and output shafts, allowing for seamless speed matching and preventing gear grinding. d. Reverse Idler Gear: The reverse idler gear is an additional gear used to engage the reverse gear in a manual transmission. It is positioned between the input and output shaft gears and rotates in the opposite direction when reverse gear is engaged. This causes the output shaft to rotate in the opposite direction, resulting in the reverse motion of the vehicle. e. Countershaft Gears: The countershaft, also known as the layshaft, is an intermediate shaft that connects the input and output shafts. The countershaft gears mesh with both the input and output shaft gears. The primary purpose of the countershaft is to transmit power between the input and output shafts, as well as to manage gear ratios and direction changes. 2. How many types of transmission systems can be used in an automobile vehicle? There are several types of transmission systems that can be used in an automobile, each with their own set of advantages and disadvantages. The primary types of transmission systems are: a. Manual Transmission: A manual transmission, as described above, requires the driver to manually select and change gears using a gear stick and clutch pedal. Manual transmissions are known for their driver engagement, fuel efficiency, and lower manufacturing cost. b. Automatic Transmission: Automatic transmissions automatically change gears without any input from the driver. They use a torque converter instead of a clutch to transfer engine power to the gearbox. Automatic transmissions provide smooth gear changes, increased driving comfort, and ease of use, but tend to be less fuel efficient and more expensive to produce than manual transmissions. c. Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT): A CVT is a type of automatic transmission that uses a pair of variable-diameter pulleys and a belt or chain to provide an unlimited range of gear ratios. CVTs offer smooth and seamless acceleration, improved fuel efficiency, and a simpler design but can suffer from reduced driving engagement and higher repair costs. d. Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT): A DCT is a type of automated manual transmission that uses two separate clutches for odd and even gears. It delivers fast and precise gear shifts while maintaining fuel efficiency similar to a manual transmission. DCTs offer better performance and responsiveness but can be more expensive and complicated compared to traditional automatic transmissions. e. Automated Manual Transmission (AMT): An AMT is a type of semi-automatic transmission that uses an electronically controlled clutch to automate gear shifts in a manual transmission. AMTs offer a balance between the driver engagement of a manual transmission and the ease of use of an automatic transmission but can have jerky gear changes compared to traditional automatics. In summary, while both questions are related to automobile transmissions, they address different aspects of the topic. The first question focuses on the types of gears used in the manual transmission, while the second question covers various types of transmission systems employed in automobiles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Input: - ACTION1: laughing at Rover Opportunity's death - ACTION2: pushing my daycare to notify parents of pinworms Let's break down the two actions: ACTION1: laughing at Rover Opportunity's death. This action may be considered disrespectful or insensitive since someone is laughing at the demise of a universally recognized and valued rover. However, it may also be viewed as a coping mechanism or a form of humor. Still, it may be seen as less ethical. ACTION2: pushing my daycare to notify parents of pinworms. This action can be seen as responsible and ethical, as it advises a daycare to inform parents about a health issue that may affect their children. It demonstrates concern for the well-being of others. Comparison: - ACTION1 can be seen as potentially disrespectful and less ethical. - ACTION2 is responsible and more ethical. Using the provided guidelines, we can determine that ACTION1 is less ethical compared to ACTION2. So, the output should be 'no', as one of the statements (ACTION1) is less ethical.

Would \\"Robinson's initial idea was to sculpt the Needles ; however, Gutzon Borglum rejected the Needles site because of the poor quality of the granite and strong opposition from environmentalists and Native American groups.\\" be a reasonable answer?","completion":"No, the statement you provided does not accurately address the question about what it is like at Mount Rushmore. Instead, here's a detailed answer to your question: Mount Rushmore National Memorial, located near Keystone, South Dakota, is a massive sculpture carved into the granite face of Mount Rushmore. It features the 60-foot (18-meter) heads of four significant U.S. Presidents: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. These figures were chosen to represent the birth, growth, development, and preservation of the United States. The sculpture was completed between 1927 and 1941 under the direction of American sculptor Gutzon Borglum and his son, Lincoln Borglum. The original idea was conceived by South Dakota historian Doane Robinson who wanted to construct a colossal sculpture in South Dakota's Black Hills region to promote tourism. Borglum rejected Robinson's initial idea of sculpting the Needles, due to the poor quality of the granite and opposition from environmentalists and Native American groups, and, subsequently, Mount Rushmore was selected. Visiting Mount Rushmore offers a distinct experience, encompassing both natural beauty and historical significance. Here are some aspects of what it's like at Mount Rushmore: 1. Scenic Views and Hiking: The park offers breathtaking views of the Black Hills and the monumental sculpture. Various trails, including the Presidential Trail, enable visitors to get closer to the monument and experience the surrounding terrain. 2. Visitor Center and Museum: A museum and visitor center at the site provide exhibits on the presidents, the sculptor Gutzon Borglum, and the construction process. 3. Evening Lighting Ceremony: During summer months, an evening lighting ceremony is held where the monument is illuminated. This event also includes a ranger talk, a flag-lowering ceremony, and a video presentation. 4. Wildlife: It is common to see a variety of wildlife in the area, including mountain goats, deer, and occasional bison. 5. Cultural Ramifications: Mount Rushmore is not without controversy. Some Native American groups see the monument as an infringement on sacred land, as the Black Hills region is significant in their cultural and spiritual heritage. In summary, Mount Rushmore is an impressive historical landmark with beautiful views of the surrounding Black Hills and ample opportunities for learning about the presidents, their accomplishments, and the process of creating the monument. However, it is essential also to understand the controversies and cultural implications surrounding this site."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer a question about the following article about Hindu philosophy: Ancient and medieval Hindu texts identify six pramāṇas as correct means of accurate knowledge and truths: pratyakṣa (perception), anumāṇa (inference), upamāṇa (comparison and analogy), arthāpatti (postulation, derivation from circumstances), anupalabdi (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof) and śabda (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts) Each of these are further categorized in terms of conditionality, completeness, confidence and possibility of error, by each school . The various schools vary on how many of these six are valid paths of knowledge. For example, the Cārvāka nāstika philosophy holds that only one (perception) is an epistemically reliable means of knowledge, the Samkhya school holds three are (perception, inference and testimony), while the Mīmāṃsā and Advaita schools hold all six are epistemically useful and reliable means to knowledge.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — A Washington teenager was on the phone with her mother as she hiked alone on a mountain in Alaska, saying she was nervous about the slippery terrain before her mother heard a scream, and then silence. The 18-year-old had fallen 30 feet from a cliff. The mother, Shelly LaGrou, said Tuesday that she waited, roughly 1,500 miles away in Omak, Washington, to hear her daughter's voice again. \\"I'm still living it,\\" she told The Associated Press in a phone interview. Daughter Cherelle LaGrou, who is working in Alaska this summer, came back on the phone after a while, saying she had slipped down the slope and couldn't climb back up. She was hysterical and crying, telling her mother she wasn't ready to die. Shelly LaGrou tried to keep her daughter calm Sunday while her husband frantically called the teen's employer, Denali Princess Wilderness Lodge, which alerted Alaska State Troopers. That call set in motion a dramatic 45-minute rescue near Denali National Park that was captured by the National Geographic Channel reality show \\"Alaska State Troopers.\\" It's expected to air this fall. The teen said that before her rescue, she believed she was staring death in the face and thought about everything she would miss in her life. Instead, she sustained only minor scratches. \\"It feels like it was something out of a movie,\\" she said, laughing when reminded that in a way, it was. \\"It was all just so unreal that it was actually happening.\\" Shelly and Cherelle LaGrou were talking for about 15 minutes before the teen fell from a ridge atop Fox Creek. The mother suggested Cherelle switch the phone to the hands-free option, which she did. She told her mother she had reached the edge of the mountain and didn't know what to do. Then came the scream. When the teen came back on the phone, she was hysterical and said her feet kept slipping. In that position, there was no way she could have called for help herself, Cherelle LaGrou said. Mother and daughter prayed together that angels would hold the teenager against the wall of the mountain. Soon after troopers arrived, Cherelle LaGrou's phone went dead. After the teen was safely on the ground, officials called her parents. While she waited to hear from rescuers, Shelly LaGrou didn't know they had secured her daughter with a rope. All she knew was that her daughter had been getting weary of trying to hold on. \\"I knew that just one wrong slip any second, and I'd be hearing her scream again and she'd be gone,\\" she said. ___ Follow Rachel D'Oro at https://twitter.com/rdoro . ||||| FAIRBANKS, Alaska – Cherelle “Evie” LaGrou, 18, of Omak, was rescued from a cliff over which she fell Sunday near Denali National Park. “This was the first time she went hiking alone,” said her mother, Shelly LaGrou. “She hikes several times a week with friends, but they were all at work. She wanted to go see some waterfalls.” Cherelle LaGrou, who is working as a housekeeper at Denali Princess Wilderness Lodge owned Princess Cruise Line, was hiking back from the falls on a different route when she got nervous due to poor footing, her mother said. “She was on the phone before this happened to her,” Shelly LaGrou said. “We were on the phone together (about 15 minutes) when the ground went out from under her. “She was hysterical and did not know what happened. I calmed her down.” Cherelle LaGrou ended up on a rock wall about 60 feet above Fox Creek. She was unable to climb up or down from there. “I am not sure what she found to get a finger hold to stop herself in the slide,” Shelly LaGrou said. “She had her feet against the rock wall, which was a rock surface. It was rocky, icy down below.” The girl’s father, Joe LaGrou, called the lodge, which in turn notified Alaska State Troopers. The first trooper arrived about 15 minutes after being notified, but he could only get within about 20 feet of Cherelle LaGrou. “She said she did not want to die,” said Shelly LaGrou, who prayed with her daughter. About 30 minutes after the fall, as troopers were working on the rescue, the cellphone battery died. Two troopers climbed a ridge and brought Cherelle LaGrou up from her perch. The LaGrous’ daughter called about 45 minutes later to say she was rescued and safe, with only minor scrapes. “You don’t know if you’re talking to your child for the last time,” Shelly LaGrou said. “It was a miracle.” Cherelle LaGrou is a 2013 graduate of Omak High School.

Q:Article: Amanda Clement grew up in Hudson, South Dakota. Baseball was always her favorite sport. Once in a while her brother Hank and his friends would let her play first base in their games. More often, however, they asked her to umpire for them, because they knew her calls would be fair and there would be no arguing. One day in 1904, Amanda and her mother traveled to Hawarden, Iowa, to watch Hank play for the home team against Hawarden. When they arrived at the ball field, two local teams were waiting to play a preliminary game. The umpire hadn't arrived, so Hank argued that the teams should let his sister serve as umpire. The players finally agreed. Amanda, then sixteen and standing five feet, ten inches tall, made perfect calls. She was so good that players for the main game asked her to umpire for them and even offered to pay her. Thus, at sixteen, Amanda Clement became the first paid female baseball umpire of all time. She is honored in the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. Question: Amanda went to Hawarden in order to _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"watch her brother play\\"?

Context: Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s longtime personal lawyer who is under investigation for his business dealings, has provided legal advice to Fox News host Sean Hannity, one of Trump’s most prominent media supporters. The dramatic revelation came Monday during a court hearing in New York where lawyers for Cohen and Trump argued for permission to determine whether thousands of pages of documents FBI agents seized from Cohen last week should be subject to attorney-client privilege. U.S. District Court Judge Kimba Wood appeared to reject the idea, saying that a “taint team” created by prosecutors to set aside privileged documents is a “viable option,” while a court-appointed outside lawyer known as a “special master” may also play a role in determining which records can and cannot be viewed by prosecutors. The disclosure about Hannity, who also hosts a nationally syndicated talk radio show, came after prosecutors indicated that Cohen performed “little to no legal work” and had just one client: Trump. In response, Cohen’s lawyers said that Cohen has represented three clients in the past year — Trump, GOP fundraiser Elliott Broidy and a third “publicly prominent individual” who wished to remain anonymous. Cohen's lawyers identified Hannity as the third unnamed client only after Judge Wood ruled that it must be made public. In a statement, Hannity sought to minimize his relationship with Cohen, saying he had never retained him as a lawyer. “Michael Cohen has never represented me in any matter,” Hannity said. “I never retained him, received an invoice, or paid legal fees. I have occasionally had brief discussions with him about legal questions about which I wanted his input and perspective.\\" “I assumed those conversations were confidential, but to be absolutely clear they never involved any matter between me and a third-party,” Hannity said. Fox News also responded to the revelation. \\"While Fox News was unaware of Sean Hannity's informal relationship with Michael Cohen and was surprised by the announcement in...

Rusting is one of many example of corrosion. Corrosion is the deterioration of metals by redox processes. Corrosion causes enormous amounts of damage to buildings, bridges, ships, cars, and other objects. It has been estimated that corrosion costs the U.S. economy over 100 billion dollars each year.

Dune city had very dry air and no rain, while Bay city had very high humidity, fog and lots of rain. Answer this question please: Which city had less damage to cars because of corrosion? Answer:","completion":"Dune city had less damage to cars because of corrosion. This is because corrosion, including rusting, is generally accelerated in the presence of moisture and high humidity as they promote the oxidation processes. In the case of the two cities, Bay city has high humidity, fog, and lots of rain, which creates an environment more conducive to corrosion. In contrast, Dune city has dry air and no rain, which means less moisture is available to initiate and accelerate the corrosion process.

Prosecutor drops DUI charge on man who tested positive only for caffeine He was arrested and charged with driving under the influence in Solano County, but investigators found no alcohol or drugs in his system. Fairfield resident Joseph Schwab, 36 did test positive for one substance: caffeine. Prosecutors kept his DUI charge intact for more than a year after his arrest, insisting he had to have been under the influence of some other drug that didn’t show up in the test, based on a police officer who said he weaved in and out of traffic and almost caused several collisions. Police also said he failed sobriety tests at the scene. The Solano County District Attorney’s Office dropped the DUI charge against Schwab Wednesday, some 16 months after he was pulled over on Interstate 680 driving north in August 2015. “Without a confirmatory test of the specific drug in the defendant’s system that impaired his ability to drive, we do not believe we can prove the charge beyond a reasonable doubt,” said Krishna Abrams, the district attorney, in a written statement. Abrams insisted the case was “never about caffeine,” and she insisted that Schwab had to have been under the influence of another drug that didn’t show up in the test. Not all drugs do under standard rounds of testing.

Email: mbodley@sfchronicle.com. Twitter: @michael_bodley ||||| A California DA has dropped charges against a man who was slapped with a DUI even though a drug test at the time only came back positive for caffeine. Yes, a DUI for being caffeinated. There is definitely more to this story. Pulled over for erratic driving, then charged Joseph Schwab was pulled over in August 2015 in Fairfield, California. According to a statement from the Solano County District Attorney’s office, the officer at the scene was suspicious because of Schwab’s “erratic and reckless driving” and his “demeanor” and “performance on a number of field sobriety tests.” The officer charged Schwab with a DUI, and the charge stood even when his blood sample tested negative for drugs such as cocaine, THC and opiates. How can you hang a DUI on caffeine? The reason, according to the District Attorney’s office, was because drug tests don’t catch all drugs, and based on the officer’s account it seemed like Schwab was definitely on something. This reasoning didn’t fly with Schwab’s attorney, who told CNN affiliate KCRA she couldn’t believe the charge. “I actually consulted with the other attorneys in my office to make sure that I wasn’t missing something.” Charges dismissed On Wednesday, the DA’s office announced they were filing a motion to dismiss the charges. That doesn’t, however, mean they don’t think drugs were in play. The DA’s office said forensic lab experts claim it was “highly likely the defendant was under the influence of a drug,” but since they have no way to prove it beyond reasonable doubt, Schwab’s off the hook. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"A DUI charge against Joseph Schwab in Solano County, California has been dropped after prosecutors could not prove beyond reasonable doubt that he was under the influence of a drug other than caffeine.

Summarize the following: Although bamboo has a rapid growth rate, you only need to prune it once a year if you do a really thorough job. Pruning your bamboo more frequently can actually cause it to send off more shoots. Mark on your calendar when to start pruning and coordinate it with fertilizing. Branches and leaves can cut your skin in a bamboo grove, so it’s a good idea to wear sturdy gloves, long pants, and a long-sleeved shirt. Wearing sturdy gloves will also make it easier to handle and cut the canes. Nodes are where the pieces of the stem join together. You’ll see a slight bump or bulge on the stem shaft indicating this joining. To trim down the height of a bamboo plant, locate a node. Then, position your shears or plant saw right above it and cut across. Making your cut above the node also makes the pruning process easier, as these spots are less thick. Bamboo is very strong and if you cut it at an angle, it can be quite dangerous. Keep your cuts blunt and horizontal to minimize the risk. You should be able to use hand clippers for most cane. However, if the cane is rather large, opt for a pruning hand saw and extension. Summary:","completion":"Bamboo, despite its rapid growth, requires only annual pruning if done thoroughly, as frequent pruning can prompt further shoot development. Start pruning in sync with fertilizing and remember to mark your schedule. For personal safety during pruning in a bamboo grove, wearing sturdy gloves, long pants and a long-sleeved shirt is advised. The gloves also assist in handling and cutting the canes. Pruning requires locating a node, indicated by a slight bump on the stem shaft, and cutting just above it as these spots are less thick. To minimize risk, make blunt and horizontal cuts rather than angled ones. For most canes, hand clippers should suffice.

Article:Peers voted by a majority of 92 to amend the Welfare Reform and Work Bill to make ministers report annually on income levels in the poorest families. The move was spearheaded by the Bishop of Durham, Rt Rev Paul Butler, who argued income-related statistics must be recorded so they could be assessed with other measurements of deprivation. Ministers say life chances are a better measure of economic outcomes. The defeat could be overturned when the bill returns to the Commons later this year. If it is not, ministers will be obliged to present a report to Parliament each year setting out the percentage of children in households whose net income is 60% to 70% below the median average. The government's decision to change how child poverty is measured, to focus on the root causes of poverty rather than income disparities, has angered opposition parties and anti-poverty campaigners But ministers insist that income benchmarks put in place by the last Labour government painted a false picture and meant that inter-generational factors holding families back, such as unemployment and low educational attainment, were ignored. Bishop Butler said he conceded income levels should not be the only measure of levels of relative poverty but were still highly significant. \\"It is also possible to understate the importance of income, or the lack of it, especially among those of us who have plenty,\\" he said. \\"There is also a wealth of academic evidence pointing to the damaging effect income poverty has on children's wellbeing, including their health, education and future employment prospects.\\" While he was not seeking to reinstate an income-based definition of child poverty, the bishop said his proposal would ensure income was measured and reported on an equal basis to other social indicators. Ministers insist the move is not needed as income-related statistics would still be collated. Welfare minister Lord Freud said, on their own, income figures were at best a \\"partial reflection\\" of an individual's economic wellbeing, and did not take into account levels of debt and savings, employment histories and increased school spending in areas of the highest deprivation. During Monday's report stage debate on the Welfare Bill, ministers also announced that the government would be exempting recipients of carer's allowance from the overall household benefit cap, which is set to fall to a maximum of Â£20,000 outside London and Â£23,00 in the capital. Lord Freud said the government valued the contribution carers made to society and was taking further steps to support them.

In this royalty-free CD image, we are introduced to various elements associated with a construction site, including a man, scaffolding, a worker, and a helmet. The image encapsulates the typical atmosphere found at any construction site and highlights the importance of safety equipment such as helmets in maintaining a safe work environment. Firstly, the man in the image signifies the presence of human labor that is an integral part of any construction project. These skilled workers collaborate to create structures and complete projects in a timely and efficient manner. Men from various backgrounds join forces in the construction industry, bringing their unique expertise to contribute to the growth of cities and infrastructure. Scaffolding, as depicted in the image, is a temporary structure widely used in the construction industry to support workers and materials during the building process. This essential tool enables builders to access elevated work areas, ensuring they can perform their tasks safely and efficiently. Scaffolding is designed to be easily assembled, disassembled, and transported, making it a versatile and indispensable component of modern construction projects. The worker portrayed in the image represents the backbone of the construction industry. This skilled labor force is trained to carry out different tasks at construction sites, such as bricklaying, carpentry, electrical work, and more. Workers in this field are often required to work in challenging environments and under pressure to meet deadlines. Their role is paramount to the successful completion of projects, as their expertise and dedication directly impact the quality and safety of the structures they help create. Lastly, the helmet symbolizes the importance of safety gear at construction sites. Workers must wear appropriate and regulated personal protective equipment (PPE) to minimize the risk of injuries or accidents. Helmets protect the wearer's head against falling objects or sudden impact and are a mandatory requirement for all personnel on a construction site. The presence of helmets in this royalty-free CD image signifies the industry's commitment to ensuring worker safety and promoting a responsible work environment. In conclusion, this royalty-free CD image captures the essence of a construction site with the presence of a man, scaffolding, worker, and helmet, showcasing various aspects of the industry. From skilled human labor and vital support structures to the indispensable safety equipment, this image is a true representation of how essential each component is to the success and safety of a construction project."},{"prompt":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What was the result of President Eisenhower's threat toward China\\" is in \\"The war started badly for the US and UN. North Korean forces struck massively in the summer of 1950 and nearly drove the outnumbered US and ROK defenders into the sea. However the United Nations intervened, naming Douglas MacArthur commander of its forces, and UN-US-ROK forces held a perimeter around Pusan, gaining time for reinforcement. MacArthur, in a bold but risky move, ordered an amphibious invasion well behind the front lines at Inchon, cutting off and routing the North Koreans and quickly crossing the 38th Parallel into North Korea. As UN forces continued to advance toward the Yalu River on the border with Communist China, the Chinese crossed the Yalu River in October and launched a series of surprise attacks that sent the UN forces reeling back across the 38th Parallel. Truman originally wanted a Rollback strategy to unify Korea; after the Chinese successes he settled for a Containment policy to split the country. MacArthur argued for rollback but was fired by President Harry Truman after disputes over the conduct of the war. Peace negotiations dragged on for two years until President Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened China with nuclear weapons; an armistice was quickly reached with the two Koreas remaining divided at the 38th parallel. North and South Korea are still today in a state of war, having never signed a peace treaty, and American forces remain stationed in South Korea as part of American foreign policy.\\".

Helen Birtwhistle, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, said 20,000 English patients were registered with Welsh GPs compared to 15,000 Welsh patients with English GPs. No extra money comes to Wales for the additional 5,000 patients, she said. The Welsh Affairs committee's hearing comes amid a bitter political row over the state of the NHS in Wales. Health Minister Mark Drakeford has accused Conservatives at Westminster of spreading a \\"tissue of lies\\" about health care in Wales, after UK Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt claimed patients in Wales were getting a \\"second class service\\". Giving evidence to the committee on Tuesday, Ms Birtwhistle admitted that for hospital care, the cross-border traffic was generally from Wales to England, most often in mid and north Wales. \\"It's party due to geographic convenience, but also because of the lack of secondary care in some areas,\\" she said, noting that Powys had no district general hospital. Jesse Norman, Conservative MP for Hereford and South Herefordshire, told the committee that 3,500 people in Herefordshire were with Welsh GPs mainly because they were the nearest and English GPs would not accept them. He called for assurances such people would be given the same rights as other English patients under the English NHS in terms of waiting times for treatment and access to the cancer drugs fund in England. Conservative Monmouth MP David Davies, who chairs the Welsh Affairs committee, said everyone had been \\"working on the assumption that there are huge differences\\" between the NHS in England and Wales. But he said it sounded as if there were \\"a lot of similarities\\". Alan Brace, director of finance at Aneurin Bevan health board in south east Wales, said the only real difference was how the respective nations commissioned their health services. \\"Within England there are very separate organisational models with fairly high transactional costs to do that,\\" he said. \\"I think in our system [in Wales] we've tried to simplify all of that and try and break some of those boundaries down.\\" Ms Birtwhistle added that finances were \\"extremely tight everywhere in the UK\\" and that \\"really tough and difficult decisions\\" had to be made about health service priorities.

The sentence provides information about the transition of power in Cyprus from the Lusignan dynasty to the Republic of Venice, but it doesn't specifically address the Ottomans or the destruction of Limassol. A more relevant answer to the question would be: The Ottomans destroyed Limassol in the year 1570, during the Ottoman invasion of Cyprus. In July of that year, following the fall of Nicosia, the forces led by Ottoman general Lala Mustafa Pasha laid siege to Limassol. The city was heavily fortified, but the continuous onslaught of the Ottoman forces and the lack of outside assistance eventually led to its fall. Upon seizing Limassol, the Ottomans proceeded to destroy significant parts of the city, especially the fortifications and vital infrastructures. The widespread destruction was aimed at asserting Ottoman dominance over the island and weakening any possible resistance from the remaining inhabitants. As the Ottomans continued their conquest of Cyprus, they captured other cities, including Famagusta, which was the last Venetian stronghold on the island. The fall of Famagusta in August 1571 marked the end of Venetian control in Cyprus and the beginning of a 300-year rule by the Ottoman Empire. During the Ottoman period, Limassol underwent a series of rebuilding efforts, and the city experienced a resurgence of trade and commerce. The Ottomans introduced new land and tax administration systems, and many of the city's Greek Orthodox inhabitants converted to Islam, further shaping the socio-cultural landscape of the island. In conclusion, the Ottomans destroyed Limassol in 1570, during their invasion of Cyprus that led to the end of Venetian control and the beginning of the Ottoman era on the island."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Alberto Kenya Fujimori Fujimori (Spanish: [al'berto fuxi'mori, fuji-]; Japanese: [FWzimori]; born 26 July 1938 or 4 August 1938) served as the President of Peru from 28 July 1990 to 22 November 2000. His government is credited with the creation of Fujimorism, defeating the Shining Path insurgency, and restoring Peru's macroeconomic stability. Fujimori ended his presidency by fleeing Peru for Japan amid a major scandal involving corruption and human rights violations. Even amid his prosecution in 2008 for crimes against humanity relating to his presidency, two-thirds of Peruvians polled voiced approval for his leadership in that period. Fujimori obtained his early education at the Colegio Nuestra Senora de la Merced and La Rectora. Fujimori's parents were Buddhists, but he was baptised and raised as a Roman Catholic. While he spoke mainly Japanese at home, Fujimori also learned to become a proficient Spanish speaker during his years at school. In 1956, Fujimori graduated from La gran unidad escolar Alfonso Ugarte in Lima. He went on to undergraduate studies at the Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina in 1957, graduating in 1961 first in his class as an agricultural engineer. The following year he lectured on mathematics at the university. In 1964 he went to study physics at the University of Strasbourg in France. On a Ford scholarship, Fujimori also attended the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in the United States, where he obtained his master's degree in mathematics in 1969. In 1974, he married Susana Higuchi, also Japanese-Peruvian. They had four children, including a daughter, Keiko, who followed her father into politics. In recognition of his academic achievements, the sciences faculty of the Universidad Nacional Agraria offered Fujimori the deanship and in 1984 appointed him to the rectorship of the university, which he held until 1989. In 1987, Fujimori also became president of the National Commission of Peruvian University Rectors (Asamblea Nacional de Rectores), a position which he has held twice. He also hosted a TV show called \\"Concertando\\" from 1988 to 1989, on Peru's state-owned network, Channel 7. Fujimori won the 1990 presidential election as a dark horse candidate under the banner of Cambio 90 (\\"cambio\\" means \\"change\\") beating world-renowned writer Mario Vargas Llosa in a surprising upset. He capitalized on profound disenchantment with outgoing president Alan Garcia and the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance party (APRA). He exploited popular distrust of Vargas Llosa's identification with the existing Peruvian political establishment, and uncertainty about his plans for neoliberal economic reforms. During the campaign, Fujimori was nicknamed El Chino, which roughly translates to \\"Chinaman\\"; it is common for people of any East Asian descent to be called chino in Peru, as elsewhere in Latin America, both derogatively and affectionately. Although he is of Japanese heritage, Fujimori has suggested that he was always gladdened by the term, which he perceived as a term of affection. With his election victory, he became just the second person of East Asian descent to become head of government of a Latin American nation, after Fulgencio Batista of Cuba and the third of East Asian descent to govern a South American state, after Arthur Chung of Guyana and Henk Chin A Sen of Suriname (each of whom had served as head of state, rather than head of government).

The hypothesis, meanwhile, states that every one of these individuals admitted trying drugs due to its commonality during their youth. To evaluate whether the premise entails the hypothesis, it is essential to break down the statements provided and examine their relationship. The term \\"entailment\\" refers to a logical relationship between statements, in which if one statement (the premise) is true, the other statement (the hypothesis) must also be true. This means that if the premise holds, then the hypothesis is a natural and inevitable consequence of the premise. Premise: Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich, and Al Gore have all admitted to having tried drugs in their early days. Hypothesis: Every one of them has admitted to having tried drugs since it was common when they were young. In this case, the hypothesis expands on the premise to provide a possible reason for their actions, which is the commonality of drug use during their youth. However, the premise itself does not necessarily imply this reason as the only possible explanation. For instance, they could have tried drugs due to personal circumstances, curiosity, or other factors unrelated to the commonality of drug use during their youth. Furthermore, even if it were common for young people to try drugs during the time these individuals were growing up, this does not mean that everyone who tried drugs did so solely because of that commonality. Personal factors and unique experiences may have played a significant role in people deciding whether or not to experiment with drugs. In conclusion, while the premise does provide evidence that Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich, and Al Gore have all tried drugs during their early years, it does not necessarily entail the hypothesis that they did so because drug use was common at that time. The premise and the hypothesis are related, but the hypothesis goes beyond the premise by providing a potential reason for their actions, which is not explicitly addressed in the premise. Thus, the premise does not logically entail the hypothesis, as it does not establish the commonality of drug use as the exclusive explanation for the actions of these three individuals."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Detailed Instructions: In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"The statement you're referring to seems to connect two independent concepts: animal hibernation and adding more trays to the freezer. In the sense of hibernation, these two concepts do not directly coincide and placing more trays in a freezer will typically not impact the hibernation process of an animal. Freezers and refrigerators are part of human technology, and while they mimic the cold temperatures of winter that could trigger hibernation in certain species, they are generally not associated with the natural processes of hibernation in most organisms because animals don't naturally seek out man-made freezers for hibernation. However, if you try to artificially induce hibernation in a controlled environment, then drastic changes like adding more trays in a freezer could potentially impact that specific process. For instance, it might modify temperature or space available, if the animal was being stored in that freezer, which would be directly impacting a step of the process. This scenario is very specific and would require particular settings. Under normal natural conditions though, hibernation is triggered by changes in daylight duration and temperature in the animal's natural habitat. Once in hibernation, the animal's body process slows down significantly, with reduced heart rate, breathing rate, and metabolic rates, allowing them to survive for long periods with no food or drink. Therefore, in a typical and natural context, adding more trays to the freezer appears to not impact any step of the hibernation process of an animal.

Is the premise \\"A man in a red jacket and stubble stands before a mural.\\" true if \\"A man is looking at and admiring a mural.\\"?","completion":"The validity of the proposition \\"A man in a red jacket and stubble stands before a mural\\" hinges upon how we interpret, define and associate certain aspects and characteristics with the given statement \\"A man is looking at and admiring a mural.\\" To determine if it is true or not, we must carefully analyze both the premises, and consequently make comparisons. Let's break down each statement and examine the facts presented within: Premise 1: A man in a red jacket and stubble stands before a mural. In this premise, we receive specific details about both the man and his position: 1. The man has a noticeable feature—stubble on his face. 2. The man is wearing a red jacket. 3. The man is standing before a mural, which could mean he is facing it, close to it or directly in front of it. Premise 2: A man is looking at and admiring a mural. In the second premise, we are given different pieces of information about the man and his actions: 1. There is a man present. 2. The man is looking at a mural; implying that he is facing it. 3. The man is admiring the mural, which suggests a positive emotion toward the artwork. Now, let's compare the two premises to establish if they hold any instantiating relationship: Both premises involve a man and a mural, implying a shared context. However, we do not receive enough information from the second premise to deduce if the man has stubble on his face or if he's wearing a red jacket. On the other hand, the first premise does not provide sufficient insight into the emotional state or the level of engagement of the man with the mural. It is possible for a man to be standing before a mural without looking at or admiring it. From what has been analyzed, we cannot definitively declare whether the premise \\"A man in a red jacket and stubble stands before a mural\\" is true or false based on the information provided in \\"A man is looking at and admiring a mural.\\" The second premise addresses the man's interaction with the mural, whereas the first primarily focuses on the man's physical appearance and position relative to the mural.

As the Marines leave, one Marine remains and makes his way towards the exit. The Marine's name is Jesse Rodriguez (Freddy Rodriguez). The film cuts to a house where a man, Edy Rodriguez (Alfred Molina) is on a ladder nailing up a welcome home sign for Jesse. The woman, his wife, Anna Rodriguez (Elizabeth PeÃ±a) gives him a rather disgruntled look before leaving to prepare for Jesse's return. Edy then travels to his store, a small neighborhood supermarket, called Bodega. Along the way, and even in the store, Edy appears to be quite popular with the ladies. Back at the airport, Jesse finally meets up with his friend and cousin Johnny (Luis Guzman) and Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), who have come to pick him up.

Movie title: PokÃ©mon: The First Movie Context: Pokémon: The First Movie (Pocket Monsters the Movie: Mewtwo's Counterattack) is the first Pokémon anime film directed by Kunihiko Yuyama, the chief director of the Pokémon television series. It is the first theatrical release in the Pokémon franchise.It was released in Japan on July 18, 1998. The English-language adaptation, produced by 4Kids Entertainment and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures (under its Kids' WB banner), was released in North America on November 12, 1999.The film primarily consists of three segments: Pikachu's Vacation, a 21-minute feature focusing on the series mascot Pikachu; Origin of Mewtwo, a 10-minute featurette that functions as a prologue to the main feature; and Mewtwo Strikes Back, the main 75 minute film feature. The North American version omitted Origin of Mewtwo from the package before its U.S. theatrical run due to its dark nature, as the target MPAA rating was G; the first two minutes were restored in the film's release on VHS and DVD as The Story of Mewtwo's Origin. The featurette was eventually dubbed and restored as a special feature in the U.S. release of the direct-to-video follow-up film sequel Pokémon: Mewtwo Returns as The Uncut Story of Mewtwo's Origin.As Pokémon was extremely popular when the film was released, it was a box office success worldwide.

Will Millhouse have a higher or lower temperature than Jarthrow? Two new planets have just been discovered in our solar system. Scientists have just landed on both and are in the process of analyzing the environment and atmosphere of each planet. What is immediately apparent is that both planets are remarkably similar to Earth since both are oxygen rich and do not require a space suit to breathe. Another similarity that one of the planets, Jarthrow, has with Earth is that it naturally outputs approximately the same amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as Earth does. The other planet, Millhouse, outputs about twice as many greenhouse gases. Climate scientists are rushing to try to see if anything new can be discovered to help out our planet with these new discoveries. Hint: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature. A:","completion":"Millhouse will have a higher temperature than Jarthrow. This is because Millhouse outputs about twice as many greenhouse gases as Jarthrow (which has the same greenhouse gas output as Earth). The greenhouse effect causes some of the solar heat to be trapped and be returned to the planet due to the presence of greenhouse gases. When there are more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, as in the case of Millhouse, more heat is trapped, leading to an increase in global temperature. Therefore, Millhouse will have a higher temperature compared to Jarthrow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Step 1: Read and understand the context presented by the user. Here, the speaker expresses a desire to pull troops out of the Balkans, yet acknowledges it cannot happen just yet due to agreements with NATO. Step 2: Undertake a deep analysis of the text. Specifically, the speaker does not advocate an immediate withdrawal, stating that doing so would contravene NATO agreements. There's no direct mention of having wished to withdraw troops earlier. Step 3: Make the inference. In this case, based on the speaker's insistence about the reality of current facts and agreements, there's no clear evidence to suggest he or she would have withdrawn the troops earlier. Justification: Despite the speaker's desire to withdraw troops from the Balkans, the facts presented don't offer any evidence that the speaker would have withdrawn the troops earlier. The speaker's careful consideration of existing NATO agreements shows an understanding of, and respect for, these formal commitments, which would likely have been in place in the past as well.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full anglicized name of the person whose later biographer tentatively accepted the epithet of Scotsman coined by John Evelyn? John Michael Wright, who at the height of his career would interchangeably sign himself \\"Anglus\\" or \\"Scotus\\", is of uncertain origin. The diarist John Evelyn called him a Scotsman, an epithet repeated by Horace Walpole and tentatively accepted by his later biographer, Verne. However, writing in 1700, the English antiquarian Thomas Hearne claims Wright was born in Shoe Lane, London and, after an adolescent conversion to Roman Catholicism, was taken to Scotland by a priest. A London birth certainly seems supported by a baptismal record, dated 25 May 1617, for a \\"Mighell Wryghtt\\", son of James Wright, described as a tailor and a citizen of London, in St Bride's Church, Fleet Street, London.What is known is that, on 6 April 1636, the 19-year-old Wright was apprenticed to George Jamesone, an Edinburgh portrait painter of some repute. The Edinburgh Register of Apprentices records him as \\"Michaell, son to James W(right), tailor, citizen of London\\". The reasons for this move to Scotland are unclear, but may have to do with familial connections (his parents may have been London Scots) or the advent of plague in London. During his apprenticeship, Wright is likely to have lodged at the High Street tenement near the Netherbow Gate that served as Jameson's workplace. The apprenticeship was contracted for five years, but may have been curtailed by Jameson's imprisonment in late 1639. There is no record of any independent work by Wright from this period (his earliest known painting being a small portrait of Robert Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury, painted in the early 1640s during his time in Rome).It is also possible that Wright met his wife during his Scottish residency. Nothing is known of her, except from a statement of thirty years later which describes her as \\"related to the most noble and distinguished families of Scotland.\\" If this is accurate, it may explain how Wright was later able to find aristocratic patronage. All that is known for certain is that Wright had at least one child by her, a son, Thomas.

Anbar province, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraq's vice president issued a decree Thursday calling for parliament to meet next week to start the process of creating a new government as the Iraqi military battles Sunni extremist militants. Vice President Khader al Khuzaei, acting on behalf of Iraq's President, made the directive amid calls for political action to tackle sectarian tensions that have fueled violence as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, advances toward Baghdad. On Thursday evening, seven people were killed and 36 others injured in an explosion in the capital's northern neighborhood of Kadimiyah, Iraqi police told CNN. There were conflicting reports about whether a suicide bomber or car bomb was responsible. \\"Also, the planes flew directly from","completion":"Russia to the al-Muthanna airbase in Samarra, about 100 kilometers north of Baghdad, to join the Iraqi military in their fight against ISIS. The delivery of these Russian Su-25 aircraft is a significant boost to the Iraqi military, as they have been struggling to contain the rapid advance of the extremist group. The past few weeks have been marked by significant territorial gains by ISIS militants in Anbar province, particularly in the city of Ramadi and the surrounding areas. The extremist group has exploited the unstable political situation in Iraq, taking advantage of the deep sectarian and ethnic divisions that have long plagued the country. As the security situation has deteriorated, with the Iraqi military suffering from low morale, lack of proper equipment, and poor leadership, the United States and other Western countries have stepped up their support for the ailing Iraqi forces. This includes not only the provision of military equipment and intelligence but also sending military advisors to train and advise the Iraqi troops on the ground. The situation in Iraq remains dire, with many Iraqis now displaced from their homes and forced to take refuge in makeshift camps both within Iraq and in neighboring countries such as Syria and Jordan. The United Nations has expressed concern about the growing humanitarian crisis and warned that the international community needs to do more to address the needs of the displaced population. However, alongside the military operations, many observers and analysts argue that a political solution is equally necessary to address the root causes of the current crisis and prevent the rise of future extremist groups. The long-awaited decree by Vice President al Khuzaei is seen as a positive step towards the formation of a new government that can work to tackle sectarianism and better represent the diverse population of Iraq. It is hoped that by coming together, the political factions can agree on a roadmap to rebuild the war-torn nation and move towards a more stable and peaceful future. Next week's parliamentary session will be crucial in shaping the course of political developments in Iraq, with long-standing power struggles between the Shiite, Sunni, and Kurdish factions expected to play a significant role in the negotiation process. If the Iraqi political leaders can overcome their differences and form a more inclusive government, this will likely be seen as a positive development not only by Iraqis but also by the international community, which has voiced support for a more united stance against the ongoing violence. In the meantime, the Iraqi military will continue to rely on the support of countries like Russia, the United States, and other international allies in their efforts to combat ISIS extremism and regain territories lost to the militant group. The people of Iraq, exhausted by years of violence and instability, will be watching closely as both military and political efforts unfold, hoping for a future where peace and stability can finally return to their long-suffering nation.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Decide what you want your end goal to be first. What do you want your lifestyle to look like, and where should your career be in five years? This should be a broad idea of what you want.

Set a realistic timelines for the smaller goals that will lead to the end you created. For example, write down goals like receive training, get an internship, work with a mentor, get a job at a school. Write down your goals and display them somewhere you will see them often. For example, tape the goals to your mirror or near your desk to remind you of the things you are working toward. Track the progress that you make. If you do not get that internship, for example, cross out that goal and replace it with a comparable goal or a goal that will still serve to get you to your end goal. Reevaluate your 5 year plan.

The text also highlights the importance of goal setting and long-term planning. One should have a clear vision of their end goal, such as the desired lifestyle and career progress in the next five years. To achieve this end goal, the text suggests setting realistic timelines for smaller, intermediate goals, like acquiring training, internships, or mentorship. Writing down these goals and placing them somewhere visible serves as a constant reminder and motivator. Moreover, tracking progress and adjusting goals accordingly plays a critical role in the journey towards one's dream. If certain goals are not achieved, it is essential to reassess and replace them with comparable objectives or modify existing ones to align with the end goal. Lastly, the passage acknowledges that it is perfectly fine to reevaluate or change the five-year plan if needed, as personal preferences and aspirations might evolve over time."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Paragraph: (CNN) -- A Christian evangelical group said Thursday that a Bible school -- backed by American evangelist Franklin Graham -- was destroyed in the latest bombing raid to hit South Kordofan, an oil-rich Sudanese province that borders the newly created independent country of South Sudan. At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement No injuries were reported. \\"It was a miracle that no one was injured,\\" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike. At least four churches have been destroyed since August, the group said. \\"We are deeply concerned for the welfare and lives of the people of South Kordofan and we condemn the bombing of churches and Christian facilities,\\" added Graham, son of the famed Rev. Billy Graham. More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported. The Sudanese government is thought to have responded to the rebellion by conducting sustained air raids with the use of Russian-made Antonov bombers, which have raised concerns over civilian casualties.

Q: Question: What number season of Molde FK was the 1999 season? Passage 1:In the 1999 season, Molde had a successful season, finishing second in the league and reaching the semi-final of the 1999 Norwegian Cup, where they were eliminated by Brann. Molde also participated in the UEFA Champions League, where Molde was drawn against CSKA Moscow in the second qualifying round. In the first match in Moscow, Molde lost 2–0, while in the second leg, 19-year-old Magne Hoseth had his big break-through with two goals when CSKA was defeated 4–0 to send Molde to the third qualifying round, where they met Mallorca. The first leg against Mallorca ended 0–0 at home. Away at Mallorca were Molde one goal behind for a long time, but Andreas Lund became the big hero when he equalized on a penaltyin the 84th minute. With a 1–1 aggregate score, Molde qualified for the group stage on away goals, and Molde became the team from the smallest city to have qualified for the group stage of Champions League until Unirea Urziceni repeated the feat in 2009–10. In the group stage, Molde were drawn against Real Madrid, Porto and Olympiacos, and with one 3–2 home win against Olympiacos and five losses, Molde finished last in their group. On the occasion of Molde's 100-year anniversary in 2011, the readers of the local newspaper Romsdals Budstikke voted 1999 as the best year in the history of the club. Passage 2:On 17 October 1987, Pope John Paul II named him Titular Archbishop of Urbs Salvia and appointed him Apostolic Nuncio to Ghana, Togo and Benin. He was consecrated on 28 November by Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, with Bishops Albino Mensa and Luigi Bettazzi as the principal co-consecrators. On 12 January 1990, he was transferred to Rwanda, where he supported human rights organizations and encouraged Catholic bishops to unite as forceful advocates for ending civil war. He remained at his post and traveled into dangerous regions to bear witness to the Tutsi Genocide in 1994. In March 1995, John Paul II appointed him Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the United Nations in Geneva from 1997, with the same role at the World Trade Organization. Upon his appointment Bertello negotiated the status of the Holy See as permanent observer in the World Trade Organization, becoming its first representative that year. Passage 3:President Álvaro Obregón and his successor Calles, as well as other politicians, wanted the revolutionary government to restrict and terminate the Catholic Church in Mexico. In February 1925, armed intruders calling themselves \\"Knights of the Order of Guadeloupe\\" occupied the church of María de la Soledad in Mexico City where , a Freemason and former Catholic priest, proclaimed himself the future patriarch of a new national church; parishioners attacked the interlopers and rioted the next day; similar riots were incited when other churches in Mexico were occupied by armed intruders that month. These armed intruders occupying churches induced fear of anti-Catholic persecution that led to the formation of the National League for the Defense of Religious Liberty (LNDLR) a militant Catholic defense organization. Official favoritism of a national church enraged revolutionaries who saw this as a \\"violation of state '\\" with potential to faction the revolution, so Calles stopped his support of after about 3 months. Nevertheless, the government failed in 1925 to orchestrate Pérez's consecration by a visiting Eastern Orthodox bishop, but in 1926, North American Old Roman Catholic Church Bishop Carmel Henry Carfora consecrated Pérez, Antonio Benicio López Sierra, and Macario López Valdez as bishops. In 1927, López Sierra established an church in San Antonio, Texas, where Archbishop Arthur Jerome Drossaerts, of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Antonio, called the ' (Spanish for schismatics) \\"designing proselytizers of the sects supported by Calles and the Mexican government, that archenemy of all Christianity;\\" and in 1929, López Valdes established an church in Los Angeles, California.

You are given a new situation: Catherine is throwing her friend a birthday party and is starting to put up decorations. She has finished hanging streamers and now she has to fill the balloons. Having never used a helium tank before, she wants to test how much to fill each balloon. and a hint : All fluids exert pressure like the air inside a tire. The particles of fluids are constantly moving in all directions at random. As the particles move, they keep bumping into each other and into anything else in their path. These collisions cause pressure, and the pressure is exerted equally in all directions. When particles are crowded together in one part of an enclosed space, such as the air particles first entering a tire, they quickly spread out to fill all the available space. That’s because particles of fluids always move from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure. This explains why air entering a tire through a tiny opening quickly fills the entire tire. Please answer this question : If one balloon is full and another is only half full does the full balloon have a higher or lower pressure? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The full balloon has a higher pressure. When a balloon is filled with helium or any gas, the gas particles inside the balloon exert pressure on the walls of the balloon due to their continuous random motion and collisions with each other and the balloon walls. The more gas particles there are inside the balloon, the more collisions will occur, resulting in higher pressure. Comparing a full balloon to a half-full balloon, the full balloon has more gas particles inside, which leads to more collisions and consequently higher pressure. The half-full balloon has fewer gas particles and less pressure. In summary, a full balloon has a higher pressure than a half-full balloon due to the increased number of gas particles causing more collisions and increased pressure on the balloon walls."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

European Exotic - NYTimes.com Hedy Lamarr, born Hedwig Kiesler in 1914 in Vienna, enjoyed an early if not particularly auspicious start in Max Reinhardt’s theater, and a few bit parts in movies before the Czech director Gustav Machaty cast her as the centerpiece of “Ecstasy.” The idyll of a young bride, married to a frigid older man, who finds liberation in the arms of a virile engineer was genuinely audacious in its concentration on a woman’s thwarted desire. But what made it the scandal of its time — 1933 — and onward were bucolic nude scenes of the star swimming and chasing a runaway horse, and rapturous close-ups of her sexual awakening. Seeing it now, one imagines generations of adolescents approaching it expecting soft-core titillation and being disappointed by the wholesomeness of a girl who is less sex goddess than pudgy teenager with small breasts (about which more to come). In an all-but-silent movie that has more in common with Leni Riefenstahl’s mountain-girl films (not to mention Soviet paeans to the Noble Worker), Hedwig is radiantly and un-self-consciously “au naturel,” lovely but as yet unformed, ­undefined. Then came Hollywood. The young aspirant was picked up by MGM and for her 1938 American debut in “Algiers” was given the full goddess treatment: sleeked down, smartened up, renamed, glamorously photographed, her jet black hair dramatically parted in the middle, her lovely face framed by hats and snoods and turbans that turned into both a trademark and a fashion sensation. She became a star, yet through a long and checkered career, still remained undefined — remote, beautiful, yes, even mesmerizingly so, but without a distinct personality. Not one but two biographers have now made it their mission to resurrect a life and career that, without making exorbitant claims, they deem more interesting than her lackluster place in film history would suggest. Lamarr was a complicated woman, deserving of a more serious appraisal than the numerous tabloid accounts that till now have stood as the public record (not least of which was her own lurid memoir, “Ecstasy and Me”). Perhaps Stephen Michael Shearer and Ruth Barton were both drawn by the startling contrast between her eerie on-screen stillness and a life full of drama and agitation to the point of incoherence. The well-brought-up daughter of a rich and socially ambitious Jewish banker (he dragged his wife and daughter in shame from the premiere of “Ecstasy”), Lamarr married Fritz Mandl, Austria’s foremost (and half Jewish) munitions manufacturer), who was supplying arms to Mussolini, and who kept her a virtual prisoner. After several attempts, she made a daring escape, out of the boiling pot of Austria into the arms and dubious patronage of L. B. Mayer, the head of MGM. She was by all accounts an extremely intelligent woman, cultured and musical. And with her knowledge of weaponry, she was soon to be an inventor: on the eve of America’s entrance into World War II, she came up with an idea for a radio-directed torpedo-guidance system that was later adapted to modern warfare. But Lamarr arrived in the United States at a moment of social uncertainty and sexual puritanism. She emanated refinement, yet all anybody seemed to be able to talk about were those small breasts. Mayer continually advised her to “do something about” them. Shearer’s “Beautiful” and Barton’s “Hedy Lamarr” cover pretty much the same ground, but with different emphasis. The author of a biography of Patricia Neal, Shearer is steeped in Hollywood history and context; he provides the nuts, bolts and by-ways of production, and a sympathetic account of Lamarr’s later life and friends. Barton, who has written on Irish actors in Hollywood, introduces interesting ancillary cultural referents, including tributes to Lamarr from admirers like Henry Miller and Joseph Cornell, and takes a more analytical, feminist approach. Both authors are familiar with all that has been written on the subject, most especially Lamarr’s memoir, which they quote from, but warily. Molly Haskell’s most recent book is “Frankly, My Dear: ‘Gone With the Wind’ Revisited.” What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about the life and career of Hedy Lamarr, a famous actress from the 1930s and 1940s.

The government really wants to keep the city clean and will fine you for chewing gum. Before you leave for the United Arab Emirates you'd better make sure you aren't visiting during Ramadan . During that time you aren't allowed to eat or drink in public. Tourists have been fined up to 275 for drinking in public. Lovers spend so much time kissing each other goodbye at train stations that trains often start late. This law -- no kissing your lover goodbye at train stations - is rather old, and isn't in use today in France. In Thailand it's against the law to drive a car or motorcycle without a shirt on, no matter how hot it is. Punishments are different in different areas and can include warnings and tickets costing about 10. No joke -- the local police will stop you. Studies in Denmark have shown that cars with their headlights on are more noticeable by other drivers than those with their headlights off. Drivers there are required to leave their headlights on even during the day, or they may face a fine up to 100. Do you often buy things using coins? Don't do it in Canada.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: Whose reception of Niecks was reportedly not merely polite but most friendly? is inside the article: It is not clear why, in 1873, Alkan decided to emerge from his self-imposed obscurity to give a series of six Petits Concerts at the Érard piano showrooms. It may have been associated with the developing career of Delaborde, who, returning to Paris in 1867, soon became a concert fixture, including in his recitals many works by his father, and who was at the end of 1872 given the appointment that had escaped Alkan himself, Professor at the Conservatoire. The success of the Petits Concerts led to them becoming an annual event (with occasional interruptions caused by Alkan's health) until 1880 or possibly beyond. The Petits Concerts featured music not only by Alkan but of his favourite composers from Bach onwards, played on both the piano and the pédalier, and occasionally with the participation of another instrumentalist or singer. He was assisted in these concerts by his siblings, and by other musicians including Delaborde, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Auguste Franchomme.Those encountering Alkan at this phase included the young Vincent d'Indy, who recalled Alkan's \\"skinny, hooked fingers\\" playing Bach on an Érard pedal piano: \\"I listened, riveted to the spot by the expressive, crystal-clear playing.\\" Alkan later played Beethoven's Op. 110 sonata, of which d'Indy said: \\"What happened to the great Beethovenian poem ...

Lying really does create a desire to clean the \\"dirty\\" body part, according to a study by University of Michigan. \\"The references to 'dirty hands' or 'dirty mouths' in everyday language suggest that people think about abstract issues of moral purity in terms of more experiences with physical purity,\\" said Spike W.S. Lee, a U-M doctoral candidate, who conducted the study with Norbert Schwarz, a psychologist at the U-M Institute for Social Research (ISR), the Ross School of Business, and the U-M psychology department. For the study, Lee and Schwarz asked 87 students to play the role of lawyers competing with a colleague, \\"Chris\\", for a promotion. Each was asked to imagine they found an important document that Chris had lost, and that returning the document would help his career and hurt their own career. Each participant was instructed to leave Chris a message by either voice mail or email, telling him who they were and either lying that they could not find his document or telling the truth that they had found the document. Next, participants rated the desirability of several products as part of a supposed marketing survey and reported how much they were willing to pay for each product. The products included mouthwash and hand sanitizer . Study participants who lied on the phone, leaving an untrue and mean voicemail, felt a stronger desire for mouthwash and were willing to pay more for it than those who lied on e-mail. And conversely, those who lied on e-mail, typing the same mean message, felt a stronger desire for hand sanitizer and were willing to pay more for _ . Saying nice and morally correct things, on the other hand, made it less appealing to clean the body part involved in conveying the message.

He merely paddled urgently for the edge of the plastic pool with his head high and his thin legs churning.

Ma could not swim, so she never made me jump off a dock into deep water, and she always insisted that I wear an orange styrofoam cylinder on my back like a skindiver or spaceman.

For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music. Saint-Saëns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere. In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged. His four-act \\"drame lyricque\\", Le timbre d'argent (\\"The Silver Bell\\"), to Jules Barbier's and Michel Carré's libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production. The work was eventually presented by the Théâtre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances.The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy \\"To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition\\". Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died. He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities. After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all. He composed a Messe de Requiem in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Saëns conducted. In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success, with Samson et Dalila, his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation.

It was a chilly evening, and the tavern was packed with locals seeking warmth and company. The streets were quiet, the only sounds being the wind rustling through the golden leaves of autumn and the distant laughter of customers inside the cozy tavern. Ellie's father, a loyal worker at a local factory, had promised to come home right after work to help her take care of their sick son, Max, and her mother, Emma. However, Jack chose to spend his time in the tavern instead, leaving Ellie distraught and feeling betrayed. She put on her worn-out coat and hastily made her way to the tavern, the dimly lit sign guiding her way through the darkness. Inside the tavern, Ellie spotted her father sitting at the end of the bar, laughing at some joke. Ward and Fred, two animators from the Disney animation studio, who had recently moved to town, were there too. They had quickly become the local favorites, frequently drawing caricatures of regular customers, lightening the mood, and providing amusement for everyone in the tavern. The bartender, Mickey, was a jovial and comforting man, often smoothing things over for patrons who had become upset during the night. As Ellie approached her father, her eyes filled with tears. She was angry, but more than that, she was disappointed. She thought of her exhausted mother at home, desperately trying to care for their sick son alone. The sight of her father beaming with joy among his friends was a painful reminder of the promise he had broken. Gently pulling at her father's sleeve, she said, \\"Dad, please... come home. You promised you would help us tonight. Max is so sick, and Mom... she needs us, too.\\" Her father looked down at her with an embarrassed expression, unable to muster up the decency to reply. Her direct plea caught the attention of the tavern's patrons, and the murmur of conversations began to fade. Even Fred and Ward stopped in the middle of sketching an exaggerated caricature of an elderly patron who had nodded off in his seat. The room grew quiet, awaiting Jack's response. He sighed deeply and finally broke the silence, muttering an almost inaudible apology, \\"I'm sorry, Ellie. I... I just needed a break. But you're right, I should have been home.\\" Mickey, sensing the tension, approached Ellie and tried to comfort her, gently patting her shoulder. \\"Don't take it so hard, kiddo,\\" he reassured her, \\"Your father's a good man, he just let himself get carried away.\\" Ellie looked up at Mickey, appreciative of his attempt to comfort her. \\"Thank you, Mickey,\\" she smiled sadly, \\"it means a lot.\\" Fred and Ward put down their sketchbook and pencil, feeling guilty for their part in Jack's absence. They exchanged glances and then walked over to Ellie and her father. As a gesture of goodwill, they gave Ellie their sketchbook with the illustrations they had done that night. \\"We're sorry, Ellie,\\" they said in unison. \\"We didn't realize how important it was for your father to be with his family tonight. We'll all walk you home.\\" Together, Ellie, her father, Fred, and Ward left the confines of the warm tavern, stepping out into the cold, autumn night. They walked through the quiet, narrow streets under a star-lit sky. The aroma of wood smoke hung in the crisp air, and amidst the tense beginning, laughter started filling the air as they shared stories, lightening the mood. Jack made a promise to make amends, and his heartfelt apology allowed Ellie and her mother to forgive him. From that night on, Jack made a conscious effort to prioritize his family, always remembering what truly mattered in life – the love and support of his loved ones. Fred and Ward's presence in their town brought more than just humorous caricatures, they also brought life and kindness which forged new friendships and reminded everyone of the importance of unity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person who must remain handcuffed to his father? Fifteen disparate African American men board a bus in Los Angeles bound for Washington, D.C., where they plan on attending the Million Man March. Other than their race, destination, and gender, the men have nothing in common: George is the trip organizer; Xavier is an aspiring filmmaker hoping to make a documentary of the March; Flip is the vain but charismatic and openly homophobic and sexist actor; Kyle and Randall are a homosexual couple; Gary, a biracial police officer; Jamal is a former gang banger turned devout Muslim who has evaded prosecution for the murders he committed; Evan Jr., is a petty criminal who has been permitted to break probation to attend the march on the condition that he remain handcuffed to his father, Evan Sr. As the bus travels across country, Xavier conducts interviews with the various attendees, allowing them to express their views on race, religion, and politics. The interviews often provoke outbursts from other men on the bus, invariably leading to many political confrontations. Jeremiah, the eldest member of the group, is an 80-year-old former alcoholic who lost his job and family, has found new meaning in life and is energized by the Million Man March, and embraces his African heritage; his philosophies on the black experience and stories of precolonial Africa serve to unite the men and ease tensions and the infighting among them. En route the bus breaks down and the men are forced to board another bus, driven by an ethnically Jewish white man named Rick.

Let them ride a bike to school. In England 8.3 million children travel to school every day. It is reported that only a small number of pupils cycle to school (under 2%), although one in three children would actually like to. Experts say that to stay healthy, children need at least one hour of moderate exercise every day. But only six out of ten boys and four out of ten girls get that. One of the reasons is that parents have developed a habit of driving their children to school when they could just walk or ride a bike to school. Teachers often say that children who walk or ride a bike to school are more ready to listen to their classes, ask and answer questions in class than those driven by car, and the school journey is a good chance for children to learn about road safety and other life skills. Also, for many children, riding a bike is more fun than going to school by car. Most parents know the benefits . Then what's stopping them from letting their kids ride a bike? Safety is the number one worry for them. But actually riding a bike is not as dangerous as parents think it is. When you decide to buy a bike, you should be aware that a bike that is too big or too small is dangerous. Don't try to get a bike that your child will \\"grow into\\". Get the right size in good working order. Generally, 20-inch wheels are on bikes for 5-8 year olds; 24-inch wheels are for 9-11 year olds; 26-inch wheels are suitable for those over 11, and some older children should even take bikes with 28-inch wheels, but the main thing is that the bike fits your child.

The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill Thursday that would protect from arbitrary dismissal the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The measure, backed by 10 Democrats and four Republicans, would codify Justice Department regulations that the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or a designee for \\"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.\\" The proposal would give the special counsel 10 days to challenge a dismissal in court. If a court determines the firing was not for \\"good cause,\\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation. While marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea. The legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller. Mueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign. Trump has said there was no collusion and repeatedly denounced the probe as a \\"witch hunt.\\" Despite his harsh criticism of the Special Counsel and the Justice Department, Trump has dismissed reports that he's privately talked about firing Mueller. He told the cable show Fox and Friends on Thursday that he'll \\"try and stay away\\" from the Justice Department, but \\"at some point, I... Who is Mueller? A. attorney general B. deputy attorney general C. special counsel D. not enough information A:","completion":"C. Special Counsel The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee's approval of a bill to protect the special counsel from arbitrary dismissal demonstrates strong bipartisan support for Robert Mueller, who is currently leading the federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign. Mueller, a former FBI director, was appointed as special counsel by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in May 2017. The bill, backed by 10 Democrats and four Republicans, intends to preserve the integrity and independence of the investigation. This legislation aims to solidify existing Justice Department regulations, specifying that the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or a designee for \\"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.\\" In the event of a dismissal, the special counsel would be granted 10 days to challenge the decision in court. Should a court find the firing to be without \\"good cause,\\" the special counsel would be reinstated. Furthermore, the bill mandates the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the investigation's findings. Despite the intense political pressure and frequent attacks directed at Mueller by President Trump and some Republicans, the proposed bill is unlikely to become law due to opposition within the Republican Party. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell previously stated that Trump would not fire Mueller and deemed it unnecessary to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also expressed resistance to the idea. However, the legislation's introduction by a bipartisan group of senators earlier this month highlights the ongoing concern that Trump may attempt to fire Mueller and Rosenstein following the FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office. Throughout the investigation, President Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia, routinely referring to the probe as a \\"witch hunt.\\" He has also downplayed reports suggesting he has discussed firing Mueller privately, asserting on Fox and Friends that he would \\"try and stay away\\" from the Justice Department. Overall, the Senate Judiciary Committee's approval of the bill showcases growing support for protecting Mueller's investigation and reinforces the notion that the special counsel should be allowed to conduct a thorough, impartial inquiry into the matter at hand."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Remember the difference between “Good evening” and “Goodnight” in Afrikaans. Say “Goodbye” formally or informally.","completion":"Title: Greetings in Afrikaans: Mastering the Basics Introduction Afrikaans, a West Germanic language spoken primarily in South Africa and Namibia, boasts a rich linguistic history and unique expressions. As a learner or visitor, one of the first aspects to master is the art of greeting others. In this article, we will explore how to greet in Afrikaans, the differences between key phrases, and when to use them properly. 1. Start With a Morning Greeting: 'Goeiemôre' Just like in English, where we say \\"Good morning,\\" to greet someone in the morning, in Afrikaans, you can say \\"Goeiemôre.\\" This phrase is a perfect way to greet someone during the early part of the day. Pronounce it as \\"Khoo-yeah-more-ah\\" and remember to smile as you extend this warm greeting. 2. Transition to Afternoon Greetings: 'Goeie middag' As the day progresses towards afternoon, it is time to switch from the morning greeting to an afternoon greeting. To wish someone a good afternoon in Afrikaans, say \\"Goeie middag.\\" Pronounced as \\"Khoo-yeah mid-dach,\\" this phrase carries the same sentiment as \\"Good afternoon\\" in English. Be sure to adjust your greeting according to the time of day, as it reflects your awareness of the culture and language. 3. Distinguishing Between 'Good Evening' and 'Goodnight' in Afrikaans In Afrikaans, just like in English, there is a distinct difference between \\"Good evening\\" and \\"Goodnight.\\" \\"Good evening\\" serves as a greeting when you meet someone during the evening hours, while \\"Goodnight\\" is a farewell expression used before going to sleep. To say \\"Good evening,\\" use the phrase \\"Goeienaand\\" (pronounced as \\"Khoo-yeah-naahnt\\"). On the other hand, to wish someone a \\"Goodnight,\\" say \\"Goeie nag\\" (pronounced as \\"Khoo-yeah nuch\\"). 4. Saying Goodbye: Formal and Informal Farewell Expressions Formal Farewells: When it comes to formal settings, it is essential to bid farewell appropriately. In Afrikaans, you can use the phrase \\"Totsiens\\" (pronounced as \\"Tote-see-ehns\\") or \\"Vaarwel\\" (pronounced as \\"Faar-vehl\\") to say \\"Goodbye.\\" These expressions work well when you are in a professional environment or when speaking with someone older than you. Informal Farewells: In informal settings, you can use the more casual phrase \\"Lekker dag\\" (pronounced as \\"Leh-kher dach\\") or simply \\"Hamba kahle\\" (pronounced as \\"Hahm-ba-kah-hle\\") to say \\"Goodbye\\" or \\"Take care.\\" These expressions are suitable for casual interactions, speaking to friends, and acquaintances. Conclusion To navigate and communicate effectively in a new culture, it is crucial to understand and master greetings in the local language. By incorporating these Afrikaans greetings and farewells into your vocabulary, you can engage in more meaningful conversations and create stronger connections with native speakers. Embrace the beauty of the Afrikaans language, and keep practicing to perfect these phrases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

After a few years of peace, the Ottoman Empire attacked the Habsburg Empire again. The Turks almost captured Vienna, but king of Poland John III Sobieski led a Christian alliance that defeated them in the Battle of Vienna which shook the Ottoman Empire's hegemony in south-eastern Europe. A new Holy League was initiated by Pope Innocent XI and encompassed the Holy Roman Empire , the Venetian Republic and Poland in 1684, joined by Tsarist Russia in 1686. Ottomans suffered two decisive defeats against the Holy Roman Empire: the second Battle of Mohács in 1687 and a decade later, in 1697, the battle of Zenta. On the smaller Polish front, after the battles of 1683 , Sobieski, after his proposal for the League to state a major coordinated offensive, undertook a rather unsuccessful offensive in Moldavia in 1686, with the Ottomans refusing a major engagement and harassing the army. For the next four years Poland would blockade the key fortress at Kamenets, and Ottoman Tatars would raid the borderlands. In 1691, Sobieski undertook another expedition to Moldovia, with slightly better results, but still with no decisive victories. The last battle of the campaign was the battle of Podhajce in 1698, where Polish hetman Feliks Kazimierz Potocki defeated the Ottoman incursion into the Commonwealth. The League won the war in 1699 and forced the Ottoman Empire to sign the Treaty of Karlowitz. The Ottomans lost much of their European possessions, with Podolia returned to Poland with imposion of Austria.

I expected to have a long wait just like any other Oregano's I've been to. That said, My first visit to this location was couple weeks after they opened. I ordered Beefstro salad and Bollo Pasta. They had no knowledge of menu at all... When I asked the hostess how long it was gonna take, she said it'll be 45 minutes. I replied with \\"for a salad and pasta?\\" right then, the manager was walking by and overheard my question and said, \\"no, not for a salad and Bollo Pasta, it'll only be 10-15 minutes\\". That sounded better, so I walked over to the bar, which only has 4 tightly close seats, saw that they were all taken, of course, just ordered my drink and stood in the walk-way. There were no other place to wait for food and outside waiting area was WAY over crowded. After 45 minutes..... (hostess was right) I finally got my food and took it to my work (good thing I had plenty of time before my shift) opened my food and I couldn't find any beef on my Beefstro salad. Just a big box of greens! So I called... and surprisingly the hostess knew that I was missing my beef and asked me to come back and get them (She said she had it right there and forgot to put it in my bag). I was already at work so I wasn't able to. If they had not taken so long to get my food in the first place, I probably had came, but no. So she puts me on hold and gets the manager. He tells me to come get the meat. Again, I said I can't. So then he said he will give me a salad for free next time I come in. So I said sure. I couldn't stop by to get the salad, so I called up again and he just mailed me a 15 gift card (one week later). Second visit (to use my gift card). It was around 1 pm on Saturday.

Remembering the \\"we have some planes\\" remark, Boston Center guessed that Delta 1989 might also be hijacked. Boston Center called NEADS at 9:41 and identified Delta 1989, a 767 jet that had left Logan Airport for Las Vegas, as a possible hijack. NEADS warned the FAA's Cleveland Center to watch Delta 1989.

Following a brief stint touring with New Order in the summer , Corgan reunited with Chamberlin to form the band Zwan with Corgan's old friend Matt Sweeney in late 2001. According to Neil Strauss of New York Times, during his few live performances with the band, Corgan says \\"is still a work in progress.\\" The lineup was completed with guitarist David Pajo and bassist Paz Lenchantin. The band had two distinct incarnations, the primary approach being an upbeat rock band with a three-guitar-driven sound, the second, a folk and gospel inspired acoustic side with live strings. The quintet performed throughout 2002, and their debut album, Mary Star of the Sea, was released in early 2003 to generally positive reviews. In the midst of their supporting tour for the album, mounting conflict between Corgan and Chamberlin, and the other band members led to the cancellation of the rest of the tour as the band entered an apparent hiatus, formally announcing a breakup in September 2003. In 2004 Corgan began writing revealing autobiographical posts on his website and his MySpace page, blaming Iha for the breakup of the Smashing Pumpkins, calling Wretzky \\"a mean spirited drug addict,\\" and criticizing his former Zwan bandmates' fixation with \\"indie cred\\" and calling them \\"filthy\\", opportunistic, and selfish. On September 17, 2003, Billy first presented his poetry at the Art Institute of Chicago's Rubloff Auditorium. In late 2004, Corgan published Blinking with Fists, a book of poetry. Despite mixed reviews, the book debuted on the New York Times Best Seller list. Around this time, he began posting autobiographical writings online under the title The Confessions of Billy Corgan. Also in 2004, he began a solo music career, landing on an electronic/shoegaze/alternative rock sound for his first solo album, TheFutureEmbrace, co-produced and arranged by Bon Harris of Nitzer Ebb. Released on June 21, 2005, through Reprise Records, it garnered mixed reviews from the press and only sold 69,000 copies. Corgan toured behind his solo album with a touring band that included Linda Strawberry, Brian Liesegang and Matt Walker in 2005. This tour was not as extensive as previous Smashing Pumpkins or Zwan tours. Prior to recording TheFutureEmbrace, Corgan had recorded some 72 songs inspired by Chicago history for the largely acoustic ChicagoSongs project, which have yet to be released.

Kill the zombies you encounter for extra SP. When you fall into the next area after pulling the levers, let the game save, then quit the level and repeat as needed. For extra SP, try shooting the zombies in the head to make them Bloodshots, which are worth more. These chapters have lots of enemies that drop high amounts of SP. Each Ogroman enemy (the giant-like creatures with red organs on their backs) drops 4,000 SP. There are two Ogroman enemies in 2-3 — avoid using the third AA gun to be able to get the SP from the second Ogroman. In 2-4, there are several Napad enemies (the ones with hard armor shells you need to break) worth 1,500 SP each and several Strelat enemies (the lizards that spit spines at you) worth 1,000 SP each. Try using the grenade launcher to kill all the Napads in the foyer to get about 10,000 in a very short time. In this chapter, you're in a race against Chris. If you're quick, you can rack up tons of SP in a short amount of time. Beating Chris to the elevator nets you 2,000 SP. After, when you're hacking the locks, use the shotgun to take down the drones effectively. If you do well, you'll beat Chris and win 14,000 SP. After the Simmons cutscene, the game will save and you can repeat this process for more SP. A good deal of SP is scattered through the entire chapter. Napads are worth 1,500 SP each, while Whoppers (the enormous fat zombies) are worth 2,500 each and Shriekers (the zombies with the large red growth on their chests) are worth 1,000 each. There are also lots of SP drops distributed in the various boxes, including a 4,000 SP drop in the treasure chest after the first Napad. Level 2-3 is especially lucrative — killing the enemies in the underground lab can earn you about 25,000 SP in less than ten minutes.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: A popular student in her small high school, Katie started college, expecting to do well in her courses and be best friends with her roommates. But things didn't turn out that way. Psych 101, the course she thought would be a first-semester favorite, turned out to be a struggle. Living away from home tends to be the toughest adjustment for first-year students. You may feel homesick in your first weeks or months. It can help to call, write, or email your parents and friends, making them know how you're going. You can also talk with your roommates. As first-year students themselves, they're probably experiencing many of the same fears and worries that you're dealing with . But what if you don't get along well with your roommates? In some cases, it can be a good thing if you and your roommates aren't much alike. Different views on things may be helpful, so respect your differences no matter what. If you and your roommates don't get along well, it can help to find someone who you feel does understand you, which should be easy on a campus with so many people. Many schools have student organization nights where all of the campus clubs gather and promote their organizations, so you can meet people with the same interests there as you. You'll also meet tons of people in class or in your dorm building. As homesickness, painful throats, sprained ankles and wisdom teeth that act up are common among college students, you should check out your student guidebook or your school's website to find out information about the university health center. If you think you cannot deal with your problems, make a stop at the school counseling center. First-year troubles are something the counselors know well. You can get help there.

Is it true that did deion sanders play baseball and football at the same time based on the following text? During his best year in the majors, the 1992 season, he hit .304 for the team, stole 26 bases, and led the NL with 14 triples in 97 games. During the 1989 season, he hit a major league home run and scored a touchdown in the NFL in the same week, the only player ever to do so. Sanders is also the only man to play in both a Super Bowl and a World Series. Deion Sanders and Bo Jackson were the pre-eminent multi-sport athletes of their time, but prior to the 1990 season, they had never squared off against each other in a professional game. That changed in 1990, when Jackson and Sanders met five times on the diamond -- the most memorable of which came on July 17th, in what was billed as \`\`The Bo and Prime Time Show.''

The Agencies Confer When they learned a second plane had struck the World Trade Center, nearly everyone in the White House told us, they immediately knew it was not an accident. The Secret Service initiated a number of security enhancements around the White House complex. The officials who issued these orders did not know that there were additional hijacked aircraft, or that one such aircraft was en route to Washington. These measures were precautionary steps taken because of the strikes in New York. The FAA and White House Teleconferences. The FAA, the White House, and the Defense Department each initiated a multiagency teleconference before 9:30. Because none of these teleconferences-at least before 10:00- included the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department, none succeeded in meaningfully coordinating the military and FAA response to the hijackings. At about 9:20, security personnel at FAA headquarters set up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies, including the Defense Department. The NMCC officer who participated told us that the call was monitored only periodically because the information was sporadic, it was of little value, and there were other important tasks. The FAA manager of the teleconference also remembered that the military participated only briefly before the Pentagon was hit. Both individuals agreed that the teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of 9/11. Acting Deputy Administrator Belger was frustrated to learn later in the morning that the military had not been on the call. At the White House, the video teleconference was conducted from the Situation Room by Richard Clarke, a special assistant to the president long involved in counterterrorism. Logs indicate that it began at 9:25 and included the CIA; the FBI; the departments of State, Justice, and Defense; the FAA; and the White House shelter. The FAA and CIA joined at 9:40. The first topic addressed in the White House video teleconference-at about 9:40-was the physical security of the President, the White House, and federal agencies. Immediately thereafter it was reported that a plane had hit the Pentagon. We found no evidence that video teleconference participants had any prior information that American 77 had been hijacked and was heading directly toward Washington.

Options: - ceiling - library - surface of earth - most buildings - desktop Explain why a human would choose \\"most buildings\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"most buildings\\" to answer the question \\"Dust accumulates where?\\" because it is the most accurate and encompassing option amongst the given choices. Dust accumulation is a common occurrence in most, if not all, buildings due to various factors such as the presence of humans, outdoor pollutants, and natural processes that generate dust particles. In order to provide more context and in-depth understanding, let's look at each option independently and assess how \\"most buildings\\" stands as the best answer. 1. Ceiling: Dust can indeed accumulate on ceilings, particularly near vents or in corners where air circulation can be poor. However, this option is too specific and does not cover the range of places where dust may accumulate in buildings. 2. Library: While dust certainly can and does accumulate in libraries, this answer is also too narrow. Libraries are just one type of building, and dust is a universal issue that affects most indoor spaces. 3. Surface of earth: Dust does accumulate on the surface of the Earth, especially in the form of soil or sand particles. Nevertheless, this choice mainly pertains to outdoor environments rather than the indoor spaces that make up most buildings. 4. Most buildings: This is the best answer because it acknowledges that dust is a widespread issue affecting nearly all indoor environments. Buildings provide numerous surfaces for dust to rest upon, and the presence of humans and their activities further contribute to dust generation. This option simply and effectively covers the broad range of potential dust accumulation sites. 5. Desktop: Similar to the ceiling and library options, the desktop is too specific a location for dust accumulation. Although dust can and does accumulate on desktops, it is just one of the many surfaces within a building where dust can be found. In conclusion, the reason a human would choose \\"most buildings\\" as the answer is because it is the most comprehensive option that encompasses all the potential indoor environments where dust may accumulate. It accounts for the multitude of surfaces in buildings and acknowledges the widespread concern of dust accumulation in various indoor spaces. The other choices, while containing some truth, are either too narrow or unrelated to specifically address the question of where dust accumulates."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the equation 24*g + 42 = 234 for g, follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Isolate the term with the variable g by subtracting 42 from both sides of the equation. This will help us eliminate the constant term (42) and get closer to finding the value of g. 24*g + 42 - 42 = 234 - 42 This simplifies to: 24*g = 192 Step 2: Now, we have a simplified equation with just one term having the variable g. To find the value of g, we need to remove the coefficient 24 in front of g by dividing both sides of the equation by 24. (24*g) / 24 = 192 / 24 Since 24 divided by 24 equals 1, this simplifies to: g = 8 So, the solution of the equation 24*g + 42 = 234 for g is: g = 8"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Around the turn of the century, Carrie Meeber leaves her family in a small rural town and heads to Chicago. On the train to Chicago, Charles Drouet approaches her. Although Carrie is reluctant to speak to him, the salesman persists and the two chat until they reach Chicago. Carrie gets off in South Chicago, the slums as Charles Drouet points out, after taking Drouet's business card. In South Chicago, Carrie stays with her sister and her husband Sven who have one child. Carrie loses her sweatshop sewing job after injuring her hand. After an exhausting and fruitless day of job hunting, Carrie looks up Charles Drouet. He not only talks her into having dinner with him at Fitzgerald's, an upscale restaurant, but also gives her 10. Carrie heads to Fitzgerald's to return the money to Drouet. While there she meets George Hurstwood, the manager of the restaurant, who is immediately smitten with her. Carrie ends up moving in with Drouet. He is a big talker but basically harmless. She pressures Drouet to marry her because the neighbors are talking about them. He tries to distract her and invites Hurstwood, whom he had run into by sheer coincidence, into their home.

George and Carrie fall in love, spending all of their free time together. Despite being committed to another person, George's emotions for Carrie are genuine, and he entertains thoughts of starting a new life with her. However, Carrie eventually discovers the truth about George's marital status and confronts him about it.

Rachel stepped forward into the crowd while I took a moment to drink in the ceiling's blue-lit, shadowed vault and the light-catching haze from who-knows-what rising between the DJ and the crowd. There was a terrific echo, each beat reverberating inside of the next, and the old stained-glass windows rattled in their frames. On the dance floor, people moved with their eyes closed and their hands in the air. I danced with Rachel for a while, but then something by the bar seemed to be pulling her eyes. She told me that she was heading for a drink and slipped out of the crowd. When she hadn't come back halfway through the next song, I glanced over at the bar. It was just a little set-up where someone had stacked a few crates and brought something alcoholic to share, mostly beer. Rachel was standing with a plastic cup, looking like she was having a conversation, but I couldn't see anyone else there. The next time the crowd split, I saw him. He stood in front of a blue light, so I couldn't see him clearly, but what I saw was memorable. He wore a jacket of what might have been blue velvet, and his hair gleamed black against his white skin. The blue haze seemed to stop just shy of his pallor, setting off his striking face without illuminating its details, and his wrists flashed white in the darkness. He didn't move, just stared and held his drink. The next time I saw them, his mouth was moving. She nodded and he took her arm. I watched them through the crush of dancers as they squeezed along the wall, and the feeling came to me that something was very wrong. Saturday morning, I woke up and saw that she still hadn't come home.

And the answer is?","completion":"The name of the murderer whom the crowd chose to release instead of Jesus is Barabbas. The story of Barabbas being released and Jesus being crucified is told in all four Gospels of the New Testament: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Each account provides slightly different details, but the essential narrative remains the same. Barabbas, whose full name may have been Jesus Barabbas, was a notorious prisoner, described variously in the Gospels as a rebel, murderer, and robber. In the context of the narrative, Barabbas was already imprisoned by the Roman authorities for his role in an insurrection against the Roman rule and for committing murder. As per the custom during the Passover festival, the Roman governor Pontius Pilate would release one prisoner chosen by the Jewish crowd. Pilate, recognizing Jesus to be a victim of the religious leaders' envy, offered to release Jesus as part of this annual pardon. However, the religious leaders and the crowd demanded Barabbas's release instead. According to the Gospels: 1. In Matthew 27:15-26, Barabbas is referred to as a \\"notorious prisoner.\\" Pilate offered to grant amnesty to either Jesus or Barabbas, but the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to call for Jesus' crucifixion. 2. In Mark 15:6-15, Barabbas is described as being in prison \\"with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising.\\" Again, Pilate offered to release either Jesus or Barabbas, but the crowd chose Barabbas. 3. In Luke 23:13-25, Barabbas is presented as someone \\"who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city and for murder.\\" Pilate's offer to free either Jesus or Barabbas led to the same decision to release Barabbas. 4. In John 18:39-40, Barabbas is simply called a \\"bandit.\\" The Gospel reiterates the practice of freeing one prisoner at Passover, and when Pilate asked whether they want Jesus or Barabbas released, the crowd shouted for Barabbas. Despite the differences, all accounts describe the ultimate release of Barabbas and Jesus being handed over to be crucified. The character and story of Barabbas symbolize the unjust fate that Jesus endured on behalf of humanity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Italian troops captured Ghat in the south-west of the province in August 1914, which prompted an uprising and forced the Italians out of Ghat and Ghadames. The call to jihad had more effect among the Senussi than elsewhere and Ahmad began the jihad in Fezzan in southern Libya. The Italians re-captured Ghadames in February 1916 but the blockade on the Senussi had little military effect, since they were well stocked with captured Italian weapons; Italian garrisons in Cyrenaica were withdrawn to reinforce the west. Ottoman-German operations in Tripolitania were based at Misratah, where a submarine visited every couple of weeks to deliver arms and ammunition and in May 1917 a wireless station was built. Ottoman troops established about twenty posts on the coast and by 1918 had 20,000 regular troops, a similar number in training and another 40,000 untrained reservists. In September 1918, having been prevented from entering Tripolitania by the Ottoman forces, Sayed Ahmed boarded a German submarine at al-Aqaila and went into exile in Turkey. In Tripolitania, local troops under al-Shtaiwi and Ottoman regular soldiers under Nuri Bey and Suliman al-Baruni, resisted the Italians until the end of the war. Archaeological analysis of the salt pan of Kallaya, the site of a minor skirmish between Libyans on 14 November 1918, shows that they had Russian rifles captured by the Germans and Austro-Hungarians on the Eastern front and sent to Libya via the Ottomans.

Answer the following question: Process: - When water freezes it becomes 10% bigger, or takes up 10% more space - As water expands it puts great pressure on the walls of anything containing it, including any rocks which happen to be surrounding it - The force of the pressure exerted on the rock surrounding it is enough to wedge the walls of the crack farther apart, thus expanding and deepening the crack - Clay expends when wet like ice does - This causes rock to break apart - Some plants like mosses and lichens are capable of growing without soil on bare rock - When they do this their roots penetrate pores and crevices and cause rocks to split apart as the roots force their way down through the rocks - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the rock is underwater and requres colder temperatures for longer durations for the water to freeze happens, how will it affect LESS or SLOWER erosion of rocks. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an effect (both direct and indirect) on the process of erosion of rocks. In the perturbation hypothesis, it is suggested that the rock is underwater and requires colder temperatures for longer durations for the water to freeze. This situation will affect erosion in the following ways: 1. Direct effect: Since the freezing of water takes longer in colder temperatures, the formation of ice in the cracks of the rocks will also be slower. This results in less frequent expansion of the water, which in turn decreases the rate at which the rocks are subjected to pressure. Thus, the overall process of rock erosion will be slower in this scenario due to the lesser frequency of ice formation and expansion. 2. Indirect effect: With colder temperatures, the growth of plants such as mosses and lichens that grow on bare rock may be adversely affected. This is because colder temperatures might slow down or inhibit their growth, and consequently, the erosion of rock surfaces by these plant roots will be less significant. Slower plant growth also leads to fewer roots penetrating pores and crevices, which contributes to a slower rate of rock erosion. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggests a scenario where colder temperatures and longer durations for water to freeze would lead to both direct and indirect effects that cause less or slower erosion of rocks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Answer 1: What does this color mean? To provide an accurate response to the meaning behind a particular color, it's essential to have more context, such as the specific color and socio-cultural context in which it is used. However, we can discuss some general meanings that colors hold in various cultures and contexts. Colors can have different meanings across different cultures, emotions, and situations. Here's a brief overview of some colors and their general meanings: 1. Red: Red often signifies passion, energy, love, and aggression. It can also denote power, urgency, and danger. In some cultures, red is associated with good luck and prosperity. 2. Blue: Blue generally symbolizes peace, calmness, stability, and trust. It's often associated with the sky and water, evoking relaxation and serenity. It can also signify intelligence, loyalty, and wisdom. 3. Green: Green typically represents nature, growth, harmony, and fertility. It is symbolic of life and renewal, and in some cultures, it signifies luck, wealth, and ambition. 4. Yellow: Yellow is often associated with happiness, brightness, warmth, and optimism. It can also represent caution or cowardice. In some cultures, it signifies wealth, power, or royalty. 5. Purple: Purple is commonly associated with luxury, nobility, creativity, and spirituality. It has been linked to wisdom, mystery, dignity, and magic. 6. Orange: Orange symbolizes energy, excitement, warmth, and optimism. It can also stand for creativity and ambition. In some cultures, orange is associated with harvest, joy, or even danger. 7. White: White typically represents purity, innocence, peace, and simplicity. In some cultures, it symbolizes mourning, while in others, it symbolizes spirituality or renewal. 8. Black: Black is often associated with power, elegance, sophistication, and authority. It can also represent death, mourning, evil, or mystery. Answer 2: What does color mean in photography? Color in photography is an essential aspect of composition and storytelling. It can influence the mood, evoke emotions, and establish a visual relationship between different elements in a photograph. Unlike the meaning of color in general contexts discussed earlier, the meaning of color in photography does not necessarily depend on the color itself but on the way it is used in the picture. Color can have several functions in photography: 1. Mood and emotion: Colors in photography can convey the mood and emotions of the image. For instance, warm colors such as red, orange, and yellow can create a sense of warmth, passion, or energy, while cool colors like blue and green evoke calmness, serenity, or tranquility. 2. Contrast and focal points: Through the use of contrasting colors, photographers can create focal points in their images. By pairing complementary colors or using bright colors against neutral backgrounds, the photographer establishes visual interest and guides the viewer's attention to specific areas of the image. 3. Visual harmony and balance: Proper use of color can create a sense of harmony and balance in a photograph, making the image more visually appealing. By using different shades and tones of the same color, a photographer can achieve a cohesive and balanced composition. 4. Symbolism and narrative: Colors can be used symbolically in photography to convey messages, themes, or stories. For example, a photograph of a bride in a white dress tells the viewer about the purity and innocence associated with the occasion. Would the answer to these two questions be the same? The answer to both questions is not the same. The first question is related to the general meaning of color in various contexts and cultures, while the second question specifically pertains to the function and importance of color in photography. Although the emotions and symbolism behind colors are interconnected, the way color is utilized and analyzed in these two environments is different. The color meaning in a general context may offer guidance to the photographer on how to use colors, but it does not define the entire role of color in photography."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

New research from a European team of engineers sheds light on why: Though the tower’s signature lean is the result of an interaction between its foundation and the too-soft soil it stands in, that interaction has also kept it up in the most perilous of situations. A number of earthquakes have struck the Pisa region in the years since construction on the Tower began in 1173. Although historical earthquakes are a bit harder to track than modern ones, historian Romano Camassi writes that earthquake records in Italy goes back as far as the Romans. Because the country is located on multiple fault lines, earthquakes have played an important part in its history. However, none of them—including the four major earthquake events mentioned in a University of Bristol press release about this new research—caused the Leaning Tower to fall. “Ironically, the very same soil that caused the leaning instability and brought the Tower to the verge of collapse, can be credited for helping it survive these seismic events,\\" civil engineer George Mylonkanis, who was part of the study, said in the press release. Mylonkanis was one of two non-Italian members of the sixteen-person team. Neither he nor team leader Camillo Nuti of Roma Tre University could be reached for comment by press time. According to the press release, that team conducted a survey study, concluding that the tower’s height and stiffness and the softness of the ground means that, when an earthquake hits, it doesn’t vibrate the same way everything around it does. This is just the newest study of Pisa’s famous landmark. In the past 30 years, the Tower has come under renewed scrutiny. It was closed in 1990 because it was leaning too dramatically, and engineering interventions were required to return it to its signature 0.54 degree angle (while ensuring it wouldn’t fall down). Nuti has been an author on two recent studies of the tower and earthquakes. In 2016, a study published in Advances in Civil and Infrastructure Engineering concluded that monitoring the tower using sensors could provide a model for how to keep tabs on heritage buildings more generally. The region that includes Pisa features several other leaning towers, and examples can also be found in England. The companion paper concluded that new analysis of the relationship between the tower and the soil that surrounds it was important to keeping the structure standing. This might all sound like technicalities, but these towers were all built to hold church bells, and as such have heritage value as well as serving as local oddities. Studying the leaniest tower of them all offers insight into how to preserve it—as well as those sweet, sweet tourist dollars. ||||| (ANSA) - Pisa, November 21 - The legendary Leaning Tower of Pisa is stable and has slowly lost a tiny bit of its trademark tilt, a group of researchers monitoring the Tuscan monument has said. The tower lost a reported 4cm of its tilt in the past 20 years and its health is better than forecast by an international committee coordinated by Michele Jamiolkowski between 1993 and 2001, which planned and coordinated consolidation work, the surveillance group led by Salvatore Settis, Carlo Viggiani and Donato Sabia said on Tuesday. The surveillance group has been monitoring the monument for the past 17 years. Nunziante Squeglia, a professor of geotechnics at the University of Pisa who cooperates with the monitoring group, said that the tilt has decreased thanks to stabilization work, along with \\"oscillations now varying at the average of 1/2 millimeter a year, although what counts the most is the stability of the bell tower, which is better than expected\\". The group's activities, which are funded by the non-profit Opera della Primaziale Pisana, include monitoring the tower and improving the quality of conservation measures, as well as promoting research on the monument. |||||Summary:","completion":"The Leaning Tower of Pisa has a special tilt because it was built on soft soil. This tilt is not safe, but do you know what? It has helped the Tower to stay standing during earthquakes! When there's an earthquake, the soft soil and the tower's tilt help it not to shake too much, so it doesn't fall down. That's why the Leaning Tower of Pisa is still there after so many years, even though it's not straight. People have been trying to fix the tower's tilt and make it safer. They closed it in 1990 because it was leaning too much, but they made it a little straighter before opening it again. Now a team of researchers are keeping a close watch on the tower to make sure it stays safe for everyone to visit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. News article: Dressed in green prison fatigues, R. Allen Stanford entered a federal courthouse in Houston today to hear U.S. District Judge David Hitner pronounce his prison sentence. The decision: 110 years. Prosecutors had asked that the one-time billionaire financier get 230 years in prison. (note: Bernard Madoff is serving 150 years). The prosecutor told Judge Hitner, “230 years will not get anyone their money back but on sleepless nights they will know that he got the maximum.” I think 110 years will give them just as much comfort. During the proceeding, Stanford’s attorney, Ali Fazel, objected to the use of the term “Ponzi scheme,” but Hittner said the evidence at trial justified it. It’s not like Stanford could be any more insulted. The prosecutors also compared him to Bernie Madoff. That too caused Fazel to speak up on behalf of Stanford by saying of Madoff, “he didn’t invest time in anything.” Not sure what he was going for with that comment but I took it that Stanford worked harder at his fraud than did Madoff. Speaking on his own behalf, Stanford recounted his last three years, including his beating in September 2009. The best that he could say as a compliment for those who prosecuted him was, “I wouldn’t wish this on them.” While he acknowledged that he felt sorry for depositors, employees and his own family for the failure of Stanford Financial, he managed to slip in, “I’m not a thief,” and, “I never defrauded anyone.” Victims in the courtroom, all dressed in black, begged to differ. One of the victims, Jaime Escalona, who represented Latin American victims, addressed the court. Looking at Stanford he said, “You sir are a dirty, rotten, scoundrel.” The other victim spokesman, Angela Shaw of the Stanford Victims Coalition, said of Stanford, “He took our lives as we knew them.” The prison sentence represents a long fall for the once-knighted Antiguan, who has been in prison since his arrest in June 2009. Declared indigent by the court, all of Stanford’s assets were frozen and he was represented by a public defender. In March, Stanford was found guilty of running a 7 billion Ponzi scheme. However, his road to the courthouse was not without controversy. First, there was that strange interview on CNBC in which Stanford proclaimed his innocence. Then Stanford sued Lloyd’s of London, the underwriter of Stanford Financial Group’s Directors and Officers insurance, to pay for his legal fees. In the end, Lloyd’s won and Stanford got the legal help of public defenders Ali Fazel and Robert Scardino. Stanford learned that prison can be a difficult place to live. Long before being tried in court, Stanford was severely beaten by another inmate. He was hospitalized and later transferred to a federal prison medical facility in Butner, NC, as result of an addiction to anti-depressants, which he developed after the beating. The trauma, his lawyers claimed, left their client unable to remember anything. After a year’s delay in heading to trial, government psychologists determined he was faking it and set a court date. In January, just 12 days before Stanford’s trial was to begin, Fazel and Scardino wanted out of the case on the grounds that budget restrictions were hurting their ability to defend him. Prior to that, a number of supporting groups and expert witnesses for the defense said that they too wanted to quit because they were not being paid by the government. Eventually, some money was released and Stanford was off to trial. With all of this drama, there still has been no distribution of the funds that have been seized by the government to victims who had invested their savings with Stanford in the hopes of incredible returns on supposedly safe certificates of deposit. The trial and the prison sentence will bring some closure, but the restitution to investors will come up a little short. With regard to the losses for U.S. taxpayers? We will be paying for Stanford’s prison stay and his future legal fees. Stanford is planning to appeal and the court will be giving him a new public defender. Stanford’s most memorable statement was, “If I live the rest of my life in prison …. I will always be at peace with the way I conducted myself in business.” He can think about that one for a while. My thanks to Twitterers Ronnie Crocker and CNBC’s Scott Cohn, who gave us all updates during the sentencing.

Allen Stanford has been sentenced to 110 years in prison, marking the latest chapter in a case that has captivated parts of the financial world for three years. Bloomberg News The government has come down on Stanford as more than just some white-collar criminal. In a blistering sentencing proposal, prosecutors sought a life sentence of 230 years for Stanford, calling him a “ruthless predator responsible for one of the most egregious frauds in history.” Stanford, however, sought only ten years, which the government asserting he was essentially looking for “time served.” He maintains that his operations were not, in fact, a Ponzi scheme at all, given he was actually investing the money in real-estate and other properties. That left a wide gap of time and beliefs between the two sides, and the court came down at 110 years.

What's the most logical way to complete this passage? (CNN) -- As Germany continues to rise as lead survivor -- and decision-maker -- in the European Union's economic mire, the U.S. would do well to take a lesson from the country's economic model, particularly in manufacturing. Losing 4 million jobs over the past 10 years, U.S. manufacturing has hovered at roughly 12% of America's GDP, less than half its percentage in the 1950s. In Germany, however, manufacturing is well on its way toward 25% of GDP. President Barack Obama's pledge this week to lower manufacturing sector taxes to 25%, and January's U.S. manufacturing growth numbers, the highest in seven months, will certainly help stem the tide. But, clearly, a word to the wise is in order. Couple these trends with the devastating financial crisis, which hurt those whose wealth was in basic stocks and first-time home purchases -- as opposed to the wealthy who invested in insurance-backed securities, derivatives and credit default swaps -- and you've bottomed out","completion":"the American middle class. To rebuild and strengthen this vital sector, the U.S. should look to Germany's economic strategies for inspiration and guidance. One key aspect of Germany's success in manufacturing stems from its emphasis on vocational education and apprenticeship programs, which have equipped workers with specialized skills necessary to excel in the industry. By fostering a strong pipeline of skilled labor, these programs have been crucial in maintaining Germany's competitive edge in the global market. Additionally, Germany has nurtured a unique partnership between industry and academia by promoting collaboration on research and development projects. These partnerships have fostered innovation, enabling German manufacturers to maintain their status as leaders in advanced technology and high-quality products. The U.S. should encourage similar partnerships, incentivizing the country's brightest minds to work together to drive industrial advancement. Germany has also been a leader in clean energy and environmental technology, both essential to modern manufacturing's sustainability concerns. This focus on renewable resources and energy efficiency not only helps to address climate change but also opens up opportunities for job growth and economic development within the manufacturing sector. For the U.S., embracing these innovations would create a more sustainable manufacturing industry and generate new jobs in a rapidly growing sector. Lastly, the economic success of Germany's manufacturing sector can be attributed to its strong social welfare system, which provides an essential safety net for workers. This system fosters a more stable and equitable workforce, providing employees with the security they need to focus on their jobs and be more productive. The U.S. should consider implementing similar policies to support its workforce, and in turn, strengthen its manufacturing industry. In conclusion, as the U.S. seeks to revitalize its manufacturing sector and foster economic growth, it would do well to take note of Germany's success. By investing in vocational education, promoting industry-academia partnerships, embracing clean energy technology, and providing a strong social welfare system, the U.S. can forge a path toward bolstering its middle class and regaining its foothold as a global manufacturing powerhouse."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. The city of Reslie is known for its grilled cheese sandwiches. People come from all over the world to taste their sandwiches. The mayor of Reslie, while having a meeting about how to spend the excess funds from tourism this year, was told that the city is experiencing soil piping. The neighboring city, Tichago, consumes many of Reslie's grilled cheese sandwiches. The mayor of Tichago has just received a phone call from the mayor of Reslie asking if Tichago is also having soil piping. Tichago's mayor replies that no, they are not. Which city will need to inspect their dams more often? Hint: Soil piping is a particular form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface. It causes levee and dam failure, as well as sink hole formation. Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient. The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.Soil salination is the accumulation of free salts to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. Irrigation of arid lands is especially problematic. All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying water table. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the capillary fringe of saline groundwater. Soil salinity control involves watertable control and flushing with higher levels of applied water in combination with tile drainage or another form of subsurface drainage. Answer:","completion":"The city of Reslie will need to inspect their dams more often. This is because they are experiencing soil piping, which is a form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface and can cause levee and dam failure, as well as sinkhole formation.

Debt cancellation, a practice by which lenders either partially or fully forgive the outstanding debts owed by borrowing countries, has been used as a form of development aid for countries struggling with high levels of debt. However, there has been a growing call to reassess how this type of debt relief is categorized within the broader framework of official development assistance (ODA). Critics argue that, by including debt cancellation as a component of ODA, it can artificially inflate the perceived level of aid being provided to countries in need. They point out that debt relief, while helpful to ease the debt burden on struggling nations, is not the same as providing direct financial support for development initiatives like healthcare, education, infrastructure, and measures to combat poverty. Simply cancelling a debt does not directly translate to new resources available for developmental projects. There is a demand for a more transparent and accountable system to track developmental aid, and distinguish it from debt cancellation. This would allow for better assessment of how much actual funding is directed towards addressing developmental issues, rather than merely keeping a country solvent. Such a shift in categorization might also encourage more practical and targeted actions to improve welfare in developing countries, as it puts the focus on creating sustainable solutions rather than relying on debt cancellation as a catch-all solution. Moreover, changing the way debt relief is treated in the public development aid domain could promote responsible borrowing and lending practices. By not counting debt cancellation as part of ODA, it may incentivize governments in borrowing countries to avoid excessive debts and manage their finances more efficiently. Simultaneously, it could encourage lenders to be more cautious in extending loans to high-risk nations. In summary, the assertion that debt cancellation should no longer be seen as an integral part of public development aid is based on the need for a more transparent, accountable, and targeted approach to supporting development initiatives in struggling countries. By treating debt relief as a separate entity from ODA, it is believed that there can be better assessment and tracking of the actual aid provided, ultimately encouraging more impactful and sustainable actions to improve the welfare of those in need."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For the first time since the 1998 season, Peyton Manning was not under the helm at quarterback and it was recently acquired Kerry Collins that would take his position. The game started very well for the Colts, opening up with an interception by Melvin Bullitt that allowed the Colts to take control. However, a three and out from the offense quickly gave the Texans the ball to drive down and score a field goal and take a 3-0 lead. Collins and the Colts offense was out of sync for much of the first quarter, fumbling two snaps and giving Houston the great field position inside of the Indianapolis 40-yard line. After the first quarter, the Texans held a commanding 17-0 lead and were firing on all cylinders.

Answer the following question: Information: - Virarajendra Chola (10631070 CE) was one of the most underrated Chola kings, mainly because a major part of his life was spent as a subordinate of his two elder brothers Rajadhiraja Chola I and Rajendra Chola II, who along with Virarajendra Chola himself were the illustrious sons of their Chakravarti(Emperor) father, Rajendra Chola I. While certainly it was not a practice among the Chola kings to nominate the eldest son, but the most capable (in administration of their domains as well as proving their mettle on the battlefield) as the heir to the throne. During his early reign he granted the maintenance of a school to study the Vedas, Sastras and Grammar and a hostel was provided for the students. A hospital named Virasolan was also provided by him for the sick people. The famous grammatical work in Tamil, Virasoliyam was written by Buddhamitra during his reign. - Rajendra Chola II reigned as the Chola king succeeding his elder brother Rajadhiraja Chola in the 11th century. He is best remembered for his role in the battle of Koppam along with his elder brother where he dramatically turned the tables on the Chalukyan King Someshvara I, after the death of his brother in 1052. During his early reign an expedition was led to Sri Lanka, in the course of which the Sri Lanka army was routed and their king Vijayabahu I of Polonnaruwa was driven to take refuge in a mountain-fortress. He maintained the Chola Empire well as the distribution of his records show that the Chola Empire did not suffer any loss of territory during his reign. - Rajendra Chola I or Rajendra I was a Chola emperor who is considered one of the greatest rulers and military generals of India. He succeeded his father Rajaraja Chola I in 1014 CE. During his reign, he extended the influence of the Chola empire to the banks of the river Ganga in North India and across the Indian ocean to the West, making the Chola Empire one of the most powerful empires of India. Rajendras conquests included the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Sri Lanka, Maldives, and he successfully invaded and raided the territories of Srivijaya in Malaysia, Southern Thailand and Indonesia in South East Asia. The Cholas exacted tribute from Thailand and the Khmer kingdom of Cambodia. He defeated Mahipala, the Pala king of Bengal and Bihar, and to commemorate his victory he built a new capital city called Gangaikonda Cholapuram. - Kpparaksarivarman Rjdhiraja Chla I was an 11th-century emperor of the Indian Chola empire and the successor of his father, Rajendra Chola I. During his long reign, he helped his father conquer many territories and maintained the Chola authority over most of Lanka, Vengi, Kalinga, etc. and the relations with overseas domains despite a series of revolts in the territory. Rajadhiraja Cholas record shows that he was a born fighter who was very capable of maintaining a vast and expansive empire with territories even outside the shores of India. He was a great warrior who always led from the front. His life is a testimony to a king who fought his own wars standing shoulder to shoulder with his men on front lines. He performed the horse sacrifice and earned the title \\"Jayamkonda Cholan\\" (The Victorious Cholan). He was also known as \\"Vijaya Rajendra Cholan\\" (the victorious Rajendra Cholan). One of his predecessors, Rajaraja Chola I also assumed the title Jayangonda Chola towards the \\"end\\" of his reign. - Athirajendra Chola ( 1070 CE ) reigned for a very short period of few months as the Chola king succeeding his father Virarajendra Chola . His reign was marked by civil unrest , possibly religious in nature , in which he was killed . The Chalukya Chola prince Rajiga succeeded him as Kulothunga Chola I.

He made more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. During the 1950s and 1960s Decca had an alliance with RCA Victor, and some of Solti's recordings were first issued on the RCA label.Solti was one of the first conductors who came to international fame as a recording artist before being widely known in the concert hall or opera house. Gordon Parry, the Decca engineer who worked with Solti and Culshaw on the Ring recordings, observed, \\"Many people have said 'Oh well, of course John Culshaw made Solti.' This is not true. He gave him the opportunity to show what he could do.\\"Solti's first recordings were as a piano accompanist, playing at sessions in Zurich for the violinist Georg Kulenkampff in 1947. Decca's senior producer, Victor Olof did not much admire Solti as a conductor (nor did Walter Legge, Olof's opposite number at EMI's Columbia Records), but Olof's younger colleague and successor, Culshaw, held Solti in high regard. As Culshaw, and later James Walker, produced his recordings, Solti's career as a recording artist flourished from the mid-1950s. Among the orchestras with whom Solti recorded were the Berlin Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, London Philharmonic, London Symphony and Vienna Philharmonic orchestras. Soloists in his operatic recordings included Birgit Nilsson, Joan Sutherland, Régine Crespin, Plácido Domingo, Gottlob Frick, Carlo Bergonzi, Kiri Te Kanawa and José van Dam. In concerto recordings, Solti conducted for, among others, András Schiff, Julius Katchen, Clifford Curzon, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Kyung-wha Chung.Solti's most celebrated recording was Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen made in Vienna, produced by Culshaw, between 1958 and 1965. It has twice been voted the greatest recording ever made, the first poll being among readers of Gramophone magazine in 1999, and the second of professional music critics in 2011, for the BBC's Music Magazine.

Sadly, the weather has been pretty gray and rainy so far – in fact the forecast has it cloudy and rainy every day until after we leave. So I was pleasantly surprised to be awakened by the sun peeking around the edges of the curtain in my room, especially after the weather yesterday in which the wind gusted 35-40 mph – hard enough to blow the patio furniture around on my balcony (and at one point, catching a chair and flipping it against the rail so hard that if the rail had been just a bit shorter, it might have gone over). Our group all agreed that we should take advantage of the nice weather and head to the old city walls and St. Lawrence Fort (Lovrijenac). We spent several hours walking the walls and climbing up and down stairs. The sun sparkled off the Adriatic Sea and cast a warm glow on the orange and red tiled roofs in old city. It was such a change from the gray and foggy gloom of the last couple of days and it created a completely different mood, at least for me. From foreboding and dark to welcoming and bright. The clouds eventually rolled back in again, but the sunshine was nice while it lasted. We walked over to the fort and I took these shots of the city wall and from across the small cove between them. If you look closely in a few shots, you’ll see a stone pier, which is just between the Pile Gate (pronounced “peel-ay”) at the city walls and the fort.

Step 2: Assess whether the provided protection is coming from the change itself. We see that protection is provided by an external source (indicated by \\"we shall shield you\\") until the change occurs. After the change has taken place, there is no mention of protection being required or offered. Step 3: Form a conclusion based on the analysis. From our analysis, it appears that the protection is externally provided until the change happens, and the change's occurrence is dependent on external factors.

Just be sure emails are sent to a private, personal email and never through a work or school platform. Since you don't get to see them in person, the second best thing to do is to send them pictures of you. Send them pictures via email and also via text message, or you could even send developed copies via snail mail. Send a variety of pictures. Some should be loving, smiling shots, but don't forget to throw in a few naughty ones as well. When sending pictures keep in mind of potential consequences of them falling in the wrong hands. Try to minimize this possibility by securing both your phones and preventing others from accessing sensitive content. Use snail mail to your advantage. Don't forget the power of snail mail and the lasting effect of an intimate handwritten letter sprayed with your favorite perfume or aftershave. Fill your letter with all your deepest darkest secrets of what you want to do with them, then give it a spritz of perfume, cologne, aftershave, etc. so that they can inhale your scent while reading.

In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished.

Given that Dwight has significantly more testosterone than Jimothy, it is likely that he is at a more advanced stage in his puberty. Since growth spurts usually last for several years during puberty, it is probable that Dwight started his growth spurt earlier than Jimothy, considering their age difference. So, it is likely that Dwight will finish his growth spurt before Jimothy, since he has already progressed further into puberty and has a higher level of testosterone. However, it is important to note that individual growth patterns can vary, and factors like genetics, nutrition, and overall health can also influence growth.

Question: suppose lava flows into ocean happens, how will it affect more proteins available. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"When lava flows into the ocean, it can cause changes in the marine ecosystem by influencing the temperature and acidity of the water, as well as potentially releasing harmful substances. However, this event is unlikely to have a direct effect on the liver's function in producing more proteins. The liver's function of producing proteins for blood plasma is a complex process that is regulated by various factors. Lava flowing into an ocean does not have a direct impact on these factors, so it should not affect the liver's ability to produce proteins. As for the second effect mentioned, the liver's production of bile, it is also an independent process that is regulated within the body. The entry of lava into an ocean would not have a direct impact on this process either. Therefore, considering the steps involved in the liver's functions along with the impact of lava flowing into an ocean, there would be no effect on the liver's ability to produce more proteins or on the production of bile."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: suppose the bat makes sound waves towards objects happens, how will it affect \\"the bat wont hit any objects\\". How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","completion":"Echolocation is an incredible system utilized by bats to navigate, hunt, and avoid obstacles in their environment. The process outlined describes the key steps in echolocation, which allow bats to accurately discern their environment in order to navigate efficiently without collisions. It is through this series of events that the bat can effectively locate any objects in its path. Suppose a perturbation occurs, such as the bat making sound waves towards objects. This perturbation would actually not affect the bat's ability to avoid hitting objects; in fact, it would enhance it. By emitting more sound waves, the bat would be increasing the chances of receiving valuable information about the location and distance of any objects in its environment. If a bat emits more sound waves, several outcomes can result: 1. More objects are detected: By making more sound waves, the bat increases the likelihood of the signals hitting a variety of objects and reflecting back towards the bat. This means that the bat can receive more information about its surroundings, leading to a greater ability to avoid objects in its path. 2. Greater precision: With more sound waves bouncing off objects, the bat can collect additional data points about the location, size, and shape of the objects. This increased precision can contribute to the bat's ability to avoid hitting any objects. 3. Faster response time: Emitting more sound waves allows the bat to update its mental map of its environment more frequently. This means that the bat can react more quickly to changes in its surroundings and adjust its flight accordingly, thus reducing the risk of collisions. 4. Enhanced adaptation: In the event that objects are suddenly introduced or the environment changes, emitting more sound waves can help the bat more rapidly adapt and continue to navigate effectively. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of a bat emitting more sound waves towards objects would not negatively affect the bat's ability to avoid hitting objects. Instead, it would improve the bat's echolocation capabilities by providing more information about its surroundings, increasing precision, and enhancing adaptation. Ultimately, this perturbation would have a positive effect on the bat's navigation abilities and further reduce the likelihood of it hitting objects in its environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(Associated Press) The volcano erupted Wednesday afternoon for the first time in more than four decades, spewing out a plume of ash more than 6 miles (10 kilometers) high. Emergency officials were taken by surprise and had only a few minutes to issue an alert. Calbuco had another spectacular outburst early Thursday with lightning crackling through a dark sky turned reddish orange by the explosion. As the ash cloud spread Wednesday, \\"people went into a state of panic,\\" said Miguel Silva Diaz, an engineer who lives in Puerto Montt, a city about 14 miles (22 kilometers) from the volcano. \\"Then, at around 1 a.m., I heard a loud noise, as if somebody had detonated an atomic bomb.\\" No injuries were reported and the only person reported missing since the eruption was located Thursday. Authorities evacuated 4,000 people as gas and ash continued to spew, and they closed access to the area around the volcano, which lies near the cities of Puerto Varas and Puerto Montt, some 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) south of Santiago. \\"I was shocked. I had just arrived home when I looked through the window and saw the column of smoke rising up. We called our families, posted photos,\\" said Daniel Palma, a psychologist who lives in Puerto Varas. \\"We woke up today with a blanket of fog and it hasn't cleared. We have a layer of smoke above us,\\" Palma said, adding that many were concerned about the possible effects of the ash on their health. The Chilean national geology and mining service warned that people should prepare for a third and \\"even more aggressive eruption.\\" President Michelle Bachelet declared a state of emergency, saying the eruption of Calbuco was \\"more serious and unpredictable\\" than the one last month at the Villarica volcano, which also forced the evacuation of thousands. \\"We don't have any problems with supplies, water or sewage up to now. That's not the problem,\\" said Bachelet, who visited the area Thursday. \\"Our problem is a respiratory one, from inhaling all of this ash, and the fact that this ash could generate some sort of environmental contamination.\\" The short-term dangers related to the ash also include eye and skin infections as well as water contamination, said Bernardo Martorell, a physician and the head of the sanitary planning division at Chile's health ministry. \\"That's why the people in the area need to evacuate,\\" Martorell said. Ash continued to fall Thursday in Puerto Montt and other nearby cities, said Patricio Vera, director of a local radio station. Vera said that after the initial eruption, hundreds of people rushed to buy gasoline, forcing stations to ration sales, while supermarkets closed early to avoid the risk of looting. The 6,500 foot (2,000-meter) Calbuco last erupted in 1972 and is considered one of the top three most potentially dangerous among Chile's 90 active volcanos. LATAM and other airline companies cancelled flights to and from Puerto Montt because airborne ash can severely damage jet engines. In 2011, a volcano in the Caulle Cordon of southern Chile erupted violently, forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights and the evacuation of more than 3,500 people. Thick, abrasive soot coated slopes in the ski resort city of San Carlos de Bariloche, over the border in Argentina. By Thursday afternoon, much ash had made its way to Villa La Angostura, Argentina, a small town about 56 miles (90 kilometers) northeast of Calbuco. Cars and streets were coated with a thin layer of ash, but people were otherwise going about their business. \\"We are praying that the volcanic activity will be as short as possible,\\" said mayor Roberto Cacault. ___ Associated Press writer Luis Hidalgo reported this story in Puerto Montt and Luis Andres Henao reported from Santiago.

The volcano first erupted Wednesday, marking the first such activity in more than 42 years, billowing a huge ash cloud over the sparsely populated, mountainous area in southern Chile. Calbuco's second blast overnight was stronger and lasted longer A second, more powerful eruption hit around 1 a.m. Thursday, creating swarms of lightning storms. Stunning photos captured the phenomenon, known as “dirty thunderstorms,” which illuminated the night sky. The eruption rained down as much as 15 to 20 inches of ash in the nearby town of Ensenada, officials said, closing schools and canceling flights. Several surrounding towns, including Alerce, Colonia Rio Sur and Correntos, were also evacuated. About 7 p.m. local time, two earthquakes associated with fracturing of rock occurred. The largest happened less than 3 miles east of the main crater, with a magnitude of 3, officials said in a 9 p.m. update. An additional \\"minor\\" eruption is possible, officials said. ALSO: Five years after BP spill, new rules for offshore drilling aim to boost safety The volcano could erupt again, possibly within hours, officials say The country’s National Service of Geology and Mining said Thursday that the region remains on red alert, meaning there could be a third eruption within hours. President Michelle Bachelet has warned the volcano could soon emit lava. About 5,000 residents were evacuated, and towns within a 13-mile radius of the volcano were declared \\"exclusion zones.\\" No injuries or deaths were reported. A mountain climber reported missing earlier had been found, officials said. A government spokeswoman identified the hiker as 21-year-old Waldo Flores.

Given the question: Information: - Air Chief Marshal Sir David George Evans GCB , CBE ( born 14 July 1924 ) is a retired senior commander of the Royal Air Force . - The Battle of Britain (German: \\"die Luftschlacht um England\\", literally \\"Air battle for England\\") was a combat of the Second World War, when the Royal Air Force (RAF) defended the United Kingdom (UK) against the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) attacks from the end of June 1940. It is described as the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces. The British officially recognise its duration as from 10 July until 31 October 1940 that overlaps with the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, while German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard it as a campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941. - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain. - Air chief marshal (Air Chf Mshl or ACM) is a four-star air officer rank which originated in and continues to be used by the Royal Air Force, where it is the most senior peacetime air force rank. The rank is also used by the air forces of many countries that have historical British influence and it is sometimes used as the English translation of an equivalent rank in countries which have a non-English air force-specific rank structure. Air chief marshal is a four-star air officer rank and has a NATO ranking code of OF-9. An air chief marshal is equivalent to an admiral in the Royal Navy or a General in the British Army or the Royal Marines. In other forces, such as the United States Armed Forces and the Canadian Armed Forces, the equivalent four-star rank is General. - The Central Powers , consisting of Germany, , the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria hence also known as the Quadruple Alliance was one of the two main factions during World War I (191418).

The term itself is controversial and has divergent definitions in popular culture and in academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. The word \\"cult\\" has always been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, used as an \\"ad hominem\\" attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices.

Question: \\"What did Antarctica and Australia do during the Eocene period?\\" Context: \\"During the Eocene (56 million years ago - 33.9 million years ago), the continents continued to drift toward their present positions. At the beginning of the period, Australia and Antarctica remained connected, and warm equatorial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters, distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high. But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 Ma, the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica, and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents. The Antarctic region cooled down, and the ocean surrounding Antarctica began to freeze, sending cold water and ice floes north, reinforcing the cooling. The present pattern of ice ages began about 40 million years ago.[citation needed]\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"During the Eocene period, which lasted from approximately 56 million years ago to 33.9 million years ago, the continents continued to drift toward their present positions. At the beginning of this period, Australia and Antarctica were still connected. Warm equatorial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters, distributing heat around the globe and maintaining high global temperatures. Around 45 million years ago, Australia separated from Antarctica, causing the warm equatorial currents to be deflected away from the southern continent. As a result, an isolated cold water channel developed between Australia and Antarctica. This led to a significant cooling of the Antarctic region, with the ocean surrounding Antarctica beginning to freeze, displacing cold water and ice floes northward and further reinforcing the cooling effect. The current pattern of ice ages we are familiar with today began approximately 40 million years ago because of these events. The separation of Australia and Antarctica during the Eocene period played a crucial role in shaping the Earth's climate and the development of ice ages, by altering the flow of ocean currents and contributing to the cooling of the Antarctic region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Imagine that the genome is a book.The book consists of 23 chapters with thousands of stories made up of paragraphs, words and letters on different levels.There are one billion words in the book, as long as 800 Bibles; if I read the genome out to you at the rate of one word per second for eight hours a day, it would take me centuries; if I wrote out the human genome, one letter per millimeter, my text would be as long as the River Danube.This is a huge volume, a book of great length, but it all fits inside an extremely small cell nuclear that fits easily upon the head of a pin. The idea of the genome as a book is not, strictly speaking, even a metaphor.It is true to a great extent.A book is a piece of digital information, written in one-directional form and defined by a code that translates a small alphabet of signs into a large dictionary of meanings through the order of their groupings.So is a genome.The only difference is that all English books read from left to right, while some parts of the genome read from left to right while some from right to left, but never both at the same time. While English books are written in words of different lengthens using twenty-six letters, genomes are written entirely in words of three-letter length, using only four letters, and instead of being written on flat pages, they are written on long chains of DNA molecules .

What is the answer for the question: What was the first name of King George III's 19-year-old queen? from the following article ? The Mozarts' first London lodgings were above a barber's shop in Cecil Court, near St Martin-in-the-Fields. Letters of introduction from Paris proved effective; on 27 April 1764, four days after their arrival, the children were playing before King George III and his 19-year-old German queen, Charlotte Sophia. A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \\"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\\".Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th. This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June, at Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens. Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as \\"a way to earn the love of this very special nation\\". Wolfgang was advertised as \\"the celebrated and astonishing Master Mozart, a Child of Seven Years of Age...\\" (he was in fact eight), \\"justly esteemed the most extraordinary Prodigy, and most amazing Genius, that has appeared in any Age\\". On 8 July there was a private performance at the Grosvenor Square home of the Earl of Thanet, from which Leopold returned with an inflammation of the throat and other worrying symptoms. \\"Prepare your heart to hear one of the saddest events\\", he wrote to Hagenauer in anticipation of his own imminent demise. He was ill for several weeks, and for the sake of his health the family moved from their Cecil Court lodgings to a house in the countryside, at 180 Ebury Street, then considered part of the village of Chelsea.","completion":"The first name of King George III's 19-year-old queen mentioned in the article is Charlotte.

The injury bug would later notably strike first-round draft pick Hakeem Nicks, who suffered a sprained foot in the fourth quarter and was carted off the field. Wide receiver Mario Manningham caught the game's first touchdown in the second quarter; the 30-yard strike was worth more yardage than Manningham had totalled in the entire 2008 season.

UPDATED:. 11:11 EST, 26 June 2012. David Cameron's spin doctor helped his celebrity wife run an 'avoidance' scheme that may have diverted thousands away from the tax man, it was claimed today. Craig Oliver's partner, BBC news presenter Joanna Gosling, could have pocketed an extra £22,000 a year by being paid through a private company the pair set up, according to newspaper reports. It comes just days after the Prime Minister declared comedian Jimmy Carr 'morally wrong' for putting millions in an offshore tax dodging scheme. But it appears one of his closest aides helped his wife to run a company for several years that may have reduced the tax she paid on her estimated £150,000-a-year earnings. Claims: The Daily Mirror has said a business set up to handle BBC presenter Joanna Gosling's pay was an 'avoidance' scheme. 'It is total hypocrisy and Craig Oliver should stay out of Downing Street until it is sorted out,' Labour MP John Mann told the Mirror last night. 'The Jimmy Carr publicity stunt has clearly come back to haunt the Prime Minister.' Mr Oliver, who is a former senior BBC executive, ran Paya Limited with Ms Gosling to handle her earnings. He was paid £2,999.97 to be secretary. Star: Top presenter Joanna Gosling, pictured on BBC Breakfast in a controversial short skirt, may have saved thousands by being paid through a company. The TV presenter hit the headlines herself recently after wearing a short skirt to work on the BBC Breakfast sofa. Classed as a 'TV and journalism' company, they were helped by accountant Nicholas Ridge, who says he helps TV producers 'make sure their tax bills are kept as low as possible'. Figures from Companies House seen by MailOnline show that around £150,000 a year was funnelled into Paya. If Ms Gosling had earned the cash via PAYE she would have paid around £52,000 a year in income tax and national insurance, according to the Mirror. But paying herself via a company would have allowed her to cut this to as little as £29,800, making a tax saving of up to £22,000 a year, the paper claims. These are based on figures to 2008, when the company changed the type of return it sent to Companies House. Last year Mr Oliver quit as Paya's secretary after details of the company emerged, not long after Mr Cameron's previous spin doctor and former News of the World editor Andy Coulson resigned over the hacking scandal. Mr Oliver was also in the news last. month after he was filmed giving BBC political correspondent Norman. Smith a dressing down over his coverage of the Leveson Inquiry. A source close to Mr Oliver told MailOnline today: ‘There was never any tax saving motive. It was a condition of employment by the BBC. Couple: No.10 spin doctor Craig Oliver, left,. was secretary of his wife Joanna Gosling's company, and it s has been claimed today this business would have allowed her to avoid up to £22,000 a year in tax. ‘Joanna does not have a staff job and. as a freelance presenter you are told to make this arrangement. Freelance presenters do not got maternity pay or pension benefits or. sick pay. ‘Claims about the benefits have been wildly exaggerated.’ The. BBC was last month under intense pressure to reveal how many of its. stars are channelling their pay through private companies. MPs. accused the corporation of paying senior figures ‘off-payroll’ –. meaning they can potentially cut their tax bills by thousands of pounds a. year. Replacement: Mr Oliver came into Downing Street after Andy Coulson, pictured with David Cameron, quit because of the hacking scandal. Row: Head of Communications Craig Oliver was inadvertently caught on camera berating a BBC correspondent, Norman Smith, outside No. 10 Downing St last month. Danny Alexander, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, revealed that more than 2,400 civil servants have been paid through a private company. This means they can pay the corporation tax rate of 21 per cent, rather than higher rates of income tax. But, to the fury of MPs, he said he was unable to provide similar information about public servants who work for local councils and the BBC, because they are not controlled by central government. Probe: Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander is investigating how many civil servants are avoiding tax but cannot look into the BBC's affairs. The corporation has said it pays ‘up to 3,000’ actors, editors, make-up artists and other ‘craft staff’ through service companies. Of these, 36 earn more than £100,000. But it refused to reveal how many top presenters and other talent are paid this way. In the past it has been reported that household names including Newsnight presenters Jeremy Paxman, Emily Maitlis and Gavin Esler as well as BBC News stars Sophie Raworth and Fiona Bruce have set up companies to channel their earnings, because they are on freelance contracts. This allows some high profile presenters to off-set expenses against tax, therefore dramatically boosting their net income. The corporation flatly refuses to give concrete numbers of those paid in this way, saying it was ‘commercially sensitive’ and would breach data protection laws. Mr Alexander told MPs: ‘The review could not include either local government or the BBC, who are not under the direct control of central government.' Mr Oliver is away in Mexico with the PM and declined to comment but a source close to him said his wife had not made huge savings from the company. A BBC spokesman said: 'There is no fixed rule that requires presenters to be self-employed. It wil depend on her role. But if they are then the BBC requires them to do this through a service company. This is in order to ensure they are responsible for their tax affairs. It is not done to avoid tax.'

Plot title: Tideland Movie plot: Tideland centers on an abandoned child, Jeliza-Rose, and her solitary adventures during one summer in rural Texas while staying at a rundown farmhouse called What Rocks, and focuses on the increasingly dark, imaginative fantasy life the girl creates with the aid of dismembered Barbie doll heads that she often wears on her fingertips. With names such as Mystique, Sateen Lips, Baby Blonde and Glitter Gal, the doll heads not only engage in long conversations with Jeliza-Rose, reflecting different aspects of the girl's psyche, but also act as her companions while she explores the barren Texas landscape. After her mother chokes to death, Jeliza-Rose and her father, Noah, flee to Noah's mother's home, a remote Texas farmhouse. Noah fears that with all the drugs in their house he will lose Jeliza-Rose and be sent to prison, so he attempts to set it alight before they leave, although Jeliza-Rose manages to stop him. They find the farmhouse abandoned, but they settle in anyway. Their first night there, Noah dies from a heroin overdose. For much of the rest of the film, Noah's corpse remains seated upright in a living room chair with sunglasses covering his eyes. As her father slowly begins to decompose, Jeliza-Rose doesn't readily acknowledge his death because she has grown accustomed to him being unconscious for long periods at a time. Instead, she retreats deeper and deeper into her own mind, exploring the tall grass around the farmhouse, relying on her doll heads for friendship as an unconscious way of keeping herself from feeling too lonely and afraid. During Jeliza-Rose's wanderings, she eventually encounters and befriends her neighbors, a mentally impaired young man called Dickens and his older sister Dell who is blind in one eye from a bee sting. At this point the story begins to unfold, revealing a past connection between Dell and Jeliza-Rose's deceased father.

I am not talking about if accounting messes up and you have to wait an extra day or two to get paid. If you are a good employer, I won’t be happy, but I am understanding. I am talking refusing to pay or being even rumored to be not paying. I am not in the volunteer business for business owners. Only happened once… I thought I had a part timer gig being a waiter at an over-priced tourist trap restaurant in the New Orleans French Quarter. As typical for these type of jobs, you do not get to actually wait tables and get tips till a training period is over. Somehow, I did not get the memo that this place did not have “training” but “auditions”, meaning all that silverware I rolled and floors I mopped and food I ran to tables I was not getting paid for! Add to that, if somehow they did not like me, after a week I would not have a job! Now, I understand actors and actresses go to auditions and not get paid all the time. I’ve known a few amateur actors. But, those auditions do not include showing up for a week to work unpaid so maybe you might get hired from talking to them… And waiters don’t do auditions! I left immediately. I think they owed me 30 bucks for half a day’s work at the minimum wage. Tried to go back threatening labor board and all that, but they would not be intimidated. They said there was no record of me being there and to get off property. I wrote it off to bad experience and started working another place that I had been interviewing with. Much better job.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: In our culture, the sources of what we call a sense of \\"mastery\\" - feeling important and worthwhile - and the sources of what we call a sense of \\"pleasure\\" - finding life enjoyable - are not always the same. Women often are told \\"You can't have it all.\\" Sometimes what the speaker really is saying is: \\"You chose a career, so you can't expect to have closer relationships or a happy family life.\\" or \\"You have a wonderful husband and children--What's all this about wanting a career?\\" But women need to understand and develop both aspects of well-being, if they are to feel good about themselves. Our study shows that, for women, well-being has two dimensions. One is mastery, which includes self-esteem, a sense of control over your life, and low levels of anxiety and depression. Mastery is closely related to the \\"doing\\" side of life, to work and activity. Pleasure is the other dimensions, and it is composed of happiness, satisfaction and optimism. It is tied more closely to the \\"feeling\\" side of life. The two are independent of each other. A woman could be high in mastery and low in pleasure, and vice versa . For example, a woman who has a good job, but whose mother has just died, might be feeling very good about herself and in control of her work life, but the pleasure side could be damaged for a time. The concepts of mastery and pleasure can help us identify the sources of well-being for women, and remedy past mistakes. In the past, women were encouraged to look only at the feeling side of life as the source of all well-being. But we know that both mastery and pleasure are critical. And mastery seems to be achieved largely through work. In our study, all the groups of employed women rated significantly higher in mastery than did women who were not employed. A woman's well-being is enhanced when she takes on multiple roles. At least by middle adulthood, the women who were involved in a combination of roles-marriages, motherhood, and employment were the highest in well-being, despite warnings about stress and strain.

Dynegy-Enron Deal Faces Significant Reg Review By Bryan Lee 11/08/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Any merger deal that may emerge between Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and Enron Corp. (ENE) will face a complicated and time-consuming regulatory-review process, legal experts said Thursday. Any equity deal would require approvals from numerous U.S. federal regulatory agencies and state utility regulators, as well as survive Canadian and European antitrust reviews, energy attorneys contacted by Dow Jones Newswires said. A merger would require approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission. And the Illinois Commerce Commission likely would weigh into the mix, since Dynegy owns Illinova's Illinois Power Co. Any effort to strike a deal quickly also could be complicated by Enron's ownership of Portland General Electric Co. While Enron has entered into an agreement to sell the utility to Northwest Natural Gas Co. (NWN), a previous attempt to sell the company fell through because of regulatory complications. A key issue for federal regulators scrutinizing a potential Enron-Dynegy merger will be the degree of electricity market concentration such a transaction would entail, the attorneys said. Financially wounded Enron is the nation's largest electricity and natural gas trader with an extensive network of gas pipelines. Dynegy is ranked sixth nationally in both electricity and natural gas marketing. The transaction would receive the greatest scrutiny at FERC, where the merger application would challenge the commission's merger-review policy, attorneys said. Racing Against The Liquidity Clock \\"Enron is a complicated beast,\\" and an acquisition by Dynegy likely would \\"stretch FERC's limits of market-power review,\\" one legal expert said. The primary question the commission will consider is whether combining the companies will increase market concentration in wholesale power markets to an unacceptable level. Also, FERC is in the process of changing the basis upon which it authorizes electricity sales at market-based rates, which could pose complications for a combined Enron-Dynegy down the road. According to Platts Power Markets Week, Enron's market share in competitive power markets is nearly 15%, while Dynegy's is pushing 5%. That makes the combined market share perilously close to the 20% threshold of concern under antitrust review. But FERC will undertake a more complicated analysis than that, looking at both vertical and horizontal market power, attorneys said. On a horizontal basis, there likely won't be much concern at FERC. Enron owns few hard generating assets compared to Dynegy, although FERC will scrutinize generation assets that Enron doesn't own but controls the output of on a contractual basis. It is in the vertical market power analysis where FERC's merger review gets truly complicated. The commission will assess to what degree the combination of Enron's pipelines - including one that controls 23% of natural gas imported from Canada - and Dynegy's portfolio of electric generation assets present competitive concerns. While Dynegy's pipeline holdings are far smaller than Enron's, it does have some upstream natural gas processing and gathering assets that FERC could view as problematic. Never before has FERC encountered a vertical market power analysis of such scale and scope before, legal experts agreed. Another aspect of the deal that will interest FERC, according to one attorney, is Enron's Internet-based trading platform, EnronOnline, through which 25% of wholesale power sales are traded. FERC has traditionally only looked at hard assets, but in recent weeks has indicated it intends to take a harder look at financial assets when considering market power issues. But even if FERC doesn't take on the issue, the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission certainly will when considering the antitrust aspects of the combination. \\"These two companies are huge commodity traders. Oftentimes they're trading in commodities that have nothing to do with energy,\\" noted one attorney. Antitrust agencies will scrutinize whether the combination could present market power concerns for nonenergy-related commodities as well as electricity and natural gas. As if the complicated market-power reviews by FERC and antitrust agencies weren't enough, the deal also must pass muster at the Securities and Exchange Commission under the 1935 Public Utility Holding Company Act. The Depression-era law restricts the geographic scope and nonenergy business holdings of multistate utility holding companies. Dynegy is an exempt holding company under the act, since its utility holding is confined to one state. It would have to register under the law and potentially divest assets to garner SEC approval as long as Enron still holds Portland General Electric, attorneys agreed. The SEC review also is complicated by the 26% stake in Dynegy held by ChevronTexaco (CVX). That investment was structured in a highly complex manner to avoid triggering regulation under the 1935 holding company act, according to a lawyer familiar with the deal. Dynegy could structure the deal in several different ways in order to sidestep holding company act restrictions, according to a leading legal expert on the law. Dynegy could take nonvoting or preferred stock with conversion rights contingent on Enron's selling the Oregon utility, the attorney said. \\"There are ways to structure it short of a stock-for-stock deal, which is what most people think about.\\" Given the race against the clock driven by Enron's increasingly perilous liquidity crunch, such an investment sidestepping regulatory review may be the way the companies have to go in the near term. \\"It's a run on the bank,\\" the holding company act expert said. A Wall Street analyst suggested that, given Enron's predominance in energy markets, concerned Washington regulators and politicians may choose to expedite the deal. \\"Enron going down on the verge of winter is not a good thing,\\" the analyst said. \\"They may be more lenient if they can put a frigging tourniquet on Enron.\\"","completion":"Subject Line: Dynegy-Enron Merger: Regulatory Challenges and Complex Review Process Ahead"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: The Norwegian government is doing its best to keep the oil industry under control. A new law limits exploration to an area south of the southern end of the long coastline; production limits have been laid down(though these have already been raised) ; and oil companies have not been allowed to employ more than a limited number of foreign workers. But the oil industry has a way of getting over such problems, and few people believe that the government will be able to hold things back for long. Ever since the war, the government has been carrying out a program of development in the area north of the Arctic Circle. For the past few years this program has had a great deal of success: Torso has been built up into a local capital with a university, a large hospital and a healthy industry. But the oil industry has already started to draw people south, and within a few years the whole northern city could be in ruins. The effects of the oil industry would not be limited to the north, however. With nearly 100 per cent employment, everyone can see a situation developing in which the service industries and the tourist industry will lose more of their workers to the oil industry. Some smaller industries might even disappear altogether when it becomes cheaper to buy goods from abroad. The real argument over the oil industry is its effects on the Norwegian way of life. Farmers and fishermen do not make up most of the population, but they are an important part of it because Norwegians see in them many of the qualities that they regard with pride as real Norwegians.

Hunley takes his ship, the H.L. Hunley, out in the Charleston, South Carolina harbor and it sinks with all hands. As the blockade still needs to be broken, Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard has the ship raised and puts George E. Dixon in charge. He starts looking for a crew and after some difficulty finally finds enough volunteers to man it. They practice cranking the propeller. The crew do not all get along with each other. Dixon flashes back to the Battle of Shiloh, where a gold coin given to him by his wife (who was later killed in a steamboat explosion caused by a drifting mine) deflected a bullet and saved his life. They take the ship down and sit on the bottom to see how long they can stay down and almost get stuck. The U.S. Navy is warned about the sub. The crew votes that if after an attack they are stuck on the bottom, they will open the valves, flooding the ship, rather than suffocate. They go out to attack the USS Wabash, but the attack fails. Following the warning the ship has draped metal chain netting over the side. Also the rope which was attached to the torpedo they were to release under the ship gets loose and becomes entangled in the propeller. It has to be cut loose while sailors on the Wabash shoot at the Hunley. Beauregard proposes putting the torpedo at the end of a long spar. The USS Housatonic is ordered to change its position in the harbor and always be ready to steam, meaning it cannot hang metal netting over the side. The Hunley's second in command, Lt. Alexander, is ordered to Mobile, Alabama, and a young soldier who had been volunteering to join the crew is allowed to do so. answer the following question: What is the full name of the person who is alive because a gold coin deflected a bullet?

The seal is the top predator in inshore waters and a strong population is taken as an indicator of the health of the surrounding ecosystem. The Department of the Environment's marine division monitors the seal population every year, drawing on help from volunteers and wildlife charities. Stephen Foster is one of those in charge of the work. \\"It certainly seems to have been a good season, and with the weather having been so good for the last few weeks they haven't been hit by storms,\\" he said. \\"That means there've been good conditions for the mothers to come ashore to feed them and help them grow.\\" The pups are only on shore for a matter of weeks. During this time they must put on about 2kg (4lb 6oz) of weight a day. The mothers do not feed during this time, spending all their time at sea foraging for food and protecting their pups. They can lose about 4kg (8lb 13oz) a day while that is happening. After four weeks, the pups lose their fluffy white coat and have to take to sea to fend for themselves. It will take six years for the males to develop. The females take three years to reach full maturity. They will then return to their breeding grounds to have their own pups.

Your social skills and relationships with people in college will have an influence long after you graduate. Here are some tips on developing your people skills at college. Put yourself out there and meet new people You're very likely to make some lifelong friendships at college. But before you get there you have to start by making friends. Upperclassmen and the college itself will organize events to introduce you and your peers to each other and the new college environment. For the purpose of improving your social skills early on, attend every single one. Join clubs that fit your interests. You can meet many people there and it's a safe bet that you will have something in common. Being active on social networks, such as Renren and micro blogs, is also a good way to meet people, especially if you're not so good at face-to-face conversation. Always open yourself to conversation Your chances of making new friends depends on your ability to get a friendly atmosphere across. Simple gestures, such as moving your things from a chair when someone is looking for a place in the canteen, can make you seem more open to conversation.

Atomic Kitten released the double A-side single Someone like Me/\\"Right Now 2004\\" as a \\"goodbye\\" to their fans, but were reunited on Valentine's Day 2005 to release the charity single \\"Cradle 2005\\", a new version of the original song from their album Right Now which was a number-one hit in Asia back in 2000. \\"Cradle 2005\\" peaked at number ten, selling 35,000 copies worldwide, with proceeds going to World Vision. In 2005, Atomic Kitten were featured on the soundtrack of Disney's Mulan II with the song \\"(I Wanna Be) Like Other Girls\\".

What is the answer to this question? when was the current missouri state capitol building completed?","completion":"The current Missouri State Capitol Building, located in Jefferson City, was completed in 1917. Construction of this grand structure began in 1913 after a fire destroyed the previous capitol building in 1911. The new building was designed by the architectural firm Tracy and Swartwout from New York, who had won the nationwide competition to design the new capitol. The Missouri State Capitol building sits atop a bluff overlooking the Missouri River, making it visible from various parts of Jefferson City. Spanning an area of nearly 285,000 square feet, it serves as the seat of government for the state of Missouri, housing the legislative chambers, offices for the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, state treasurer, and state auditor. The exterior of the building is constructed from high-quality Carthage limestone, which is native to Missouri, giving the structure a grand and stately appearance. The Capitol is designed in a blend of the American Renaissance and Beaux-Arts architectural styles. The building features a 238-foot high central dome adorned with a bronze statue called \\"Ceres,\\" the Roman goddess of agriculture, perched atop the dome symbolizing Missouri's prime economic activity during its early years. This statue was created by Sherry Edmundson Fry. Art and history are harmoniously integrated throughout the inside of the building. The Capitol's features include stunning murals by prominent artists such as Thomas Hart Benton, Frank Brangwyn, and N.C. Wyeth. Moreover, the building houses several historically and culturally significant artifacts, sculptures, and paintings, showcasing Missouri's rich history and heritage. Various monuments and memorials can be found on the capitol grounds, as well, such as the Soldiers and Sailors Monument, the Missouri State Veterans Memorial, and the Law Enforcement Memorial, amongst others. In addition to its primary function as the center of Missouri's government activities, the Capitol is also a popular destination for tourists and school field trips, offering a plethora of informative and educational activities exploring the state's history and government processes. In conclusion, the current Missouri State Capitol Building was completed in 1917 after four years of construction following the destruction of the previous capitol building in 1911. This massive structure serves as the heart of Missouri's government while offering both residents and visitors an opportunity to learn about the state's history and the workings of its government. The architectural design, art, and surrounding grounds all contribute to making the Missouri State Capitol a point of pride and a symbol of the state's resilience and progress."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: As time passes, the number of HIV copies keeps increasing, while the number of helper T cells keeps decreasing. The graph in Figure below shows how the number of T cells typically declines over a period of many years following the initial HIV infection. As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. As a result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections. Medicines can slow down the virus but not get rid of it, so there is no cure at present for HIV infections or AIDS. There also is no vaccine to immunize people against HIV infection, but scientists are working to develop one. and the situation: Robert and Justin are both patients in the hospital who are suffering complications from their HIV infections. The doctor is trying to get information from both men about their diseases so he can create customized treatment plans for both men. After a few questions, the doctor discovers that Robert has been infected with HIV for many years, while Justin's infection is quite recent. Answer the following question: Who will develop infections less frequently? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given background, Robert has been infected with HIV for many years, while Justin's infection is quite recent. Over time, the number of T cells in an HIV-infected person decreases, weakening their immune system and leading to more frequent infections. Since Robert has had the infection for a longer period, his T cell count is likely to be lower than Justin's. As a result, Robert's immune system would be weaker, and he will develop infections more frequently. In contrast, Justin, with a more recent infection, would have a relatively higher T cell count and a better ability to fight off infections. Therefore, Justin will develop infections less frequently than Robert."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

He waits until the last moment before he eventually lies to her, claiming that he's suffering from numerous injuries that prevent him from flying.A race is organized between the dog-sled team and the bush plane. Kodi wants his father to lead his team. Balto is not so sure, but after a little convincing from Jenna, he accepts the offer. Not long afterwards, Duke discovers Balto exploring his plane. The two become friends, for Duke knows about how Balto saved the children. The next day, the race is about to begin. Boris boasts to Balto about how he's lied to Stella, unaware that she's right behind him. She becomes very angry and manages to get him stuck in one of the mail bags, which is hoisted onto the plane.

The CIA's senior management saw problems with the armed Predator as well, problems that Clarke and even Black and Allen were inclined to minimize. One (which also applied to reconnaissance flights) was money. A Predator cost about 3 million. If the CIA flew Predators for its own reconnaissance or covert action purposes, it might be able to borrow them from the Air Force, but it was not clear that the Air Force would bear the cost if a vehicle went down. Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz took the position that the CIA should have to pay for it; the CIA disagreed. Second, Tenet in particular questioned whether he, as Director of Central Intelligence, should operate an armed Predator.\\" This was new ground,\\"he told us. Tenet ticked off key questions: What is the chain of command? Who takes the shot? Are America's leaders comfortable with the CIA doing this, going outside of normal military command and control?

Question: I read this background article the other day: In many ways, bacterial metabolism provides traits that are useful for ecological stability and for human society. One example is that some bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves. I am facing a new situation today: Brett and Scott were both studying bacteria for their exam. Scott read more about nitrogen-fixating and sulfate-reducing bacteria, while his colleague Brett read more about non-respiratory anaerobe bacteria and facultative anaerobes.

Here is a goal: how to strip kale leaves from stems Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"Stripping kale leaves from the stems can be done in several ways, depending on the tools and techniques available, as well as personal preference. The goal is to remove the nutritious leaves from the tough fibrous stems, which are often too chewy and hard to digest. Here are three common methods to accomplish this goal: 1. Using your hands (no tools required): a. Hold the kale stem with one hand, grasping it near the bottom. b. Using the other hand, firmly grasp the base of the leaf where it connects to the stem. c. While holding the stem securely, gently pull the leaf up and away from the stem with the other hand. d. The leaf should separate from the stem easily, with the leaves still intact. e. Repeat this process for the remaining leaves and stems. 2. Using a knife: a. Lay the kale leaves flat on a cutting board, with the stem-side facing up. b. Using a sharp knife (like a chef's knife), carefully slice along the edge of the stem on one side, detaching the leaf from the stem. c. Repeat this process on the other side of the stem. d. Once both sides of the stem have been cut, gently lift the stem from the cutting board, leaving only the leafy part behind. e. Repeat this process for the remaining leaves and stems. 3. Using a kitchen gadget or tool (e.g., a salad spinner): a. Place the kale leaves in the basket of a salad spinner. b. Put the salad spinner's lid on and spin the kale with moderate force. c. The centrifugal force will strip the leaves from the stems as they fly to the walls of the spinner. d. When the spinning is complete, remove the lid, and you will find the leaves separated from the stems. You can then discard the stems or use them for other purposes, such as making vegetable broth. Each of these methods has its advantages and drawbacks: -Using your hands is the simplest method, as it requires no special tools, and it is often considered the fastest overall. However, it might not work as well for people with limited strength or dexterity in their hands. -Using a knife can provide precise control over the process and is the preferred method for chefs, as it minimizes any bruising or damage to the leaves. This method may take more time than using your hands as it requires careful and precise cutting. -Using a kitchen gadget or tool can make the process more efficient, especially for large quantities of kale, but it may not remove the leaves as cleanly as the other two methods and may require an additional investment in kitchen equipment. In conclusion, the preferred method for stripping kale leaves from the stems depends on individual preferences, the tools you have available, and the time needed for the task.------+"},{"prompt":"Read the article and select the best answer.

These add-ons usually add new game areas, weapons, objects, characters and/or an extended storyline to complete an already released game. While board game expansions are typically designed by the original creator, video game developers sometimes contract out development of the expansion pack to a third-party company, (see \\"\\" for \\"Diablo\\"), it may choose to develop the expansion itself or it may do both (Ensemble Studios developed the real-time strategy game Age of Empires III and the first expansion called itself, but contracted Big Huge Games for the second expansion pack, the Asian Dynasties). Board games and tabletop RPGs may have been marketing expansions since the 1970s, and video games have been releasing expansion packs since the 1980s, early examples being the \\"Dragon Slayer\\" games \\"\\" and \\"Sorcerian\\". - Gothic II : Night of the Raven ( German : Die Nacht Des Raben ) , often abbreviated as NotR , is the official expansion pack of the German role - playing video game Gothic II.

Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing games (Including \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. Since the 1980s, Role-playing is the most commercially viable video game genre in Japan, and has more market share of any other genre in the japanese gaming industry, although in the 2010s first-person shooters and western iOS and Android games were becoming rapidly and increasingly popular in that country. - Gothic II is a role-playing video game and the sequel to \\"Gothic\\", by the German developer Piranha Bytes.

The primary difference lies in the focus of the tools/gadgets being asked about. Let's break down each question to understand the subtle distinction. 1. What are some mind-blowing outdoor gadgets tools that most people don't know about? This question broadly covers all outdoor gadgets and tools that have a \\"mind-blowing\\" quality and are not widely known. These could be technological innovations, versatile tools, or unique products that can be used for various outdoor activities like camping, hiking, gardening, or even backyard leisure. The main emphasis here is on the gadgets/tools themselves, regardless of any specific outdoor adventure context. Examples of such gadgets and tools could include: - Solar-powered chargers for smartphones and other devices - Portable camping hammocks with integrated mosquito nets - Collapsible water bottles that save space when they're empty - LED-lit beanies for hands-free nighttime illumination - Multi-tool shovels with multiple attachments for versatile use 2. What are some mind-blowing outdoor adventure tools that most people don't know about? This question narrows down the category to outdoor adventure tools, putting the emphasis on gadgets or tools that are specifically related to adventurous outdoor activities such as hiking, mountaineering, rock climbing, or extreme sports. The tools sought here would likely be more specialized and used in situations where standard outdoor gear won't suffice. Examples of these outdoor adventure tools could include: - Ultra-lightweight, mini camping stoves that can fit in your pocket - Compact, all-in-one survival kits for emergency situations in the wilderness - Climbing-specific multi-tools, such as one-handed carabiner clips with built-in blades or other features - Inflatable solar lanterns that collapse to the size of a hockey puck for backpacking - Personal water filters or purifiers that allow you to drink from any water source safely In summary, while both questions ask for lesser-known, impressive outdoor tools or gadgets, the first question takes a more general approach, encompassing all aspects of outdoor life, while the second question zeroes in on the more adventure-oriented aspect of the outdoors.

By the time Etty exhibited Musidora, the theme was becoming something of a cliche, such that by 1850 it was described by The Literary Gazette as \\"a favourite subject for a dip of the brush\\". As interest in studies of Musidora waned, its role as a pretext for nude paintings by English artists was replaced by Lady Godiva, who had become a topic of increased interest owing to Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem Godiva. After the death of William Wordsworth in 1850, James Thomson ceased to be a major influence on writers. From the 1870s his popularity with readers waned, and by the end of the 20th century his works other than Rule, Britannia! were little known.When Etty died in 1849, despite having worked and exhibited until his death, he was still regarded by many as a pornographer. Charles Robert Leslie observed shortly after Etty's death that \\"[Etty] himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\\". Interest in him declined as new movements came to characterise painting in Britain, and by the end of the 19th century the value of his paintings had fallen. It is likely that the composition and style of John Everett Millais's controversial The Knight Errant was influenced by Musidora, but other than Millais, and Etty's admirer and imitator William Edward Frost, few other artists were directly influenced by Etty's work. In 1882 Vanity Fair commented on Musidora that \\"I know only too well how the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather. I have seen the gangs of workmen strolling round, and I know that their artistic interest in studies of the nude is emphatically embarrassing.\\" By the early 20th century Victorian styles of art and literature fell dramatically out of fashion in Britain, and by 1915 the word \\"Victorian\\" had become a derogatory term. Frederick Mentone's The Human Form in Art (1944) was one of the few 20th-century academic works to favourably view Musidora.

William II (Old Norman: Williame; c. 1056 - 2 August 1100), the third son of William the Conqueror, was King of England from 1087 until 1100, with powers over Normandy, and influence in Scotland. He was less successful in extending control into Wales. William is commonly known as William Rufus (Rufus being Latin for 'the Red'), perhaps because of his red-faced appearance or, more likely, due to having red hair as a child that grew out in later life. William went hunting on 2 August 1100 in the New Forest, probably near Brockenhurst, and was killed by an arrow through the lung, though the circumstances remain unclear. The earliest statement of the event was in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which noted that the king was \\"shot by an arrow by one of his own men.\\" Later chroniclers added the name of the killer, a nobleman named Walter Tirel, although the description of events was later embroidered with other details that may or may not be true. The first mention of any location more exact than the New Forest comes from John Leland, who wrote in 1530 that William died at Thorougham, a placename that is no longer used, but that probably referred to a location on what is now Park Farm on the Beaulieu estates. The king's body was abandoned by the nobles at the place where he fell. A peasant later found it. William's younger brother, Henry, hastened to Winchester to secure the royal treasury, then to London, where he was crowned within days, before either archbishop could arrive. William of Malmesbury, in his account of William's death, stated that the body was taken to Winchester Cathedral by a few countrymen. To the chroniclers - men of the Church - such an \\"act of God\\" was a just end for a wicked king, and was regarded as a fitting demise for a ruler who came into conflict with the religious orders to which they belonged. Over the following centuries, the obvious suggestion that one of William's enemies had a hand in this event has repeatedly been made: chroniclers of the time point out themselves that Tirel was renowned as a keen bowman, and thus was unlikely to have loosed such an impetuous shot. Moreover, Bartlett says that rivalry between brothers was the pattern of political conflict in this period. William's brother Henry was among the hunting party that day and succeeded him as King. Modern scholars have reopened the question, and some have found the assassination theory credible or compelling, but the theory is not universally accepted. Barlow says that accidents were common and there is not enough hard evidence to prove murder. Bartlett notes that hunting was dangerous. Poole says the facts \\"look ugly\\" and \\"seem to suggest a plot.\\" John Gillingham points out that if Henry had planned to murder his brother it would have been in his interest to wait until a later time. It looked as though there would soon be a war between William and his elder brother Robert, which would result in one of them being eliminated, thus opening the way for Henry to acquire both England and Normandy through a single assassination. Tirel fled immediately. Henry had the most to gain by his brother's death. Indeed, Henry's actions \\"seem to be premeditated: wholly disregarding his dead brother, he rode straight for Winchester, seized the treasury (always the first act of a usurping king), and the next day had himself elected.\\" William's remains are in Winchester Cathedral, scattered among royal mortuary chests positioned on the presbytery screen, flanking the choir. His skull appears to be missing, but some long bones may remain. Ask a question about this article.","completion":"William II, also called William Rufus, was the King of England from 1087 until 1100.

Rachel and Sarah were close friends who would often take the subway together to work. They lived in a bustling city with an extensive underground subway system that connected different neighborhoods and business districts. While they both appreciated the convenience of the mass transit, they also embraced the opportunity to spend quality time together before the start of their busy days. Sarah worked in an advertising agency located just a few stops away from their shared starting point. She enjoyed her job and was content with her relatively short commute. On the other hand, Rachel recently accepted a new position at a tech company situated across town. It was an exciting opportunity for her, but it meant she had to adapt to a much longer ride on the subway. To reach her new workplace, Rachel needed to change subway lines multiple times, often waiting for trains at various intersections. The journey demanded careful planning and dedication, as being late was not an option in her new role. She began to study the subway system, learning the schedules and timings of trains, as well as alternative routes in case of unforeseen interruptions. As Rachel learned more about the intricacies of the subway system, she also gained an appreciation for the vibrant culture and exciting destinations along her new route. She discovered hidden gems of the city, such as fascinating local shops, galleries, and restaurants. Sometimes, Rachel would share her new knowledge with Sarah, and they would explore these new places together during their spare time. Despite the increased length of her commute and the challenges of navigating a complex subway system, Rachel's enthusiasm for her new job and the opportunities it brought outweighed the obstacles. And, although she missed the shorter rides and the precious time spent conversing with Sarah, she was grateful for the bond they shared and the support they provided each other through the ups and downs of life. So, in the underground, the journey Rachel undertook was not only longer but also packed with new experiences, learnings, and possibilities.

It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics. - Noise rock is a style of experimental rock rooted in noise music. The genre, which gained prominence in the 1980s, makes use of the traditional instrumentation and iconography of rock music, but incorporates atonality and especially dissonance, and frequently discards typical songwriting conventions. Noise rock developed from early avant-garde music, sound art, and rock songs featuring extremely dissonant sounds and electronic feedback. The New York no wave scene, featuring such artists as Mars and Teenage Jesus and the Jerks in the late 1970s, was an essential development in noise rock. - Memphis is a city in the southwestern corner of the U.S. state of Tennessee and the county seat of Shelby County.

After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes. I started getting very restless because I wanted to work on dinner, the sun was blazing hot and I needed to do many other things. It was coming up on 5 o’clock. He then went to his truck to write up an estimate. After 20 minutes or so he comes back and tells me it will be about 10,000 to fix our fuse box system.

The app Vine is on its deathbed, which made me think about that Vine where that kid crosses over a baby on a basketball court. Maybe you’ve forgotten about Vine :( But now you remember it. Let’s remember some other Vines: Man, remember those Vines? What Vines do you remember? ||||| With Twitter’s future still in question following failed attempts at finding an acquirer and the recently announced layoffs of nine percent of its workforce, the company today announced it’s shutting down its standalone short-form video app, Vine. According a post, nothing is changing immediately — the website and apps will remain online for the time being, and users will be given a chance to download their Vine videos ahead of its official closure. The announcement was devoid of any explanations about what led to the decision, only stating that Twitter would share more news on its blog and via its official Twitter account in the future regarding what comes next. While the plan is to wind down Vine’s operations, Twitter also says the website will remain online because the company thinks “it’s important to still be able to watch all the incredible Vines that have been made.” However, it’s unclear at this time how long the site will live on, given Twitter’s plans. In recent days, Twitter has been focusing more on its Periscope product and live streaming rather than the short looping video service Vine, which is home now to a number of creators. It even integrated live streaming into the service, offering to alert users when someone you follow goes live. It has also focused heavily on live TV, via partnerships to stream televised content with organizations like the NFL, Bloomberg and others. The team had already had a spate of departures and all three co-founders previously left. And it seems there’s still some frustration about the way Twitter has handled the product. Vine co-founder Rus Yusupov just tweeted: Don’t sell your company! — Rus (@rus) October 27, 2016 Acquired by Twitter in 2012, Vine started off strong, becoming the No. 1 app on the iTunes App Store only six months after joining the company. At one point, Vine had more than 200 million active users, yet it struggled to maintain traction and saw a decline in popularity in recent months. Competition from Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube made it difficult to stand out from the pack. According to data from App Annie, Vine has since dropped to No. 284 in the top charts for free applications on iOS, down from the low 100s at the beginning of the year. It’s still fairly well-ranked (No. 24) in the Photo & Video category, but hasn’t placed on the Entertainment apps top charts since 2015. Year-over-year worldwide downloads of the Vine app declined 55 percent in Q3 across both the Apple App Store and Google Play, according to Sensor Tower’s data. This is just the latest social media app to throw in the towel. Selfie app Shots, recently rebranded as Shots Studios and is looking to create YouTube content with former Vine stars. ||||| WARCZone is a collection of outsider-uploaded WARCs, which are contributed to the Internet Archive but may or may not be ingested into the Wayback Machine. They are being kept in this location for reference and clarity for the Wayback Team, while also being accessible to the general public who are seeking any particular items they can regarding certain websites. ||||| Twitter is killing off Vine, the short-form video app it once hoped would complement its text-based network with a vibrant community of independent creators. The mobile app will be discontinued “in coming months,” the company said. A source told The Verge that significant layoffs hit Vine today, though Twitter declined to specify how many at Vine were affected or whether any employees were being offered new jobs. The company said it would not delete any Vines that have been posted — for now, anyway. “We value you, your Vines, and are going to do this the right way,” the company said in a Medium post. “You’ll be able to access and download your Vines. We’ll be keeping the website online because we think it’s important to still be able to watch all the incredible Vines that have been made.” Twitter bought Vine, which had yet to launch, in late 2012. It launched in January 2013, and its looping 6-second clips gradually became a popular format for sports highlights, visual effects, and comedy. A number of Vine stars improbably became popular recording artists after clips of themselves singing went viral, most notably Shawn Mendes. And yet Vine never became the destination that Twitter had hoped for. Its co-founders gradually quit, and Twitter was slow to invest in the property. The launch of video on Instagram in 2013 blunted its growth, and as with the rest of Twitter, its product added features at a glacial pace. The end of Vine comes as Twitter tries to overhaul its core product, which has been slow to add users or grow revenue. The company said today that it would lay off 9 percent of its workforce, or about 350 people, as it attempts to find a sustainable path forward. A recent effort to sell the company failed when no one would meet Twitter’s asking price. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| Hi, Welcome to Chili's.

Article: Before you bring your guinea pig to your house for the first time, make sure that you have everything you need. Take care to have a comfortable home created for them. You should also have plenty of food on hand for your new companion. A good water bottle is one of the most important items you will need for your new pet. Ask the pet store to recommend a brand. A good water bottle will provide your guinea pig with the supply of fresh and clean water they need without any leaks. Most cages that are marketed for guinea pigs are too small. You should look for a larger cage that is at least 7.5 square feet. This might mean that you purchase a cage that is intended for another animal. That's okay, don't worry about the name of the product. If you can't find an appropriate cage, you can make your own. A good suggestion could be a C&C cage, which is spacious and affordable. Plus, you can customise the cage! Make it interesting. Guinea pigs like to move around, so try to find a cage that includes ramps and different levels. Include bedding. Guinea pigs like to nest and burrow, so make sure that they have the material to do so. Pine and cedar shavings, though widely sold, are not good for small animals, because of chemicals. Instead, ask the pet store for a paper-based bedding product, or use fleece with some type of absorbent liner underneath. Feed this as the number one constituent of the diet. Also, you can offer a small amount (no more than they can eat in 20 minutes) of good quality extruded food. The latter is a pellet that is milled so that each nugget looks identical which stops the guinea pig from selectively eating the tasty bits and leaving the healthier parts. Feeding a diet of entirely pellets leads either to obesity or to the guinea pig's teeth overgrowing. Your guinea pig should be eating a few servings of vegetables and fruits each day. Guinea pigs cannot produce Vitamin C so you must supplement their diet, as pellets are not enough. Some pig-safe vegetables are kale, romaine lettuce, carrot, celery (strings removed) spinach, parsley, and cilantro. Keep in mind that some different vegetables will have different limitations on how much you can feed them per week. Fruits are sugary but can be fed once every week. Apples (seeds removed), blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, banana, oranges, peaches (pits removed) and cherry (pits removed) are fruits that you can try. You can look online for more safe veggies and fruits. Remember to feed organic if you can, and always, always, always wash your vegetables and fruits thoroughly with water before feeding. Remove any food remains after 4 hours to prevent bacteria buildup. Generally, your guinea pig will be able to bathe itself. But every three months (or if she gets particularly dirty), you can bathe it. Place her in the bathroom sink, on top of a washcloth. Gently scoop room temperature water over the guinea pig and rub it in. Use a small amount of shampoo and work it into a lather in your guinea pig's fur. Then gently but thoroughly rinse. Just bathe your guinea pig's body, not her head. You don't want to get water in her eyes. Gently pat your pet dry with a clean, soft towel. Your guinea pig should see his vet once every year. Your vet can make sure that he is at a healthy weight and is not showing any signs of illness. Make sure to use a vet who thoroughly and patiently answers all of your questions. Take your guinea pig to the vet anytime they show signs of illness or significant changes in behavior. Before you bring home a guinea pig (or two) make sure that you have factored the financial costs into your budget. You'll need to purchase food, a cage, bedding, and a water bottle. Don't forget to add in occasional trips to the vet. Annual guinea pig care costs between 500-800.

Variously described as idiosyncratic, and \\"ridiculously smart,\\" she was the state's first female governor and was governor during the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. She was a supporter of atomic energy. A graduate of Mills College and Stanford University, where she earned a doctorate in biology, Ray became an associate professor at the University of Washington in 1957. To the surprise of many, Ray announced in 1975 she would seek election as Governor of Washington. Later asked why she decided to make her first run for public office the highest office in the state, she would reason that \\"I was much too old to start at the bottom, so I decided to start at the top.\\" Though previously politically unaffiliated, she declared herself a Democrat. Ray displayed a blunt, sometimes confrontational, style on the campaign trail, for which she would later become known. During a visit with the Dorian Society, a Seattle gay rights group, she was asked by one member if she had met any gay federal employees and if they ever felt under pressure. Ray responded, \\"I don't know any - you can't tell by looking at them,\\" drawing applause from attendees. In another instance, she declared Seattle Post-Intelligencer reporter Shelby Scates, who had deluged her with tough questions on the campaign trail, would \\"learn what the words persona non grata really mean\\" after her election. Ray narrowly won the Democratic nomination over Seattle mayor Wes Uhlman, having spent almost no money on her campaign, having no experience in running for elected office, and having little support from the state's political class. Despite opposition from all major newspapers and predictions from pundits that the state was not ready \\"for an unmarried woman who gave herself a chainsaw for Christmas,\\" Ray went on to win the general election with a victory over King County Executive John D.

After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science.

Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child.

And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the equation -5382*u - 5264 = -5194*u for u, we will first move all the terms containing the variable (u) to one side of the equation and the constant term to the other side. This will help us isolate the variable and solve for it. Step 1: Add 5194*u to both sides of the equation. -5382*u - 5264 + 5194*u = -5194*u + 5194*u -5382*u + 5194*u - 5264 = 0 Step 2: Combine the u terms on the left side. (-5382 + 5194)*u - 5264 = 0 -188*u - 5264 = 0 Step 3: Add 5264 to both sides of the equation. -188*u = 5264 Step 4: Divide both sides by -188 to solve for u. u = 5264 / -188 u = -28 So, the solution to the equation -5382*u - 5264 = -5194*u is u = -28."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on chaplain of the House of Representatives (all times local): 6 p.m. In a reversal, Speaker Paul Ryan says the chaplain of the House of Representatives will stay in his job. Ryan's announcement comes hours after Rev. Patrick Conroy said he would withdraw his resignation in a caustic letter charging that a top Ryan aide told him \\"something like 'maybe it's time that we had a Chaplain that wasn't a Catholic.'\\" Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican and a Catholic himself, sparked an uproar last month when he asked Conroy to resign. Ryan has said he was dissatisfied with Conroy's pastoral care to lawmakers. In a statement Thursday, Ryan says \\"this body is not well served by a protracted fight over such an important post.\\" He says he will sit down with Conroy next week. __ 4:25 p.m. The embattled chaplain of the U.S. House of Representatives is seeking to withdraw his resignation in a caustic letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan that accuses a top Ryan staff aide of telling him \\"something like 'maybe it's time that we had a Chaplain that wasn't a Catholic.'\\" Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican and a Catholic himself, forced Conroy to tender his resignation last month, sparking a firestorm. Ryan has said he was dissatisfied with Conroy's pastoral care to lawmakers. Conroy said in a two-page letter delivered Thursday that he has never \\"heard a complaint about my ministry\\" as House chaplain. ||||| (CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday he accepts the decision by the Rev. Pat Conroy, the House chaplain, to rescind his resignation, following a week's worth of lawmakers from both parties questioning Ryan's request that Conroy step down. \\"I have accepted Father Conroy's letter and decided that he will remain in his position as chaplain of the House,\\" Ryan said in a statement. \\"My original decision was made in what I believed to be in the best interest of this institution. To be clear, that decision was based on my duty to ensure that the House has the kind of pastoral services that it deserves.\\" Ryan added, \\"It is my job as speaker to do what is best for the body, and I know that this body is not well-served by a protracted fight over such an important post. I intend to sit down with Father Conroy early next week so that we can move forward for the good of the whole House.\\" Conroy sent his intentions in a letter to Ryan earlier Thursday. \\"At this time, and upon advice of counsel, I herby retract and rescind said resignation for the reasons that follow,\\" Conroy wrote in the letter dated Thursday and addressed to Ryan. Conroy, a Jesuit priest, resigned April 15 after he spent nearly seven years praying at the outset of House sessions. He wrote two versions of his resignation letter, which were also obtained by CNN from a congressional source. In the first version, he wrote that Ryan, who is Catholic, should consult with his chief of staff on a resignation date, but the second version stated his last day would be May 24. In the letter, he addressed speculation that lawmakers wanted a chaplain who wasn't Catholic. \\"While you never spoke with me in person, nor did you send me any correspondence, on Friday, April 13, 2018 your Chief of Staff, Jonathon Burks, came to me and informed me that you were asking for my letter of resignation,\\" he said in the letter. \\"I inquired as to whether or not it was 'for cause,' and Mr. Burks mentioned dismissively something like, 'maybe it's time that we had a Chaplain that wasn't a Catholic.'\\" He continued: \\"At that point, I thought that I had little choice but to resign, as my assumption was that you had the absolute prerogative and authority to end my term as House chaplain.\\" Burks said in a statement, \\"I strongly disagree with Father Conroy's recollection of our conversation. I am disappointed by the misunderstanding, but wish him the best as he continues to serve the House.\\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement that Conroy's service as House chaplain has been \\"a blessing to members on both sides of the aisle.\\" \\"Speaker Ryan's decision to accept Father Conroy's decision to rescind his resignation and finish his term is welcome news,\\" Pelosi said. \\"However, many distressing questions must still be answered about the motivations behind Father Conroy's unwarranted and unjust dismissal.\\" Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat who is Catholic, has been among the most vocal critics of the request for Conroy to step down. \\"The letter is a bombshell, inside that bombshell are explosive items like Ryan's chief of staff actually said to him maybe it's a time for a non Catholic chaplain -- for Catholics that is a profoundly offensive comment,\\" Connolly told CNN in a phone interview. \\"The more this festers, the uglier it gets and the wider this infection. I think Paul Ryan should see the letter as an opportunity to heal rather than pouring salt on an open wound.\\" Connolly, who sent a letter with Jones to Ryan requesting more information on the resignation, said he spoke to Conroy before he wrote the letter and submitted it. \\"My sense on (Conroy is) Jesuits are strong people and they're fighters and you don't mess with them,\\" Connolly said. \\"We know in the Catholic church, you don't mess with Jesuits.\\" Lawmakers from both parties were lobbied Ryan to take steps to rescind his request. Republican Rep. Walter Jones of North Carolina asked Ryan to reinstate Conroy on Wednesday, saying in a letter he believes the way the House chaplain was let go reflected \\"poorly on the House\\" and appears \\"intentionally underhanded.\\" \\"Not only was I dismayed that Father Conroy was apparently asked to resign without explanation, I was troubled by the manner in which it was done. All members were not asked for their opinions on the chaplain's performance,\\" Jones said in the letter. \\"Instead, it appears a decision to push him out was made behind closed doors based on the input of only a few.\\" The letter continued: \\"It appears the decision was made to minimize the input of members, and executed surreptitiously to overcome what was likely to be their overwhelming objection. It appears intentionally underhanded, and that is deeply disappointing!\\" According to a person who attended last week's GOP conference meeting, the speaker explained that he asked Conroy to resign \\"based on member feedback about pastoral care.\\" A separate GOP member who attended the meeting said Ryan \\"didn't say this as bluntly but the reason for the change is that many of us like Father Conroy but we feel like he didn't do anything. We never see him. We never hear from him. We'd like to have a more active priest/pastor.\\" ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"The chaplain of the House of Representatives, Rev. Patrick Conroy, had given a resignation letter last month because he was asked to by House Speaker Paul Ryan. However, he recently decided to take back his resignation and not leave his job. Paul Ryan agreed that it's better not to have a big argument over the chaplain's job, and he said they will talk more about it next week. A chaplain is like a religious helper for the people working in the government. Some people think that the House could use a chaplain who is not Catholic, but others think Rev. Conroy has been a good helper to both sides of the political parties."},{"prompt":"What song has mid-tempo riffing, followed by a bass solo at half-tempo? Answer the above question based on the context below: \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" was inspired by the Cthulhu Mythos created by famed horror writer H.P. Lovecraft, with notable direct references to The Shadow Over Innsmouth and to Cthulhu himself, who is the subject matter of the song's chorus. It is considered the heaviest track on the album, with the main riff emulating a beast dragging itself into the sea. The Black Sabbath-influenced guitars are downtuned, creating slow and moody ambiance. \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" was based on Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and conveys the thoughts of a patient unjustly caged in a mental institution. The song opens with a section of clean single strings and harmonics. The clean, arpeggiated main riff is played in alternating 44 and 64 time signatures. The song is structured with alternating somber clean guitars in the verses, and distorted heavy riffing in the choruses, unfolding into an aggressive finale. This structure follows a pattern of power ballads Metallica set with \\"Fade to Black\\" on Ride the Lightning and would revisit with \\"One\\" on ...And Justice for All.\\"Disposable Heroes\\" is an anti-war song about a young soldier whose fate is controlled by his superiors. With sections performed at 220 beats per minute, it is one of the most intense tracks on the record. The guitar passage at the end of each verse was Hammett's imitation of the sort of music he found in war films. The syncopated riffing of \\"Leper Messiah\\" challenges the hypocrisy of the televangelism that emerged in the 1980s. The song describes how people are willingly turned into blind religious followers who mindlessly do whatever they are told. The 136 beats per minute mid-tempo riffing of the verses culminates in a descending chromatic riff in the chorus; it increases to a galloping 184 beats per minute for the middle section that climaxes in a distorted scream of \\"Lie!\\". The title derives from the lyrics to the David Bowie song \\"Ziggy Stardust\\". \\"Orion\\" is a multipart instrumental highlighting Burton's bass playing. It opens with...

They scavenge for supplies and avoid roaming gangs as they travel on a road to the coast in the hope it will be warmer. Years earlier, the man's wife gives birth to their son shortly after the catastrophe and she gradually loses hope. When the man shoots an intruder using one of three bullets they have saved for their family as a last resort, she accuses him of wasting the bullet deliberately to prevent her suicide. Removing her coat and hat, she walks into the woods, never to be seen again. The coldness of her abandonment being \\"her final gift\\", it spurs the man to take his son south in search of warmer climates. In the present, after shooting a member of a gang of cannibals who stumbles upon them, the man is left with only one bullet. Later, exploring a mansion, he and the boy discover people locked in the basement, imprisoned as food for their captors. When the armed cannibals return, the man and his son hide. With discovery imminent, the man prepares to shoot his son, but they flee when the cannibals are distracted by the escaping captives. Further down the road, the man and boy discover an underground shelter full of canned food and supplies. They feast and bathe. When they hear noises above, including a dog, he decides they must leave for a dog means an owner. Further down the road, the son persuades him to share food with a near-blind old man. At the coast, the man leaves the boy to guard their possessions while he swims out to scavenge a beached ship. The boy falls asleep and their supplies are stolen. They chase down the thief and take everything from him, even his clothes. This distresses the boy, so they turn back and leave the clothes and a can of food for the thief. As they pass through a ruined town, the man is shot in the leg with an arrow. He kills his ambusher with a flare gun he found on the ship and finds the archer's female companion in the same room.

The decision was made, arguably, because the immediate threat to them possibly outweighed every other consideration.

Question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: Who decide to take action instead of waiting for another attack? Movie plot title: Assault on Precinct 13 Movie plot: Sergeant Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), veteran officer Jasper O'Shea (Brian Dennehy) and secretary Iris Ferry (Drea de Matteo) are the only people remaining in a soon to be shut down Detroit police precinct on New Year's Eve. Roenick is deskbound and abusing alcohol and prescription drugs. He is haunted by a botched undercover operation eight months prior that resulted in the deaths of two members of his team. Psychiatrist Alex Sabian (Maria Bello) is treating Roenick at the station. Meanwhile, crime lord Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne) is in custody and accused of killing a police officer. He is being transported to another location by bus with three other criminals: addict Beck (John Leguizamo), petty crook Anna (Aisha Hinds), and counterfeiter Smiley (Ja Rule), but a raging snowstorm forces the two guards to hunker down at Precinct 13 until the storm is over. Bishop and Police Captain Marcus Duvall (Gabriel Byrne) were formerly partners in crime. Duvall and his men must kill Bishop before he can testify about their involvement. Heavily outnumbered and outgunned by the corrupt street cops and SWAT officers, Roenick sets free and arms the prisoners to bolster the defense of the station. Roenick and Bishop forge an uneasy truce between cops and criminals and their combined efforts repel several more attacks by the corrupt police officers. Roenick and Bishop decide to take action instead of waiting for another attack. With so few defenders left alive, the precinct stands vulnerable to attack. O'Shea suddenly remembers a sewage tunnel running beneath the building and the survivors set fire to the station to cover their escape and flee down the passageway. When they emerge from the tunnel, the survivors find themselves surrounded by the corrupt policemen. The real traitor is revealed to be O'Shea and Duvall prepares to execute the rest. Roenick and Bishop work together to survive the final confrontation with Duvall and his men, eventually leading to Roenick killing Duvall and letting Bishop go, giving him a head start.

The answer to the question: What album title was taken from a passage in a Stephen King novel? is inside the article: Ride the Lightning is the second studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released on July 27, 1984, by the independent record label Megaforce Records. The album was recorded in three weeks with producer Flemming Rasmussen at the Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The artwork, based on a concept by the band, depicts an electric chair being struck by lightning flowing from the band logo. The title was taken from a passage in Stephen King's novel The Stand. Although rooted in the thrash metal genre, the album showcased the band's musical growth and lyrical sophistication. This was partly because bassist Cliff Burton introduced the basics of music theory to the rest of the band and had more input in the songwriting. Instead of relying strictly on fast tempos as on its debut Kill 'Em All, Metallica broadened its approach by employing acoustic guitars, extended instrumentals, and more complex harmonies. The overall recording costs were paid by Metallica's European label Music for Nations because Megaforce was unable to cover it. It was the last album to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, and the first to feature contributions from his replacement, Kirk Hammett. Ride the Lightning received positive response from music critics, who saw it as a more ambitious effort than its predecessor. Metallica promoted the album on the Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang European tour in late 1984, and on its North American leg in the first half of 1985. The band performed at major music festivals such as Monsters of Rock and Day on the Green later that year. Two months after its release, Elektra Records signed Metallica to a multi-year deal and reissued the album. Ride the Lightning peaked at number 100 on the Billboard 200 with no radio exposure. Although 75,000 copies were initially pressed for the American market, the album sold half a million by November 1987. It was certified 6× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2012 for shipping..., can you guess it ?

Barcelona put on a sumptuous display against Rayo Vallecano and it was no surprise that Lionel Messi led the way, rewriting the record books in the process. The four-time world player of the year scored two goals to give him 228 overall in the Spanish league, passing Alfredo di Stefano's mark and placing the Argentine into a tie for third with a man who, like di Stefano, made a name for himself at Real Madrid, Raul.

National Football League owners approved a 10-year labor and revenue-sharing agreement with players, who late Thursday discussed key elements but did not vote on it. Owners, meeting in Atlanta, agreed by a 31-0 vote to end the current lockout. Team facilities could be open by Saturday, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said, if players approve the deal. \\"It is time to get back to football,\\" Goodell said. \\"That's what everybody here wants to do.\\" Player representatives conducted a conference call Thursday night in which they discussed the proposal and the recertification of the NFL Players Association, which dissolved after the lockout began in March. There was no vote, the association told CNN. New Orleans Saints player Heath Evans, referring to the collective-bargaining agreement, tweeted: \\"The owners tried 2 slip many things n2 the CBA 'they' voted on that were NEVER agreed 2!\\" NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith said after the owners' vote that there was no joint agreement. SI.com said it obtained an e-mail Smith wrote to player representatives, indicating workers' compensation and other issues remain unresolved. The proposed collective-bargaining agreement with 1,900 players would last through the 2020 season. \\"I do feel good\\" about the prospects of resolving the situation, Falcons player representative Coy Wire told CNN before Goodell announced the terms. Carolina Panthers majority owner Jerry Richardson called the compromise \\"fair and balanced.\\" The proposed agreement includes a new rookie compensation system, a salary cap of 142.4 million per club in 2011 and additional retirement benefits, according to the NFL. In a bid to reduce injuries, the pact limits practice times and full-contact practices. Clubs receive credit for actual stadium investment and up to 1.5% of revenue each year. Current players can remain in the player medical plan for life, under the owners' plan. They also will have enhanced injury protection benefit of up to 1 million of a player's salary for the year after his injury and up to 500,000 in the second year after his injury. The first preseason game -- the annual Pro Football Hall of Fame Game, between the Chicago Bears and St. Louis Rams -- has been canceled because of the delay in opening camps, Goodell said. It had been scheduled for August 7. The regular season is set to open on September 8. The owners call for the free-agent signing period to begin Wednesday. The league's owners imposed the lockout on March 11, suspending the labor deal in place at the time in hopes of creating a new financial structure. Players Tom Brady, Drew Brees, Peyton Manning and seven others subsequently filed an antitrust lawsuit against the league on behalf of other current and eligible NFL athletes. A judge in early April joined that action with another filed by retired players. Since the lockout, the two sides have faced off in courts and around conference tables. The major issues have revolved around how to divide the billions of dollars of revenue reaped via the league each year, rules of free agency, a possible rookie wage scale, retirement benefits and a host of other matters. The heart of the issue between the players and the owners was how to divide the league's 9 billion in revenue. Under the old agreement, NFL owners took 1 billion off the top of that revenue stream. After that, the players got about 60%. The owners said the old labor deal didn't take into account the rising costs related to building stadiums and promoting the game. The players argued that the league has not sufficiently opened up its books to prove this. CNN's Lateef Mungin, Kevin Conlon, Phil Gast and David Mattingly contributed to this report.

The attack, which sent shockwaves across the global community, has intensified the already strained relations between Israelis and Palestinians, heightening tensions that have been brewing for years. During a crowded morning commute in the commercial capital of Israel, a powerful explosion ripped through a passenger bus, causing chaos and panic among citizens and tourists alike. The bus bombing is a stark reminder of the dark days that occurred during the height of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, which has claimed thousands of lives. While emergency services rushed to assist those injured, eyewitnesses reported thick plumes of smoke emanating from the wreckage, painting a poignant image of the magnitude of the destruction. Officials have confirmed a significant number of casualties and several people left severely injured in the bombing. The attack comes at a time when Israeli forces have been engaging in a series of offensives against the Gaza Strip, creating a fragile atmosphere between the two nations. It now appears that the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the militant wing of Hamas, has taken responsibility for the bus bombing, asserting that this is merely a response to Israeli aggression in the Palestinian territories. The Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, named after a prominent pre-State Palestinian nationalist, are the military branch of the Palestinian Islamist political organization, Hamas. Founded in the late 1980s, they have continuously been involved in various attacks and military operations against Israeli targets. In a statement released by the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the group claims that the operation was a \\"natural response to the ongoing Israeli aggression against our people in Gaza and the West Bank.\\" The group further stated that \\"the enemy is deluded if it thinks it can scare the Palestinian people through its crimes and its targeting of civilians.\\" In response to this incident, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement condemning the attack and vowing that \\"we will not be deterred by terror; we will find the terrorists and bring them to justice.\\" As military and intelligence efforts are launched to track down those responsible for the bombing, it remains to be seen if this attack initiates a new wave of violence between Israel and the Palestinian territories. With the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appearing increasingly fragile, the international community has called for a de-escalation of tensions, urging both sides to step back from hostilities and work towards a broader and more sustainable peace process. However, hopes for peace have been repeatedly hampered by the intransigence of both parties, allowing the conflict to continue unabated with no end in sight. With the recent bus bombing in Tel Aviv reigniting fears of a full-scale armed conflict, it becomes ever more important for global leaders to marshal their efforts and resources to encourage diplomacy and constructive dialogue between the Israelis and Palestinians to prevent further bloodshed and loss of life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. How might one describe the sentiment of this review? Long day of work in San Francisco, racing to catch a plane (that's naturally delayed) and getting into Scottsdale after 9pm -- what do we possibly do for dinner? When we spotted Second Story, the choice seemed fairly obvious and we were rewarded for it. It's ostensibly a liquor bar/cocktail bar as evidenced by the name, but don't be fooled -- they make really good food here as well. To get in, talk to the host outside to the left of the pizzeria and they'll get you set up and then head up the stairs. Once you get there, you'll see tons of dark woods and lush, deep browns highlighting what is a great upscale addition to the scene. You wouldn't think this was out of place in LA or New York. Drinks as you might imagine are delicious and the food is really good. Highly recommend the Diablo Del Sol, which our waitress listed as her favorite and, as for food, you can't go wrong with 'Don Just Wants Some F*cking Bolognese'* which is only on the happy hour menu. And the happy hour menu is where it's at. Sure, you could get there early and do the typical happy hour but what you really want is to get there after 9 and do the happy hour menu then. You don't need a full meal here -- the HH portions are fairly meaty. And combined with a few cocktails**, you can get out for a fairly decent price. The two of us, with drinks, were under 100 for dinner tip and tax included. The only thing I didn't really love about it, and hence the four stars, was the theme -- having them 'take us on a journey' or explaining 'the story of the menu' that we would 'be experiencing' were a bit much on the pretension side. But the food greatly outweighs anything else you could dock them for. And considering they've only been open a month, they'll probably smooth that out down the road. Try to sit outside. It's really nice! * - the story we heard: the owners' father, named Don, owns the pizzeria downstairs and whenever they would take him out to dinner, he always ordered pasta and bolognese. So what you'll get here is delicious, homemade pasta and some seriously large meatballs. You can't go wrong. ** - designate a DD, kids.","completion":"The sentiment of this review is mostly positive. The reviewer talks about the good food, delicious drinks, nice location, and reasonable prices. They liked the happy hour menu and the large portion sizes.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? is unusual , food-for-thought cinema that 's as entertaining as it is instructive","completion":"Step 1: Understanding the Task The task is to evaluate the sentiment of a given sentence. Sentiment analysis involves determining the emotional tone or attitude expressed in a piece of text and classifying it, usually as positive, negative, or neutral. Step 2: Evaluating the Sentence Let's examine the given sentence: \\"is unusual, food-for-thought cinema that's as entertaining as it is instructive.\\" Step 3: Identifying Key Words Identifying key words and phrases will help determine the sentiment. The key words and phrases in this context are \\"unusual\\", \\"food-for-thought\\", \\"entertaining\\", \\"instructive\\". All these words give a strong indication of the author's sentiment: - \\"Unusual\\" can often carry a positive sentiment in movie reviews, as it can indicate a unique, non-clichéd movie experience. - \\"Food-for-thought\\" implies a positive sentiment, as it suggests that the movie is intellectually stimulating or contemplative. - \\"Entertaining\\" is certainly a positive sentiment, indicating that the movie is enjoyable. - \\"Instructive\\" implies a positive sentiment, suggesting that the movie is informative or has a valuable lesson. Step 4: Evaluating the Sentiment Given the context and the positive connotations of the key words and phrases, it can be concluded that the sentiment of the sentence is positive. This is because the author uses positive language to describe the movie and reveals an appreciation for its unusual, entertaining, and instructive nature."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer a question about the following article about Empiricism: This idea was later developed in ancient philosophy by the Stoic school. Stoic epistemology generally emphasized that the mind starts blank, but acquires knowledge as the outside world is impressed upon it. The doxographer Aetius summarizes this view as \\"When a man is born, the Stoics say, he has the commanding part of his soul like a sheet of paper ready for writing upon.\\" Later stoics, such as Sextus of Chaeronea, would continue this idea of empiricism in later Stoic writings as well. As Sextus contends \\"For every thought comes from sense-perception or not without sense-perception and either from direct experience or not without direct experience\\" (Against the Professors, 8.56-8). What was Aetius's career?","completion":"Aetius was a Greek doxographer, which means he was a compiler and transcriber of the teachings and beliefs of various ancient philosophers. His career primarily revolved around documenting the diverse views held by philosophers, particularly in ancient Greece. Aetius' main work, \\"Placita Philosophorum\\" or \\"Opinions of the Philosophers,\\" is considered an invaluable resource for understanding the beliefs and ideas expressed by philosophers from various schools of thought. The text contains a systematic and organized presentation of their doctrines, facilitating a comparative understanding of the different philosophical systems and their proponents. It is worth mentioning that the surviving parts of Aetius' works are not in their original form, as such, but rather as excerpts preserved in other compilations, such as \\"Doxographi Graeci\\" by Hermann Diels. As a doxographer, Aetius played a crucial role in preserving and transmitting knowledge of the ancient philosophical world. Although details about his personal life are scarce, his career as a doxographer is significant due to the extensive documentation that serves as a vital resource for modern scholars studying ancient philosophy, as demonstrated through the quote about Stoic empiricism mentioned in the article."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What can I do to remove it? Select from the following. + no; + yes; Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Answer to Question 1: If your dog is having difficulty moving after a bath, there could be a few reasons for this, such as physical discomfort, fear, or simply being tired from the bathing process. It is important to address this issue to ensure your dog's well-being and physical health. 1. Check for injuries: Carefully examine your dog for any injuries or discomfort that may be causing their inability to move. Look for cuts, swelling, or other signs of pain near their joints or muscles. If you suspect your dog is injured, consult with a veterinarian as soon as possible. 2. Address any fear or anxiety: Dogs can sometimes become anxious or fearful about being wet or taking a bath, especially if they have had a previous traumatic experience. Offer positive reinforcement by providing treats and gentle praise to help them associate bath time with positive experiences. 3. Dry your dog thoroughly: Ensure your dog is completely dry after their bath by using a towel or a hairdryer on a low heat setting. Not drying your dog properly can lead to issues such as chills and muscle stiffness. 4. Keep them warm: Make sure your dog is in a comfortable, warm environment after their bath, especially during colder months. Provide a warm, dry bed in a cozy area for them to rest. 5. Assist with movement: If your dog is still unable to move after you have addressed the above points, try gently guiding them or assisting them in moving their limbs. This can help them regain mobility and loosen any stiffness. 6. Consult a veterinarian: If your dog's inability to move continues or worsens, seek professional advice from a veterinarian. They can help determine the cause and provide appropriate treatment if necessary. Answer to Question 2: If you have water in your ear after taking a bath, there are several methods you can use to remove it. Trapped water in the ear can lead to discomfort and, in some cases, infection. Here are a few methods for removing water from your ear: 1. Gravity: Tilt your head sideways and gently shake your head. Gravity can help pull the water out of your ear. You can also use your palm to create a vacuum seal over the affected ear and tilt your head sideways to help remove the water. 2. Yawning or chewing: Yawning or chewing gum can help open your Eustachian tubes and alleviate the sensation of water in your ear. 3. Warm compress: Place a warm (not hot) damp cloth or towel on the affected ear for a few minutes to help evaporate the trapped water. 4. Hairdryer: Hold a hairdryer on a low heat setting and gently blow warm air near the entrance of your affected ear. Be sure to keep a safe distance and avoid getting the hairdryer too close to avoid burns or further damage. 5. Over-the-counter medication: Some over-the-counter ear drops are designed to help dry out the ear canal after swimming or bathing. Follow the instructions on the packaging and consult with a pharmacist or medical professional if you have any concerns. 6. Prevention: To prevent water from entering your ear in the future, consider using earplugs or a swim cap during bathing. To answer your final question, no, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 deals with a dog's inability to move after a bath, while Question 2 concerns an individual's issue with trapped water in their ear after bathing. Both questions address different concerns and require specific solutions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

What are the most popular advertising trends nowadays? What is the most popular trend of 2016? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Options are: [1]. no [2]. yes","completion":"The two questions can be seen as asking for related but distinct information. The first question inquires about the most popular advertising trends in the present day, while the second question focuses on identifying the most popular trend of 2016. With that in mind, here is a detailed response to both questions: 1. Most popular advertising trends nowadays: a. Personalization: Modern advertising relies heavily on personalization, where advertisements are tailored to a user's preferences, browsing history, and online behavior. This enables businesses to display their products and services to a specific target audience, thereby increasing the likelihood of converting them into buyers. b. Artificial intelligence and machine learning: AI-driven tools and software have revolutionized the advertising industry. From predictive analytics to chatbots and voice search, AI is making it easier for marketers to analyze data, devise strategies, and communicate more effectively with their target audiences. c. Video advertising: Video ads on platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok have become popular, dominating the advertising world because they are more engaging, memorable, and efficient in conveying information than traditional banner ads or text-only content. d. Influencer marketing: Influencers act as brand ambassadors on social media platforms, primarily Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, and TikTok. They have a large following and can authentically promote products to their audiences, making them a valuable aspect of modern advertising strategy. e. Native advertising: Instead of intrusive ads, many businesses opt for native advertising, which involves sponsoring content that aligns with the brand's values and target audience. The content appears to be a natural part of the platform it is featured on, thus creating a more seamless and less disruptive user experience. f. Programmatic advertising: This refers to the use of automated technology platforms to buy, sell, and optimize online advertisements, making the process more efficient and streamlined. Programmatic ads allow marketers to target specific audiences or market segments, ensuring ads reach the right consumers at the right time. g. Mobile-first advertising: With the increasing penetration of mobile devices worldwide, advertising strategies have shifted to prioritize mobile optimization. Marketers focus on creating ads and content that are optimized for mobile browsing and engagement, ensuring seamless experiences for users. 2. The most popular trend of 2016: Live streaming: In 2016, live streaming became a hugely popular trend as platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat introduced or expanded their live streaming capabilities. Periscope and Meerkat had already initiated this trend, but the expansion of live streaming into major social media platforms allowed users to broadcast and engage with their followers in real-time. This created new opportunities for marketers to reach consumers in a more authentic, unscripted manner, promoting events, launching products, and connecting with target audiences in ways that hadn't been possible before.

No, the two questions are not inquiring about the same information, as the first question pertains to current advertising trends, while the second question concentrates on the most popular trend in 2016."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

First question: I have over 10,000 shared items in Google Reader. What are my options for export? Second question: How can I view all my shared Google Reader items from a single blog? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First, let me answer both questions one by one. 1. Exporting over 10,000 shared items in Google Reader: Step 1: Log in to your Google Account and open Google Reader. Reason: To access your shared items, you need to log in to the account where they are stored. Step 2: Locate the \\"Settings\\" or \\"Gear\\" icon in the top right corner and click it. Reason: This will open a dropdown menu with options for managing your Google Reader. Step 3: Select \\"Reader settings\\" from the dropdown menu. Reason: The \\"Reader settings\\" option will provide you with the tools needed to export shared items. Step 4: Navigate to the \\"Import/Export\\" tab. Reason: This tab contains options for exporting your Google Reader data. Step 5: Click the \\"Download your data through Takeout\\" link. Reason: Google Takeout is a service that allows you to download your personal data from various Google products, including Google Reader. Step 6: Follow the instructions provided by Google Takeout to download your archive. Reason: The Google Takeout process will guide you through creating an archive containing your Google Reader shared items. 2. Viewing all shared Google Reader items from a single blog: Unfortunately, with the discontinuation of Google Reader in 2013, there is no direct way to view all shared items from a single blog within Google Reader. However, you can use the exported data from the previous question as a solution. Step 1: Unzip the archive you downloaded from Google Takeout. Reason: Extracting the contents of the archive will give you access to your Google Reader shared items. Step 2: Locate the \\"shared-items.json\\" file in the extracted data. Reason: This file contains the information about your Google Reader shared items. Step 3: Utilize a JSON viewer, converter, or programming tool to parse and filter the shared items JSON data for the specific blog of interest. Reason: By filtering the JSON data, you can isolate the shared items from the desired blog and view them all together. Conclusion: The two questions you asked are not exactly the same thing. The first question is about exporting the shared items from Google Reader, while the second question is about viewing all the shared items from a specific blog within Google Reader. The solution is to use the exported data to achieve the desired outcome (viewing shared items from a single blog) since Google Reader is no longer operational."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: Ai Weiweiâs S.A.C.R.E.D. depicts scenes from prison In 2011, dissident artist Ai Weiwei was imprisoned by Chinese authorities for 81 days. Now a new work on show in Venice called S.A.C.R.E.D. depicts scenes from his incarceration. Ai Weiwei is China’s best known living artist and the most high-profile critic of the country’s government. He has spoken out about human rights abuses, called for political reform and made allegations of widespread corruption – none of which sit comfortably with the ruling Communist Party. In 2010, the authorities demolished his studio in Shanghai – they said he had not obtained planning permission – and the following year he was detained at Beijing Airport as he attempted to board a flight to Hong Kong. He was released 81 days later. Ai has depicted scenes from his incarceration in a work called S.A.C.R.E.D., on display at the Church of Sant’Antonin in Venice until 15 September. The work consists of six hulking, iron boxes containing dioramas that show the indignities of imprisonment: squalor, surveillance and constant supervision. Alastair Sooke and Bendor Grosvenor visit the church and take a look.

Which language is this?","completion":"The language in the given text is Turkish. Turkish is a member of the Oghuz group of languages, a subgroup of the Turkic language family. The Turkic language family is a language family of at least thirty-five documented languages, spoken by the Turkic peoples. Turkish, as spoken in Turkey, is defined by the country's language regulatory body, the Turkish Language Association, as Istanbul Turkish, which is the most widely spoken of the Turkic languages, its native speakers accounting for about 40% of all Turkic speakers. Turkish is nearly mutually intelligible with Azerbaijani and both languages are often considered dialects of a single language. Turkish has a high degree of mutual intelligibility with other Oghuz languages, such as Gagauz, Qashqai, Turkmen and Salar. The language has distinctive vowel harmony, agglutination, and lack of grammatical gender. Agglutination means parts of the word referring to several grammatical aspects are all expressed in one word form. Additionally, Turkish has a T-V distinction: second-person singular forms can vary by social distance. Further aspects of Turkish grammar are topic-prominent organizing, evidentiality and an SOV (subject-object-verb) word order. The history of the Turkish language can be subdivided into three periods: Old Turkish (from the 7th to the 13th centuries), Middle Turkish (from the 13th to the 19th centuries) and Modern Turkish (from the 19th century to present day). Turkish, regardless of the period, has always been characterized by its distinctive grammar, phonology and vocabulary. The Latin alphabet was introduced in 1928, replacing the Arabic script which had been in use before that time. This was part of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's reforms following the founding of the modern Turkish Republic. The change was supported by public education, official encouragement, and law, all aimed at increasing literacy. Turkish, besides Turkey, is also spoken in Northern Cyprus, Iraq, Greece, Bulgaria, the Republic of North Macedonia, Kosovo, Moldova’s Gagauzia region, and other areas of traditional settlement that formerly, in whole or part, belonged to the Ottoman Empire. Turkish literature is a mix of cultural influences. Interaction between the Ottoman Empire and the Islamic world along with Europe contributed to a blend of Turkic, Islamic and European traditions in modern-day Turkish music and literary arts. Turkish literature was heavily influenced by Persian and Arabic literature during most of the Ottoman period. The Tanzimat reforms introduced previously unknown Western genres, primarily the novel and the short story. This period saw the first examples of realism in Turkish literature. The republic's founder Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and his associates imposed a reform in 1928 replacing the Arabic script with the modern Turkish alphabet. Novelist Orphan Pamuk, the most famous contemporary Turkish author, won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2006."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Given the following context: Bach's early cantatas are Choralkonzerte (chorale concertos) in the style of the 17th century, different from the recitative and aria cantata format associated with Neumeister that Bach started to use for church cantatas in 1714. Wolff points out the relation of Bach's early cantatas to works by Dieterich Buxtehude, with whom Bach had studied in Lübeck. Christ lag in Todes Banden shows similarities to a composition of Johann Pachelbel based on the same Easter chorale. Although there is no evidence that Bach and Pachelbel met, Bach grew up in Thuringia while Pachelbel was based in the same region, and Bach's elder brother and teacher Johann Christoph Bach studied with Pachelbel in Erfurt. Another of Pachelbel's works appears to be referenced in the early Bach cantata, Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich, BWV 150, and there has been recent speculation that Bach wanted to pay tribute to Pachelbel after his death in 1706.The texts for the early cantatas were drawn mostly from biblical passages and hymns. Features characteristic of his later cantatas, such as recitatives and arias on contemporary poetry, were not yet present, although Bach may have heard them in oratorios by Buxtehude, or even earlier. Instead, these early cantatas include 17th-century elements such as motets and chorale concertos. They often begin with an instrumental sinfonia or sonata (sonatina). The following table lists the seven extant works composed by Bach until 1708, when he moved on to the Weimar court. Bach uses the limited types of instruments at his disposal for unusual combinations, such as two recorders and two viole da gamba in the funeral cantata Gottes Zeit ist die allerbeste Zeit, also known as Actus Tragicus. He uses instruments of the continuo group as independent parts, such as a cello in Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich and a bassoon in Der Herr denket an uns. The cantata for the inauguration of a town council is richly scored for trumpets, woodwinds and strings. Wolff notes: The overall degree of mastery by which these early... answer the following question: What is the full name of the person who used instruments of the continuo group as independent parts?

Let's solve it step by step. 1. First, we have two numbers: -5 and 23. We can add them together. -5 + 23 = 18 2. Now the equation looks like this: 3*v + 18 = 0 3. To find the value of v, we want to get v alone on one side of the equation. We can do this by moving the 18 to the other side of the equal sign. Since it's a positive 18, we'll subtract 18 from both sides of the equation: 3*v + 18 - 18 = 0 - 18 3*v = -18 4. Now, we want to figure out what v is. Since 3 is multiplied by v, we can find v by dividing both sides of the equation by 3: (3*v) / 3 = (-18) / 3 v = -6 So, the solution is v = -6."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Today, I'm going to tell you a story about the shortest field goal in a football game. Do you like football? It's a fun game where players try to kick or carry a ball across the field and score points. A field goal is an exciting part of football, and it happens when a player kicks the ball through two tall poles called goal posts. When a player scores a field goal, their team gets 3 points. Sometimes, field goals are really long, but other times, they are short. Now, let's talk about the shortest field goal ever. Can you believe that the shortest field goal in the game was only 9 inches away from the goal line? That's about as long as a ruler! Most field goals are usually much farther away. This short field goal happened during a college football game. In 1976, a player named Pat Brady played for a team called the Nevada Wolf Pack. In a game against a team called the Utah State Aggies, the Wolf Pack were so close to the goal line that their coach decided to try a very short field goal instead of running the ball into the end zone. Pat Brady lined up to kick, and he made the shortest field goal ever! It was really amazing, and the Nevada Wolf Pack scored 3 points. Everyone cheered and clapped because they had never seen such a short field goal before. I hope you enjoyed this story about the shortest field goal in a football game!

A. used-car salesman has been jailed for life for murdering his estranged wife,. their young son and his father-in-law by setting fire to their family. home after his marriage collapsed. Danai. Muhammadi, 24, was fuelled by 'spite, anger and resentment' when he. killed Melissa Crook, 20, and their 15-month-old son Noah by torching. the house in Chatham Hill, Chatham, Kent. Melissa’s father Mark Crook, 49, was left critically ill with severe. burns in hospital following the fire just before 2.30am on September 10. last year and he died six days later. Judge Mr Justice Sweeney, sentencing at Maidstone Crown Court, told Iraqi-born Muhammadi that he will spend at least 38 years behind bars before being eligible for parole. Happier times: Melissa Crook and her future killer Danai Muhammadi on their wedding day. The court heard how Muhammadi. and his friend, bouncer Farhad Mahmud, 35, squirted petrol through the. letter box using a garden spray container, leading to fire breaking out. at the base of the stairs. The location of the fire cut off any reasonable means of escape for the family who were asleep upstairs as the blaze took hold. As. smoke and flames filled the three-bedroom terraced house, Melissa. collapsed in an upstairs bedroom and was found dead by firefighters. lying by her son who was wrapped in a quilt. Amid. the chaos, her brother Bohdan jumped out of a front bedroom window,. causing fractures to his feet and hands. He then tried to get back. inside to reach his mother, Amanda, who eventually managed to escape. Her. husband, Mark Crook, meanwhile, tried to flee the building by following. his wife out of an upstairs window on to a flat roof outside. But. 26-stone Mr Crook got stuck in the window frame just as a fireball blew. the windows out. He. suffered 80 per cent burns and was taken to a specialist burns unit in. East Grinstead, West Sussex, where he never regained consciousness in. the intensive care unit. He died six days later. Mahmud was also found guilty of three counts. of murder. Muhammadi and Mahmud were both also found guilty of two counts of attempted murder. Muhammadi’s. new girlfriend, jobless Emma Smith, 21, was cleared of three counts of. murder and two counts of attempted murder but convicted of three counts. of manslaughter after a six-week trial at Maidstone Crown Court. The judge said that while she was not the principal figure, she was a 'joint perpetrator in the common venture to burn the house'. Scene of tragedy: The Crook family home in Chatham, Kent, was left gutted after the blaze. Escape: Melissa's brother Bohdan Crook (left) broke his feet and hands when he jumped from the burning house while her mother Amanda watched in horror as her husband burned after becoming stuck in the window. Judge Sweeney said the actions of Muhammadi 'can truly be described as pure, selfish wickedness' - adding that Melissa Crook and Noah 's last moments, trapped by the flames, must have been 'of abject terror. He said: 'No-one who heard the evidence in this case will ever forget Mrs Crook’s description of how, as he tried to escape, her husband became stuck in the bedroom window and how, unable to extricate himself, she had to stand and watch as his lower half was burned. 'It’s no thanks to you two that Amanda Crook and Bohdan Crook escaped the fate that you intended for them. 'Each suffered significant injuries, the effects - whether physical or mental - they are still clearly suffering from today.' Mr Justice Sweeney acknowledged that Muhammadi was the 'principal offender', adding: 'The enterprise was all your idea and you drove it forward to its conclusion.' He said that Mahmud’s actions were borne out of 'misguided friendship' with Muhammadi and his expectation of significant financial gain from him. Mahmud was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 34 years prison before being eligible for parole. Muhammadi's girlfriend Smith showed no emotion as she was jailed for 14 years. The couple's marriage collapsed after six months amid arguments and emotional conflict involving their son. The judge told her: 'You joined the enterprise because you were the girlfriend of Danai Muhammadi. 'It was an on-off relationship in which, as I have already said when passing his sentence, he used you to get Melissa back.' He added that like both Muhammadi and Mahmud, Smith had shown not 'a spark of genuine remorse' for her actions. In the weeks before the fire, the court heart how Melissa Crook's relationships with Muhammadi and Smith deteriorated. Smith. had started a relationship with Mrs Crook’s estranged husband, Danai. Muhammadi, and in four-letter text message exchanges she taunted Melissa. about their 'great life together'. Smith also mocked Mrs Crook. about her size, for being 'boring' in the bedroom and added: 'Enjoy your. life with no husband, no house... no money you gold-digger.' Amanda Crook, 50, said she felt 'sick' when she learned Danai Muhammadi was suspected of starting the. fire that killed three generations of her family. Mrs. Crook escaped the burning building in Chatham, Kent, along with her. 22-year-old son Bohdan - Melissa’s brother - but both said the end of. the court case would not bring them closure. She said: 'We weren’t. just anyone, we were family, and the fact he (Muhammadi) did it to his. wife and his own child and his father-in-law.

His theatrical works were written between 1604 and 1643 and included ten operas, of which three—L'Orfeo (1607), Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (1640) and L'incoronazione di Poppea (1643)—have survived with their music and librettos intact. In the case of the other seven operas, the music has disappeared almost entirely, although some of the librettos exist. The loss of these works, written during a critical period of early opera history, has been much regretted by commentators and musicologists. Opera, as a musical and theatrical genre, began to emerge during the early part of Monteverdi's career, initially as a form of courtly entertainment. With other composers, he played a leading part in its development into the main form of public musical theatre. His first opera, L'Orfeo, written in 1607 for the Mantuan court, which employed him, was a major success. In the years that followed, at Mantua and in his later capacity as maestro di cappella (director of music) at St Mark's Basilica in Venice, Monteverdi continued to write theatrical music in various genres, including operas, dances, and intermedi (short musical interludes inserted into straight plays). Because in Monteverdi's times stage music was rarely thought to have much utility after its initial performance, much of this music vanished shortly after its creation. Most of the available information relating to the seven lost operas has been deduced from contemporary documents, including the many letters that Monteverdi wrote. These papers provide irrefutable evidence that four of these works—L'Arianna, Andromeda, Proserpina rapita and Le nozze d'Enea con Lavinia—were completed and performed in Monteverdi's lifetime, but of their music, only the famous lament from L'Arianna and a trio from Proserpina are known to have survived. The other three lost operas—Le nozze di Tetide, La finta pazza Licori and Armida..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The answer to your friend's question is: The last name of the person who had three operas survive with their music and librettos intact is Monteverdi. Step 1: Read the question carefully and understand what it's asking for. In this case, the question wants to know the last name of the person with three surviving operas that have both music and librettos intact. Step 2: Look for relevant information in the given article. The article states that Claudio Monteverdi wrote ten operas, out of which three—L'Orfeo (1607), Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (1640), and L'incoronazione di Poppea (1643)—have survived with their music and librettos intact. Step 3: Identify the required information. From the article, we can clearly see that Claudio Monteverdi is the person whose three operas have survived with their music and librettos intact. Step 4: Provide the answer, which is the last name of the person. In this case, it's Monteverdi."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The album was Slayer's ninth studio recording, and was released on August 8, 2006. During reviews \\"Jihad\\" received a mixed reception. Blabbermouth's Don Kaye gave the opinion that \\"a handful of songs\\" on Christ Illusion \\"are either too generic or the arrangements are too clumsy to work well\\", and specifically singled out the track: \\"I'm looking at you, 'Jihad' and 'Skeleton Christ'.\\" Ben Ratliff of New York Times remarked that the song is \\"predictably tough stuff, but let's put it on a scale. It is tougher, and less reasoned, than Martin Amis's recent short story 'The Last Days of Muhammad Atta.' It is no tougher than a taped message from Al Qaeda.\\" Peter Atkinson of KNAC.com was equally unimpressed, describing the group's choice of song climax as: ..the same sort of detached, matter-of-fact tactic Hanneman and Araya have employed for \\"difficult\\" subjects in the past—Josef Mengele's Nazi atrocities in \\"Angel of Death\\" or Jeffrey Dahmer/Ed Gein's ghoulish proclivities in \\"213\\" and \\"Dead Skin Mask\\"—with great effect.

Article: People hold different views on what or how much homework should be. It is partly due to the fact that people can't seem to agree on the purpose of homework. Some teachers think that homework is necessary to reinforce what is learned in school. And so they ask their students to memorize what was discussed in class through homework. Some teachers think the point of homework is to cover material that the class didn't have time to get to, so their homework is to let students learn additional things. Other teachers like homework simply because they want students to form work habits and still others believe homework is necessary because it's the best way for parents to learn what their children do in school. However, many parents seem to have different ideas. Elisa Cohen, who has twins at Lafayette Elementary School, doesn't like the fact that third-grade students in DC elementary schools are asked to write about 25 book summaries a year.

However, I will try my best to provide a detailed answer based on the question, \\"Does it follow that 'It's not a capital.'?\\" To determine if \\"It's not a capital\\" is a valid conclusion, we need to examine the context and possible meanings associated with the term \\"capital\\". The word \\"capital\\" has various definitions, depending on the discipline or context it is used in. 1. In politics and geography, a capital generally refers to a city or town that serves as the administrative center of a country, state, or province. For example, the capital of the United States is Washington, D.C., and the capital of France is Paris. 2. In economics, capital represents the assets, wealth, or resources that are utilized in the production of goods and services. This may include financial capital (money), human capital (skills and knowledge), and physical capital (machinery, buildings, etc.). 3. In architecture, a capital is the uppermost part of a column or pillar, which typically supports a structure or lends a decorative element. Considering these various meanings and without further context for the term \\"capital\\" in your initial statement, it is difficult to definitively conclude that \\"It's not a capital\\". However, let's explore the possibilities given each context. 1. If your statement is referring to a political or geographical capital, then \\"It's not a capital\\" might mean that the city or town you're referring to does not serve as the administrative center of a country, state, or province. It could be a smaller, non-administrative city or town. 2. If you are referring to economic capital, \\"It's not a capital\\" might mean the assets, wealth, or resources in question are not being employed in the production of goods or services. Instead, they may be consumed, hoarded, or used for other purposes. 3. If your statement is related to architectural capital, \\"It's not a capital\\" would suggest that the component being discussed is not the uppermost part of a column or pillar. It may be a different part of the structure or an unrelated decorative feature. In conclusion, based on the unclear context of your initial statement, it is difficult to definitively state that \\"It's not a capital.\\" However, considering the different potential meanings of the term \\"capital\\", we can deduce various scenarios in which this conclusion might hold true. Providing more context and clarifying the meaning of \\"capital\\" within your statement would enable a more accurate answer to your question."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: With whom is Axel having an affair? Movie title: My Bloody Valentine Movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (December 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) On the Valentine's Day of 1997, in a small town, a cave-in on the north side of a Hanninger mine trapped six miners. Six days later, rescue teams found five dead miners and the comatose Harry Warden (Richard John Walters), who survived by killing the other miners with a pickaxe, allowing himself to breathe. Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles) the owner's son, was blamed for the mine disaster because he forgot to vent the methane lines and caused a cave-in, but also Harry Warden for killing the miners. A year later, Valentine's Day, Warden wakes from his coma in the hospital, and goes on a murderous rampage. Soon after, Sheriff Burke (Tom Atkins) arrives, finding multiple mutilated bodies many of which have been severed in half and the heart of a nurse inside a candy box. Burke and his partner come to the conclusion that Warden had awoken from his coma and, realizing they don't have much time left, they try to figure out where he's headed. Meanwhile, at the abandoned mine shaft that was the site of the disaster, a party is in full swing, attended by many teens, including Axel Palmer (Kerr Smith), his girlfriend, Irene (Betsy Rue), Tom Hanniger and his girlfriend, Sarah (Jaime King). Tom was initially reluctant to go, but he goes anyway. He leaves Sarah and goes back to his car to pick up some beers before going inside. Sarah goes alone and gets lost looking for Axel and Irene. She runs across a teen and a few seconds later, he is stabbed through his eye. She is confronted by Warden in full miner's garb, carrying a bloody pickaxe, and she flees, finding several dead bodies. Axel grabs her and they, along with Irene, hide from the killer. Warden eventually sees the trio, and they run out of the mine, meeting Tom as he comes in. Warden hits Tom with the pickaxe, injuring him, while the other three run...

Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain. Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming.

Options: - climb - play frisbee - travel - hike - go somewhere Explain why a human would choose \\"go somewhere\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"go somewhere\\" to answer the question above for the following reasons: Step 1: Assess the context of the question. In this case, the context is that the couple has had their vacation negatively affected by bad weather, specifically rain. Today, however, the weather has improved, so they want to make the best of it. Step 2: Evaluate the options. - Climb: This option could be an activity that the couple engages in, but it is specific and may not appeal to everyone, nor would it necessarily utilize the whole day. - Play frisbee: This is a fun outdoor activity, but again it is specific and may not be everyone's preference. Also, it might not maximize the good weather opportunity. - Travel: Though this may involve visiting new places or exploring the area, it could be interpreted as too broad/vague, or it could also refer to leaving the current vacation spot. - Hike: This could be an enjoyable outdoor experience, but it assumes the couple is interested in hiking and that there are suitable trails nearby. Like climbing, it is a specific outdoor activity. - Go somewhere: This option is more general and open-ended, and would allow the couple to decide where to go based on their preferences, such as sightseeing, shopping, visiting points of interest, or partaking in outdoor activities. Step 3: Choose the most suitable answer. Considering the context and the evaluation of the options, a human would likely choose \\"go somewhere.\\" This answer is broad and versatile, allowing the couple to make diverse choices about how to spend their day, which is important after having previous days negatively affected by rain.

OK , the other night me and my cousin got drunk when the parents were out and played around with one we found in the basement cuz we was bored . It was nt fun . Why did the narrator get drunk ?","completion":"The narrator got drunk due to a combination of factors, primarily stemming from the absence of parental supervision, boredom, and the desire to engage in an activity for amusement or excitement with their cousin. To begin with, the parents' absence played a significant role in the narrator's decision to get drunk. Without any authoritative figure to monitor their actions, the narrator, and their cousin had the freedom to explore and indulge in activities that may be considered inappropriate, risky, or unsafe under normal circumstances. The lack of parental oversight consequently provided an environment that encouraged the exploration of activities such as consuming alcohol. Secondly, boredom was a motivating factor. The narrator explicitly states that they were bored, which indicates that they were seeking ways to pass the time and alleviate their boredom. In this context, getting drunk could have been perceived as an appealing option for entertainment and as a means to create novelty and excitement in an otherwise dull situation. The desire to escape boredom might have overpowered their better judgment and rational thinking, leading to their choice to indulge in alcohol consumption. Additionally, the social context of the situation also played a role in the narrator's decision to get drunk. The fact that their cousin was present and willing to partake in the activity with them likely contributed to their decision, as engaging in such activities in a social context can make it more enjoyable or appealing. Lastly, it should be noted that the narrator and their cousin stumbled upon the alcohol in the basement, which could have triggered their curiosity and eagerness to experiment with it. This chance discovery, combined with the previously mentioned factors, eventually led the narrator to get drunk with their cousin. In conclusion, the narrator got drunk due to a mix of factors such as the absence of parental supervision, their boredom, the influence of their cousin's presence, and the accidental discovery of alcohol in the basement. These factors blended together to create a situation where the narrator decided to consume alcohol to create excitement and amusement, despite the negative consequences that ultimately followed."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Please answer the following question: Information: - The Western Hemisphere is a geographical term for the half of the earth that lies west of the Prime meridian (which crosses Greenwich, UK) and east of the antimeridian, the other half being called the Eastern Hemisphere. - Lake MichiganHuron (also HuronMichigan) is the combined waters of Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, which are joined through the wide, 20-fathom (120 ft; 37 m) deep, open-water Straits of Mackinac. Huron and Michigan are technically a single lake because the flow of water through the straits keeps their water levels in near-equilibrium. (Although the flow is generally eastward, the water moves in either direction depending on local conditions.) Combined, Lake MichiganHuron is the largest fresh water lake by area in the world. If Lake Huron and Lake Michigan are considered two separate lakes, Lake Superior is larger than either. - Lake Michigan is one of the five Great Lakes of North America and the only one located entirely within the United States. The other four Great Lakes are shared by the U.S. and Canada. It is the second-largest of the Great Lakes by volume and the third-largest by surface area, after Lake Superior and Lake Huron (and is slightly smaller than the U.S. state of West Virginia). To the east, its basin is conjoined with that of Lake Huron through the wide Straits of Mackinac, giving it the same surface elevation as its easterly counterpart; the two are technically a single lake. Lake Michigan is shared, from west to east, by the U.S. states of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan. Ports along its shores include, Chicago, Milwaukee, Green Bay, Wisconsin, Gary, Indiana, and Benton Harbor, Michigan. The word \\"Michigan\\" originally referred to the lake itself, and is believed to come from the Ojibwa word \\"mishigami\\" meaning \\"great water\\". In the earliest European maps of the region, the name of Lake Illinois has been found in addition to that of \\"Michigan\\". - The Great Lakes (also called the Laurentian Great Lakes, or the Great Lakes of North America) are a series of interconnected freshwater lakes located primarily in the upper mid-east region of North America, on the CanadaUnited States border, which connect to the Atlantic Ocean through the Saint Lawrence River. Consisting of Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron (or MichiganHuron), Erie, and Ontario, they form the largest group of freshwater lakes on Earth, containing 21% of the world's surface fresh water by volume. The total surface is , and the total volume (measured at the low water datum) is . Due to their sea-like characteristics (rolling waves, sustained winds, strong currents, great depths, and distant horizons) the five Great Lakes have also long been referred to as \\"inland seas\\". Lake Superior is the second largest lake in the world by area, and Lake Michigan is the largest lake that is entirely within one country. The southern half of the Great Lakes is bordered by the Great Lakes Megalopolis. - Michilimackinac is derived from an Odawa name for present-day Mackinac Island and the region around the Straits of Mackinac between Lake Huron and Lake Michigan. Early settlers of North America applied the term to the entire region along Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior. Today it is considered to be mostly within the boundaries of Michigan, in the United States. Michilimackinac was the original name for present day Mackinac Island and Mackinac County. - The War of 1812 was a military conflict that lasted from June 1812 to February 1815, fought between the United States of America and the United Kingdom, its North American colonies, and its Native American allies. Historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right, but the British often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars. By the war's end in early 1815, the key issues had been resolved and peace returned with no boundary changes. - Fort Mackinac (pronounced: \\"MACK-in-awe\\") is a former British and American military outpost garrisoned from the late 18th century to the late 19th century in the city of Mackinac Island, Michigan, on Mackinac Island. The British built the fort during the American Revolutionary War to control the strategic Straits of Mackinac between Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, and by extension the fur trade on the Great Lakes. The British did not relinquish the fort until fifteen years after American independence. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - Lake Huron is one of the five Great Lakes of North America. Hydrologically, it comprises the easterly portion of Lake MichiganHuron, having the same surface elevation as its westerly counterpart, to which it is connected by the , Straits of Mackinac. It is shared on the east by the Canadian province of Ontario and on the west by the state of Michigan in the United States. The name of the lake is derived from early French explorers who named it for the Huron people inhabiting the region. The Huronian glaciation was named due to evidence collected from Lake Huron region. The northern parts of the lake include the North Channel and Georgian Bay. The main inlet is the St. Marys River and the main outlet is the St. Clair. - A suspension bridge is a type of bridge in which the deck (the load-bearing portion) is hung below suspension cables on vertical suspenders. The first modern examples of this type of bridge were built in the early 19th century. Simple suspension bridges, which lack vertical suspenders, have a long history in many mountainous parts of the world. - The Mackinac Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Straits of Mackinac to connect the Upper and Lower Peninsulas of the U.S. state of Michigan. Opened in 1957, the bridge (familiarly known as \\"Big Mac\\" and \\"Mighty Mac\\") is the world's 17th-longest main span and the longest suspension bridge between anchorages in the Western Hemisphere. The Mackinac Bridge is part of Interstate 75 and the Lakes Michigan and Huron components of the Great Lakes Circle Tours across the straits; it is also a segment of the U.S. North Country National Scenic Trail. The bridge connects the city of St. Ignace on the north end with the village of Mackinaw City on the south. - Michigan is a state in the Great Lakes and Midwestern regions of the United States. The name Michigan is the French form of the Ojibwa word \\"mishigamaa\\", meaning \\"large water\\" or \\"large lake\\". Michigan is the tenth most populous of the 50 United States, with the 11th most extensive total area (the largest state by total area east of the Mississippi River). Its capital is Lansing, and its largest city is Detroit. - The Great Lakes Circle Tour is a designated scenic road system connecting all of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River. It consists of routes for circumnavigating the lakes, either individually or collectively. - The Straits of Mackinac Shipwreck Preserve is a 148 - square - mile ( 380 km2 ) state preserve in and around the Straits of Mackinac . The preserve is divided in two by the Mackinac Bridge . The waters of the preserve include the waters offshore from Mackinaw City and St. Ignace , as well as all or part of the shorelines of Bois Blanc Island , Mackinac Island , Round Island , and St. Helena Island . The preserve contains at least eleven identified wrecks . Frequent fog and congested shipping added to the count of shipwrecks in the Straits area . Half a dozen lighthouses in and around the preserve testify to the dangers that existed prior to the invention of radar in the 1940s . Tragedies have continued , however . One modern wreck within the boundaries of the preserve is the Cedarville , a limestone lake freighter that sank in 1965 after a collision . For more information on the wrecks , see \`\` Shipwrecks of the Straits of Mackinac '' by Dr. Charles E. Feltner and Jeri Baron Feltner . Divers also visit underwater formations of Mackinac breccia near Mackinac Island ; one such formation , the Rock Maze , is offshore from Arch Rock . Further east off Arch Rock , a drowned , 100 - foot - high ( 30 m ) waterfall formation , Mackinac Falls , was discovered in August 2007 . - The American Revolutionary War (17751783), also referred to as the American War of Independence and the Revolutionary War in the United States, was an armed conflict between Great Britain and thirteen of its North American colonies that after onset of the war declared independence as the United States of America. - The fur trade is a worldwide industry dealing in the acquisition and sale of animal fur. Since the establishment of a world fur market in the early modern period, furs of boreal, polar and cold temperate mammalian animals have been the most valued. Historically the trade stimulated the exploration and colonization of Siberia, northern North America, and the South Shetland and South Sandwich Islands. - The Straits of Mackinac is a narrow waterway in the U.S. state of Michigan, between Michigan's Lower and Upper Peninsulas. The Straits of Mackinac connect two of the Great Lakes, Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. The straits are wide and deep. Hydrologically, the two connected lakes can be considered one, which is called Lake MichiganHuron. Historically, the region around the Straits was known by the native Odawa people as Michilimackinac. - The Odawa (also Ottawa or Odaawaa ), said to mean \\"traders,\\" have long had territory that crossed the current borders of the United States, where they are federally recognized as Native American tribes, and Canada, where there are numerous recognized First Nations bands. They are one of the Anishinaabeg, related to but distinct from the Ojibwe and Potawatomi peoples. - Mackinac Island is an island and resort area, covering in land area, in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is located in Lake Huron, at the eastern end of the Straits of Mackinac, between the state's Upper and Lower Peninsulas. The island was home to an Odawa settlement before European exploration began in the 17th century. It served a strategic position as a center on the commerce of the Great Lakes fur trade. This led to the establishment of Fort Mackinac on the island by the British during the American Revolutionary War. It was the site of two battles during the War of 1812.

Ted also had lots of battles with other wrestlers like Ric Flair, Bob Roop, Paul Orndorff, Dick Murdoch, The Fabulous Freebirds, and One Man Gang. He even had a group of friends called The Rat Pack with Jim Duggan and Matt Borne, but they had a misunderstanding and became enemies. There was another big wrestling company called WWF, and they wanted Ted to join them. They promised him a super cool wrestler character but didn't tell him what it was until he agreed to join them. When Ted joined WWF, he got an awesome character, just like they promised. There were many more exciting matches in Ted's wrestling career, but these were some of the most memorable moments that made him famous and loved by fans all around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Which temperature will result in faster decay of the cupcakes? Robert, a baker, has just baked a large batch of cupcakes for his store. He won't be able to sell all of his cupcakes within the next week, so he has decided to store a portion of them in the freezer to preserve them for later. He is trying to decide if he should store the cupcakes at 0° F or at 10° F in the freezer. Hint: Freezing is a common method of food preservation that slows both food decay and the growth of micro-organisms. Besides the effect of lower temperatures on reaction rates, freezing makes water less available for bacterial growth.

If the number of rings in a tree trunk can be used to estimate how many years old it is, then what unit of time can be estimated by the rings in a tree trunk? Answer choices: - hours - decades - months - H20 - Joules - DNA - years - seasons Answer:","completion":"The unit of time that can be estimated by the rings in a tree trunk is years. Each tree ring represents one year of the tree's life. Each year, a tree goes through a cycle of growth and dormancy. The growth period typically occurs in the spring and summer months, during which the tree adds a layer of cells. As the tree grows, the older layers of cells form a ring around the younger layers. The thickness of each ring indicates the amount of growth that occurred during that year. Thicker rings generally mean a year of favorable conditions, such as abundant rainfall and sunlight, while thinner rings indicate a year of less favorable conditions, such as a drought or other environmental stressors. Counting these rings can provide an estimate of the tree's age. Therefore, the rings in a tree trunk serve as a visual record of a tree's life and can be used to estimate its age in years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Post-punk: Also emerging during this period was New York's no wave movement, a short-lived art and music scene that began in part as a reaction against punk's recycling of traditionalist rock tropes and often reflected an abrasive, confrontational and nihilistic worldview. No wave musicians such as the Contortions, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, Mars, DNA, Theoretical Girls and Rhys Chatham instead experimented with noise, dissonance and atonality in addition to non-rock styles. The former four groups were included on the Eno-produced No New York compilation, often considered the quintessential testament to the scene. The no wave-affiliated label ZE Records was founded in 1978, and would also produce acclaimed and influential compilations in subsequent years. Please answer a question about this article.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Children who spend more time outdoors may have a lower risk of becoming nearsighted, new research suggests. In the study, researchers looked at about 1,900 schoolchildren. The scientists found that the kids who had been instructed to spend more time outdoors over three years were 23 percent less likely to develop nearsightedness during this time than those who had not been instructed to spend more time outdoors. Moreover, among the kids who did become nearsighted during the study, the degree to which their eyesight worsened was slightly smaller among those who spent more time outdoors. The researchers selected six schools and required the children, whose average age was 7 at the start of the study, to attend one additional 60-minute class of outdoor activities during each school day for three years. The parents of these children were also encouraged to engage their children in outdoor activities after school, especially during weekends and holidays. The other half of the children, from another six schools, continued their usual activity patterns. Afterthree years, 30.4 percent of the kids in the intervention group had become nearsighted, compared with 38.5 percent of the kids in the other group. It is not clear exactly why spending more time outside would benefit children's eyesight, the researchers said. However, some research has suggested that the higher levels of light intensity found outdoors may increase the release of the chemical dopamine of the eye. In turn, dopamine is known to restrain the type of growth in the eye that is associated with nearsightedness. Based on the new results, the researchers recommend that children spend more time outdoors because of the potential benefits to their eyesight. However, it's important to protect kids' skin and eyes from UV light, which can be damaging. Question: Which can serve as the best title for the passage? Options: A: The More Time Outdoors, the Better B: Kids May See Better if They Play Outside C: It's Time to Engage Kids in Outdoor Activities D: Researchers Found a Cure for Nearsightedness Answer:","completion":"B: Kids May See Better if They Play Outside"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By 1944, Howard's energy began to wane. Films like Idle Roomers (1944) and Booby Dupes (1945) present a Curly whose voice was deeper and his actions slower. It is believed that he suffered the first of many strokes between the filming of Idiots Deluxe (October 1944) and If a Body Meets a Body (March 1945). After the filming of the feature length Rockin' in the Rockies (December 1944), he finally checked himself (at Moe Howard's insistence) into Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, California, on January 23, 1945, and was diagnosed with extreme hypertension, a retinal hemorrhage, and obesity. His ill health forced him to rest, leading to only five shorts being released in 1945 (the normal output was six to eight per year). The Three Stooges: An Illustrated History, From Amalgamated Morons to American Icons by Michael Fleming, states that Moe Howard pleaded with Harry Cohn to allow his younger brother some time off upon discharge to regain his strength, but Cohn would not halt the production of his profitable Stooge shorts and flatly refused his request. Other sources state the Stooges had five months off between August 1945 and January 1946. They used that time to book themselves a feature film at Monogram, and then leave on a 2-month live performance commitment in New York City working shows 7 days per week. During that NYC appearance, Howard met and married his 3rd wife Marion Buxbaum, a bad relationship that further deteriorated his health and morale. Returning to L.A. in late November 1945, Howard was a shell of his former self. With two months rest, the team's 1946 schedule at Columbia commenced in late January, but involved only 24 days work during February - early May. In spite of 8 weeks' time off in that same period, Howard's condition continued to deteriorate. By early 1946, Howard's voice had become even more coarse than before, and it was increasingly difficult for him to remember even the simplest dialogue. He had lost a considerable amount of weight, and lines had creased his face.
