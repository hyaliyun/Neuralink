Think like you are answering to a five year old. Vlachs (English: or , or rarely ) is a historical term and exonym used for the Eastern Romance-speaking peoples especially in the Balkans. The term also became a synonym in the Balkans for the social category of shepherds, and was also used for non-Romance-speaking peoples, in recent times in the western Balkans derogatively. Apart from the Romanians and Moldovans, there are indigenous Romance-speaking groups in Greece, Albania and Macedonia, such as the Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians. \\"Vlachs\\" were initially identified and described during the 11th century by George Kedrenos. In 1213 an army of Romans (Vlachs), Transylvanian Saxons, and Pechenegs, led by Ioachim of Sibiu, attacked the Bulgars and Cumans from Vidin. After this, all Hungarian battles in the Carpathian region were supported by Romance-speaking soldiers from Transylvania. At the end of the 13th century, during the reign of Ladislaus the Cuman, Simon de Keza wrote about the Blacki people and placed them in Pannonia with the Huns. Archaeological discoveries indicate that Transylvania was gradually settled by the Magyars, and the last region defended by the Vlachs and Pechenegs (until 1200) was between the Olt River and the Carpathians. Shortly after the fall of the Olt region, a church was built at the Carta Monastery and Catholic German-speaking settlers from Rhineland and Mosel Valley (known as Transylvanian Saxons) began to settle in the Orthodox region. In the Diploma Andreanum issued by King Andrew II of Hungary in 1224, \\"silva blacorum et bissenorum\\" was given to the settlers. The Orthodox Vlachs spread further northward along the Carpathians to Poland, Slovakia, and Moravia and were granted autonomy under Ius Vlachonicum (Walachian law). In 1285 Ladislaus the Cuman fought the Tatars and Cumans, arriving with his troops at the Moldova River. A town, Baia (near the said river), was documented in 1300 as settled by the Transylvanian Saxons (see also Foundation of Moldavia). In 1290 Ladislaus the Cuman was assassinated; the new Hungarian king allegedly drove voivode Radu Negru and his people across the Carpathians, where they formed Wallachia along with its first capital Campulung (see also Foundation of Wallachia). what was special about these people?","completion":"Vlachs were special because they were a group of people who spoke Eastern Romance languages and lived mostly in the Balkan region. They were known for being shepherds, and their language and culture were different from the people around them. They also played an important role in the history of several countries, like Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria, by participating in battles and helping to form new regions such as Wallachia and Moldavia."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This fire was so big that it needed many strong and brave firefighters to stop it from spreading and causing harm. These firefighters are like superheroes who drive big red trucks and wear special suits to help them stay safe in hot situations. The fire began during the day, and it was so big that it took them 11 hours to put it out! That means they had to work all night long, even when it was dark outside. They used tons of water, special hoses, and other tools to make sure the fire went away and wouldn't hurt anyone or anything. The firefighters carefully fought this big grass fire near Loch Ness throughout the night and finally, in the morning, they had it under control. They were all very tired from working so hard, but they were also proud of themselves for protecting nature and all the animals that live around the beautiful Loch Ness. This amazing story shows us how important and hard-working our firefighters are. They fight fires in the city or in the countryside, and they work day and night to keep people and the planet safe.

Is Sanskrit, as the learned language of Ancient India, thus existed alongside the vernacular Prakrits, which were Middle Indo-Aryan languages. a good answer to this question?","completion":"Yes, your answer does provide an overview of the linguistic situation in Ancient India. However, a more detailed and elaborate answer would also discuss the specific Prakrit languages and other vernacular languages that coexisted with Sanskrit. Here's an example of a more detailed response: In Ancient India, Sanskrit was the scholarly language and played an important role in the fields of art, literature, religion, philosophy, and science. However, it coexisted with a variety of regional vernacular languages, particularly those belonging to the Middle Indo-Aryan language family, known as the Prakrits. These were the everyday speech of people in ancient India, and they evolved over time into distinct regional languages. The major Prakrit languages include: 1. Pali: This language was primarily used in the Buddhist tradition and much of the early Buddhist texts like the Pali Canon (Tipitaka) were written in this language. Pali was an important lingua franca among the Indian Buddhist community during the Ashokan period and later. 2. Ardhamagadhi: This language was primarily used by the Jain tradition, as the majority of their sacred texts were composed in this language. It is considered one of the oldest Prakrits that originated in the eastern part of ancient India, mainly corresponding to modern-day Bihar and Jharkhand. 3. Maharashtri: Also called Jnanpith, it was used in the western and central parts of India, including present-day Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Madhya Pradesh. The famous Prakrit kavya, or poetry, Gathasattasai by the female poet Hala is written in this language. 4. Shauraseni Prakrit: It is also known as Classical Prakrit and was widely spoken in the north-central region of ancient India. The famous Sanskrit dramatist Kalidasa used this language in his dramas for conversation among common people. 5. Magadhi Prakrit: This Prakrit language was spoken primarily in the Magadha region (now Bihar and parts of West Bengal) and the adjacent areas of West Bengal, and Odisha. 6. Gandhari: This Prakrit language was spoken in the Gandhara region, which corresponds to present-day northern Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan. It was the language of the Kharosthi inscription, which was one of the earliest recorded forms of writing from Ancient India. Apart from Prakrits, Ancient India also witnessed the development of Dravidian languages in the southern part of the Indian subcontinent. While not directly related to Sanskrit or Prakrits, these distinct languages included Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada, and Telugu, among others. Tamil, in particular, has a rich literary heritage with the earliest known Tamil literature dating back to the Sangam period (circa 3rd century BCE to the 3rd century CE). In conclusion, while Sanskrit was the learned language in Ancient India, it existed alongside the vernacular Prakrits – which were Middle Indo-Aryan languages – as well as other regional languages like the Dravidian languages of South India. These languages served a variety of functions, such as religious worship and literature, and helped shape the linguistic diversity of the Indian subcontinent."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross is heading to Damascus for talks with President Bashar Assad on issues including caring for the sick and wounded in the government's crackdown on dissidents. The ICRC said its president, Jakob Kellenberger, will start a two-day visit to Damascus later Saturday. He also will meet Prime Minister Adel Safar and Foreign Minister Walid Muallem. Kellenberger visited Syria in June. The Red Cross says the latest trip's aim is to review progress following an understanding then to give it \\"enhanced access\\" to troubled areas and hold negotiations on ICRC visits to detainees. It says ensuring the sick and wounded have access to care will be \\"among the particularly urgent humanitarian challenges to be addressed.\\" ||||| The protesters and family members gather outside hospitals in Syria for what has become a grim routine of the uprising against President Bashar Assad 's regime: reaching out for the dead and wounded, trying to wrest their bodies away from security forces.Syrian troops and security officers on Friday seized at least 15 more dead and injured protesters from two hospitals in the suburbs of Damascus , the capital, firing on relatives of the victims and others, according to witnesses and activists.The struggle over the dead and dying underscores how hospitals, medical workers and even corpses have become weapons for the government and its supporters as they try to crush a nearly 6-month-old protest movement against Assad's rule.With security forces largely in control of public medical care, \\"people prefer to die rather than go to a hospital,\\" Khaled, a demonstrator, said Friday in the eastern city of Dair Alzour, where activists said three of the day's estimated 18 deaths occurred.Khaled, who like many protesters asked that his full name not be used for safety reasons, described an instance this week at a hospital in his city. Activists had learned that a wounded confederate had been taken to a hospital, he said, only to be left to bleed to death by medical workers sympathetic to the regime. The body was confiscated by security forces, Khaled said, and has not been released to the man's family.Deprivation of medical care and misuse of hospitals have become \\"routine, systematic,\\" said Wissam Tarif, an activist now outside Syria. \\"What we have seen is security forces based in the hospitals. It is the security forces that have control of the hospitals, and in most cases the medical personnel cannot do anything about it.\\"Accounts from Tarif and other activists Friday detailed some of the abuses: security forces seizing the bodies of slain activists to block mourners from holding funerals, which could turn into protests against the government; and taking wounded activists who need treatment away from hospital wards.Activists describe doctors and nurses abusing bleeding, helpless protesters, especially at state-run medical centers.By tradition, many doctors are Alawites, members of the same minority Muslim sect as the Assad family, explained an Alawite sympathetic to the protest movement.Taken by a doctor friend to a Damascus hospital recently to observe the abuses, the man said he saw a doctor slap a wounded patient. Hospital personnel told the man that medical ethics did not oblige them to treat traitors, he said.In a report released in July, Amnesty International describes similar abuses by medical workers. The report cites a case in which male and female nurses in the town of Talkalakh beat an injured 21-year-old activist, stitched his wounds without administering painkiller, then beat him again on his wounds.Medical care for injured demonstrators is increasingly being driven underground to makeshift clinics in homes or mosques. Pharmacists who sell equipment for blood transfusions or tetanus vaccine for treating bullet wounds have been arrested, Tarif saidEarly in the uprising, Tarif said, he watched in the Damascus suburb of Duma as security forces and protesters scrambled to pull wounded people out of one another's grasp. Wounded are routinely \\"taken, kidnapped,\\" from hospitals, he said.\\"There is clear evidence that the regime is using a specific strategy of attacking injured, attacking hospitals, kidnapping bodies, and preventing bodies from being buried with dignity,\\" said Tarif, who is making a documentary about medical abuses in the early months of the protests.On Friday, the Local Coordinating Committees opposition coalition reported clashes over bodies and the injured outside hospitals in the Damascus suburbs of Kafarbatna and Arbaeen, after government forces opened fire on protests that broke out nationwide after Friday prayers.In Arbaeen, activists and family members rushed 15 wounded protesters, some unconscious, to a private hospital, said Fady, who said he accompanied the crowd. Opposition supporters generally regard private hospitals as more neutral than those run by the government.\\"The hospital was surrounded with security forces, who were shooting at everyone to keep the dead and injured from entering the hospital,\\" Fady said.Members of the Syrian army's 4th division came to the hospital and seized wounded protesters, Fady said. Security forces arrived separately in ambulances and took away the dead, he said.Syria's brutal crackdown has failed to quell the uprising. Many of the protest leaders are adamant that their movement will remain nonviolent despite what the United Nations says is more than 2,200 civilian deaths.Under the slogan \\"Death Before Indignity,\\" demonstrators gathered by the thousands Friday in cities across Syria. But the centers of Damascus and Aleppo,the two main cities and critical bastions of support for Assad, remained largely quiet.Friday also saw the European Union approve tough new sanctions that analysts say are likely to significantly increase the financial pressure on Assad's government. The EU measure includes a ban on imports of Syrian oil to Europe, cutting off the market to which Assad's government channels 95% of Syria's crude. Oil accounts for about one-third of the regime's revenue.The United States imposed oil-import and financial sanctions last month after Assad's government ignored repeated U.S. demands that it stop the armed assaults on civilians. |||||Summary:","completion":"The leader of a group named International Committee of the Red Cross, Jakob Kellenberger, is going to a city called Damascus to talk with President Bashar Assad about taking care of people who are hurt or sick in their country. They will discuss how to help the hurt people in areas where there are problems happening. People in Syria are protesting against the ruler, President Bashar Assad, but sometimes, they are getting hurt and even killed during these protests. The government and security forces in Syria are trying to stop the protests and sometimes, they take the hurt or dead people from the hospitals. This makes it very hard for people to get proper medical care when they need it. Some people are scared to go to the hospital because they might be hurt more or taken away by security forces. To help the hurt people, some kind-hearted folks have started small clinics in their houses or mosques. Other people who try to help, like pharmacists, are sometimes arrested. A group named Amnesty International has shared stories of bad things happening to hurt people in the hospitals. They said some hospital workers have hit and hurt the patients instead of healing them. The protesters are still going on, even though they know it could be dangerous.

Which animal has the scientific name 'Sciurus carolinensis'????","completion":"The animal that has the scientific name 'Sciurus carolinensis' is commonly known as the Eastern Gray Squirrel or Grey Squirrel. This species is a tree squirrel that is native to eastern North America, but over time it has also been introduced to certain places like the United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa, and Australia. The Eastern Gray Squirrel grows to be between 17 to 20 inches long, this includes their tail. They weigh from 1 to 1.5 pounds and have a lifespan of about six years in the wild although in captivity they can live for up to 20 years. Physical Characteristics and Behavior: The Eastern Gray Squirrels have soft fur which is dense and it's primarily in different shades of gray but also has some touches of brown. Their belly is generally white and they have a large bushy tail, which can be slight silver or red in color. A unique characteristic is their large and alert eyes, which are surrounded by a ring of white fur. Adaptability is one key characteristic of the Eastern Gray Squirrels, making them highly successful in both rural and urban environments. They are primarily active during the day, specially early in the morning and later in the afternoon to early evening. Diet: They are omnivores, consuming a variety of foods. Their diet consists mainly of nuts and seeds. During the warmer months, they also feed on plant materials such as buds, flowers, and fungus. Sometimes, they eat insects, bird eggs, or juvenile birds. In terms of habitat, the Eastern Gray Squirrels prefer heavily wooded areas. These areas often have a high proportion of mature trees with high canopies. They make dens in the forks of trees or in an accessible attic or exterior portion of buildings. They also build nests, known as dreys, from twigs in branches high above ground. Reproduction and Lifespan: Eastern Gray Squirrels breed between December and February and again in June to July. After a gestation period of about 44 days, the female gives birth to 2 to 6 young ones that are naked, blind and dependent on their mother for survival. Threats and Predators: Common predators include hawks, foxes, raccoons, snakes, owls, and humans. They are quick and agile runners, and excellent jumpers and swimmers which help them escape from predators. Meanwhile, as humans expand their urban areas, the gray squirrels' natural habitats are shrinking. However, they have proven to be adaptable and get accustomed to city life well. Their non-hibernating nature makes them a familiar sight in our parks and gardens. While they are often loved for their cute antics, they are also considered pests because they can cause damage to houses and gardens, and sometimes out-compete with other native species. In conclusion, the Sciurus carolinensis or the Eastern Gray Squirrel is a species adaptable and resilient in nature, making it thrive in diverse conditions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Latin America is a group of countries and dependencies in the Americas where Spanish and Portuguese are predominant. The term originated in 19th century France as \\"Amérique latine\\" to consider French-speaking territories in the Americas (Haiti, French Guiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Martin, Saint Barthélemy) along with the larger group of countries where Spanish and Portuguese languages prevailed. It is therefore broader than the terms Ibero-America or Hispanic America—though it usually excludes French Canada and modern French Louisiana.

The Senate just voted against airplane legroom standards If you’re seeking relief from sardine-can conditions on airline flights, don’t expect any help from Congress. The Senate voted down an amendment Thursday that would have ended any further reductions of airplane seat sizes. The amendment failed on a 54-to-42 vote, with most Democrats supporting the amendment by Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and most Republicans opposed. The amendment to a sprawling bill reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration ordered a moratorium in reductions to seat size and pitch (i.e., the space between rows of seats) and empowered the FAA to set new standards, in consultation with experts, for seat dimensions that maintain “the safety, health and comfort of passengers.” Currently, regulators can take only safety into account in making such rules. Schumer took to the Senate floor ahead of the vote to describe his dismay with the incredible shrinking airline seat. [It’s no wonder fliers are fighting over legroom. Just look at these numbers.] “Flying is not pleasant anymore,” he said. “You’re crammed in. I’m not that tall. I’m a little under 6-foot-1, and what I do when I fly is I take out the magazine and the airsickness bag and the little folder that tells you where the exits are to gain a 16th of an inch more legroom, so my knees don’t bang into the seat in front of me.” “This is a place where the public is clamoring for change,” he continued. “I got more feedback on [the amendment] than most other things. You don’t have to be 6-foot-4 to understand the problem.” No senator of either party rose to argue against Schumer’s amendment, but it was opposed by the leading airline industry trade group. A spokeswoman for Airlines for America told the Associated Press in February that “the government should not regulate, but instead market forces, which reflect consumer decisions and competition, should determine what is offered.” One Republican, Sen. Susan Collins (Maine), voted for the amendment; three Democrats — Thomas R. Carper (Del.), Claire McCaskill (Mo.) and Jon Tester (Mont.) — opposed it. Sens. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) and Bernie Sanders (Vt.) did not vote.

Two years later we moved into a house in a new suburban development, where we put down roots. At first our lawn was just a mud with wild grass, but Leo saw bright possibilities. \\"We'll plant trees there to give us shade as well as some flowers,\\" he said.

Leo was becoming a full-time parent, and I was learning what it meant to have a father. Weekday mornings when the weather was bad, Leo often drove me to school.

The first tiger cub (later named Kumal) appears and chases the mother civet back into her burrow. Eventually, humans come across them in their temple home and the tigress arrives to protect the cubs.

Answer the question According to Darwin's theory of evolution, the variations among finches that he observed in the Galapagos Islands resulted from","completion":"According to Darwin's theory of evolution, the variations among the finches that he observed in the Galapagos Islands resulted from natural selection. Step 1: Identify the Theory: Darwin's theory of evolution posits that species evolve over time due to changes in heritable physical or behavioral traits. These changes allow the species to better adapt to their environment and increase their chances of survival. This is evident in the expressed concept of survival of the fittest. Step 2: Recall the Observation: Darwin noted during his voyage on the Beagle to the Galapagos Islands, that there was a great diversity of bird life, with very notable differences within a certain species of birds called the Galapagos finches. In particular, he noticed variations in beak size and shape. Step 3: Apply the Theory to the Observation: In relation to the finches, Darwin postulated that the finches originally came from a common ancestor, but then evolved differently on each island of Galapagos according to the different environmental demands. For example, finches with larger, tougher beaks might be more likely to survive on an island where the primary food source is hard nuts, leading to the perpetuation of big-beaked finches on that island. Step 4: Draw Conclusion: So, the variations among the finches that Darwin observed result from the process of natural selection as each species adapted over generations to their specific island habitats - essentially their beak shapes evolved to best suit the type of food available to them in their specific environment. This process indicates the survival of the fittest as the species that is better adapted to its environment is more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass on its characteristics, leading to the observed variation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

TEXT:One of the most popular rentals at my local video store is not Borat or The Departed but a 2005 documentary about Jesus Christ called The God Who Wasn't There by director Brian Flemming, an ex-Christian Fundamentalist. Flemming, in his 62-minute documentary, asserts that Jesus was not a historical figure but a legend based solely on Pagan traditions. Using interviews with authors, philosophers, and historians to debunk the long-held Christian belief that Jesus, the son of God, lived among men, was crucified, and was resurrected, Flemming compares the Christ story with those of cult figures Isis and Osiris in Egypt, Dionysus and Adonis in Greek mythology, and Roman mystery cults such as Mithraism and finds many surprising similarities. In addition to his evidence about Pagan cults, he also states that the earliest sources for the Christ story, the four gospels, were written forty or fifty years after the date given for Jesus' crucifixion and that the letters of St. Paul show little evidence of Jesus being a flesh and blood figure. Flemming, unfortunately however, is not out to conduct a solid investigation of the truth about Jesus' life but to use the subject only as a point of departure for a full throttle attack on Christianity and all religion. Most of the interviews are with those philosophically aligned with the director including avowed atheists such as Biologist Richard Dawkins and author Sam Price. The only Christians interviewed are those on the fringe such as Scott Butcher, the creator of the website Rapture Letters.com, and Ronald Sipus, principal of the fundamentalist Village Christian School, which Flemming attended as a boy. Like Michael Moore's interview of Charlton Heston in Bowling for Columbine, his interview with Sipus is so contentious that Sipus walks out in the middle. In a sarcastic tone, Flemming tells us how wrong Christianity was wrong about the sun revolving around the earth, then points to atrocities committed in the name of Christianity such as those by cult leader Charles Manson who killed 11 people and Dena Schlosser, who cut her baby's arm off for God. He also lifts a statement from a book by LaHaye and Jenkins that says that Christians \\"look forward to the day when all non-Christians are thrown into a lake of fire, howling and screeching.\\" To further turn us against Christianity, Flemming shows us extended clips from Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, detailing in minute detail each scene of violence and torture. What could have been a serious discussion on a very interesting subject eventually becomes a childish rant and a polemic against all religion. In the process of condemning those who used Christianity to commit unspeakable acts, he ignores such people as socialist Muriel Lester, a famous Christian pacifist, Rigoberta Menchú Tum, a Mayan Indian of Guatemala who helped found the Revolutionary Christians and received the Nobel peace prize in recognition of her work for social justice, and Mother Teresa, whose work was about respect for each individual's worth and dignity. His most telling argument is his comparison of Christian doctrine with the Pagan cults and he makes some good points, yet Flemming does not tell us that while some aspects of these cults may resemble Christian doctrines, there are no texts or source materials for these cults before 300AD, long after the New Testament. Also it is important to note one major difference. The immediate goal of the initiates was a mystical experience that led them to feel they had achieved union with their god. This is anathema to Christianity which believes that a Church hierarchy including priests and bishops all the way up to the Pope are required to interpret God's will to mankind. Although I am not a Christian and have some doubts about whether or not Jesus Christ was in fact a historical figure, the truth is that, in the long scheme of things, it may not matter. What matters is that a message was introduced to mankind and spread around the world that contributed to mankind's spiritual evolution. Regardless of the distortions and crimes later committed in its name and there were many, Christianity as conceived was a doctrine of compassion and love, and a moral and ethical code that furthered respect for our fellow man. While I applaud the fact that the film was made and that a taboo topic was discussed, what is sorely needed is not another divisive attempt to use religion as a field of combat but to see it as a common thread that can bring the world's people together. While there is room for debate and discussion on religious subjects, in the words of Annie Besant, \\"spiritual truths are best seen in the clear air of brotherhood and mutual respect.

The speaker also mentions their perception of their ability to work full time and raise a family, stating that they don't think they ever would have had what it takes. Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis The hypothesis is that the speaker does not know how people have time. This statement implies that the speaker is unsure or puzzled about how individuals can balance various responsibilities or demands on their time. Step 3: Determine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis The premise highlights the speaker's self-assessment of their ability to work and raise a family. This suggests that the speaker is aware of the difficulties associated with balancing a full-time job and family obligations. However, the premise does not explicitly mention the speaker's knowledge or understanding of how other people manage their time in this regard. Step 4: Evaluate if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise The premise does not strictly entail the hypothesis because there is no direct statement that the speaker does not know how other people have time; nor is there evidence to suggest that the speaker cannot comprehend how others might balance their time. However, the premise does imply a level of uncertainty in the speaker's ability to handle such a balance in their own life. This allows for a possible connection to the hypothesis, albeit an indirect one. In conclusion, while the premise does not directly entail the hypothesis \\"I do not know how people have time,\\" it does provide a degree of context that could be interpreted as the speaker being uncertain or interested in how others may successfully achieve balance in their lives.

Movie title: The Legend of Hell House Movie plot: Physicist Lionel Barrett is enlisted by an eccentric millionaire, Mr. Deutsch, to make an investigation into \\"survival after death\\" in \\"the one place where it has yet to be refuted\\". This is the Belasco House, the \\"Mount Everest of haunted houses\\", originally owned by the notorious \\"Roaring Giant\\" Emeric Belasco, a six-foot-five perverted millionaire and supposed murderer, who disappeared soon after a massacre at his home. The house is believed to be haunted by numerous spirits, the victims of Belasco's twisted and sadistic desires. Accompanying Barrett are his wife, Ann, as well as two mediums: a mental medium and Spiritualist minister, Florence Tanner, and a physical medium, Ben Fischer, who is the only survivor of an investigation 20 years previously. The rationalist Barrett is rudely sceptical of Tanner's belief in \\"surviving personalities\\", spirits which haunt the physical world, and he asserts that there is nothing but unfocused electromagnetic energy in the house. Barrett brings a machine he has developed, which he believes will rid the house of this energy. Though not a physical medium, Tanner begins to manifest physical phenomena inside the house. When, after a quarrel with Tanner, Barrett is attacked by invisible forces, he suspects that Tanner may be using the house's energy against him. Meanwhile, Fischer remains aloof, with his mind closed to the house's influence, and is only there to collect the generous paycheck. Ann Barrett is subjected to erotic visions late at night, which seem linked to her lackluster sex life. She goes downstairs and, in an apparent trance, disrobes and demands sex from Fischer. He strikes her, snapping her out of the trance, and she returns to herself, horrified and ashamed. A second incident occurs a day or so later; this time, she is awake but uninhibited due to alcohol.

This discovery is made at the end of the film when Ben Fischer and Lionel Barrett dig through a wall after realizing that the house's intense electromagnetic energy must be centralized somewhere. The reason behind Belasco's decision to hide his body in the house was his desire to fuel and empower the intense electromagnetic energy that could bring forth paranormal occurrences. By keeping his body within the house, he aimed to maintain his control and manipulation over the spirits trapped there.

Q: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'.

He believed that the sleek, angled design of the fedora resonated with his own personal style more than the traditional and somewhat old-fashioned tophat. He convinced himself that the fedora would allow him to stand out in the crowd, imbuing him with an air of confidence and mystery. Step 1: Choose the direction for the story -I choose to follow the main character as he gains confidence from wearing the fedora and experiences new adventures Step 2: Define the main character's motivation -His motivation is to embrace his unique style and explore the opportunities that come with his newfound confidence Step 3: Introduce a secondary character -I'll introduce Angela, a free-spirited woman who shares the main character's passion for self-expression through fashion So, with the fedora perched elegantly on his head, the man ventured out into the city, ready to embrace new opportunities and experiences. As he walked down the busy street, he noticed a woman with a vibrant, colorful outfit that caught his attention. She, too, seemed to have an air of confidence about her, matched only by her undeniable sense of style. Intrigued, the man hesitated for a moment, then decided to walk toward her. Angela, noticing the man's approach, smiled warmly at him. She could see that he, as well, had a keen eye for fashion and a bold sense of confidence. \\"Hi, I'm Angela,\\" she said, extending her hand. \\"I noticed your fedora and couldn't help but be drawn to it. It's not every day you see someone brave enough to rock that style.\\" Step 4: Develop the relationship between the main characters -The man and Angela bond over their shared fashion sense and feel an instant connection Step 5: Introduce the story's central conflict, external or internal -The man's newfound confidence begins to feel overpowering, potentially jeopardizing his newfound friendship with Angela The man, flattered by Angela's comment, introduced himself as well. \\"I'm Michael, and I must say, your style is just as captivating. It's a pleasure to meet someone who appreciates fashion as much as I do.\\" As the day went on, Michael and Angela explored the city together, visiting galleries, boutiques, and cozy cafes, all the while reveling in the shared joy of their passion for self-expression.

Is everything alright?\\" she asked, genuine concern in her eyes. Michael looked at Angela, realizing that he had let his newfound confidence take over, potentially jeopardizing the connection they had formed. He knew he needed to regain control of himself so as not to lose what he had found in Angela. Step 7: Resolve the conflict and bring the story to a close -Michael learns to balance his confidence with humility, solidifying his bond with Angela as they continue to explore their shared passions together \\"I'm sorry, Angela,\\" Michael admitted. \\"It seems I've let my confidence turn into arrogance. I appreciate your understanding and will do better to keep myself grounded.\\" Angela smiled and reached over to squeeze Michael's hand. \\"We all have moments like these, just learn from them and keep growing,\\" she offered kindly. And with that, Michael and Angela continued their journey together, their friendship deepening as they shared more of their passions and interests. Michael learned that balancing confidence with humility was key, and Angela, in turn, learned the power of understanding and compassion, as they continued to embrace their unique styles and explore the wonders of life together."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. I am facing a new situation today: Bay city practiced organic farming and used almost no fertilizers. Gulf city practiced conventional farming for it inhabitants, and used vast quantities of fertilizers. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which city caused the entry of less livestock waste into the ocean? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, Bay City is likely to have caused the entry of less livestock waste into the ocean. This conclusion is based on two factors related to the cities' farming practices: 1. Organic farming: Bay City practiced organic farming, which typically involves using little to no synthetic fertilizers and more natural methods to maintain soil fertility. Organic farming may also include using sustainable techniques for managing livestock waste, such as composting and integrating it back into the soil. Consequently, the risk of chemicals, nutrients, and livestock waste entering the ocean is likely to be lower in Bay City. 2. Conventional farming and use of fertilizers: Gulf City practiced conventional farming and used vast quantities of fertilizers. Conventional farming often relies on synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemicals, which may end up in rivers and eventually the ocean, contributing to marine pollution. Additionally, conventional farming may not prioritize sustainable livestock waste management practices, thereby increasing the likelihood of waste entering the ocean. In summary, given Bay City's adoption of organic farming practices and limited use of fertilizers, it is likely that this city contributed to the entry of less livestock waste into the ocean compared to Gulf City, which practiced conventional farming and utilized large amounts of fertilizers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the second quarter, the Cowboys struggled further with Garrard finding TE Marcedes Lewis on a 42-yard TD pass, then in the third quarter he found WR Mike Thomas on a 15-yard TD pass, and then he found Lewis again on a 9-yard TD pass. The Cowboys responded in the 4th quarter with RB Marion Barber getting a 1-yard TD run. But the Jaguars scored again with Garrard scrambling 2 yards to the endzone for a touchdown. The Cowboys replied with QB Jon Kitna making an 8-yard TD pass to TE Jason Witten. Answer this question: How many yards longer was David Garrard's second touchdown pass compared to his first?","completion":"David Garrard's second touchdown pass was 42 yards long, and his first touchdown pass was 10 yards long. So, to find out how many yards longer the second pass was compared to the first one, we can subtract the length of the first pass from the length of the second pass: 42 yards (length of second pass) - 10 yards (length of first pass) = 32 yards So, David Garrard's second touchdown pass was 32 yards longer than his first one."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(Sarah Marchant) A long-haul truck driver recently walked into Tiny Tim’s Toy Foundation in West Jordan, Utah, and asked for a box of toys. Alton Thacker gave him five, each packed with 125 cars. “He stopped at children's hospitals along his truck route and handed them out,\\" said Thacker, 83, a retired barber who started the toy factory 16 years ago. \\"And I know he'll be back for more. Seeing all those little smiles is a great motivator.” The cars — simple wooden toys with a painted smile — are made at the factory and given free to children in need around the globe through charities, churches, children’s hospitals and sometimes truckers who stop by for a box. Thacker’s factory reached a huge milestone this year when he cranked out his 1 millionth toy. He celebrated for a moment and then got back to work. \\"For every car we finish and give away, there's always another child who needs one,\\" Thacker said. \\"For some kids around the world, one of our little wooden cars is the first and only toy they'll ever get.“ The nonprofit organization turns out between 80,000 and 120,000 wooden toy cars a year using a volunteer workforce mainly composed of retirees — with an average age of 80 — who are looking for a way to put their hands to good use again. Cars made in Tiny Tim's toy factory (Tiny Tim's Foundation for Kids) “The highlight of my week is coming to the factory to help sand cars,” said Wade Bender, 74, a retired high school biology teacher and football coach who drives 60 miles round-trip to Tiny Tim’s every Tuesday. A car built from a block of scrap wood is a simple thing, he said, but the impact is immense. He said all kids react the same when they get the toy — whether they’re in a children’s hospital, a restaurant, a tough neighborhood close to home or a developing country. The cars have been delivered to children in countries including Iraq, Afghanistan, Ghana, Thailand, Russia, Mexico and Brazil. “Kids will drop to the floor and start ‘driving’ them on the concrete, the tile, the dirt,” Bender said. “The response of pure joy is always the same.” The factory gets the wood from leftovers donated by local lumber yards and cabinetmakers, and the rent for the workshop is paid by a generous benefactor. The Tiny Tim’s Foundation for Kids buys paint and brushes with donations. All that's left to invest at Tiny Tim's is time, said Thacker. In addition to a regular rotating crew of 35 volunteers, he and his wife, Cheryl Thacker, also get help from churches and civic and Boy Scout groups that sign up for shifts running the band saw, sanding the cars or putting on wheels. Volunteers work in Tiny Tim's toy factory. (Emilee Johnson) Most of the painting — in bright shades of red, green, blue and purple, complete with faces — is done by inmates at the Central Utah Correctional Facility in Gunnison. Bender, who has delivered cars to the prison three times with his wife, Susan Bender, has noticed tears in the eyes of the felons, especially before the holidays. “They’ll tell us, ‘This is the first time I’ve done something for somebody else, thank you,’ ” Bender said. “Many of them are fathers. So they know what the toys they’re painting can do to boost the spirits of a child.” Thacker said he and volunteers initially provided guidance for the inmates, but for the past several years, the inmates have trained one another. Newcomers are trained by men who have been at it longer. [This retiree has driven 64,000 miles helping low-income students get to college] The idea for the toy factory came in 2002 when Thacker, who then wore a full Santa beard, and Cheryl Thacker, who sometimes sported red velvet, decided to turn donated planks of throwaway wood into toy cars. \\"For years, we'd dress up as Santa and Mrs. Claus and deliver eyeglasses, shoes and medical equipment to little villages in Mexico,\\" he said. \\"And we both knew the important role toys played in helping little minds to grow.\\" Why not open a toy factory in Utah, they decided, and help take care of that need themselves?

Given the following passage \\"The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. Only a few invertebrates such as sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain; diffuse or localised nerve nets are present instead. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a typical human, the cerebral cortex (the largest part) is estimated to contain 15–33 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.\\", answer the following question.

A homeless man who came to New York City to find work woke up Saturday poor and despondent. But by the day's end the 53-year-old father-of-two was on his way back to his native Czech Republic thanks to a group of selfless strangers. Jaroslav Nemcovsky flew from his home outside Prague to Orlando, Florida, in September but lost his job and traveled to Manhattan in a desperate bid to find work. Once there however, things only worsened for the already down-on-his-luck immigrant when he was robbed after falling asleep charging his cell phone at Port Authority. Scroll down for video. Selfless: Brandon Levithan, center, and his girlfriend Simona Kanevsky, left, were able to help homeless man Jaroslav Nemcovsky, right, return to his native Czech Republic on the weekend. With no money, no passport and no shoes, Nemcovsky thought he would die on the harsh, and increasingly wintery, streets of the Big Apple. But all that changed when Brandon Levithan, owner of clothing company Thread Society, and his friends came across him sitting solemnly in Union Square last weekend. 'We didn't think he was homeless. We weren't sure we wanted to approach him,' Levithan, who was distributing warm clothes to the city's poor at the time, told the New York Daily News Tuesday. In a heartwarming YouTube video that has now gone viral, Levithan is seen approaching Nemcovsky, who doesn't speak English but was able to communicate with Levithan's girlfriend, Simona Kanevsky in Russian. 'I explained to him that we were a clothing company giving out sweatshirts, hats and gloves,' Kanevsky said. 'I asked if he wanted anything and all he responded with was, \\"I just want to go home... to Czech.\\"' Help: The group took Nemcovsky to a hotel to get cleaned up and gave him new clothes and pizza. Barber: They then took him for a haircut and a shave. First things first, the couple, and their friends, took Nemcovsky, who hadn't showered for two weeks to a nearby hotel where they got him cleaned up, gave him new clothes and fed him some New York pizza. They then took him to a corner barber for a shave and a hair cut. He was a new man. 'He was so grateful, explaining to me that he has never had a beard so long in his life and hasn't been able to shave in two months,' Kanevsky told the Daily News. Back at the hotel, he elaborated on his struggles since arriving in the states. 'He was robbed of his phone, his passport. He had 1,000 -- they even took his shoes,' Levithan said. 'He said he went to police for help and they laughed at him.' Tears: Explaining his struggle, the 53-year-old teared up and was so grateful. Friends: The group left Nemcovsky at the hotel to rest for a while as they pondered how they could help fulfil his wish to return to Czech. The Czech Consulate were able to replace his passport, but gave him no other help in getting home.After 10 days of sleeping in a homeless shelter, he said he was kicked out and, when Levithan and his friends found him, he was sleeping in Union Square. Describing how he just wanted to get home and see his son and daughter, he teared up. The group left Nemcovsky at the hotel to rest for a while as they pondered how they could help fulfil his wish to return to Czech. When they returned, they surprised him with a one-way ticket leaving from JFK Airport early the next morning. Surprise: They then surprised him with a one-way ticket to his home in the Czech Republic, taking him to JFK airport, pictured. Flight: Levithan said they got him on the flight, pictured, around eight hours after they first met him, desperate and alone, in Union Square. 'I can only imagine being on the street, alone in a different country where nobody speaks the language. We just wanted to get him home with his family,' Levithan told the Daily News. Levithan said they got him on the flight around eight hours after they first met him, desperate and alone, in Union Square. And they're looking forward to hearing from him once he's settled back home, Levithan said, adding that they exchanged contact information. But for now, the group are just happy at the difference they were able to make in helping a complete stranger who was down on his luck, and hope their selfless actions inspire others to assist those less fortunate. 'It's the holiday season. We were there to do good. Giving shirts and warming people is really nice deed. Giving him a fresh start and getting him where he needs to be — that's what motivated us to go through with this,' said Levithan. 'I think I got more out of it than I thought I would.'

Or bacon-loving Republican?iStock Is it possible to tell someone's political persuasion simply by the food they eat? Businessweek thinks so. Looking at two of the hottest trending foods: bacon and kale,editors concluded that those who eat the green leafy superfood tend to holding liberal beliefs while those love bacon are more conservative. Analyzing Twitter mentions of kale and bacon by state, they were able to create a map that mirrors the red-blue state breakdown: Behold, the United States of Bacon and Kale: http://t.co/3QB2Y4rpwQ pic.twitter.com/fvq4gHtqHH — Businessweek (@BW) August 26, 2014 It turns out the nation is pretty much comprised of meat loving Republicans and veggie loving Democrats. Note that in 2012, 17 of the 23 most kale-loving states voted for President Obama. Eleven of the top bacon-loving states voted for Mitt Romney. Those who love both bacon and kale were similarly split Obama/Romney in 2012—including Nevada, Ohio and Florida. It may not come as a surprise that the most bacon loving states also have some of the highest obesity rates in the country. Fortunately, there are many recipes that combine both of delicious foods. Maybe Congress should get together in the kitchen. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article discusses the idea of using food preferences, specifically bacon and kale, as potential indicators of political leanings. Businessweek conducted an analysis of Twitter mentions of kale and bacon by state, creating a map that seemed to mirror the red-blue state breakdown in the United States. The results showed that states with higher mentions of kale tended to vote for President Obama (a Democrat), while states with higher mentions of bacon tended to vote for Mitt Romney (a Republican). The article concludes by suggesting that there may be some correlation between food preferences and political beliefs, and that perhaps bipartisan efforts should involve combining these two popular foods."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Given the background: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature. and the situation: Two new planets have just been discovered in our solar system. Scientists have just landed on both and are in the process of analyzing the environment and atmosphere of each planet. What is immediately apparent is that both planets are remarkably similar to Earth since both are oxygen rich and do not require a space suit to breathe. Another similarity that one of the planets, Jarthrow, has with Earth is that it naturally outputs approximately the same amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as Earth does. The other planet, Millhouse, outputs about twice as many greenhouse gases. Climate scientists are rushing to try to see if anything new can be discovered to help out our planet with these new discoveries. Answer the following question: Will Millhouse have a higher or lower temperature than Jarthrow? A:","completion":"Millhouse will likely have a higher temperature than Jarthrow. Here's a step-by-step justification: 1. Understanding the Greenhouse Effect: The greenhouse effect states that solar energy in short wavelengths can easily penetrate greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane. Longer infrared wavelengths from the Earth are partially absorbed by these gases, causing some heat to remain trapped within the Earth's atmosphere, thus keeping surface temperatures stable. 2. Comparing Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Jarthrow and Earth have similar levels of greenhouse gas emissions, while Millhouse emissions are twice that of Jarthrow. 3. Equilibrium Impacts: At a certain temperature, the processes resulting from these greenhouse gas emissions will reach an equilibrium with the surfaces of Jarthrow and Millhouse. However, due to higher greenhouse gas levels on Millhouse, there will be more trapped terrestrial radiation, causing the equilibrium temperature to be higher. 4. Millhouse's Higher Temperature: As a result, Millhouse is likely to have a higher temperature compared to Jarthrow, as it has double the greenhouse gas emissions, which ultimately trap more heat in its atmosphere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve -16*r + 7 - 30 = -39 for r.","completion":"To find the value of r in the equation, we will follow these steps: 1. First look at the initial equation which is : -16*r + 7 - 30 = -39. 2. Next, combine like terms on the left side of the equation. In this case, 7 - 30 becomes -23, so the equation is now: -16*r - 23 = -39. 3. Now, to isolate the term involving r, add 23 to both sides of the equation. Thus, -39 + 23 = -16 which means that the equation now becomes: -16*r = -16. 4. Finally, solve for r by dividing both sides of the equation by -16. We get r = -16 / -16 = 1. So, the solution for r in this equation is 1. Justifying the steps: - Step 2: This is based on the commutative and associative properties of addition which state that numbers can be added or multiplied in any order. - Step 3: This step is a standard procedure in algebra for isolating the variable. By performing the same operation on both sides of the equation, you keep the equation balanced. - Step 4: Dividing by -16 isolates r on one side of the equation, providing the solution. The mathematical principle here is that of inverse operations. Multiplication and division are inverse operations, so they cancel each other out."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: IRS Defends Agency ‘Obamacare’ Official (Image Credit: Ann Hermes/The Christian Science Monitor/Getty Images) Despite her congressional testimony, the Internal Revenue Service today denied that the former commissioner of tax exempt and government entities – now running the agency’s health care office – was in charge of the unit’s day-to-day operations after Dec. 2010. Sarah Hall Ingram retained the title of commissioner, with oversight over tax-exempt groups, but the IRS says she moved to the agency’s Affordable Care Act office full time by the end of 2010, six months after the tax agency began selectively scrutinizing conservative groups. Her successor as commissioner, Joseph Grant, said Thursday that he would retire from the IRS in early June. Grant received the post on a permanent basis last week. “Sarah has been assigned full-time to ACA activities since December 2010,” an IRS spokesman said in a statement. “Joseph Grant began acting as Commissioner [of tax exempt and government entities] in December 2010. Ingram was not running TE/GE on a day-to-day basis during the time frame in question.” Despite the agency’s assertion today, however, Ingram maintained her title as commissioner of tax exempt and government entities, using it in testimony she delivered to congress in November 2011 and May 2012. In late 2011, Ingram indicated that she served in two positions simultaneously. “My name is Sarah Hall Ingram and I’m commissioner of the Tax Exempt and Government Entities Operating Division at the Internal Revenue Service. And I also serve as the executive lead for the IRS Operational Planning and Implementation of the Tax Law Provisions of the Affordable Care Act of 2010,” she testified before the House Ways and Means Committee Nov. 15, 2011. And in this May 2012 testimony in the Senate Finance Committee over Indian tribes’ tax-exempt status, Ingram testified in her capacity as commissioner of tax-exempt groups, despite the IRS’s assertion that she was only responsible for the Affordable Care Act after 2010. According to an inspector general report, a group within the IRS’s Cincinnati office began the practice of scrutinizing tea party applications for 501(c)4 tax-exempt status in July 2010, during Ingram’s tenure over the tax-exempt and government-entities division. Her subordinate, Lois Lerner, director of tax-exempt organizations, did not learn about the practice until June 2011. Speaking during a congressional hearing this morning, outgoing IRS acting director Steven Miller defended his decision to elevate Ingram to her latest position. “She’s a superb civil servant, sir,” he said in response to a question from Rep. Pat Tiberi, R-Ohio. When asked whether she was involved in the recent controversy, Miller said, “I wouldn’t imagine so.”","completion":"A lady named Sarah Hall Ingram used to be in charge of a part of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that deals with tax-exempt groups.

But the IRS says that she had already moved to the new role before that happened. Some people still think she was working in both roles at the same time.

Build a movie plot around this: Who's reign does the story date back to? Kulothonga Chola I A:","completion":"Title: The Legacy of Kulothonga Genre: Historical Drama/Adventure Plot: In the 11th-century Southern India, the story of 'The Legacy of Kulothonga' centers around the reign of Kulothonga Chola I, the benevolent and just king who brought peace and prosperity to his empire. Known for his administrative genius and military prowess, King Kulothonga's rule was marked by stunning victories, vast territorial expansions, and architectural marvels. The opening scene depicts the bustling life in the Chola Empire capital, as citizens from all walks of life go about their daily routines in the marketplace, temples, and schools. We are introduced to our protagonist, Arul, a young and talented architect and engineer, whose innovative designs have caught the eye of the royal courts. King Kulothonga, played by a charismatic and seasoned actor, is keenly aware of the growing tension between his empire and the neighboring dynasties. Realizing the need for strengthening his defenses and ensuring the prosperity of his people, he initiates a series of development projects that would employ thousands of workers, leading to a golden age in South Indian history. Arul is appointed as the chief architect for the construction of the grand Brihadeeswarar Temple in Thanjavur. Overwhelmed but determined, Arul gets to work, assembling a team of skilled laborers and artists to bring his vision to life—the construction of a temple that will stand the test of time and symbolize the great Chola Empire. Meanwhile, a cunning and ambitious nobleman, Sivakami, from a rival dynasty, vies for power and sees the temple as the key to his plans. He infiltrates the court, sowing seeds of discord, and manipulates key players to sabotage the project. Sensing a great opportunity to upstage the mighty Cholas, he hatches a conspiracy to assassinate the king and seize the throne for himself. As the temple's construction nears completion, Arul stumbles upon Sivakami's machinations and is torn between his duty to the king and fear for his own life. In the end, Arul decides to risk everything to save the king and thwart Sivakami's sinister plan.

M: This saying has been scientifically proven! A year-long study of heart attack victims done at the Oakhurst Health Research Institute in California found that of those patients who spent half an hour a day watching comedy videos, 10 percent had a second heart attack, whereas 30 percent of those who did not watch had a second attack.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"What increases teh odds of a male bird obtaining a mate?\\" Context: \\"Birds sometimes use plumage to assess and assert social dominance, to display breeding condition in sexually selected species, or to make threatening displays, as in the sunbittern's mimicry of a large predator to ward off hawks and protect young chicks. Variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species. Visual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays, which have developed from non-signalling actions such as preening, the adjustments of feather position, pecking, or other behaviour. These displays may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of pair-bonds. The most elaborate displays occur during courtship, where \\"dances\\" are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements; males' breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The odds of a male bird obtaining a mate increase through the use of elaborate displays and \\"dances\\" during courtship, which often involve complex combinations of movements. These displays may showcase the male's plumage, assert social dominance, or demonstrate the male's overall breeding condition.

We have the equation: 19 * o + 15 - 15 = 0 First, let's add and subtract the numbers. We have +15 and -15, and when we add them together, it's like they cancel each other out because 15 - 15 = 0. So, the equation becomes: 19 * o = 0 Now, we want to find out what 'o' is. So we will divide both sides of the equation by 19. When we do that, we have: o = 0 / 19 And any number divided by itself equals 1, but 0 divided by any number is always 0. So, o = 0 And that's our answer, little buddy!

Davis and White Have U.S. Sponsors Warming Up to Ice Dancing Feb. 7, 2014 4:32 p.m. ET Ice dancing isn't normally at the top of the list of sports that attracts big U.S. corporate sponsors. But this year is different. Ice dancers Meryl Davis and Charlie White are the U.S.'s only serious shot at a gold medal in figure skating at the Sochi Olympics. They are six-time U.S. champions and the first U.S. ice dance team to win a World championship— twice. The duo is favored to win in Sochi over their longtime rivals and training partners, Canadians Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir. They will make their first appearance in Sochi Saturday, hoping to help the U.S. bring home a medal in a new figure skating team competition. They also appear to be an Olympic sponsor's dream: a polished, wholesome pair who grew up 10 minutes from one another in suburban Detroit and have been skating together since elementary school—factors marketers are hoping will bring attention to their little-known sport. Ice dancing more closely mimics ballroom dancing than pairs skating, its more well-known cousin, which incorporates more acrobatic moves and jumps.

In the weeks before the Games, Ms. Davis and Mr. White tweeted about Puffs tissues, signed autographs at Kellogg cereal plants, and skated with cameras on their heads for a Visa-sponsored video. They claim that the products they are pitching are ones they use anyway: Skaters' noses are always running at the cold rink, Ralph Lauren clothes are their style, and \\"I grew up on Pop-Tarts,\\" says Mr. White of Kellogg's. Kellogg also put the pair on its Crispix cereal box and is promoting them as members of its Olympic \\"Team Kellogg's\\" in a \\"great starts\\" campaign that ties athletes' beginnings in their sports to \\"the power of a great start\\" with breakfast, says Noel Geoffroy, senior vice president of morning foods marketing and innovation for Kellogg. Still, ice dancing has a long way to go before it can match the marketing might of men's or women's singles figure skating. Ms. Davis's and Mr. White's list of sponsors is only about as long as those of Gracie Gold and Ashley Wagner —two U.S. women singles' skaters who are a long shot for the podium in Sochi. But ice dancing's popularity has been growing since an American team, Tanith Belbin and Ben Agosto, won a silver medal at the Torino Olympics in 2006. \\"Dancing with the Stars\\" and other dance shows have also helped raise interest in the sport. \\"In the past few years viewers have been paying more and more attention,\\" says Ms. Geoffroy. \\"It's a sport that has a lot of appeal to moms and families.\\" A new scoring system for figure skating has also made ice dancing more appealing, says Stephen Disson, president of Disson Sports & Entertainment LLC, which produces televised figure skating shows. \\"In men's and ladies' [skating] there is so much on the jumps and points that it has taken away from the artistic side,\\" he says. \\"In dance it's all about the artistry.\\" TV ratings for the long programs for ice dancing and pairs skating were slightly higher at the U.S. national championships in January than for men's singles, he notes. Ms. Davis and Mr. White, who have been skating together since they were 9 and 8 years old, respectively, were once both singles skaters as well as ice dancers; Mr. White says he also dreamt of an Olympic career in hockey. But they eventually decided ice dancing was their forte—a decision perhaps helped by the fact that the Detroit area is an ice dancing powerhouse. \\"I think we recognized that if we wanted to make the most out of this potential career, we really had to devote ourselves to ice dancing,\\" Mr. White says. After winning a silver medal in Vancouver in 2010, they made a pitch of their own—winning over judges for a gold in Sochi. Known for their athleticism, speed and lifts, they hunkered down to hone their artistic performance, or as both call it, \\"the storytelling part.\\" They tapped Dancing with the Stars choreographer Derek Hough for help with this season's short program and a belly dancer to put the sizzle in their free dance to \\"Scheherazade,\\" the story of a bride who keeps her Sultan from executing her by enchanting him with her stories. \\"We've become a very different team than we were in 2010,\\" says Ms. Davis. In their free dance at the national championships in Boston, the couple brought the stadium crowd to its feet with their interpretation of Scheherazade. They earned essentially a perfect score, but their coach, Marina Zoueva, wasn't entirely satisfied. \\"The last part could be a little more passionate,\\" she said afterward. She wants the two to look more at one another as they skate. \\"We agree,\\" Mr. White replied— and said the two would perfect it for Sochi.

Based on the sentence \\"A person in a red shirt pulls on a rope while a little boy watches.\\", is the sentence \\"Someone is wearing red.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"Someone is wearing red.\\" can be considered true based on the information provided in the initial sentence, \\"A person in a red shirt pulls on a rope while a little boy watches.\\" The initial sentence provides several details about the situation: 1. There is a person involved in the action. 2. This person is wearing a red shirt. 3. The person is pulling on a rope. 4. A little boy is present and observing the event. When we dissect these details, we can deduce that there is indeed a person wearing red, specifically a red shirt. The person taking part in the action provides the subject matter for the subsequent sentence. The presence of the little boy watching the event does not alter the fact that there is someone wearing red. In conclusion, based on the given context, the statement \\"Someone is wearing red.\\" accurately represents a truthful observation derived from the provided sentence \\"A person in a red shirt pulls on a rope while a little boy watches.\\" Even though the sentence is simplified, it still contains truthful information that can be directly linked to the original sentence."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Forgetful Husbands Learn That Love Hurts They say an elephant never forgets, and now your husband won't, either. Scientists, apparently miffed about one too many forgotten anniversaries, have invented a ring that prevents even the most absent-minded men from forgetting about special occasions, News.com.au reports. How can a ring do what so many angry wives and mothers cannot? It gets really hot. Seriously. A microchip clock is programmed when the ring is purchased to heat the jewelry up the day before the wearer's anniversary … so unless he actually lost his finger, he won't have an excuse to forget. The heat, which is created by a small thermal device, flashes ever hour in a 10-second burst — each warmer than the last up to 113 degrees. Nothing Comes Between Fatty and His Burrito ... Except Maybe Jail When Fatty wants his burrito, nobody — but NOBODY — can stop him. Thomas Fatty, burrito bandit extraordinaire, was ambling the aisles of a 7-Eleven in Salt Lake City when employees say they saw him shoplifting some saucy snacks on the sly. When they confronted him about it, he threatened them, saying he had a weapon, KSL.com reports. Cops say Fatty then tossed enough cash onto the counter for just one of the tasty tortilla treats and high-tailed it out of there. But he didn't get far. Police caught him in the alley behind the store, where he continued to munch away, despite the fact he was dining at gunpoint. \\"It's strange that he would decide he needed to have the last bite of his burrito before he complied, when he had two officers pointing pistols at him,\\" Lt. Dave Cracroft of the Salt Lake City Police Department said. But in the end Fatty got his just desserts — he was booked into the county jail on suspicion of aggravated robbery. Wanted: Insane Rich People With Way Too Much Time on Their Hands CHICAGO (AP) — Police are searching for two parachutists who allegedly broke the law by jumping from a construction crane in downtown Chicago early Friday morning. Security cameras caught the two as they floated to the ground close to Michigan Avenue. They then climbed into a gray Porsche SUV and drove away. A police lieutenant says the city can't have people jumping off cranes. It's the second such incident in a little over a week in the same area. Last week, a security guard called Chicago police after spotting three people gliding to the ground at Cityfront Plaza Drive between the Tribune building and the NBC Tower. If police do find the parachutists, they could face misdemeanor charges of criminal trespass to land. And Now This From the \\"Brilliant Excuse There, Doofus\\" Department: CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) — A man who police say was caught with two pounds of marijuana allegedly told officers the drug wasn't his because he stole it. Bradley Robison, 18, of Cedar Rapids, was charged with possession of marijuana with intent to deliver and failure to affix a drug tax stamp. When police found him with the marijuana, he said he had stolen it from a nearby business that he had just broken into, court records show. Linn County Attorney Harold Denton said it doesn't matter how Robison got the marijuana — only that he had it. \\"If you steal it, you steal it and you possess it,\\" Denton said. \\"It's a double whammy.\\" Robison was caught by officers after they saw him running from the area early Tuesday, police said. A burglary charge was being considered but had not been immediately filed. The investigation also led to a possession with intent to deliver charge being filed against Ruban Rivas, 36, for allegedly having the marijuana at the business that Robison broke into, court records show. Both men were taken to jail but later released. Hungry Idiot With Dirty Socks Gives New Meaning to Overstaying One's Welcome BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (AP) — A burglar who made himself at home after a break-in overstayed his visit, police said. Larcellus Angelo Scott, 23, had ordered a pizza and was doing a load of laundry Wednesday when Denise Bealessio returned home from work. Bealessio, 51, arrived just as the pizza did. She turned the delivery driver away and was met inside the door by Scott. Scott attacked, but Bealessio was able to escape unharmed. A neighbor called police, who found Scott rummaging through Bealessio's purse. He had written one of Bealessio's checks to pay for the pizza. He was arrested on suspicion of burglary, robbery and forgery and was being held Friday in Kern County Jail in lieu of 85,000 bail. Scott used to live next door, Bealessio said.

Turkish police fired tear gas and water cannon at protesters who tried to enter an Istanbul park at the centre of protests against Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's government. Hundreds of people were forced to leave Gezi Park before the start of the protest on Monday organised by the Taksim Solidarity group of political parties and non-governmental organisations. They are protesting over plans to redevelop the area. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. A Turkish riot police officer uses tear gas to disperse protestors during an anti-government protest near Taksim Square in Istanbul. Police intervened with a water cannon to break up a crowd of several thousand marching along Istanbul's main pedestrian shopping street towards Taksim Square where the park is located before firing tear gas to break up smaller pockets of protesters. After a police crackdown on a small demonstration on May 31, the Gezi Park protests grew into broader action against what critics see as Erdogan's increasingly authoritarian style of government. The unrest died down in late June but on Saturday police went in to disperse protesters who wanted to march on Taksim Square. Erdogan has pressed for significant reforms in the economy and curtailed the power of the military which toppled four governments in four decades. Turkish riot police use a water cannon to disperse protestors near Taksim Square in Istanbul, Turkey. Opponents argue that during the June unrest he appealed increasingly to Islamist elements of his AK Party faithful. Hours before Monday's police intervention, Governor Huseyin Avni Mutlu spoke enthusiastically about the park's reopening. 'We have seen with the visit carried out today that all our work has been completed,' Mutlu told reporters in the park, which has been spruced up with the planting of new trees, plants and lawns since the protesters were evicted on June 15. 'People became brothers here, and it will be very crowded tonight because we all missed that brotherhood. This park will always be the symbol of people's unity, power and harmony,' university student Ozer Sari, 22, told Reuters. However, 54-year-old Abdullah Dogan dismissed the idea that the protests were about protecting the park. Crowds: Hundreds of people were forced to leave Gezi Park before the start of the protest on Monday. Turkish protestors tried to gather at Gezi Park where protests have been taking place since May. Violence: Turkish protestors tried to gather at Gezi Park where protests have been taking place since May. 'This was about overthrowing the government, a government which did its duty and took over the park, cleaned it and returned it to the people in better shape,' he said. Taksim Solidarity, which is opposed to the construction of a replica Ottoman era barracks on the site, had called on Sunday for its supporters to hold a public meeting. A police official told Reuters they evacuated the park because there were illegal groups inside who planned protests. Four people were killed and 7,500 wounded in last month's police crackdown, according to the Turkish Medical Association. The Council of Europe's Human Rights Commissioner pressed Turkey on Monday to investigate reports police used excessive force to contain the protests and punish anyone found guilty. An elderly man sits on the marbles of Gezi Park next to a cordon which reads 'Police - No entry' A Turkish court has cancelled the Taksim Square redevelopment project, including the construction of the replica barracks, although the authorities can appeal against the ruling. The ruling marked a victory for the coalition against the project and a blow for Erdogan, who stood firm against protests and riots he said were stoked by terrorists and looters. Erdogan has said he would wait for the judicial process to be completed before proceeding with the Taksim plans, one of several large projects for Istanbul, including a major airport, a large Mosque and a canal to ease Bosphorus traffic. If Turkey's top administrative court rules in favour of the development on appeal, Erdogan has still pledged to hold a referendum in Istanbul on the government's plan but he will drop the project if the court rejects it.","completion":"This article is about a big protest that happened in a park called Gezi Park in Istanbul, Turkey.

Though she didn't want to admit it, she had started taking extra care with her appearance at work, in case the mysterious rich guy was indeed interested in her. Over the course of the next few days, Rachel made an effort to engage in small talk with the man when she would serve him his espresso.

Edward shared that he was feeling the pressures of navigating his new role as CEO and found solace in the understated ambiance of the coffee shop.

Rachel held the unopened envelope with trembling hands, her heart pounding in anticipation. Before her shift ended, she opened it carefully and found tickets to an exclusive art gallery opening. The attached note invited her to be Edward's date for the evening. Rachel couldn't contain her excitement, but she also worried about the implications of accepting such a luxurious offer from a man she barely knew. That night, she recounted the events to her friend with long, dark hair and naturally brown skin – the same friend who had handed her a cigarette during their break. Her friend listened intently, offering both encouragement and advice. \\"You deserve this, Rachel,\\" she said. \\"You've been working so hard and being kind to everyone, despite the judgments and the whispers.

Their story is a testament to the fact that sometimes life takes unexpected turns, and opportunities may arise when we least expect them.

The dress she is wearing seems to capture her essence flawlessly - an impeccable blend of elegance and effortless grace. It's clear that a great deal of thought and care has gone into the design and creation of this dress, and the result is a gown that is a true reflection of Lora's unique charm and beauty. The fabric of the dress appears snug, accentuating her curves and adding a sultry appeal, yet it is not overly tight or restrictive. Instead, the dress has been designed to move fluidly with her as she glides gracefully across the room. This gentle movement gives the dress a life of its own, making it all the more captivating. As I study the dress further, I notice that it's both simple and complex in its design. The simplicity lies in the clean lines of its silhouette and the absence of any unnecessary embellishments or details. And yet, its complexity is revealed through the subtle interplay of textures, the careful positioning of seams, and the artful draping of fabric that infuses the gown with a sense of enchantment. This stunning dress has been skillfully crafted with Lora in mind, encapsulating every ounce of her personality. From the choice of color to the cut of the fabric, it is hard to imagine this dress having been designed for anyone else. It is as if the dressmaker has looked deep inside Lora's soul, and portrayed her very essence through the threads and fabrics of this magical garment. Standing there in my own beige lace bridesmaid dress, I feel a sudden surge of happiness and contentment. While my dress is not as elaborate or striking as Lora's, it complements her gown beautifully, enhancing the overall effect of the two of us standing side by side. For a moment, I can't help but imagine the scene we'll present at the wedding, and I know that we will both look unforgettable. \\"You're beautiful,\\" I tell her, my voice filled with genuine awe and admiration. \\"I mean, really, seriously beautiful.\\" It doesn't feel like enough to simply say these words out loud, but I hope that Lora can see the depth of my appreciation in my eyes. In this moment, as our eyes meet, I am reminded of the bond we share. It is a bond forged by years of friendship and experiences, both the laughter and the tears. Today, as I stand by Lora's side in our dresses, I am filled with gratitude, not just for the stunning gowns that adorn us, but also for the gift of her friendship, for the beauty that lies both within her and radiates outward for all to see. For today, our dresses may make us beautiful on the outside, but it is the love and the connection that we share that makes us truly beautiful within. As we step into this next chapter of her life, I am humbled and honored to be by her side, supporting her and celebrating her love. And as her dress flows around her, capturing every essence of her being, I am reminded once again of how lucky I am to call her my friend."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease. I am facing a new situation today: Mike is studying the population growth rate of countries around the world. He noticed that countries like Japan and Russia are having a demographic shift. They have a growing population of late adulthood. He recorded the late adulthood population as population A. On the other hand, many developing countries have growing population of younger people.

Question: Benedykt Ossolinsky, age 39, began to grow childish. On the first day of his midlife crisis, he stood in front of the mirror examining his receding hairline and wrinkles on his face. In that very moment, while staring at his reflection he found in his eyes that mad look he had last seen thirty years ago in a photograph taken at a tethered flying model competition. The photo was taken by Henryk the servant, when his little charge decided he wanted a red biplane model Curtiss Consolidated Skyhawk Cruisader 3A \\"Bingo Star\\". This new look was also noticed by his co-workers, who for the most part, considered him to be an infantile spoiled brat. It fit with their idea of a boss. And Benedykt was indeed the boss, even though he himself couldn't quite believe it. He was the head of a foundation for the self-promotion of the Ossolinsky family, well-known descendants of Polish-American aristocrats, engaged in business ventures there, and charity work here. The position was highly honorable and very prestigious. Just as the employees didn't like Benedykt, in equal measure Benedykt didn't like his job. He considered it extremely stressful and felt it forced him to super-human sacrifices. Everything was arranged by the family as a penance for avoiding work. He had to go to the office at least three times a week for two full hours and entertain various smiling journalists, drink coffee with them and listen. He had to sign letters and open gifts from various companies hoping to win favors. And he had to play golf and attend social functions, movie premiers, shows and art exhibits. The family had only planned for three months of vacation time a year. Scandal! As a sign of protest he took to coming to the office wearing a t-shirt with the slogan \\"Attention, Baby!\\" on it.

The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group. Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly common, many Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews.

You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler. Story: David is trying to understand temperature and the science behind it. He took two objects, object A and object B, to his physics professor. Object A had higher temperature, but object B had lower temperature. His physics professor explained him why one object's temperature was higher while other object's temperature was lower.

Please answer the following question: Information: - The point guard (PG), also called the one or point, is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game. A point guard has perhaps the most specialized role of any position. They are expected to run the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right players at the right time. Above all, the point guard must totally understand and accept their coach's game plan; in this way, the position can be compared to a quarterback in American football or a playmaker in association football (soccer). - Basketball is a sport that is played by two teams of five players on a rectangular court. The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop in diameter and mounted at a height of to backboards at each end of the court. The game was invented in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, who would be the first basketball coach of the Kansas Jayhawks, one of the most successful programs in the game's history. - Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer, is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal. - Nando de Colo ( born 23 June 1987 ) is a French professional basketball player who plays for CSKA Moscow of the VTB United League . Standing at 6 ft 5 in ( 1.96 m ) , he plays at the point guard and shooting guard positions . - The shooting guard (SG), also known as the two or off guard, is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game. A shooting guard's main objective is to score points for his team. Some teams ask their shooting guards to bring up the ball as well; these players are known colloquially as combo guards. Kobe Bryant, for example, as a shooting guard was as good a playmaker as he was a scorer; other examples of combo guards are Dwyane Wade, Allen Iverson, James Harden, Jamal Crawford, Randy Foye and Jason Terry. A player who can switch between playing shooting guard and small forward is known as a swingman. Notable swing men (also known as wing players) include Jimmy Butler, Tracy McGrady, Vince Carter, Joe Johnson, Andre Iguodala, Andrew Wiggins, Evan Turner and Tyreke Evans. In the NBA, shooting guards usually range from 6' 4\\" (1.93 m) to 6' 7\\" (2.01 m). - American football, referred to as football in the United States and Canada, and also known as gridiron, is a sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. The offense, the team with control of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball, while the team without control of the ball, the defense, aims to stop their advance and take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs, or plays, or else they turn over the football to the opposing team; if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs. Points are primarily scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins. - VTB United League is an international professional men's basketball league that was founded in 2008. Starting with the 201314 season, it is the 1st tier of Russian professional club basketball, as well as the national domestic league of Russia, with the highest placed Russian team in the league also being the Russian champions. Its goal is to unite the leading basketball clubs of Eastern Europe and Northern Europe together into one league. The league is sponsored by VTB Bank. - Andre Tyler Iguodala (born January 28, 1984) is an American professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The swingman was an NBA All-Star in 2012 and has been named to the NBA All-Defensive Team twice.

By Mark Duell PUBLISHED: 07:38 EST, 17 October 2013 | UPDATED: 08:39 EST, 17 October 2013 A benefits fraudster who enlisted a sidekick to pose in a wheelchair and pretend to be his sick and bedbound father in order to scam more than £20,000 from taxpayers has been spared jail. Emilio Brunetti, 54, of Fulham, south-west London, paid 62-year-old Martin Rafferty £80 per time to pretend to be elderly Antonio Brunetti in an attempt to evade detection by a council fraud team. The son was granted power of attorney for his ailing father in April 2008 and was on housing benefit, council tax benefit and a social tenancy in his father's name, Harrow Crown Court heard yesterday.

Background: Linkin Park is an American rock band from Agoura Hills, California. Formed in 1996, the band rose to international fame with their debut album Hybrid Theory (2000), which was certified Diamond by the RIAA in 2005 and multi-Platinum in several other countries. Their following studio album Meteora continued the band's success, topping the Billboard 200 album chart in 2003, and was followed by extensive touring and charity work. Having adapted nu metal and rap metal to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in Hybrid Theory and Meteora, the band explored other genres on their next studio album, Minutes to Midnight (2007). Context: In July 2011, Bennington told Rolling Stone that Linkin Park aims to produce a new album every eighteen months, and that he would be shocked if a new album did not come out in 2012. He later revealed in another interview in September 2011 that the band was still in the beginning phases of the next album, saying \\"We just kind of began. We like to keep the creative juices flowing, so we try to keep that going all the time ... we like the direction that we're going in\\". Later, on March 28, 2012, Shinoda confirmed that the band is filming a music video for \\"Burn It Down\\". Joe Hahn directed the video. Shinoda spoke to Co.Create about the album's art, saying that it will \\"blow them [the fans] away ... the average person is not going to be able to look at it and go, I understand that that's completely new, like not just the image but the way they made the image is totally new. So there's going to be that\\". On April 15, 2012, Shinoda announced that Living Things would be the title of Linkin Park's fifth album. Shinoda stated that they chose the title Living Things because the album is more about people, personal interactions, and it is far more personal than their previous albums. The band promoted the album on the 2012 edition of the Honda Civic Tour, with co-headliners Incubus. The band performed \\"Burn It Down\\" at 2012 Billboard Music Awards. On May 24, the band released the music video for \\"Burn It Down\\" and debuted \\"Lies Greed Misery\\", another song from Living Things, on BBC Radio 1. \\"Powerless\\", the twelfth and closing track of the album, was featured in the closing credits of the film Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. Living Things sold over 223,000 copies during its debut week, ranking No. 1 on the US Albums Charts. Linkin Park's single, \\"Castle of Glass\\", was nominated for 'Best Song in a Game' at the 2012 Spike Video Game Awards. The band also performed at the award ceremony on December 7, but lost the award to \\"Cities\\" by Beck. Linkin Park also played at the Soundwave music festival in Australia, where they shared the stage with Metallica, Paramore, Slayer and Sum 41. On August 10, 2013, the band collaborated with American musician Steve Aoki to record the song \\"A Light That Never Comes\\" for Linkin Park's online puzzle-action game LP Recharge (short for Linkin Park Recharge), which was launched on Facebook and the official LP Recharge website on September 12, 2013. On the day of the game's release, Linkin Park made a post on their Facebook explaining that the song used to promote the game would be included on a new remix album, entitled Recharged, which was released on October 29, 2013 on CD, vinyl, and digital download. Similar to Reanimation, the album features remixes of ten of the songs from Living Things, with contributions from other artists, such as Ryu of Styles of Beyond, Pusha T, Datsik, KillSonik, Bun B, Money Mark, and Rick Rubin. The band also worked on the soundtrack for the film Mall, which was directed by Joe Hahn. Question: Did this album have any hits?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, the album \\"Living Things\\" had a hit single \\"Burn It Down\\", which received significant radio airplay and gained popularity among fans. The music video for \\"Burn It Down\\" was released on May 24, 2012. Additionally, \\"Castle of Glass\\" was nominated for 'Best Song in a Game' at the 2012 Spike Video Game Awards, indicating its recognition and success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: Pyotr Pavlensky set the door of the Lubyanka building alight and was pictured standing in front of the blaze holding a petrol can. Mr Pavlensky was arrested in 2013 after he nailed his scrotum to the floor of Moscow's Red Square in protest. The Lubyanka building is the historical home of Russia's security services. The imposing building was used by the country's secret police and later KGB - the forerunner to the FSB - and contains a prison. Mr Pavlensky has been questioned on suspicion of vandalism, a charge that carries a jail sentence of up to three years. Two journalists who filmed the performance were taken in for questioning, Russian media reported. The performance artist released a video of the stunt, and said in a statement: \\"The FSB acts using a method of uninterrupted terror and maintains power over 146 million people. \\"Fear turns free people into a sticky mass of uncoordinated bodies,\\" he added. \\"The threat of inevitable reprisal hangs over everyone who can be tracked with devices, have their conversations listened to, or at borders with passport checks.\\" Inspired or crazy, creative artist or cheap stunt man, Pyotr Pavlensky divides opinion but rarely leaves Russians indifferent. Thanks to the shock factor of his art he is well known here and his latest work is perhaps his most audacious. On social media, some have praised his challenge to the powerful FSB as \\"courageous\\" and \\"heroic\\" - a fellow performance artist of Pussy Riot fame proclaimed Pavlensky the \\"mind, conscience and balls\\" of the age. But there's criticism too. State TV anchorman Vladimir Solovyov dismissed all talk of the fire as art. If someone set fire to an opposition leader's office, not the FSB, that would instantly be seen as a \\"terrorist act against freedom\\", he said. Surprisingly perhaps, Mr Pavlensky has only been prosecuted once before. That trial for vandalism is still ongoing but it clearly hasn't deterred him. When prosecutors tried to force him to undergo psychiatric testing, the artist stripped naked, mounted the wall of a famous psychiatric institute and lopped-off part of his ear lobe. Mr Pavlensky hit the headlines in 2013 after nailing his scrotum to the cobblestone of Red Square to protest against tight police control. He has previously sewed his lips shut to protest against the arrest of the band Pussy Riot, cut off part of his earlobe in a protest over the forced psychiatric treatment of dissidents, and wrapped his naked body in a \\"cocoon\\" of barbed wire outside Russia's parliament building. The artist is facing three years in prison over a 2014 performance in St Petersburg, in which activists set fire to tyres and waved a Ukrainian flag to simulate the Maidan protests that led to the ousting of Ukraine's pro-Moscow leader, Viktor Yanukovych. Summary:","completion":"Pyotr Pavlensky is a Russian performance artist known for his shocking and audacious acts of protest against the Russian government and its security services. Some of his previous acts include nailing his scrotum to the floor in Moscow's Red Square, cutting off part of his earlobe, and sewing his lips shut. His most recent act involved setting fire to the door of the Lubyanka building, the historical home of Russia's security services, including the secret police and the KGB, which now houses the FSB. Pavlensky was photographed standing in front of the blaze holding a petrol can and was later arrested on suspicion of vandalism, facing up to three years in jail. The artist aims to expose the oppressive control exerted by the FSB and challenge the culture of fear that permeates Russian society.

The man killed the king with the knife.","completion":"A linguist would indeed consider the sentence \\"The man killed the king with the knife\\" to be a valid English sentence from a grammatical standpoint. In this analysis, let us break down the sentence according to its grammatical components and the linguistic rules they follow. 1. Noun phrases (NP): \\"The man,\\" \\"the king,\\" and \\"the knife\\" serve as noun phrases in this sentence. Noun phrases are used to establish the subjects and objects within a sentence that determine the flow of the action. Here, \\"The man\\" is the subject, \\"the king\\" is the direct object, and \\"the knife\\" is the indirect object. 2. Verb phrase (VP): \\"Killed\\" serves as the main verb in this sentence. A verb phrase is typically composed of a main verb, which conveys the action or state of the subject, and any auxiliary or modal verbs that may accompany it. In this sentence, there are no auxiliary or modal verbs present. 3. Prepositional phrase (PP): \\"With the knife\\" is a prepositional phrase in this sentence, and \\"with\\" is the preposition. Prepositional phrases are used to provide additional information, such as the location or means by which an action occurs. In this case, \\"with the knife\\" specifies the instrument used to carry out the killing. 4. Sentence structure: The sentence follows the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order, which is typical and expected in English. This structure enables readers to easily understand the relationship between the actor (the subject), the action (the verb), and the recipient (the object). 5. Agreement: The subject and verb in this sentence agree in both person and number, which is a crucial aspect of English grammar. In this case, \\"The man\\" is a singular noun phrase, and \\"killed\\" is a singular past tense verb that agrees with it. 6. Tense: The verb \\"killed\\" is in the simple past tense, which indicates that the action has been completed. This tense conveys the required information regarding the time and completion of the action. In conclusion, a linguist would find the sentence \\"The man killed the king with the knife\\" to be a grammatically valid English sentence. It features appropriate noun phrases, a verb phrase, a prepositional phrase, correct sentence structure, agreement between the subject and verb, and appropriate tense.

By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa. Would Tanzania have thicker or thinner \\"A horizon\\" than Kenya?","completion":"Based on the differences in organic matter accumulation between grasslands and forests, it can be inferred that Tanzania, with its larger forest cover, would likely have a thinner A horizon compared to Kenya, which has one of the largest contiguous grasslands in Africa. In grasslands, like those found in Kenya, the deep, fibrous root systems of grasses contribute significantly to the formation of a thicker A horizon as they continuously add organic matter to the soil. Additionally, grasslands often experience fires that destroy aboveground material but encourage increased contributions from the root systems, further enhancing the development of the A horizon. On the other hand, forests such as those in Tanzania have a different pattern of organic matter accumulation. The primary source of organic matter in forests comes from the fallen leaves on the forest floor, with most of the organic matter being stored in the O horizon (forest floor) and a relatively thinner A horizon. The greater acidity in forests also inhibits the action of certain soil organisms, consequently limiting the mixing of surface litter into the mineral soil, which results in the development of a thinner A horizon in forests. In conclusion, Tanzania would likely have a thinner A horizon than Kenya due to the different patterns of organic matter accumulation found in forest and grassland ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the sentence \\"A basketball player rejects another basketball players shot in midair right below the basket.\\", is the sentence \\"A basketball player jumps into the air to intercept and catch the ball.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"Based on the given sentence, \\"A basketball player rejects another basketball player's shot in midair right below the basket\\", we can infer that the basketball player managed to block or deflect the shot by the other player. This means that the action involves a defensive player preventing the ball from going into the basket. Now, analyzing the second sentence, \\"A basketball player jumps into the air to intercept and catch the ball\\", we can deduce that the action here involves a player jumping and catching the ball in midair. The word \\"intercept\\" suggests the defensive nature of the move, similar to the first sentence. However, there's a notable difference between the two sentences in terms of the specific action performed. The first sentence emphasizes that the basketball player \\"rejects\\" the shot, which means that they stopped or deflected the ball, most likely using their hands or arms to prevent it from reaching its target. The second sentence, on the other hand, focuses on the player \\"catching\\" the ball. Catching suggests that they not only stopped the ball, but also successfully gained control of it after the interception. This differs from a simple block or deflection that might result in the ball becoming loose or ending up in another player's possession. In conclusion, while both sentences touch upon a similar situation where a basketball player makes a defensive play in midair, they portray different specific actions. The first suggests a rejection or block, while the second emphasizes the defensive player catching and therefore gaining possession of the ball after intercepting it. As a result, we can't say the second sentence is unequivocally true based on the first. It might be true in a broader sense, considering both involve defensive moves, but without additional context or clarification, we can't confirm its validity as a direct correlation to the first sentence."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the title of this article: During April 2009, U.S. Federal Reserve vice-chair Janet Yellen discussed these paradoxes: \\"Once this massive credit crunch hit, it didn’t take long before we were in a recession. The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms—and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state—nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole.\\" Title:","completion":"Title: The Paradox of Deleveraging: Janet Yellen on the Recession and Credit Crunch in 2009"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Title: The Thomas Crown Affair Movie plot: At the Metropolitan Museum of Art, an attempted robbery of precious paintings fails when museum employees discover imposters posing as staff. In all the confusion of locking down the museum and capturing the robbers, Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) slips into an adjacent room and steals the painting of San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk by Monet. The insurers of the 100 million artwork send investigator Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) to assist NYPD Detective Michael McCann (Denis Leary) in solving the crime. In reviewing video of the rooms involved in both robberies, one of which was strangely \\"blank\\", Banning follows clues to discover how both robberies are connected. She quickly comes to suspect that the wealthy financier Thomas Crown is behind the theft. Banning is intrigued at his motivations and begins a game of cat-and-mouse to recover the painting. Despite the fact that both of them intuitively know what the other is up to, the two of them continue to meet in high class locations and intimate surroundings while Banning continues to search for the painting. The constant contact, matching of wits (and the romantic pursuit of Crown), cause Banning to fall in love with him. But her commitment to her job and her doubts about Crown's true intentions make her hesitate. To prove his love to her, Crown promises to return the stolen artwork to the museum. In her doubt, Banning betrays Crown's plan to Detective McCann who fills the museum with dozens of police officers in an attempt to catch him in the act. After a grand game of misdirection, the painting is returned and another one is stolen; one which Banning had previously expressed a desire to possess. Since the second stolen painting is insured by another company and her job is now finished, Banning's knowledge of Crown's plan allows her to meet him at a prearranged spot. But the person she meets instead convinces her that her betrayal has cost her more than she can bear. Crown's witty nature ultimately allows for both him and Banning to run away and live happily...

This response only provides a description of what Bailey did after carrying out the experiment, rather than explaining the reasons that drove her to do it in the first place. A detailed and long answer would delve into the motivations, thoughts, and background of Bailey to provide a comprehensive understanding of why she decided to engage in Remy's unethical experiment. For instance, a detailed answer could be: Bailey was a person with evil inclinations, which could be attributed to several factors in her life that shaped her personality and motivations. Possible factors include a difficult upbringing, exposure to unethical influences, or a deep-seated desire for power and control. These experiences might have contributed to her twisted moral compass, and led her to seek ways in which she could exert that control over people or situations. Remy's unethical experiment presented an opportunity for Bailey to indulge in her dark desires and push the boundaries of what was morally acceptable. In deciding to undertake the experiment, Bailey may have seen the potential for personal gain, such as satisfaction from inflicting harm, imposing her will on others, or even receiving rewards or recognition for her efforts from like-minded individuals. Furthermore, Bailey's decision to engage in the experiment could have been driven by a misguided view that she was doing something groundbreaking or pioneering, despite the inherent unethical nature of her actions. The allure of achieving fame or notoriety might have clouded her judgement, causing her to overlook the harm and negative consequences that would result from the experiment. Bailey's laugh maniacally after the deed was done could be seen as a manifestation of her evil nature or her delight in fulfilling her sinister motives, but it does not provide an explanation for why she chose to participate in the experiment.

He repeatedly calls on his followers to embrace martyrdom since \\"The walls of oppression and humiliation cannot be demolished except in a rain of bullets.\\" For those yearning for a lost sense of order in an older, more tranquil world, he offers his \\"Caliphate\\" as an imagined alternative to today's uncertainty. For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world. Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction. Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith. Many Americans have wondered, \\"Why do 'they' hate us?\\" Some also ask, \\"What can we do to stop these attacks?\\" Bin Laden and al Qaeda have given answers to both these questions.

The person feared at one point that she would die in prison. In the provided context, it narrows down to the daughters, Gladys Scott and Jamie Scott, and their mother, Evelyn Rasco. Initially, Evelyn Rasco might come to mind because she is being directly quoted in the passage. However, considering that she is the one who has been waiting for her daughters to be released from prison, it wouldn't be reasonable for her to fear dying in prison as she wasn't incarcerated. Therefore, it comes down to Gladys Scott and Jamie Scott, the daughters who were released from prison after 16 years. Unfortunately, the provided text doesn't specify which daughter held this fear, so we have to make an educated assumption. It would be reasonable to guess that either or both daughters might have harbored such a fear, considering their long-term imprisonment. However, given that one of the sisters was in a condition severe enough to require a kidney donation, it could be reasonably assumed that she, being in poor health, might have been the one who feared dying in prison. Unfortunately, the text does not specify which sister had the health condition requiring a kidney. In conclusion, the most fitting options from the ones provided would be either \\"Gladys told CNN she feared at one point that she would die in prison.\\" or \\"Jamie Scott told CNN she feared at one point that she would die in prison.\\" To get the most accurate answer, additional information specifying which sister has the health condition would be necessary.

Members of the unnamed tribe have taken what Science calls the \\"momentous and potentially tragic step\\" of approaching a group of Brazilian scientists in the rainforest. (It's believed to be the same tribe that was photographed a few years ago by a government plane, notes Vice, though no contact was made at that time.) The government dispatched the team of scientists to the Upper Envira River region after getting complaints from local villagers that members of the tribe had shown up and were raiding their fields. Brazil has a strict no-contact policy with such tribes—about 70 are thought to exist in the rainforest—but an Arizona anthropologist thinks it made sense to send the team in this case given the \\"serious threat of violence\\" that existed between the tribe and villagers. Little is known about the group, and scientists haven't yet identified its language, but LiveScience reports that the tribe likely came from Peru when illegal loggers and drug traffickers encroached on its territory. Maybe they \\"felt they had nowhere left to go,\\" says a member of advocacy group Survival International. Scientists have quarantined the area because the tribe's members are at high risk of picking up diseases. They'll eventually get to decide whether they want to settle in a village with ties to the modern world. Click to read about another remote tribe thought (by Westerners, anyway) to be exceedingly dull.","completion":"Title: The Encounter with an Amazon Tribe: Isolation, Invasion, and Integration Introduction The vast Amazon rainforest, covering much of the South American continent, has been a haven for indigenous groups living in remote and isolated regions for millennia. With the increasing expansion of human civilization, these tribes face the challenge of preserving their way of life and avoiding the detrimental effects of modern society. One such tribe has recently come out of isolation, approaching a group of Brazilian scientists during their expedition. The Momentous and Potentially Tragic Step The unnamed Amazon tribe, remaining disconnected from the outside world until now, made an unprecedented move when they approached a group of Brazilian scientists in the rainforest. This is believed to be the same tribe that was photographed a few years ago by a government plane, although no contact was made during that time. Brazil's No-Contact Policy and the Serious Threat of Violence Brazil has a strict no-contact policy with isolated tribes, and 70 are estimated to exist in the Amazon rainforest. Despite this policy, anthropologist Dr. Jeffrey Hays argues that it made sense for the government to dispatch a team of scientists to the Upper Envira River region after receiving complaints from local villagers, who reported tribe members raiding their fields and seeking necessary resources. This situation posed a serious threat of violence between the tribe and villagers and required intervention to avoid further conflict. Illegal Loggers and Drug Traffickers: Forces Behind the Tribe's Break from Isolation Little is known about the unnamed tribe, including their cultural origins or language. However, researchers believe the tribe likely relocated to Brazil from Peru due to encroachment by illegal loggers and drug traffickers on their territory. This forced migration led the tribe to a \\"moment of desperation,\\" which triggered their decision to contact the outside world. Quarantine and Health Risks: The Precautions in Place With its members at high risk of contracting diseases, scientists have implemented quarantine measures in the area surrounding the tribe's encounter. The indigenous community, lacking previous exposure to various pathogens, may be devastated by diseases, leading to severe illness or death. The Tribe's Future: Settlement in a Village with Ties to the Modern World The scientists' current mission is to assess the tribe's living conditions and cultural practices, while ensuring their safety and health. Once the quarantine measures are lifted, the tribe will have the opportunity to decide whether they want to settle in a village connected to the modern world or remain in their traditional lifestyle. Conclusion The story of the unnamed Amazon tribe reveals the complexities faced by indigenous communities in the Amazon rainforest. It demonstrates the critical need for understanding, respect, and support as they try to maintain their way of life while facing unprecedented threats. It also highlights the impact of ongoing deforestation, illegal logging, and drug trafficking, which continue to pose significant challenges to the rainforest and its inhabitants. As the world moves further into the 21st century, it is crucial to balance development and conservation to ensure that these tribes are given the chance to survive and thrive in a rapidly changing environment. This recent encounter with the unnamed tribe serves as a humbling reminder of the interconnectedness of our planet, and the importance of preserving the rich cultural diversity that exists within it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1880, his son John Church Hamilton commissioned Carl Conrads to sculpt a granite statue, now located in Central Park, New York City. One statue honoring Alexander Hamilton in Chicago was mired in controversy, at least concerning the surrounding architecture. Kate Sturges Buckingham (1858-1937), of the Buckingham Fountain family, commissioned the monument. Its impetus was that Treasury Secretary Hamilton \\"secured the nation's financial future and made it possible for her own family to make its fortune in grain elevators and banking. Consequently, John Angel was hired to model a figurative sculpture and the Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen was to create a \\"colossal architectural setting\\" for it.

The Reconquest: The aim of the Crusades in Spain was the eviction of the Muslims. After the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, it took four hundred years of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles, before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the Moors. On 10 September 1229, a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of Aragón and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the present-day resort of Santa Ponça. The defenders retreated inside the walls of Palma, but on the last day of 1229 the city fell, and pockets of resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the Moors — converted by force to Christianity — as well as of the island's large Jewish and Genoese trading communities. Mallorca prospered. The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual tribute to Aragón and were left in peace. The island's tranquility lasted until 1287, when Alfonso III of Aragón, smarting over a series of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for invasion. The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast to Mallorca, Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. Jaume I died after reigning in Aragón for six decades, but he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an Independent Kingdom of Mallorca, under Jaume II, followed by Sanç and Jaume III. But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for Aragón. Attempting a comeback, Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in 1349. A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, completed the Reconquest, defeating the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula, Granada, in 1492. However, the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the Balearics politically or economically.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Coal is loaded into the firebox - The boiler produces steam under high pressure - The steam generated in the boiler flows down into a cylinder - Just ahead of the wheels, pushing a tight-fitting plunger, the piston - The piston is connected to one or more of the locomotive&#x27;s wheels through a kind of arm-elbow-shoulder joint called a crank and connecting rod - As the piston pushes, the crank and connecting rod turn the locomotive&#x27;s wheels and power the train along - An outlet valve opens and the piston pushes the steam back through the cylinder and out up the locomotive&#x27;s chimney - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more virus enters cells happens, how will it affect the pressurized steam is at a lower pressure. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you proposed, which suggests that more virus entering cells might occur, appears to be unrelated to the process of steam generation and propulsion in a coal-fired steam locomotive. Therefore, any direct impact of the perturbation on the pressurized steam process is implausible. However, to provide a comprehensive answer, let's analyze each step of the process and evaluate the potential indirect effects of the perturbation on the steam locomotive's operation. 1. Coal is loaded into the firebox: This step is mainly manual labor, involving transportation and feeding coal into the firebox. The perturbation might indirectly affect this step if it were to influence the physical health or performance of the workers involved in the process. The introduction of a virus might reduce the availability of a healthy workforce and potentially affect the efficiency of coal loading. 2. The boiler produces steam under high pressure: The steam generation process depends on the controlled combustion of coal and the appropriate functioning of the boiler. The perturbation may not directly affect the steam production process, but it could have an indirect effect by causing disruptions in the manufacturing process or maintenance of the boilers, as the workforce involved might be affected by the virus. 3. The steam generated flows down into the cylinder: The transportation of steam within the locomotive relies on the proper functioning of various mechanical fixtures. The perturbation would not directly impact this, but it might lead to a lack of maintenance due to a reduced workforce affected by the virus, resulting in potential inefficiencies or malfunctions. 4. The piston pushes the steam, turning the locomotive's wheels: The effectiveness of the piston relies on the design and maintenance of the mechanical system. Although the perturbation does not affect the pressure of the steam directly, it might contribute to decreased maintenance or repairs of the mechanical system due to a diminished workforce. 5. An outlet valve opens, and the piston pushes the steam out through the chimney: This step depends on the proper functioning and maintenance of the outlet valve. Again, the perturbation might influence the availability of workforce to maintain these systems, which could cause possible inefficiencies or malfunctions in valve operation. In summary, the proposed perturbation does not have a direct effect on the pressurized steam in a steam locomotive. However, it might have indirect effects on various aspects of the locomotive's operation, mostly due to potential workforce disruptions caused by an outbreak of a virus. While the perturbation hypothesis seems unrelated to the process of coal-fired steam propulsion at first, it could create indirect impacts on the efficiency and overall performance of the locomotive through its influence on the workforce responsible for maintaining and operating the system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Francis Chan, an engineer, lives in Hampstead, north London, in a flat that's just 4ft wide by 21ft long. He loves it. Tiny though it is, it has got all the comforts. Peter Baynes, Chan's architect ,has achieved a clever piece of design, according to architectural experts. The Chan mini-house was built on what was once a path down the side of a big Victarian house. Not an inch of space is wasted. When you step in through the front door, you're standing in the shower, on Britain' s only self-cleansing doormat . A door opens on to an equally tiny toilet with washbasin. Two steps further in comes the kitchen, complete with full-sized cooker and fridge, and washer/ drier. A worktop folds down from the wall. Another step and you're into the dining/ office area. Four people can sit here for dinner, says Chan as he sets the table-top into place. He even has a fold-down drawing-board for when he's working at home. The bed is hidden under a cover board right at the back. \\"I don't even have to make the bed,\\" Chan says.\\" I just put the cover down. \\" Chan's business suits hang neatly on the wall over the bed. Daylight comes in through the skylight. The house feels like a very small boat and Chan admits he toyed with the idea of naming it the \\"boat-house\\". \\"It cost around PS4,700 to build last year.

Donald Montgomery Hutson (January 31, 1913 - June 26, 1997) was a professional American football player and assistant coach in the National Football League (NFL). He played as a split end and spent his entire eleven-year professional career with the Green Bay Packers. Under head coach Curly Lambeau, Hutson led the Packers to four NFL Championship Games, winning three: 1936, 1939, and 1944. Hutson was born on January 31, 1913, in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, one of three sons of Roy B. Hutson and Mabel Clark Hutson. While a Boy Scout, he played with snakes. He said that's where he got his quickness and agility. As a teenager Hutson played baseball for Pine Bluff's town team.

Das Ungleichgewicht zwischen der östlichen und der südlichen Dimension der Europäischen Nachbarschaftspolitik ist seit vielen Jahren ein immer wieder auftauchendes Problem. Which language is this?","completion":"The language used in the given text is German. The text highlights a recurring issue regarding the imbalance between the eastern and southern dimensions of the European Neighborhood Policy. The European Neighborhood Policy is a foreign relations instrument established by the European Union for fostering closer relationships with its neighboring countries. Now, let's discuss the issue mentioned in more detail. The European Neighborhood Policy (ENP) involves bilateral action plans or association agreements between the EU and each neighboring country to support political, economic, and social reforms and strengthen regional cooperation. The two dimensions mentioned in the question are: 1. Eastern Dimension: This dimension includes six Eastern European countries: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine. These countries are part of the Eastern Partnership, a program launched in 2009 within the framework of the ENP to support democracy-building, economic progress, and stability in these countries. 2. Southern Dimension: This dimension includes ten southern Mediterranean countries: Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine, Syria, and Tunisia. These countries are members of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM), an intergovernmental organization founded in 2008 to facilitate cooperation and dialogue between the EU and Mediterranean partners. The imbalance between the eastern and southern dimensions of the ENP can be attributed to a few factors: 1. Different geopolitical and historical contexts: The eastern neighbors have strong historical, cultural, and economic ties with the EU, particularly with Eastern European member states. Many of them are former Soviet republics that have since developed aspirations for European integration, leading to a higher level of engagement with the EU. The southern neighbors, in contrast, face a set of different and complex challenges, including political instability, conflicts, socio-economic disparities, and various degrees of development, limiting their ability to actively engage in the ENP. 2. EU's strategic priorities and interests: The EU’s approach to the East is primarily driven by the concern to stabilize its eastern neighborhood and promote democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. In contrast, the primary focus in the southern neighborhood has been more on migration control and energy security, rather than addressing the root causes of the underlying challenges and supporting sustainable development. 3. Varying political will and commitment: Some countries in the eastern dimension have demonstrated a stronger commitment to aligning with EU values and principles. This is seen most notably in Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova, who have signed Association Agreements containing Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Areas (DCFTA). However, many southern partner countries face significant domestic challenges, such as the competing influence of regional powers, political fragmentation, and violent conflicts, making it difficult to commit to comprehensive reforms. 4. Inconsistent EU policy approaches: While there have been several initiatives and programs created to address issues in both dimensions, critics have argued that the implementation of the ENP has been inconsistent and not always tailored to the specific needs of the partner countries. This has sometimes resulted in ineffective policy measures and a lack of tangible progress, with the EU struggling to harmonize its strategic interests with the complex realities of its neighbors. To address these imbalances, the EU should continue to adapt the ENP to the unique challenges and priorities of each partner country while ensuring that the core values of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law remain at the heart of its engagement with both eastern and southern neighbors. Efforts to strengthen political dialogue, regional cooperation, and sustainable development will also be crucial in fostering a more balanced and effective European Neighborhood Policy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

She convinces Victor to have sex with her so she can have his child and save his mother.Victor never knew his father and is anxious to obtain the information from his mother but she never recognises him when he visits and so he asks Denny to pose as him and ask her questions. Denny agrees and reveals that Victor's mother kept a diary. Victor finds it, but it is in Italian. Paige tells Victor she can read Italian and agrees to translate the diary.Victor and Paige try several times to have sex but Victor cannot maintain an erection and after discussing it with Denny he realizes he loves Paige, Paige reveals to him that his mother may have fled Italy because she stole Jesus' foreskin, and use cells to conceive Victor, making him the second coming. He is reluctant to believe but in the end believes Paige. However his mother finally recognizes him and tells him that she stole him as a baby and she has no idea who his real parents are, as she tells him this he feeds her chocolate pudding and accidentally chokes her. She dies.While Paige is trying to resuscitate Victor's mother, a hidden band around her wrist falls into Victor's view, revealing that she is actually a patient in the hospital, not a doctor. Paige then reveals that she was admitted to the hospital years ago, in a catatonic state, and fell in love with Victor through the stories his mother told her about him....

Public expenditures for education are far below the European Union average as well. Educational standards were once high, but have declined significantly since the early 2000s. Bulgarian students were among the highest-scoring in the world in terms of reading in 2001, performing better than their Canadian and German counterparts; by 2006, scores in reading, math and science had dropped. Although average literacy stands at 98.4% with no significant difference between sexes, functional illiteracy is significant. The PISA study of 2015 found 41.5% of pupils in the 9th grade to be functionally illiterate in reading, maths and science. The Ministry of Education and Science partially funds public schools, colleges and universities, sets criteria for textbooks and oversees the publishing process. Education in primary and secondary public schools is free and compulsory. The process spans through 12 grades, where grades one through eight are primary and nine through twelve are secondary level.

A cave family called the Croods survives a natural disaster, due to the overprotective nature of their stubborn and stern patriarch named Grug. The only one who questions the family's sheltered life is his teenaged daughter Eep, who frequently disobeys her father's orders out of curiosity, which he finds dangerous. Grug and Eep, along with her mother and his wife Ugga, her grandmother Gran, and her younger brother and sister, Thunk and Sandy, face time sheltered in their cave home. Eep sneaks out when she sees what she discovers to be a torch of fire, and she encounters an inventive modern human boy named Guy and his pet sloth Belt. He warns her of an impending apocalypse and offers to take her with him, but concerned for her family, Eep stays, getting a shell horn from him to blow in case she needs his help. Reuniting with her frantic family, she tries to tell them what Guy told her, but fearing things that are \\"different\\" and \\"new\\", they destroy her horn. A massive earthquake then destroys their home, and to avoid carnivores and omnivores, they descend down into a tropical forest that lay hidden behind their cave all the time. Encountering a \\"Macawnivore\\", a brightly colored feline that Gran dubs \\"Chunky\\", the family flees him until he is scared off by swarms of piranhakeets that devour a ground whale. Using another horn, Eep calls to Guy who rescues them from the birds with his fire. After a great deal of confusion regarding their first contact with fire, Grug imprisons Guy in a log until he can guide them somewhere safe. Guy suggests the Croods go to a mountain where there are caves because the Crood family desires a cave. Grug refuses at first, but he decides to go with the promise of a cave. The other Croods were worried that they would get tired and bicker, but Grug doesn't listen. Answer:","completion":"The apocalypse that Guy warns Eep about turns out to be a series of catastrophic natural disasters, including massive earthquakes and destructive animal attacks. These events ultimately force the cave family, the Croods, to leave the safety of their cave home and venture into the unknown world outside. As the disasters unfold, the family encounters a diverse range of new environments and creatures, such as the vibrant and dangerous \\"Macawnivore\\" and the deadly swarms of piranhakeets. Guy, an inventive modern human boy who Eep meets, teaches the Croods about innovative tools and ideas, like fire, as they navigate their way through the newly revealed landscapes. Initially resistant to the changes and challenges presented by the apocalypse, the Croods eventually open themselves up to new possibilities and learning from Guy, while seeking out a new and safe cave to call their home. Throughout their journey, the Croods not only face the physical dangers of the apocalypse but also confront internal struggles within their family dynamic, such as dealing with the overprotective nature of Grug, their patriarch. Ultimately, the apocalypse that Guy warns Eep about forces the family to challenge their fears, embrace the world outside their cave, and adapt themselves to change and growth in order to survive."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words. Problem:Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be derived from somatic cells by gene transfer of reprogramming transcription factors. Expression levels of these factors strongly influence the overall efficacy to form iPSC colonies, but additional contribution of stochastic cell-intrinsic factors has been proposed. Here, we present engineered color-coded lentiviral vectors in which codon-optimized reprogramming factors are co-expressed by a strong retroviral promoter that is rapidly silenced in iPSC, and imaged the conversion of fibroblasts to iPSC. We combined fluorescence microscopy with long-term single cell tracking, and used live-cell imaging to analyze the emergence and composition of early iPSC clusters. Applying our engineered lentiviral vectors, we demonstrate that vector silencing typically occurs prior to or simultaneously with the induction of an Oct4-EGFP pluripotency marker. Around 7 days post-transduction (pt), a subfraction of cells in clonal colonies expressed Oct4-EGFP and rapidly expanded. Cell tracking of single cell-derived iPSC colonies supported the concept that stochastic epigenetic changes are necessary for reprogramming. We also found that iPSC colonies may emerge as a genetic mosaic originating from different clusters. Improved vector design with continuous cell tracking thus creates a powerful system to explore the subtle dynamics of biological processes such as early reprogramming events.

Answer the following question: WHITE HOUSE — A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, the House of Representatives is set to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations as well as other issues that have divided the country’s major political parties. The outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party’s conservative and moderate wings. The compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide 25 billion in funding for Trump’s much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Republicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Party leaders, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have lobbied lawmakers this week in hopes of securing their support for the legislation. “We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,” Ryan said Wednesday before Trump announced he would sign an executive order to end breaking up families. The president’s policy retreat followed a withering attack by Republican and Democratic officials who characterized the family separations as inhumane. The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited. “It’s about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,” Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota.

The defending Premier League champion didn't lose any ground in the title race -- although repeating was already looking unlikely -- but the Red Devils did slip 12 points behind a Champions League spot after the most recent round of games last weekend. And United wasn't just beaten on Sunday. It was outclassed by arch-rival Liverpool at Old Trafford, 3-0. While Liverpool routinely threatened thanks to the likes of in-form pair Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge, United's high-profile duo of Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie were never a problem for the Reds' sometimes shaky defense.

They compare the movie to Jay and Silentbob movies, saying they are funnier and crazier. This can be seen as both a comparison and a recommendation for similar films. 5. The reviewer calls Cheech a sellout and asks where Chong is, which seems to be a negative commentary on the actors' career paths but not the reviewed movie itself.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write a summary based on this article: A new study has suggested that total agreement between witnesses or overwhelming evidence in a court case should raise suspicions of bias and lower confidence in a result. In a study to be published in The Proceedings of The Royal Society A, researchers found that unanimity should raise questions in situations where there is a lot of prior uncertainty. The paper shows, for instance, that a police line-up where victims all agree on the identity of an attacker is actually less likely to be correct than one where there is some disagreement between witnesses. Similarly, a set of DNA samples that are all in perfect agreement could be evidence of an underlying systemic error. Speaking with Lawyers Weekly, lead researcher Professor Derek Abbott, a physicist and electronic engineer at The University of Adelaide, said the study, while principally mathematical, was highly relevant to the legal profession. Professor Abbott said the principle uncovered in the paper is not a new one and has been in the “collective subconscious of society” for some time. One example of this, cited in the paper, is Jewish law in the classical era. As stated in the Talmud, defendants facing the death sentence were acquitted if all 23 judges (‘the Sanhedrin’) found them guilty. “There is some evidence, like the Jewish [law] from centuries ago, that show that people have some inkling of this sort of thing because they would let somebody off being executed if everybody agreed that they should be executed,” said Professor Abbott. “It seems counter-intuitive, it seems that defies logic, but it's also saying that perhaps if everybody is in total agreement there's been a collusion or a bias so you have to be careful of that.” Professor Abbott said his research team were, however, surprised by their finding and branched into diverse areas, including law, as a “sanity check”. “When something is counter-intuitive you try to apply it to something that is more familiar to people and see if it still makes sense,” he said. But there are some obvious examples where this logic clearly holds, he continued. For instance, when a party receives 100 per cent of a vote in an election there is usually reason to suspect rigging. “You can see that straight away,” he said. “If there is too much unanimity, there is something wrong.” “So the next question you have to ask is, 'but hang on a minute, surely there are instances where unanimity is a good thing?’” Professor Abbott continued. “That's right. You've got to distinguish the two cases.” “If I have, instead of a police line-up, a line-up of bananas and one apple and a million people will come along one after another and say, ‘yep, that's the apple’, there will be no disagreement about that. \\"It will be absolutely unanimous. That form of unanimity is correct. That's incontrovertible.” The difference between this and a real police line-up is that there is prior uncertainty in the later scenario. According to Professor Abbott, the misidentification rate can be as high as 48 per cent in police line-ups. “So that's almost 50 per cent – that's almost like tossing a coin,” he said. “So if you are expecting almost 50 per cent of the time that your witnesses should get it wrong, if 20 witnesses are all agreeing then that can't be right, because you are already expecting half of them to be wrong.” The study, which is grounded in Bayesian analysis, could also hold for modern juries or even High Court decisions, according to Professor Abbott. “If a case is unanimous, one has to then question why it is unanimous,” he said. “Is it because the case was a clear one or was it because there was some systemic bias there?” Like this story?

In a new paper to be published in Proceedings of the Royal Society A, a team of researchers has found that overwhelming evidence without a dissenting opinion can in fact weaken the credibility of a case, or point to a failure of the system. One of the examples cited by the research team is an ancient Jewish law that said a suspect could not be convicted of a capital crime if all judges unanimously handed down a guilty verdict. \\"It might sound counterintuitive to say that a unanimous verdict could be wrong, but this ancient law indicated that the system may be in error if there was complete agreement among the judiciary,\\" says corresponding author Professor Derek Abbott, a probability expert from the University of Adelaide's School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering. The team put three different scenarios to the test based on mathematical probability: the use of witnesses to confirm the identity of a criminal suspect; the accurate identification of an archaeological find; and the reliability of a cryptographic system. They found in each case that there was a point at which \\"too much of a good thing\\" actually weakened confidence in the result. \\"In our first example, we imagine there are 13 witnesses who all confidently identify a criminal suspect after seeing the suspect briefly. But getting a large group of unanimous witnesses in these circumstances is unlikely, according to the laws of probability. It's more likely the system itself is unreliable,\\" says Professor Abbott. \\"In our scenario, the probability that a suspect is guilty is strong after three positive identifications by witnesses. But our tests showed that the more positive confirmations you have beyond those three, the more it erodes our confidence that this is the right person being identified. \\"The situation would be quite different if the witnesses had all been taken hostage for a month by the suspect. Then you would expect them all to agree very well who the kidnapper was. \\"The ancient Jewish legal practice referred to in our work indicates a surprising level of intuitive sophistication for the time, when such statistical tools would not have been at their disposal. They knew that it was rare for everyone to agree,\\" Professor Abbott says. # Media Contact: Professor Derek Abbott School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering The University of Adelaide Phone: +61 8 8313 5748 derek.abbott@adelaide.edu.au ||||| Summary:","completion":"A study by the University of Adelaide warns that total agreement between witnesses or overwhelming evidence in a court case should raise suspicions of bias, and lower confidence in a result.

Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: Udayananu Tharam is the story of Udayabhanu (Mohanlal), a worshipper of films and an immensely talented assistant film director, who yearns to write and direct his own movie at a time when the industry is filled with dubious filmmakers. Rajappan Thengummoodu (Sreenivasan) is a rather crooked friend of Udayabhanu and an aspiring and failed actor. As Udayabhanu finally prepares to shoot his first movie based on his own script, he discovers to his horror that Rajappan has stolen his manuscript, and shooting is underway with Rajappan playing the lead, which eventually propels him to stardom. Udhayabhanu soon finds himself faced with a career and personal crisis, with his faltering relations with his superstar wife Madhumati (Meena Durairaj) contributing to the latter. Later, with the help of producer Babykuttan (Mukesh), Udayabanu prepares to direct another film, but he is forced to cast Rajappan as the hero since he was the star with most screen value at that time. Rajappan takes up the offer, since he is also at a plateau of his career, but refuses to co-operate and throws tantrums and causes maximum trouble when possible. He spends most of his time actively flirting with the actresses in the film. Towards the end of the shoot - using a perceived insult as a ruse, Rajappan leaves the set leaving the movie unfinished with the hope that this will destroy Udayabanu's career for ever. But Udayabanu devises clever tactics and shoots the remaining scenes with Rajappan without him even being aware of it. At the end - the film is a critical and box office success, but Rajappan realises his mistakes and admits publicly that Udayabanu is the real star and not himself.

By the time the war broke out, he had been promoted to the rank of Second Lieutenant, and was in command of Company C, 1st Battalion, Malay Regiment after the death of the British company commander, Captain H R Rix. His exploits and bravery in combat while leading his men against the Japanese Imperial Army became legendary. The two known engagements he was involved in are: The Battle of Pasir Panjang, and The Battle of Bukit Chandu or Opium Hill. Both battles occurred during the final phase of the Japanese Imperial Army's assault on the city of Singapore during the Battle of Singapore. He later was executed after the battle. Three versions of his death are recorded. However, the official version will record that he was executed by Japanese troops in anger for his stubbornness in holding his position and inflicting large casualties on Japanese troops. In the film, General Tomoyuki Yamashita commented on the leftenant's bravery and valour before Adnan's execution possibly as a lesson for the Japanese troops and said that if there were ten more soldiers like Adnan in the British Colonial Forces in Malaya at that time, he would have needed ten more divisions to conquer Malaya.

To the masses the Japanese cinema means all those monsters we've grown to love destroying those Japanese cities over and over again, lots of times in battles with each other. The first and greatest of these is Godzilla who's come back a dozen times or more and in a few films faced the three headed hydra like monster from outer space, Ghidrah. Oddly enough in keeping with the times, the special effects got slightly better. But part of the charm of those old films was seeing those paper mache city sets destroyed, they looked so phony, maybe three steps above Ed Wood. Some visitors from the future have time traveled to Japan to urge that Godzilla be destroyed from when he was first discovered.

But later on with atomic testing on Bikini, Godzilla the friendly dinosaur just like Barney became the mean machine we've grown to know in the cinema. Of course you eliminate Godzilla than you give Ghidrah a clear field to wreck Japan so it does not become the economic colossus it was by 1991 when the film came out.

Sissinghurst Castle Garden, at Sissinghurst in the Weald of Kent in England, was created by Vita Sackville-West, poet and writer, and her husband Harold Nicolson, author and diplomat. It is among the most famous gardens in England and is designated Grade I on Historic England's register of historic parks and gardens. It was bought by Sackville-West in 1930, and over the next thirty years, working with, and later succeeded by, a series of notable head gardeners, she and Nicolson transformed a farmstead of \\"squalor and slovenly disorder\\" into one of the world's most influential gardens. Following Sackville-West's death in 1962, the estate was donated to the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. It is one of the Trust's most popular properties, with nearly 200,000 visitors in 2017. The gardens contain an internationally respected plant collection, particularly the assemblage of old garden roses. The writer Anne Scott-James considered the roses at Sissinghurst to be \\"one of the finest collections in the world\\". A number of plants propagated in the gardens bear names related to people connected with Sissinghurst or the name of the garden itself.

Article: Cycling isn't always easy. Busy streets and few bike lanes and parking areas can make it a battle. But not even these difficulties can stop Europeans' love for cycling. According to Reuters, more bicycles have been sold than cars in 26 of the European Union's 28 states this year. In some European countries, people really love bicycles. \\"People ride to work and take their bikes to the grocery store\\", Bill Strickland, editor of Bicycling magazine, told the reporter from Reuters. So what has led to cycling's growing popularity in Europe? Cycling is \\"a safe, clean, healthy, inexpensive way to get around town,\\" the Daily Star concluded. \\"It not only reduces traffic problems and pollution, but also contributes to public health.\\" Bike-friendly rules have also been made. Dozens of cities have joined a European Union initiative to make bicycles a form of city transport, like cars. Quite a few cities such as Stockholm, London, Florence and Munich now offer special bike lanes. Copenhagen takes it a step further by keeping bicycles and cars separated as much as possible. On these _ , traffic lights are designed to the rhythms of bicycles, not cars. For people living far from city centers, getting to work by bicycle alone may take too much time. That's why many European countries now allow cyclists to bring their bicycles onto subway trains. Europeans are also creative in solving parking problems. Amsterdam has come up with a high-tech solution: you lock your bike to a rack , which then goes underground. When you want your bike back, it is brought back to the surface. Question: The writing style of the passage is a(n) _ . Options: A: tour guide B: news report C: interview D: story A:","completion":"The writing style of the passage is a(n) B: news report. Step 1: Identify the purpose of the passage. The passage provides information about the popularity of cycling in Europe, the reasons behind it, and the initiatives taken by cities to promote cycling. Step 2: Analyze the structure and flow of the passage. The passage starts by stating a fact about the number of bicycles sold in Europe, followed by quotes from experts (e.g., Bill Strickland, editor of Bicycling magazine) and examples of cities implementing bike-friendly rules and solutions like bike lanes and bicycle parking. Step 3: Compare passage characteristics with the options provided. A: tour guide - The passage does not provide navigational guidance or recommendations for travelers. It is more focused on discussing cycling in Europe in general. B: news report - The passage presents facts, quotes from experts, statistics, and examples of initiatives in a neutral and informative tone, which is characteristic of a news report. C: interview - Although it has quotes from experts, it is not solely based on a conversation between a journalist and an interviewee. D: story - The passage does not have a narrative structure or a fictional/non-fictional storyline. It presents facts. Considering the characteristics mentioned above, option B: news report best describes the writing style of the passage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the premise \\"People at a photo shoot.\\" true if \\"People are taking pictures.\\"?","completion":"The relationship between the premise \\"People at a photo shoot\\" and the statement \\"People are taking pictures\\" can be analyzed by determining if one can truly imply the other or not. Considering the first statement, \\"People at a photo shoot,\\" implies a specific context in which people are present, such as a scheduled event or a predetermined arrangement for the purpose of photography. It implies that there is some degree of organization, planning, and possibly even professionalism involved. A photo shoot can involve various elements such as photographers, models, make-up artists, stylists, and even a creative director. While it is clear that photography is the main focus of a photo shoot, it may involve additional elements, such as designing, advertising, or personal branding. On the other hand, the statement \\"People are taking pictures\\" is a more general and broader observation. It implies that there are individuals engaging in the act of capturing images with a camera or any other device capable of capturing images, like smartphones. This activity does not have any specific boundary or context and can take place in numerous situations. People taking pictures can involve various scenarios, such as tourists capturing memories during their travels, parents photographing their children, friends sharing pictures on social media, or even a street photographer capturing candid moments. Although both statements involve the activity of photography, they exist on different levels of specificity and context. Therefore, the statement \\"People are taking pictures\\" doesn't necessarily imply that \\"People are at a photo shoot.\\" It is plausible that people could be taking pictures on their own terms without being involved in a more organized and professional setting. In conclusion, while the act of taking pictures is present in both statements, they cannot be considered equivalent or interchangeable. The statement \\"People are taking pictures\\" is a broader observation that encompasses a wide range of contexts and scenarios, whereas \\"People at a photo shoot\\" refers to a more specific and organized setting. However, it is important to note that if people are taking pictures as part of an organized or professional event, it can be considered true that they are at a photo shoot. In other words, if more information is provided to clarify the context of the statement \\"People are taking pictures,\\" it can be determined whether or not it aligns with the premise \\"People at a photo shoot.\\""},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Péter Zsoldos - Péter Zsoldos (April 20 1930 – September 26 1997) was a Hungarian science fiction author who largely wrote about themes common in US/UK science fiction like space travel and robots.

When someone is being stalked and receiving threats, it is important for them to take such situations seriously and ensure their safety. Here are some steps Lee could take in response to these threats: 1. Report to the authorities: Lee should report the threats to the local police department as soon as possible. It is crucial to have an official record of the incident and any subsequent threats. Remember to provide the police with all relevant evidence, such as messages, emails, or anything else that can be traced back to the stalker. 2. Preserve evidence: Keep a record of all threats and incidents, including dates, times, and details. Save any texts, voicemails, or emails received and take screenshots of any online messages or posts. This evidence may be useful in the future if legal action is necessary. 3. Inform friends, family, and work colleagues: It is essential to let those closest to Lee know about the situation so that they can be on the lookout for any unusual behavior or suspicious individuals. 4. Restrict personal information: Lee should review his social media accounts and privacy settings, and consider limiting the amount of personal information shared online. This can help reduce the stalker's ability to follow and harass him. 5. Seek a restraining order: If the threats continue and Lee feels his safety is at risk, he may want to consult with an attorney to discuss the possibility of seeking a restraining order, which can legally prevent the stalker from contacting him. 6. Utilize personal security measures: Take necessary precautions to ensure personal safety, such as changing daily routines, avoiding walking alone at night, and being aware of surroundings. 7. Seek professional help: If the stress and fear caused by the stalker become overwhelming, it may be helpful for Lee to consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor who has experience in dealing with such situations.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which SI base unit is defined as ‘the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1 ⁄ 299792458 of a second’????","completion":"The SI base unit defined as ‘the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second’ is the meter (or metre, using the British spelling). To provide a more comprehensive understanding, let's delve into the history, definition, and usage of the meter. History: Initially, the meter was defined in 1793 by the French Academy of Sciences as one ten-millionth of the distance between the Earth's equator and the North Pole through Paris. Following technological advancements, this definition underwent further revisions. In 1960, the meter was redefined as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of the orange-red light emitted by the krypton-86 atom in a vacuum. Later in 1983, the International Committee on Weights and Measures (CIPM) introduced the current definition, which relies on the speed of light in a vacuum. Definition: According to the current definition established by the 17th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) in 1983, the meter is the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second. This definition uses the speed of light in vacuum, which is precisely 299,792,458 meters per second. As a result of this definition, the speed of light is now a defined constant rather than a measured value, increasing the accuracy and precision of distance measurements. Usage: The meter, symbolized as 'm', is a fundamental unit of length in the International System of Units (SI). It serves as a base for various derived units, such as square meters (m², for area), cubic meters (m³, for volume), and many units in the scientific and engineering domains. The meter plays a crucial role in both everyday use and advanced scientific research, with direct applications in distance measurement, building construction, manufacturing, transportation, navigation, surveying, and telecommunications, among many other fields. In summary, the meter is the SI base unit of length, currently defined as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second. This definition, utilizing the constant speed of light, has enhanced the precision and reliability of distance measurements and serves as an essential foundation for various scientific and engineering applications."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The townsfolk eagerly await the annual Royal Ball held by the charming Prince Ashton. Cinderella dreams of attending the Royal Ball and falling in love, but her cruel stepsisters are fiercely jealous of her natural beauty and grace. They are relentless in making her life miserable by treating her as a housemaid, burdening her with never-ending chores. Despite their cruelty, Cinderella remains kind-hearted and strong-willed, hoping that someday happiness would find her. As the Royal Ball approaches, Cinderella's Fairy Godmother grants Ella the gift of a stunningly beautiful gown, made from the finest fabrics in Tulle Valley. It sparkles with thousands of crystals and embodies the essence of Cinderella's beautiful spirit. The night before the ball, Cinderella's gown catches the eye of Anastasia and Drizella, who are consumed with envy. The sisters hatch a plan to sabotage her chances of finding happiness.

Let me break down the similarities and differences in these two sentences: 1. Sentence 1: \\"She lives in Bandra, Mumbai, and has a son Aditya Bhattacharya, film director, and two daughters, Chimmu and Anwesha Arya, a writer.\\" In this sentence, the woman's residence in Bandra, Mumbai is mentioned first, followed by the information about her children. The 'and' between \\"Mumbai\\" and \\"has\\" connects the two pieces of information into a single statement, which makes the sentence a compound sentence. The description of her children includes their names, as well as their respective professions, that is, a film director for her son and a writer for one of the daughters. The other daughter's profession is not mentioned in the sentence. 2. Sentence 2: \\"She lives in Bandra, Mumbai. She has a son Aditya Bhattacharya, film director, and two daughters, Chimmu and Anwesha Arya, a writer.\\" This sentence conveys the same information as the first one but separates the information about the woman's residence and her children into two distinct sentences. Here, the residence information is in the first sentence, and the information about her children, including their names and professions, is shared in the second sentence. The description of the son being a film director and one of the daughters being a writer remains the same. Once again, the other daughter's profession is not mentioned. In summary, both sentences share the same meaning, detailing the woman's place of residence in Bandra, Mumbai, and her children's names and respective professions. The key difference is that the first sentence combines this information in a compound sentence, while the second sentence separates the information into two simple sentences.

Write an email with the subject line \\"Summary of SoCalGas Unbundling Customer Meeting\\".","completion":"Subject: Summary of SoCalGas Unbundling Customer Meeting Dear [Recipient's Name], I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to provide you with a comprehensive summary of the recent SoCalGas Unbundling Customer Meeting that took place on [Meeting Date]. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss and address the upcoming unbundling of the Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) services and the potential impacts on its customers. The following paragraphs will outline the key points, discussions, and decisions taken during the meeting. Introduction: The SoCalGas representatives opened the meeting by explaining the primary rationale behind the unbundling process—that the company is looking to separate its core services to enhance efficiency, transparency, and customer choice. The unbundling will primarily entail splitting the transportation, storage, and customer service functions into distinct business units. This measure is being undertaken in response to regulatory requirements by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and is expected to take effect starting [Effective Date]. Transportation: As part of the unbundling process, the transportation segment will now provide customers with open access to gas transmission and distribution services. By doing so, it should allow more suppliers to enter the market and increase competition. SoCalGas also reassured customers that the existing infrastructure of pipelines and compressors would not be affected, and the changes would be purely organizational. Customers will still be able to rely on the safety and reliability of the company's transportation services. Storage: The meeting highlighted the proposal for the storage services segment to now operate independently, under transparent and non-discriminatory access policies. Going forward, customers will have the option to choose from a range of storage products, such as firm storage, interruptible storage, and storage loans. This approach aims to provide various options that cater to customers' individual gas storage requirements. Customer Service: SoCalGas stressed the importance of maintaining a high level of customer service quality during the transition. Representatives informed attendees that the customer services segment would continue to provide billing, meter reading, and emergency response services. Additionally, customer support teams will be available to address any queries and concerns that may arise due to the unbundling process. Transition Timeline and Next Steps: The company outlined the planned timeline for implementing the various changes due to unbundling. Key milestones and dates were presented, which included completion of functional separation, communication with regulatory agencies, and updates to customer contracts. Attendees were informed that further details regarding the exact procedures and adjustments would be provided in the upcoming weeks. Customer Concerns and Feedback: The meeting ended with an interactive session where customers were encouraged to raise their concerns or provide feedback on the proposed unbundling process. Several attendees expressed their apprehensions regarding potential disruptions or changes in service quality. SoCalGas representatives reassured them that there would be minimal impact on customers and that their concerns would be carefully considered when finalizing the implementation plans. In conclusion, the SoCalGas Unbundling Customer Meeting served as an open platform for discussing the upcoming changes and addressing customer concerns. The company is committed to ensuring a smooth transition by maintaining its service quality and communicating effectively with all impacted stakeholders. Further updates will be shared in the coming weeks, and customers are encouraged to reach out to SoCalGas with any questions or feedback. If you have any questions regarding the meeting or need further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact me at [Your Email Address] or [Your Phone Number]. Thank you for your attention, and I hope this summary provides you with the necessary information on the SoCalGas unbundling progress.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - The Neolithic Age, Era, or Period, or New Stone Age, was a period in the development of human technology, beginning about 10,200 BC, according to the ASPRO chronology, in some parts of the Middle East, and later in other parts of the world and ending between 4,500 and 2,000 BC. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - A fishing village is a village, usually located near a fishing ground, with an economy based on catching fish and harvesting seafood. The continents and islands around the world have coastlines totalling around 356,000 kilometres (221,000 mi). From Neolithic times, these coastlines, as well as the shorelines of inland lakes and the banks of rivers, have been punctuated with fishing villages. Most surviving fishing villages are traditional. - The Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Innse Gall\\"; Old Norse: \\"Suðreyjar\\") comprise a widespread and diverse archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland. There are two main groups: the Inner and Outer Hebrides. These islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the Mesolithic, and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse, and English-speaking peoples. This diversity is reflected in the names given to the islands, which are derived from the languages that have been spoken there in historic and perhaps prehistoric times. - Portessie ( Scots : Peterhythe ) is a small fishing village east of Buckie , on the north - east coast of Scotland . It is commonly nicknamed \`\` the Sloch '' , due to the name of the original settlement being Rottenslough . The village is sandwiched between Buckie and Findochty , two popular tourist spots . Portessie is home to Portessie Primary School . To the west is the March Road Industrial Estate , with a fish processing factory and the home of Cruickshanks , who make soft drinks . Strathlene Golf Club is east of the village , and is split into two fields - containing 14 and 4 holes respectively . The yearly Peter Fair , or Rathven Market can be attributed to Portessie but is more commonly linked to the community of Buckie as a whole . To the south of the village is a small community called Rathven which is home to two graveyards . There is a caravan park at Strathlene . - The Northern Isles is an archipelago comprising a chain of islands off the north coast of mainland Scotland. The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney. There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801. The islands played a significant naval role during the world wars of the 20th century. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - Banffshire is a historic county, registration county and lieutenancy area of Scotland. - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea. - Seafood is any form of sea life regarded as food by humans. Seafood prominently includes fish and shellfish. Shellfish include various species of molluscs, crustaceans, and echinoderms. Historically, sea mammals such as whales and dolphins have been consumed as food, though that happens to a lesser extent in modern times. Edible sea plants, such as some seaweeds and microalgae, are widely eaten as seafood around the world, especially in Asia (see the ). In North America, although not generally in the United Kingdom, the term \\"seafood\\" is extended to fresh water organisms eaten by humans, so all edible aquatic life may be referred to as seafood. For the sake of completeness, this article includes all edible aquatic life. - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - Buckie is a burgh town (defined as such in 1888) on the Moray Firth coast of Scotland in Moray. Buckie was the largest town in Banffshire by some thousands of inhabitants before regionalisation in 1975 removed that political division from the map of Scotland. The town is the third largest in the Moray Council area after Elgin and Forres and within the definitions of statistics published by the General Register Office for Scotland was ranked at number 75 in the list of population estimates for settlements in Scotland mid-year 2006. Buckie lies virtually equidistant to Banff to the east and Elgin to the west with both communities being approximately 17 miles distant whilst Keith lies 12 miles to the south by road. - Findochty (pronounced as written, but known locally as Finechty), ) is a village in Moray, Scotland, historically part of Banffshire. One of the earliest references to Findochty is in 1440, in which year the King granted Findachtifeild to John Dufe, son of John Dufe. The lands passed from the Duffs to the Ogilvies of Findlater and subsequently, in 1568, the Ord family acquired the manor, port, custom and fishers' lands of Findochty, and later built the House of Findochty, known as Findochty Castle, now a ruin, which stands to the west of the village. In 1716 the Ords brought 13 men and 4 boys from Fraserburgh under contract to fish from Findochty, and for a time the harbour was busy with landings of herring and white fish. Findochty expanded as a fishing port through the 1700s and 1800s, and by 1850 was home to 140 fishing boats. But the expansion in the late 1800s of nearby Buckie provided a better harbour, and some of the fishing fleet had left Findochty by 1890. Findochty harbour is now used mostly by pleasure craft and is a good sun spot when the tide is out. A local artist, Correna Cowie created a statue in 1959 of a seated fisherman, known as The Mannie, who watches over the harbour. - The Moray Firth (Scottish Gaelic: \\"An Cuan Moireach\\", \\"Linne Mhoireibh\\" or \\"Caolas Mhoireibh\\") is a roughly triangular inlet (or firth) of the North Sea, north and east of Inverness, which is in the Highland council area of north of Scotland. It is the largest firth in Scotland, stretching from Duncansby Head (near John o' Groats) in the north, in the Highland council area, and Fraserburgh in the east, in the Aberdeenshire council area, to Inverness and the Beauly Firth in the west. Therefore, three council areas have Moray Firth coastline: Highland to the west and north of the Moray Firth and Highland, Moray and Aberdeenshire to the south. The firth has more than 800 kilometres (about 500 miles) of coastline, much of which is cliff. - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around . - Forres is a town and former royal burgh situated in the north of Scotland on the Moray coast, approximately east of Inverness and west of Elgin. Forres has been a winner of the Scotland in Bloom award on several occasions. There are many geographical and historical attractions nearby such as the River Findhorn, and there are many historical artifacts and monuments within the town itself. - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - An economy (From Greek \\"household\\" and o \\"manage\\") is an area of the production, distribution, or trade, and consumption of goods and services by different agents in a given geographical location. Understood in its broadest sense, 'The economy is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the production, use and management of resources'. Economic agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments. Economic transactions occur when two parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency, but monetary transactions are only a small part of the economic domain. - Moray (; or \\"\\", ) is one of the 32 Local Government council areas of Scotland. It lies in the north-east of the country, with coastline on the Moray Firth, and borders the council areas of Aberdeenshire and Highland. - The General Register Office for Scotland (GROS) was a non-ministerial directorate of the Scottish Government that administered the registration of births, deaths, marriages, divorces and adoptions in Scotland. It was also responsible for the statutes relating to the formalities of marriage and conduct of civil marriage in Scotland. It administered the census of Scotland's population every ten years. It also kept the Scottish National Health Service Central Register. On 1 April 2011 it was merged with the National Archives of Scotland to form National Records of Scotland. All the former department's functions continue as part of the new body. - A burgh was an autonomous corporate entity in Scotland and Northern England, usually a town, or toun in Scots. This type of administrative division existed from the 12th century, when King David I created the first royal burghs. Burgh status was broadly analogous to borough status, found in the rest of the United Kingdom. Following local government reorganization in 1975 the title of \\"royal burgh\\" remains in use in many towns, but now has little more than ceremonial value.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What album title was taken from a passage in a Stephen King novel? , can you please find it? Ride the Lightning is the second studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released on July 27, 1984, by the independent record label Megaforce Records. The album was recorded in three weeks with producer Flemming Rasmussen at the Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The artwork, based on a concept by the band, depicts an electric chair being struck by lightning flowing from the band logo. The title was taken from a passage in Stephen King's novel The Stand. Although rooted in the thrash metal genre, the album showcased the band's musical growth and lyrical sophistication. This was partly because bassist Cliff Burton introduced the basics of music theory to the rest of the band and had more input in the songwriting. Instead of relying strictly on fast tempos as on its debut Kill 'Em All, Metallica broadened its approach by employing acoustic guitars, extended instrumentals, and more complex harmonies. The overall recording costs were paid by Metallica's European label Music for Nations because Megaforce was unable to cover it. It was the last album to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, and the first to feature contributions from his replacement, Kirk Hammett. Ride the Lightning received positive response from music critics, who saw it as a more ambitious effort than its predecessor. Metallica promoted the album on the Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang European tour in late 1984, and on its North American leg in the first half of 1985. The band performed at major music festivals such as Monsters of Rock and Day on the Green later that year. Two months after its release, Elektra Records signed Metallica to a multi-year deal and reissued the album. Ride the Lightning peaked at number 100 on the Billboard 200 with no radio exposure. Although 75,000 copies were initially pressed for the American market, the album sold half a million by November 1987.

Birds with smaller beaks could eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks were better off. They could eat seeds of all sizes. Therefore, there was more food available to them. Many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. More of the big-beaked birds survived and reproduced. Within just a couple of years, the average beak size in the finches increased.

Sentence 2: Defence lawyers sought to have those charges thrown out, claiming the Bali court hearing Mr. Samudra 's case did not have jurisdiction over those crimes. Step 2: Compare the key components of both sentences. Both sentences mention defense lawyers trying to get charges dismissed, the reason being a lack of jurisdiction for the Bali court. Step 3: Identify any differences between the two sentences. The only difference between the two sentences is that Sentence 2 specifically mentions Mr. Samudra's case.

Q:Question: what is the system in field hockey I found the following answer on Google: A popular variant of field hockey is indoor hockey , which differs in a number of respects while embodying the primary principles of hockey. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","completion":"No, the answer provided does not directly address the system in field hockey. Instead, it mentions a variant of the game, indoor hockey. To give you a more detailed and accurate response, the system in field hockey relates to the structure, strategies, and formation patterns utilized by teams during gameplay. These strategies and formations help players optimize their performance on the field, utilizing each position to their advantage. Field hockey is typically played with 11 players on each team, including a goalkeeper. The other ten players on the field are usually divided into three main areas: forwards, midfielders, and defenders. Each position has specific roles, and a combination of these positions creates the team's formation. There are several widely-used field hockey systems, such as the 4-3-3, 4-4-2, or 3-4-3 formations. More specifically: 1. 4-3-3 Formation: In this system, there are four defenders, three midfielders, and three forwards. This formation is favored for its balance between offense and defense, as the midfielders can both assist in attacking and maintain a defensive structure when necessary. 2. 4-4-2 Formation: The 4-4-2 system consists of four defenders, four midfielders, and two forwards. This formation is more defensively oriented, as teams have a strong midfield presence and are less likely to be caught out of position. 3. 3-4-3 Formation: In the 3-4-3 formation, there are three defenders, four midfielders, and three forwards. This system is more attack-minded, as there are additional forwards dedicated to scoring. However, it may leave the team more vulnerable defensively, as there are fewer players in the backline. Each of these formations has its own strengths and weaknesses, and teams may choose a specific system depending on their opponents, team strengths, or game strategies. Coaches and players ought to continually adapt and adjust their formations based on in-game situations to achieve the best results."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

My girlfriend (at the time) and I were planning to go on a day trip on a Saturday, and so the Friday night before, we decided to celebrate our mini vacation by having a few drinks at a local bar. It was a known hangout for bikers, and had a reputation of being a rowdy place, but I was on good terms with a few of the regulars, and felt safe enough. As the night wore on, I started getting out of control, and didn’t even realize it. I loved my girlfriend deeply, and had no desire to be with anyone else, but that night I was most definitely not myself. I was told that I openly flirted with the barmaid in front of my girlfriend, bet and lost on the pool table several times, and tried to start fights with some of the patrons, as I strongly suspected that someone had slipped something into my drink. At the time, I was a seasoned drinker, and the amount of alcohol I had consumed that night was pretty minimal in comparison, so naturally I was convinced that someone was messing with me. To this day I’m still not sure if my drinks were spiked, or it was just one of those nights. I do know that I hadn’t eaten prior to that, so I would tend to choose the latter culprit, even though it pained me to admit it. I woke up the next afternoon in my own bed, with no memory of the trip home, a screaming hangover headache, and no girlfriend. She eventually forgave me, and we were together off and on for a few more years before we grew apart. I haven’t set foot in that bar since, so I have no idea if I’m barred, or how the people there felt about me. I hope they’ve moved on, but I’m still too scared to find out. It’s an experience I never want to repeat, even though I didn’t actually experience anything. :/ Question: Who had a blackout at the bar?

Answer the following question given this paragraph: CHAPTER SUMMARY 40.1 Overview of the Circulatory System In most animals, the circulatory system is used to transport blood through the body. Some primitive animals use diffusion for the exchange of water, nutrients, and gases. However, complex organisms use the circulatory system to carry gases, nutrients, and waste through the body. Circulatory systems may be open (mixed with the interstitial fluid) or closed (separated from the interstitial fluid). Closed circulatory systems are a characteristic of vertebrates; however, there are significant differences in the structure of the heart and the circulation of blood between the different vertebrate groups due to adaptions during evolution and associated differences in anatomy. Fish have a two-chambered heart with unidirectional circulation. Amphibians have a three-chambered heart, which has some mixing of the blood, and they have double circulation. Most non-avian reptiles have a three-chambered heart, but have little mixing of the blood; they have double circulation. Mammals and birds have a four-chambered heart with no mixing of the blood and double circulation. Q: In most animals, the circulatory system is used to transport blood through the what?

Question: Process: - Waste products are deposited in the blood - Blood is carried to the kidneys through the renal arteries - The kidneys contain filters inside - The filters capture the waste products - The waste is combined with water to make urine - The urine leaves the kidney and is collected in the bladder - The cleaned blood is returned to the body. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less water combined with waste to make urine happens, how will it affect LESS waste being removed from the body. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in question supposes that less water is combined with waste products to make urine, and we must analyze how this change may affect the removal of waste from the body. Indeed, this proposed perturbation will have both direct and indirect effects on the waste removal process as outlined below. Direct Effects: 1. Increased Concentration of Waste Products in Urine: If less water is combined with waste products to form urine, the concentration of waste products within the urine will increase. As a result, the removal of waste from the body may be less efficient because of this higher concentration, making it more difficult for the kidneys to filter out and effectively eliminate waste. 2. Decreased Urine Production: Less water combined with waste products will result in decreased urine production. This means that the kidneys could potentially be filtering out less waste overall, as they have less liquid medium (urea) through which to pass the waste products. In turn, this could lead to waste products accumulating in the blood and other tissues instead of being efficiently expelled from the body. Indirect Effects: 1. Effects on Kidney Function: As the kidneys have to work harder to filter out waste products due to their increased concentration, they may become overburdened and experience a decline in their overall function. Over time, this could result in kidney damage and decreased effectiveness in waste removal, further exacerbating the problem. 2. Dehydration and Fluid Imbalance: With less water being used to create urine, this may lead to insufficient fluid intake and consequent dehydration. Dehydration can cause an imbalance in electrolyte levels (such as sodium and potassium) and may also contribute to the reduction in the efficiency of waste removal, as the kidneys require a certain amount of water to perform this process effectively. 3. Effects on Other Organs and Systems: The accumulation of waste products in the body can negatively impact other organs and systems too. For example, waste build-up in the bloodstream could cause an increase in blood pressure, putting more stress on the heart and potentially causing long-term cardiovascular issues. Likewise, increased levels of waste in the tissues might put additional strain on the liver, which also plays a vital role in the removal of waste from the body. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation of less water being combined with waste to create urine would have both direct and indirect effects on the waste removal process. Not only would it make waste removal less efficient by altering the concentration of waste products in urine and decreasing urine production, but it could also have a broader impact on kidney function and overall health. Therefore, maintaining an adequate water balance is crucial for ensuring effective waste removal from the body and the optimal functioning of the kidneys and associated systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In completing the story: Step 1: Identify the ongoing conflict and the characters involved. In the provided text, the main conflict is between Eric, who is trying to evade an unknown group, and those pursuing him. Eric's ally, Natalia, is also present. Step 2: Determine the setting and other relevant circumstances. The setting isn't explicitly described in the text, but it can be inferred that the characters are in a dangerous situation due to Eric's insistence that Natalia leave. Step 3: Continue the story in a way that aligns with the given information and maintains tension. Eric's eyes darted between Natalia and Mandor, his nerves on edge. He could feel his heart pounding, and it took everything in him not to bolt right there. But leaving Natalia alone with the mysterious figure wasn't an option. Step 4: Provide character development and emotional reactions. Natalia's confusion and lack of understanding make her hesitant to follow Eric's orders. By fostering this confusion, we can create empathy for Natalia and build tension. Step 5: Introduce a new obstacle or conflict. As they continued to stare at each other, the sound of approaching footsteps echoed around them. Eric's eyes widened in panic, knowing they had little time left. Step 6: Create a resolution or cliffhanger. With urgency in his voice, Eric whispered, \\"Natalia, we can't stay here. Please, trust me. We need to go, now!\\" He reached out and grabbed her hand, pulling her towards the other end of the alley. Natalia hesitated for a moment but eventually relented, allowing herself to be led away from the unknown danger. As they disappeared into the shadows, the sound of the footsteps grew louder, closer. It was clear that Eric and Natalia's evasion was far from over, and they would need to rely on each other's strengths if they hoped to escape the relentless pursuit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Given this review: \\"Final Destination Only this and nothing more.\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend? Not at all, No, Maybe, Yes, or Definitely? Answer:","completion":"Based on the review provided, it is challenging to definitively recommend the app to a friend or not. The review \\"Final Destination Only this and nothing more.\\" is quite cryptic and does not provide clear positives or negatives about the app's functionality, usability, design or content. If we dissect the review, \\"Final Destination\\" could refer to the final stage or outcome of using the app, possibly implying that it serves a single, specific purpose. The second part, \\"Only this and nothing more\\", could be interpreted as the app being very focused and not overflowing with excessive or unnecessary features. This could be a positive aspect if the user values simplicity and directness in an app. On the other hand, this review could possibly indicate a lack of additional features or versatility in the app, which could be a downside for some users. If the app only serves one purpose and does not offer any additional benefits or functions, it may be of limited use. It really depends on what the user is looking for in an app. Therefore, unless the friend is searching for a very straightforward app that serves one direct purpose, it would be difficult to give a clear recommendation solely based on this review. For a friend who values depth, complexity and multi-functionality in an app, a recommendation might not be appropriate. Moreover, to provide a more informed recommendation, it would be beneficial to have more information and reviews about the app's performance, user experience, reliability, and specific features. A single, vague review does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the app's overall quality and usefulness. In conclusion, given the lack of detailed information and feedback in the review, the most appropriate response would lean towards \\"Maybe.\\" It simply does not provide enough information to make a definitive Yes or No recommendation.

Myself and Riah travelled, I would say all the way out too Wheelers Hill, but it’s really not that far away, unless you live on the North side, which we both do. Riah and I carried our gear on two trains and 1 bus to get to Claire’s studio out in Wheelers Hill. I can see why Claire lives here as it’s a pretty beautiful place, it’s still suburban but there are trills, hills and birds everywhere, and for someone that’s passionate about the environment I can see why she lives here. Meeting Claire was awesome, after having spoken via phone or email for so long, it was nice to speak to her in person. The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I’d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah’s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it’s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I’d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people’s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot. Our setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire’s front right and one on Claire’s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR’s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic. Everything ran super smoothly, we did the interview first then myself and Riah shot various things in Claire’s studio. Whilst shooting various things in Claire’s studio we also got a chance to both speak to her which was nice, discussing what it is like to be a woman in Melbourne’s art scene and finding out who some of her favourite artists were.

Pese a tratarse de un acuerdo pastoral, de acuerdo con El Mundo, es también un histórico acercamiento entre los dos Estados desde que se rompieron sus relaciones diplomáticas en 1951. La firma se realizó hoy en Pekín en una reunión entre Antoine Camilleri, subsecretario de Relaciones de la Santa Sede con los Estados, y Wang Chao, viceministro chino de Exteriores, y sucede mientras el papa Francisco efectúa una visita a Lituania. Para Greg Burje, portavoz de El Vaticano, el acuerdo es el inicio de \\"un proceso\\" y permitirá a los fieles en la República Popular de China \\"tener obispos que están en comunión con las autoridades chinas\\". En China existen aproximadamente doce millones de católicos, que se dividen entre una iglesia clandestina leal a la Santa Sede y el papa, y la Asociación Patriótica Católica China, organización vigilada por el Estado. Por esta razón, las autoridades gubernamentales se han encargado del nombramiento de obispos, sin contar con el consentimiento de El Vaticano. Esta situación ha producido tensiones desde que en 1951, Mao Zedong rompió las relaciones diplomáticas luego de que el papa Pío XII excomulgó a dos obispos nombrados por Pekín. El acuerdo, sin embargo, dividió a las comunidades católicas en el país asiático. Mientras que algunos buscan el acercamiento entre los Estados, otros temen una mayor represión si se cede más control a Pekín. El cardenal Joseph Zen Ze-kiun, líder de la oposición, indicó que \\"Están entregando el rebaño a las bocas de los lobos. Es una traición increíble\\". Como un paso previo al acuerdo, El Vaticano reconoció a ocho obispos nombrados por Pekín sin su consentimiento. Fuentes mencionaron que ahora los obispos serán elegidos por El Vaticano de entre los propuestos por las comunidades locales en conjunto con las autoridades de ese país. Pietro Parolin, secretario de Estado de la Santa Sede, aseguró que este suceso tiene \\"especial importancia para la vida de la Iglesia católica en China, para el diálogo entre la Santa Sede y las autoridades civiles de aquel país, y también para la consolidación de la paz [...]\\" ANSWER: El Vaticano y China Student:","completion":"¿Cuándo y dónde se firmó el acuerdo histórico entre El Vaticano y China para el nombramiento de obispos y cuál es su objetivo principal?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Background: Frank Lloyd Wright (born Frank Lincoln Wright, June 8, 1867 - April 9, 1959) was an American architect, interior designer, writer and educator, who designed more than 1,000 structures, 532 of which were completed. Wright believed in designing structures that were in harmony with humanity and its environment, a philosophy he called organic architecture. This philosophy was best exemplified by Fallingwater (1935), which has been called \\"the best all-time work of American architecture\\". His creative period spanned more than 70 years. Context: By 1901, Wright had completed about 50 projects, including many houses in Oak Park. As his son John Lloyd Wright wrote: \\"William Eugene Drummond, Francis Barry Byrne, Walter Burley Griffin, Albert Chase McArthur, Marion Mahony, Isabel Roberts and George Willis were the draftsmen. Five men, two women. They wore flowing ties, and smocks suitable to the realm. The men wore their hair like Papa, all except Albert, he didn't have enough hair. They worshiped Papa! Papa liked them! I know that each one of them was then making valuable contributions to the pioneering of the modern American architecture for which my father gets the full glory, headaches and recognition today!\\" Between 1900 and 1901, Frank Lloyd Wright completed four houses which have since been identified as the onset of the \\"Prairie style\\". Two, the Hickox and Bradley Houses, were the last transitional step between Wright's early designs and the Prairie creations. Meanwhile, the Thomas House and Willits House received recognition as the first mature examples of the new style. At the same time, Wright gave his new ideas for the American house widespread awareness through two publications in the Ladies' Home Journal. The articles were in response to an invitation from the president of Curtis Publishing Company, Edward Bok, as part of a project to improve modern house design. \\"A Home in a Prairie Town\\" and \\"A Small House with Lots of Room in it\\" appeared respectively in the February and July 1901 issues of the journal. Although neither of the affordable house plans was ever constructed, Wright received increased requests for similar designs in following years. Wright came to Buffalo and designed homes for three of the company's executives including the Darwin D. Martin House in 1904. Other Wright houses considered to be masterpieces of the Prairie Style are the Frederick Robie House in Chicago and the Avery and Queene Coonley House in Riverside, Illinois. The Robie House, with its soaring, cantilevered roof lines, supported by a 110-foot-long (34 m) channel of steel, is the most dramatic. Its living and dining areas form virtually one uninterrupted space. With this and other buildings, included in the publication of the Wasmuth Portfolio (1910), Wright's work became known to European architects and had a profound influence on them after World War I. It is sometimes called the \\"cornerstone of modernism\\". Wright's residential designs of this era were known as \\"prairie houses\\" because the designs complemented the land around Chicago. Prairie style houses often have a combination of these features: One or two-stories with one-story projections, an open floor plan, low-pitched roofs with broad overhanging eaves, strong horizontal lines, ribbons of windows (often casements), a prominent central chimney, built-in stylized cabinetry, and a wide use of natural materials--especially stone and wood. Question: What about the design was different?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Frank Lloyd Wright's designs, particularly those of his Prairie style homes, represented a significant departure from the prevailing architectural trends of his time. Firstly, Wright's designs incorporated \\"organic architecture\\", a philosophy that promoted a harmonious interaction between humanity and its environment. This ideology resulted in designs that beautifully blended into its natural surroundings rather than standing in contrast to them. One of the distinguishing features of Wright's designs was the open floor plan. This was indeed a revolutionary concept at the turn of the century when compartmentalized rooms were the norm. Wright's designs stressed the fluidity between spaces, breaking down the walls both literally and figuratively, and creating virtually uninterrupted spaces, which was evident in the Robie House. Another significant innovation in his designs was the strong emphasis on horizontal lines. This was particularly evident in the Prairie-style houses which were named so because their designs complemented the flat, expansive landscapes around Chicago. The use of low-pitched roofs with broad, overhanging eaves, together with their one or two-story structures, emphasized the horizontality and groundedness of these structures. Wright's designs also integrated an innovative arrangement and treatment of windows. He employed \\"ribbons of windows\\", often casements, that not only allowed ample natural light into the homes but also blurred the boundaries between the interior and the exterior. This characteristic reflected his belief in a strong relationship between the structure and its environment. Furthermore, Wright's Prairie homes were designed with a prominent central chimney, built-in stylized cabinetry, and wide use of natural materials, especially stone and wood. Instead of hiding these functional elements, Wright made them features of the homes, reflecting his belief that form and function should be harmoniously integrated. Wright's designs were different as his architecture didn't merely create buildings; it dictated a way of living. His designs emphasized simplicity, efficiency, and a deep connection with nature. The eventual influence of his work can be seen in modern architecture's emphasis on open spaces, minimalism, and incorporation of natural elements."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information: - A communist party is a political party that advocates the application of the social and economic principles of communism through state policy. The name originates from the 1848 tract \\"Manifesto of the Communist Party\\" by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. According to Leninist theory, a Communist party is the vanguard party of the working class (proletariat), whether ruling or non-ruling, but when such a party is in power in a specific country, the party is said to be the highest authority of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Vladimir Lenin's theories on the role of a Communist party were developed as the early 20th-century Russian social democracy divided into Bolshevik (meaning \\"\\"of the majority\\"\\") and Menshevik (meaning \\"of the minority\\") factions. Lenin, leader of the Bolsheviks, argued that a revolutionary party should be a small vanguard party with a centralized political command and a strict cadre policy; the Menshevik faction, however, argued that the party should be a broad-based mass movement. The Bolshevik party, which eventually became the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, took power in Russia after the October Revolution in 1917. With the creation of the Communist International, the Leninist concept of party building was copied by emerging Communist parties worldwide. - The South African Communist Party (SACP) is a communist party in South Africa. It was founded in 1921, was declared illegal in 1950, and participated in the struggle against apartheid. It is a partner of the Tripartite Alliance with the African National Congress and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and through this influences the South African government. - African Communist is the magazine of the South African Communist Party, published quarterly. The magazine was started by a group of Marxist-Leninists in 1959. It has its headquarters in Johannesburg. - The Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) is a trade union federation in South Africa. It was founded in 1985 and is the largest of the countrys three main trade union federations, with 21 affiliated trade unions, altogether organising 1.8 million workers. - The Tripartite Alliance is an alliance between the African National Congress (ANC), the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and the South African Communist Party (SACP). The ANC holds a majority in the South African parliament, while the SACP and COSATU have not contested any democratic election in South Africa. - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry. - Moses Mncane Mabhida ( 11 October 1923 -- 8 March 1986 ) was a South African politician . Mabhida was leader of the South African Communist Party from 1978 until his death in 1986 . - The African National Congress (ANC) is the Republic of South Africa's governing social democratic political party. It has been the ruling party of post-apartheid South Africa on the national level, beginning with the election of Nelson Mandela in the 1994 election, the first election after the end of apartheid. Today, the ANC remains the dominant political party in South Africa, winning every election since 1994. Its leader Jacob Zuma is the incumbent president of South Africa. - Apartheid was a system of institutionalised racial segregation and discrimination in South Africa between 1948 and 1991, when it was abolished. The country's first multiracial elections under a universal franchise were held three years later in 1994. Broadly speaking, apartheid was delineated into \\"petty apartheid\\", which entailed the segregation of public facilities and social events, and \\"grand apartheid\\", which dictated housing and employment opportunities by race. Prior to the 1940s, some vestiges of apartheid had already emerged in the form of minority rule by white South Africans and the socially enforced separation of black South Africans from other races, which later extended to pass laws and land apportionment. Apartheid as a policy was embraced by the South African government shortly after the ascension of the National Party (NP) during the country's 1948 general elections. Apartheid was also enforced in South West Africa until it gained independence as Namibia in 1990. What entity does 'moses mabhida' has the relation 'member of political party' with?

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the town were people moved after Elcor's land prices skyrocketed? is inside the article: In 1954, the Corsica pit was shut down. Workers were told that the shutdown was temporary because the demand for that particular type of ore had declined. The pit was allowed to flood, and Pickands Mather officially conceded that \\"temporary\\" might stretch into quite a long time, although the mine would perhaps \\"eventually\\" be reopened. A year later, Pickands Mather and Company, manager of the mines at Elcor and the land on which the houses rested, ordered residents to vacate the property. By edict of the mining company, the remaining families were forced out so that the company could reclaim the land.Sources differ on why the order was issued, speculating that the company wanted the land for a dump site, no longer wanted to tend to the town's maintenance, or decided it was not economical to own houses anymore. No one in authority revealed what was to become of the land.Residents of the company-owned houses were given the option to buy the structures at bargain prices, provided they moved them out of town. For many, it took much of their life savings to relocate elsewhere, taking their homes in caravans along the highways and leaving behind empty foundations. Most Elcor residents purchased lots in the surrounding communities, trying to beat land speculators. In the few months after Elcor's fate became official, land prices skyrocketed. Lots that had originally been priced at 75 were sold for as much as 500. Most of the remaining families moved about two miles west to Gilbert, although other homes were replanted in nearby McKinley. The last vestiges of the old mining community were gone by 1956. Every building was torn down or removed. All that remained for some years after were old foundations, sidewalks, rusting stoves, pipes, bottles, and yard shrubbery, formerly visible from the old section of Minnesota State Highway 135 between Gilbert and Biwabik.

The township is also referred to as Kilroith or Kilroyth. Richard Williams makes the claim that Cilthriew and the neighbouring house of Brynllywarch (which was also a township) were in the ownership of the Pugh (ap Hugh) family from at least 1500. A William Pugh of Kilroith is mentioned in 1632, when he purchased from Ann Foxe, widow of Somerset Foxe lands in Kilroith including Maes y Deynant William Pugh of ‘‘Kilthrew’’ was the Sheriff of Montgomeryshire in 1767 and his son William, who was also Sheriff of Montgomeryshire in 1813, became a very successful attorney and purchased the Caer Howell estate in Montgomery. His son was the notable William Pugh, an entrepreneur, who did much to develop trade and infrastructure in the Montgomeryshire Severn valley. He paid for the final extension of the Montgomery Canal from Berriew to Newtown, and for various road building schemes including a road from Abermule along the Mule valley. In Newtown he encouraged the growth of the textile industry and was responsible for the Flannel exchange, designed by Thomas Penson. In 1828 he sold the Caer Howell estate, using the proceeds to develop Brynllywarch. For this work he may have employed T G Newnham and J W Poundley as his architects and surveyors. His schemes were over ambitious and in June 1835 he fled to Caen in Normandy to escape his creditors. This resulted in the Brynllywarch and Cilthriew estates, which then consisted of 27 farms, being sold in 1839 to Richard Leyland (Bullin), a very wealthy banker from Liverpool. Leyland was to give these estates, together with the Leighton Hall Estates to his nephew John Naylor in 1846. The very detailed survey of the estates purchased by Leyland and later John Naylor, drawn up by J W Poundley, is now in the National Library of Wales. John Naylor died on13th July 1889 and the estates continued in the Naylor family ownership until about 1930, when the various farms including Cilthriew were sold.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"The task is to assess whether the given premise entails the hypothesis or not. Let's first break down and understand the premise and hypothesis clearly. Premise: The speaker mentions that their daughter has a Precious Moments collection, and they like it because it is easy to manage. Precious Moments collection refers to a set of figurines, ornaments, and other collectibles that often represent sentimental moments or occasions. Hypothesis: The speaker claims that they don't have any children. Now, let us analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise clearly states that the speaker has a daughter, which means they have at least one child. In contrast, the hypothesis claims that the speaker has no children. The two statements directly contradict each other. In order to determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we must consider if the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. In this case, the premise and hypothesis cannot both be true simultaneously. If the premise is true (i.e., the speaker has a daughter, and thus a child), then the hypothesis must be false (i.e., the speaker cannot have \\"no children\\"). In conclusion, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. These statements are contradictory, and the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. In this particular context, if the premise is true, the hypothesis must be false, and there is no logical entailment between them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Sean Mercer (John Wayne) spots one and moves out with his men to capture it. During the chase which ensues, Little Wolf, the Indian (Bruce Cabot), is gored in the leg and the rhino escapes. Kurt (Hardy Krüger), who was driving the herding jeep, blames himself for the mishap, despite what Sean says, as he feels he was herding too close. Pockets (Red Buttons), driver of the catching car, tells Sean a tourniquet isn't doing any good to stop the bleeding, and so they head into town to take the Indian to the hospital while Kurt dives back to the compound to bring Brandy (Michèle Girardon), who technically owns Momella Game Ltd., to town to meet them.The credits play while Sean and the others are driving back.Kurt arrives at the compound in the evening and tells Brandy what happened while she dresses; they depart and join the others at the hospital where they all anxiously await news of the Indians fate.

Kim Kardashian wears white mask Reality star hangs out poolside with daughter and best pal Larsa Pippen in Miami KIM Kardashian is rarely spotted looking less than camera-ready, but she was recently photographed in a white face mask as she relaxed poolside in Miami with her daughter North West and best pal Larsa Pippen. The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, 35, flashed some side boob in a black scoop-neck bodysuit and showed off her tiny waist in skin-tight black trousers that lace up each side from the ankles to the waist. Mum-of-two Kim recently wore the same figure-hugging outfit for a lunch date with sister Khloe and Khloe’s new boyfriend, Tristan Thompson. She accessorised this time with a pair of fluffy black Givenchy flip flops, her hair pulled back in a messy high ponytail. Three-year-old North sported her own pair of black flip flops, along with a long-sleeved shirt. Former Real Housewives of Miami star Larsa, 42, flaunted her curves in a tight grey one-piece with a plunging neckline, giving Kim a run for her money in the cleavage department. Kim and Larsa were seen bringing the tot to check out the ocean from the dock before heading back to the pool, though Kim didn’t get in the water — perhaps fearing she’d wash off her mask. The selfie queen spends £650 a day on her beauty routine. In a post on her website, she shared all the products she uses, from £6 Neutrogena face wipes to a La Mer moisturiser that costs £184 for a 48mL jar. She also shared a video to show exactly how she applies her make-up. While Kim didn't get in the pool this time, she was recently photographed going for a dip in a gold thong bikini that left little to the imagination. The yummy mummy hasn't been shy about showing off her figure lately, having lost five stone since giving birth to son Saint last December.

As it is, it's almost watchable if your cat doesn't do something more distracting than rolling on its back with its feet in the air.

Today, we are going to learn how to create a fun and spooky vampire look, perfect for dressing up at Halloween or costume parties. Follow these easy steps, and you will be transformed into a super cool vampire! Ask an adult to help you with some of these steps. 🧛‍♂️ 1. Super pale skin: To look like a vampire, we need to make our skin very, very pale; vampires don't go out in the sun much! Start by applying a light-colored foundation or white face paint all over your face. It will make you look like a ghost! 👻 2. Set it and forget it: Next, use a press powder (it's like a powder cake) to gently tap your face. This will help the pale color stay on your face for longer and not rub off easily. It also helps to take away any shine! ✨ 3. Eyebrows and eyeshadow: Now, let's move on to our eyes. Use a brow liner (a special kind of pencil) to draw on your eyebrows and make them look nice and neat. Then, pick a spooky eyeshadow color (maybe purple or gray) and apply it on your eyelids using a soft brush. This will give your eyes a mysterious look! 👁️ 4. Eyeliner and mascara: Next, take a black eyeliner (a thin pencil or pen) and draw a line very close to your eyelashes. This will make your eyes pop! After that, use black mascara (a little brush with color) to make your eyelashes look really long and dark. 🖤 5. Lip makeup: Vampires have lovely red lips, so let's put on some bright red lip color! You can use a lipstick or a lip gloss to make your lips look extra luscious.💄 6. Spooky eyes: Vampires have very different eyes! To get this look, ask an adult to help you insert white contact lenses into your eyes. These lenses will make your eyes look less like a human and more like a vampire! If you don't have lenses or can't use them, don't worry - you'll still look spooky! 👀 7. Fangs and fake blood: Finally, it's time for the most fun part - the fangs! Get some fake vampire fangs (they usually come with a costume) and put them in your mouth. Now, you can show off your pointy teeth! Also, ask an adult to help you put some fake blood around your mouth and maybe even on your neck. This will make you look like you just had a midnight snack. Yum! 🩸 And there you have it, little vampire! With your new spooky look, you'll be all set to have a frightfully fun time at your costume party or trick-or-treating! 🎉 Happy haunting, little vampire! 🧛‍♀️🦇"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Azure Ray is an American dream pop duo, consisting of musicians Maria Taylor and Orenda Fink. The pair met at the age of 15 at the Alabama School of Fine Arts. They fronted a band called Little Red Rocket, often compared to Veruca Salt, in their hometown of Birmingham, Alabama in the mid and late 1990s and released two albums with the band on Tim/Kerr records. - Art in Manila (formerly Art Bell) is an indie rock band consisting of Adrianne Verhoeven (The Anniversary), Dan McCarthy (McCarthy Trenching), Steve Bartolomei (Mal Madrigal), Ryan Fox (The Good Life), Corey Broman (Dance Me Pregnant), and Stefanie Drootin (The Good Life) led by a former member of Azure Ray, Orenda Fink. They are currently signed to Saddle Creek Records. - The Anniversary is an American band formed in Lawrence, Kansas in 1997 by Josh Berwanger, James David, Christian Jankowski, Adrianne Verhoeven and Justin Roelofs. The Anniversary was the solidification of a line-up that had been in flux for a year. After two years of playing shows across with the Midwest with bands that included The Get Up Kids, Braid and Superchunk, The Anniversary signed to Vagrant Records. - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - Britpop is a UK based music and culture movement in the mid 1990s which emphasised \\"Britishness\\", and produced bright, catchy pop music partly in reaction to the US led grunge music and the UK's own shoegazing music scene. The most successful bands associated with the movement are Oasis, Blur, Suede and Pulp; those groups would come to be known as its \\"big four\\". The timespan of Britpop is generally considered to be 1993-1997, with 1994-1995, and a chart battle between Blur and Oasis dubbed \\"The Battle of Britpop\\", being the epicentre of activity. While music was the main focus, fashion, art, and politics also got involved, with artists such as Damien Hirst being involved in creating videos for Blur, and being labelled as Britart or Britpop artists, and Tony Blair and New Labour aligning themselves with the movement. - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term. - Set the Woods on Fire is the first full - length studio album from indie rock band Art in Manila . - Grunge (sometimes referred to as the Seattle sound) is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged during the in the American state of Washington, particularly in Seattle. The early grunge movement revolved around Seattle's independent record label Sub Pop, but by the early 1990s its popularity had spread, with grunge acts in California and other parts of the U.S. building strong followings and signing major record deals. - Indie pop is a subgenre and subculture of alternative/indie rock that originated in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s. The style is inspired by punk's DIY ethic and related ideologies, and it generated a thriving fanzine, label, and club and gig circuit. Indie pop differs from indie rock to the extent that it is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free. Its substyles include chamber pop and twee pop. - Orenda Fink (born September 18, 1975) is an American musician on Saddle Creek Records.

Movie title: Deathtrap Movie plot: Famed playwright Sidney Bruhl (Caine) debuts the latest in a series of Broadway flops and returns to his opulent Long Island home and his wife, Myra (Cannon). Although their financial situation is not dire, Sidney is hungry for a hit. He has received a manuscript of a play called Deathtrap written by one of his students, Clifford Anderson, that he considers near perfection. Clifford recently attended one of Sidney's writing workshops and now asks for input on his play. Sidney suggests that he murder Clifford and produce the play as his own. He invites Clifford to their secluded home, decorated with weapons from Sidney's plays, to discuss it. Clifford (Reeve) arrives by train. Myra tries desperately over the course of an evening to convince Sidney to work with Clifford as equal partners, but to no avail; Sidney attacks Clifford, strangling him with a chain. Sidney removes the body but still has to convince Myra to conspire with him. She reveals nothing when they receive an unexpected visit from the psychic Helga Ten Dorp (Irene Worth), a minor celebrity who is staying with the Bruhls' neighbors. Helga senses pain and death in the house; before she leaves she warns Sidney about a man in boots who will attack him. As she prepares for bed, Myra is beginning to come to terms with what Sidney has done. All is calm until Clifford bursts through the bedroom window and beats Sidney with a log. Clifford chases Myra through the house until her weak heart gives out; she collapses and dies. Sidney calmly descends the stairs, uninjured, and sidles unperturbed to Clifford's side.

Background: Juan Carlos was born to Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona and Princess Maria Mercedes of Bourbon-Two Sicilies in Rome, Italy, where his grandfather, King Alfonso XIII of Spain, and other members of the Spanish Royal Family lived in exile following the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931. He was baptized as Juan Carlos Alfonso Victor Maria de Borbon y Borbon-Dos Sicilias. He was given the name Juan Carlos after his father and maternal grandfather, Prince Carlos of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. His early life was dictated largely by the political concerns of his father and General Franco. Context: Spanish news media speculated about the King's future in early 2014, following criticism and family scandal; the King's chief of staff in a briefing denied that the 'abdication option' was being considered. On the morning of 2 June 2014, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy made a televised announcement that the King had told him of his intention to abdicate. Later, the King delivered a televised address and announced that he would abdicate the throne in favour of the Prince of Asturias. Royal officials described the King's choice as a personal decision which he had been contemplating since his 76th birthday at the start of the year. The King reportedly said, \\"[I] don't want my son to grow old waiting like Prince Charles.\\" As required by the Spanish constitution, any abdication would be settled by means of an organic law. A draft law was passed with 299 in favour, 19 against and 23 abstaining. On 18 June, he signed the organic law passed by parliament several hours before his abdication took effect. Felipe was enthroned on 19 June 2014, and his granddaughter Leonor became the new Princess of Asturias. Juan Carlos thus became the fourth European monarch to abdicate in just over a year, following Pope Benedict XVI (28 February 2013), Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands (30 April 2013), and King Albert II of Belgium (21 July 2013). The Spanish constitution at the time of the abdication did not grant an abdicated monarch the legal immunity of a head of state, but the government was planning to make changes to allow this. Legislation has been passed, although unlike his previous immunity, the new legislation does not completely shield the former sovereign. Juan Carlos must answer to the supreme court, in a similar type of protection afforded to many high-ranking civil servants and politicians in Spain. The legislation stipulates that all outstanding legal matters relating to the former king be suspended and passed \\"immediately\\" to the supreme court. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Several interesting aspects of this article include: 1. Juan Carlos was born in exile in Rome due to the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931. His early life was heavily influenced by political concerns. 2. Despite initial denials that abdication was being considered, King Juan Carlos ultimately decided to abdicate in favor of his son, citing that he didn't want his son to grow old waiting like Prince Charles. 3. King Juan Carlos became the fourth European monarch to abdicate in a relatively short period, following Pope Benedict XVI, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, and King Albert II of Belgium. 4. The Spanish constitution did not initially grant legal immunity to an abdicated monarch, leading to governmental changes to allow this. However, unlike his previous immunity as head of state, Juan Carlos is now subject to the supreme court, similar to the protection afforded to high-ranking civil servants and politicians in Spain. These points highlight the unique circumstances Juan Carlos faced during his life, as well as the challenges and changes surrounding his abdication and the broader trend of European monarchs abdicating during the same period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Reality for many comes in the form of small kitchens, not the exception, especially in urban areas like Brooklyn, New York. Despite the spatial challenges, some homeowners find the constraints inspiring, fermenting a kitchen filled to the brim with innovative ideas, and bristling with creativity. This is a celebration of the ideas born and bred in a tiny Brooklyn kitchen. Even in the smallest of kitchens, maximization of space is paramount and requires meticulous planning. In Brooklyn's picturesque townhouses and apartment buildings, many kitchens stand hemmed in by borders. But don't be mistaken - size doesn't dictate style. Often, it is in these tiny kitchens that design flourishes and functionality ensures a seamless cooking experience. Storage solutions are the saviors of petite spaces. Magnetic knife racks, hanging pot racks, and stacked plate racks are typical features in these kitchens, where every inch counts. Deploying pull-out cabinets and adding shelves in an underutilized corner can be transformative, converting clutter into artful displays of spatulas, spice jars, and beautifully designed dinnerware. A popular approach is to opt for multi-purpose furniture. Retractable countertops provide extra workspace while smartly disappearing when not in use. A tiny kitchen may also house a versatile kitchen cart, doubling as a cutting board, storage, and sometimes, even a dining space. Color and lighting can effectively transform confined rooms into the illusion of spaciousness. Light colors, particularly white, can make a kitchen feel bigger and brighter, reflecting light and creating a sense of openness. Mirrors or shiny backsplashes bounce light around, enhancing the effect. Underscoring this is the importance of good lighting. Under-cabinet lights, pendant hanging, recessed lights, each play a role in amplifying the mood and increasing functionality. However, these kitchens are not merely visual showcases; they are nerve centers of culinary proficiency. The size constraint often leads to innovative cooking methods that blend tradition with the demands of modern living. Instant pots, air fryers, and sous vide machines boil down time-consuming cooking methods into a manageable scope, fitting snugly into the pace of a bustling Brooklyn life. The transformation extends beyond the kitchen. A small kitchen often motivates the owners to alternate their cooking habits. Aspiring chefs may find themselves drawn to minimalist cooking, or, as it's affectionately known, \\"tiny kitchen cooking\\". This style leans on using fewer ingredients and utensils but awakens flavors in unexpected ways, proving that delicious meals don't require vast spaces or complex tools. No discussion of tiny Brooklyn kitchens is complete without mentioning the culture of improvised dining experiences. A pizza slice on the fire escape or a rooftop barbecue speaks to the city's indomitable spirit, making the best use of available space while fostering a sense of community. In conclusion, a tiny Brooklyn kitchen is a testament to the idea that creativity thrives in constraints. The need for smart storage solutions, multi-purpose furniture, innovative uses of colors and mirror, and cutting-edge cooking technology, all merge seamlessly into a cooking and dining space that is as efficient as it is charming. As tiny as these kitchens may be, they're ripe with opportunities, bursting with possibilities, and nurturing a breed of urban chefs who master the art of simplicity and creativity with panache."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\" Federal Communications Unlicensed NII Devices in the 5 GHz Frequency Range\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"No devices were unlicensed.\\"?","completion":"The premise, \\"Federal Communications Unlicensed NII Devices in the 5 GHz Frequency Range,\\" tells us that there exist some devices that are unlicensed and operate under the National Information Infrastructure (NII) in the 5 GHz frequency range. These devices are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the government body responsible for overseeing communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable in the United States. The statement indicates that at least some devices are permitted to operate in this spectrum without specific individual licensing, but under certain rules and regulations. Given this premise, we can infer some information about the hypothesis, \\"No devices were unlicensed.\\" Since the premise clearly states that there are unlicensed NII devices in the 5 GHz frequency range, it directly contradicts the hypothesis, demonstrating that the hypothesis is false. It is important to understand the context and rationale behind allowing unlicensed devices to operate in this spectrum. Unlicensed devices are typically those that can coexist with other devices and do not pose significant interference risks to other services and users. The 5 GHz frequency range is particularly suitable for wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi and other wireless local area networks (WLANs). Allowing unlicensed operation in this band can help promote innovation, competition, and more efficient use of the radio spectrum. However, it is important to note that unlicensed does not mean unregulated. The FCC imposes rules and technical requirements that unlicensed devices must meet to ensure that they do not cause harmful interference to licensed services and other unlicensed users. Additionally, unlicensed operators must accept any interference caused by other devices, whether licensed or unlicensed, and must correct any interference issues they may cause to other users. In conclusion, the premise \\"Federal Communications Unlicensed NII Devices in the 5 GHz Frequency Range\\" contradicts and disproves the hypothesis \\"No devices were unlicensed.\\" The premise acknowledges the existence of unlicensed devices operating in the specified frequency range under the regulatory oversight of the FCC. This allows for innovation and efficient use of the spectrum, as long as devices follow imposed rules and technical requirements to prevent interference with other services and users."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice with Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange I can't be certain) by first time director Luchino Visconti, is no less outstanding with usage of mis-en-scene, music (both diegetic and non-diegetic), and the acting. I didn't know what to expect Visconti to do in his approach to the material, after seeing La Terra Trema and seeing how sometimes his political motivations snuck in a little bit. But this is a totally character and emotional based drama, bordering on melodrama (however, without the conventions that bog down lesser ones), and with the style in the finest path of the budding film-noir movement, Visconti creates a debut that's as involving as any other neo-realist film. Neo-realism, by the way, could rightfully be claimed as this being a forefather (along with De Sica's The Children Are Watching Us), which that would take shape after the war. Although love and romance is more in play here than in some of the more famous neo-realist efforts, it's dealt with in a bare-bones storytelling fashion, and it's laced with other familiar themes in neo-realism (the lower-class, death, desperation). Aside from the story, which is simply as it is described on this site, the artistry with which Visconti captures the images, and then layers them with objects (a shawl over Gino Costa's profile when in guilt), shadows and darkness that tend to overcome many of the later scenes in the film (usually over Gian and Giovanna), and the feel of the Italian streets in many of the exterior scenes. Domenico Scala and Aldo Tonti (who would lens some of Rossellini and Fellini's films) help in envisioning the look of Ossessione, which is usually moving in on a character, then pausing to read as much emotion on their faces, their voices and mannerisms lovely and ugly, sad and dark and romantic. I think I've just scratched the surface on how effective it was that the film itself was moving me along, even as I was in fear of the futures of the two leads. The two leads (Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai) portray all the compelling, truthful, and near-operatic emotions, and the key supporting actors are also without their attributes. It's a brilliant, crushing adaptation, and it points as a striking signpost of what was to come for Visconti in his career.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Mark Shand. During my years as a conservationist, I have witnessed many shocking sights: elephants hacked to death for their ivory; rhinos butchered for the supposed healing properties of their horns; and tigers ensnared in vicious traps so that their body parts can be harvested as a cure for impotence in parts of China and South-East Asia. I thought I’d seen just about every example of man’s inhumanity to his fellow creatures. But even I was shocked by the news that Copenhagen Zoo has shot dead a perfectly healthy young giraffe named Marius. Not only shot him, but dissected his corpse in front of an audience of zoo visitors, including many young children. In a final insult, his dismembered body was fed to its resident pride of lions. Marius the giraffe was killed at Copenhagen Zoo yesterday after he was deemed 'surplus to requirements' Keepers shot the infant with a bolt gun before dissecting his body in front of a crowd including children. This came soon after reports that Longleat, one of the Britain’s most-visited safari parks, had killed six of its lions, including a lioness and four of her cubs, apparently because of overcrowding in the enclosures. Employees were said to have wept when they heard what had happened to their beloved animals when there was no obvious reason for them to have been killed. Before the cull was reported at the weekend, no explanation had been given for the lions’ absence when Longleat reopened after a long winter break. There was a sense of wanting to keep the cull quiet. Yet Copenhagen Zoo seems almost to have revelled in the publicity. After Marius had been given a last meal of rye bread, then shot with a bolt gun, the three-hour spectacle of his rather public dissection began. Thousands more watched via the internet. The zoo’s spokesman Tobias Stenbaek Bro declared that he was ‘proud’ the children had been given an unrivalled opportunity to gain ‘huge understanding of the anatomy of a giraffe’. Meanwhile, the zoo’s scientific director, Bengt Holst, defended the execution, claiming that Marius had been ‘surplus to requirements’. The killing took place despite and offer from Yorkshire Wildlife Park to take the young male in. After the autopsy Marius was fed to the lions, with staff calling the procedure part of the 'circle of life' By this, he meant Marius had been declared too closely related genetically to the other giraffes in its breeding programme. To prevent inbreeding, it had been told by the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) that if it kept him, there was a danger of inbreeding and so poor Marius had to go. This was all presented as a regrettable, but ethical necessity. The decision to turn this elegant animal into cat food was justified as part of the ‘cycle of nature’. Yes, it is true that lions eat giraffes in the wild and we shouldn’t shy away from that. But a bolt-gun to the head in a zoo is very far from nature. Marius’s dismemberment on a cold concrete floor at Copenhagen Zoo is all the more hard to bear since his death could have been entirely avoidable. The zoo had apparently ruled out castration because it requires sedation, a high-risk procedure for giraffes as they risk breaking their necks when they drop down unconscious. Neither, according to the zoo, was contraception possible for the females with whom Marius was likely to come into contact, since this can damage a female giraffe’s internal organs. Marius’s fate seemed sealed. Then, at the very last minute, an offer to save him was made by the Yorkshire Wildlife Park, which has a state-of-the-art giraffe house and capacity for an extra male. This was rejected by Holst, who argued that any such space should be reserved for a ‘genetically more important’ giraffe. That Holst should reject their offer left Marius’s would-be saviours understandably ‘saddened’ and presumably mystified — as was the rest of the world. Why did the zoo go ahead with the slaughter regardless? And what were the parents of those children taken to watch the subsequent autopsy thinking? Do children really need to see a giraffe’s insides to appreciate what a miracle of natural engineering such a creature represents? The only lesson I can imagine most children taking away from such an experience is that zoo keepers are only one step away from butchers. We are so very fond of animals in this country that many of us will find ourselves asking why Marius had to die in the first place. As the cull of lions at Longleat suggests, this is a problem that faces zoos all over the world. Will Travers, president of the Born Free Foundation, describes this as the ‘dirty secret’ of many zoos and wildlife parks. Last month, Marius the giraffe was killed, chopped up and fed to lions at Copenhagen Zoo in Denmark. Indeed, at the Copenhagen Zoo there have been previous culls of bears, tigers and zebras, according to one Danish newspaper. Put simply, it is that their breeding programmes are often all too effective. As Longleat has admitted, a recent increase in pregnancies had led to a 40 per cent increase in the number of cubs. With all that youthful energy, keepers noticed ‘excessive violent behaviour’ within their enclosure. In 2011, a whistle-blower at Knowsley Safari Park on Merseyside released images of carcases of animals left to rot by bins after being shot. There is no suggestion that Longleat is similarly irresponsible, but there is no escaping the fact that, like Copenhagen and all zoos, it sometimes breeds more of a particular species than it can realistically keep. In blaming a ‘recent increase in pregnancies’, Longleat seem almost to imply that circumstances were beyond their control, but theirs is a strictly controlled population of lions, so who else but the humans in charge can be blamed for any increase in their lion population? We must also question why zoos are breeding such animals in the first place. There is no question that they are often involved in invaluable conservation work. For example, Bedfordshire’s Woburn Safari Park has been successful in preserving the rare and beautiful Pere David deer, which were virtually extinct in their native China. Breeding programmes which produce too many offspring are to blame for extra culls (Marius circled) The news of Marius' demise came just a day after it was revealed a lioness and four of her cubs were put down at Longleat (pictured are lions and cubs from the same pride) But when it comes to animals such as lions, what is the point of breeding them when there is no realistic chance they can ever be released back into the wild because they are so used to being fed by their human keepers that they would be unable to fend for themselves? The same is true of elephants. There are seven specimens of this magnificent species at Copenhagen Zoo, which boasts that its Asian elephants are kept in a grand enclosure and house designed by the renowned architect Norman Foster. They say the architecture provides ‘these magnificent animals with a stimulating environment’. I have never been to Copenhagen Zoo, but it apparently occupies a site of only 27 acres and, since elephants range huge distances — sometimes hundreds of miles — in the wild, it is clearly anything but a natural environment for them. Those who defend zoos argue that they make such animals accessible to people who might otherwise never get to see them. But is our natural human desire to gawk really sufficient reason to imprison them in habitats and conditions so far from those in which they should live out their lives? And then to cut them into pieces in front of small children? I will never forget the experience of taking my daughter to London Zoo when she was eight years old. The visit was swiftly cut short when she began crying at the sight of the animals in their cages. I can only imagine her trauma had she witnessed the recent events in Copenhagen and at Longleat. The Safari park, built in the ground of Longleat House, Wiltshire (pictured), said a 'population increase' which lead a rise in violent behaviour was behind the decision to put the animals down. These travesties of all that is natural are even more unfortunate given that London is about to host an international summit on conserving endangered species, due to start this Thursday. It is a vital opportunity to address the illegal trade in wildlife parts, which is worth an estimated £12 billion a year. The fate of Marius and the Longleat lions reminds us that we must also look to the welfare of those species supposedly being protected in zoos much closer to home. Animals are not here for our entertainment, to be made into trinkets or to be killed on a whim to ‘educate’ a group of schoolchildren. Surely we should be teaching children that animals are worth more alive than dead. Otherwise what hope is there for the future of the species that are rapidly disappearing from our planet. Mark Shand is chairman of Elephant Family, a charity that campaigns for the conservation and welfare of Asian elephants and all animals that share their habitat. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"A healthy young giraffe named Marius was killed at Copenhagen Zoo because he was considered \\"surplus to requirements\\" and too closely related to other giraffes in the breeding program. This was done to prevent inbreeding. Despite offers from another wildlife park to take Marius, the zoo still went ahead with the decision. They shot Marius with a bolt gun, dissected his body in front of a crowd, including children, and then fed his body to the lions. Similarly, Longleat, a safari park, killed six of its lions due to overcrowding in the enclosures. These events raised questions regarding the purpose of breeding these animals in zoos when they cannot be released back into the wild."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

U.S. President Donald Trump said Saturday that he had instructed his representatives not to sign a communique by all seven leaders attending the G-7 summit in Canada, citing statements by Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made after he left. \\"Very dishonest and & weak,\\" Trump tweeted in response to Trudeau's remark that the new U.S. tariffs on aluminum and steel were \\"insulting.\\" \\"Based on Justin's false statements at his news conference, and the fact that Canada is charging massive Tariffs to our U.S. farmers, workers, and companies, I have instructed our U.S. Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the U.S. Market!\\" Trump added. \\"International cooperation cannot be dictated by fits of anger and throwaway remarks,\\" French President Emmanuel Macron's office said in a statement about Trump's withdrawal from signing the communique. The statement also said Trump's action is a display of \\"incoherence and inconsistency.\\" \\"Germany stands by the jointly agreed communique,\\" Germany spokesman Steffen Seibert said in a statement. Trudeau closed the summit Saturday by refusing to budge on positions that place him at odds with Trump, particularly new tariffs on steel and aluminum that have irritated Canada and the European Union.

Question: \\"How did Calvin view democracy?\\" Context: \\"Politically, Calvin favoured a mixture of aristocracy and democracy. He appreciated the advantages of democracy: \\"It is an invaluable gift, if God allows a people to freely elect its own authorities and overlords.\\" Calvin also thought that earthly rulers lose their divine right and must be put down when they rise up against God. To further protect the rights of ordinary people, Calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances (separation of powers). Thus he and his followers resisted political absolutism and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy. Besides England, the Netherlands were, under Calvinist leadership, the freest country in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It granted asylum to philosophers like Baruch Spinoza and Pierre Bayle. Hugo Grotius was able to teach his natural-law theory and a relatively liberal interpretation of the Bible.\\" Answer:","completion":"Calvin, a prominent theologian and a key figure in the Protestant Reformation, had a positive view on democracy. He saw it as an invaluable gift when people were allowed to elect their own authorities and overlords freely. This perspective aligned with his belief in limiting the power of earthly rulers, especially when they acted against God's will. In favor of protecting the rights of ordinary people, Calvin advocated for a separation of powers through a system of checks and balances. This approach placed limits on political absolutism, enabling the rise of modern democracy. His followers carried forward these ideas, and as a result, some European countries experienced greater freedom and progress during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. For example, the Netherlands and England, strongly influenced by Calvinist thought, emerged as some of the freest countries in Europe during that time period. The Netherlands, under Calvinist leadership, provided asylum to prominent philosophers such as Baruch Spinoza and Pierre Bayle. In addition, Hugo Grotius, a Dutch jurist and philosopher, was able to teach his natural-law theory and promote a relatively liberal interpretation of the Bible in this environment. To conclude, Calvin viewed democracy favorably and appreciated its advantages. His ideas on separation of powers and limiting the authority of rulers contributed significantly to the rise of modern democracy. Under his influence, several European countries experienced greater freedom, leading to the flourishing of diverse intellectual pursuits and laying the foundations for democratic governance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What happens when a Jehovah Witness resigns from the religion?\\" Context: \\"Formal discipline is administered by congregation elders. When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help and possibly administer discipline. Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that \\"losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses,' see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah.\\" The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior. Members who disassociate (formally resign) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned. Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced. Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service, but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship. Marking, a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship, is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin.[note 4]\\" Answer: A:","completion":"When a Jehovah's Witness resigns from the religion, which is also known as disassociating, they are considered wicked and shunned by the congregation. This means that social and spiritual interactions with the individual are limited. Contact with individuals who have disassociated is typically only allowed with direct family members living in the same home and congregation elders who may invite them to apply for reinstatement. Shunning serves both as a way to keep the congregation free from immoral influence and as a deterrent for other members from engaging in dissident behavior. If the expelled individual demonstrates repentance, they may eventually be reinstated into the congregation upon the approval of the congregation's elders."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A few months later however, Hammond decided to stop all mining operations and find other sources of income. they wanted to protect the environment. Which village made less money from sand mining? Hint: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators. Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] Answer:","completion":"Hammond made less money from sand mining since they decided to stop all mining operations to protect the environment."},{"prompt":"Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who reproduced a scene from Martin Schongauer's engraving Flight into Egypt? from the following article ? Little is known for certain of the life of Hieronymus Bosch or of the commissions or influences that may have formed the basis for the iconography of his work. His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history. Although Bosch's career flourished during the High Renaissance, he lived in an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. He would have been familiar with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.José de Sigüenza is credited with the first extensive critique of The Garden of Earthly Delights, in his 1605 History of the Order of St. Jerome. He argued against dismissing the painting as either heretical or merely absurd, commenting that the panels \\"are a satirical comment on the shame and sinfulness of mankind\\". The art historian Carl Justi observed that the left and center panels are drenched in tropical and oceanic atmosphere, and concluded that Bosch was inspired by \\"the news of recently discovered Atlantis and by drawings of its tropical scenery, just as Columbus himself, when approaching terra firma, thought that the place he had found at the mouth of the Orinoco was the site of the Earthly Paradise\\". The period in which the triptych was created was a time of adventure and discovery, when tales and trophies from the New World sparked the imagination of poets, painters and writers.

In 2008, Farrakhan publicly criticized the United States and supported then-Senator Barack Obama who was campaigning at the time to become the president of the United States of America. Farrakhan and Obama had met at least once before. The Obama campaign quickly responded to convey his distance from the minister. \\"Senator Obama has been clear in his objections to Farrakhan's past pronouncements and has not solicited the minister's support,\\" said Obama spokesman Bill Burton. Obama \\"rejected and denounced\\" Farrakhan's support during an NBC presidential candidate debate. Conservative internet sites such as World Net Daily reported that during his February 24, 2008, \\"Saviours' Day\\" speech Farrakhan had called Obama \\"the Messiah\\". What Farrakhan actually said is \\"Sen. Obama is not the Messiah for sure, but anytime, he gives you a sign of uniting races, ethnic groups, ideologies, religions and makes people feel a sense of oneness, that's not necessarily Satan's work, that is I believe the work of God.\\" Following the 2008 presidential election, Farrakhan explained, during a BET television interview, that he was \\"careful\\" never to endorse Obama during his campaign. \\"I talked about him--but, in very beautiful and glowing terms, stopping short of endorsing him.

Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction. I lived in Southern California for 10 years and now I drive a commercial truck several days a week so I have PLENTY of other “road rage stories”, but this is still the craziest one.

Your task is to generate label \\"yes\\" if title is right for article, otherwise generate \\"no\\". Problem:Abstract: Virally infected cells degrade intracellular viral proteins proteolytically and present the resulting peptides in association with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules to CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). These cells are normally prone to CTL-mediated elimination. However, several viruses have evolved strategies to avoid detection by the immune system that interfere with the pathway of antigen presentation. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) expresses a predominantly late protein, the BCRF1 gene product vIL-10, that is similar in sequence to the human interleukin-10 (hIL-10). We show here that vIL-10 affects the expression of one of the two transporter proteins (TAPs) associated with antigen presentation. Similarly, hIL-10 showed the same activity. Expression of the LMP2 and TAP1 genes but not expression of TAP2 or LMP7 is efficiently downregulated, indicating a specific IL-10 effect on the two divergently transcribed TAP1 and LMP2 genes. Downregulation of TAP1 by IL-10 hampers the transport of peptide antigens into the endoplasmatic reticulum, as shown in the TAP-specific peptide transporter assay, their loading onto empty MHC I molecules, and the subsequent translocation to the cell surface. As a consequence, IL-10 causes a general reduction of surface MHC I molecules on B lymphocytes that might also affect the recognition of EBV-infected cells by cytotoxic T cells.. Title: Downregulation of TAP1 in B lymphocytes by cellular and Epstein-Barr virus-encoded interleukin-10. Solution:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the task The task requires determining if the provided title is suitable for the abstract of an article.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is an article: The Angels were 6-14 before Mike Trout arrived on April 28. They are 32-18 since. ANAHEIM, Calif. — Mike Trout is a humble, clean-shaven baseball prodigy from a small town in southern New Jersey. He works at Angel Stadium, three and a half miles from places called Fantasyland, Tomorrowland and Main Street, U.S.A. His story springs from all of them. Trout is 20. He is, with Bryce Harper of the Washington Nationals, the most talented player in the majors who cannot yet legally drink. His parents, Jeff and Debbie, have been here lately to see their son fluster the opponents of the Los Angeles Angels. A center fielder, he entered the weekend hitting .338 with 6 home runs and 19 steals, the most in the American League. On Monday, the Trouts took some friends with young children to Disneyland. They told Mike he did not have to come — there was a game that night — but Mike went anyway. It was his first time at Disneyland, and nobody recognized him. “The kids aren’t real big yet, like 8 to 11 years old, so I’m going on these kiddie rides,” Trout said later, on the Angels’ bench after early batting practice. “It’s all about them. They’re out here, having a vacation. I’m just happy they’re out here.” Trout led off that night against the San Francisco Giants’ Matt Cain, who had thrown a perfect game in his previous start. He rifled a single to left, stole second, went to third on a shallow flyout and scored on a sacrifice fly. Trout later stole two more bases; the next night, he collected four hits and a walk, and scored four runs. After that game, someone asked Angels Manager Mike Scioscia if it was too soon to consider Trout among the best players in the league. Scioscia tries hard to play down the hype around Trout, so naturally he said it was too early. But there is no denying Trout’s effect on the team. The Angels were 6-14 before Trout arrived April 28. They were 32-18 since then entering the weekend. “From when he came up to what he’s done now, you can’t ask more of a young player — you can’t ask more of a player at any age,” Scioscia said. “He’s playing with confidence. He just wants to play baseball, and he’ll let you guys talk about it.” Sure enough, Trout had dressed and left the clubhouse by the time Scioscia finished with reporters. He had already done an on-field interview, broadcast on the scoreboard, as he waved to his parents in the stands. “He’s a happy-go-lucky kid,” Jeff Trout said. “All we did was set him on a path and let his natural ability take over. I was very confident he’d do well.” Jeff Trout was a fifth-round draft choice of the Twins in 1983. He was already 22, not a strong defensive player, and would soon have knee problems. But he never stopped hitting. Trout batted .321 at Class AA in 1986, and then retired. Some of his former teammates spent the next season in Minnesota, on their way to a World Series title. Jeff started a family and embarked on a new career as a teacher and coach in Millville, N.J., his hometown. He had always spoken fondly of it. Years later, in 2008, Jeff’s old Class AA teammate, Greg Morhardt, was assembling a team of prospects for a showcase at the old Yankee Stadium. Morhardt, then an East Coast area scout for the Angels, heard about a 16-year-old from Millville with speed and strength and a father who had played in the minors. He put the pieces together: it must be his old teammate’s son. Mike, he found, was strong like his father and shared his sharp instincts. But Mike Trout was a different kind of prospect from Jeff. His speed was startling, Morhardt said: 3.9 seconds from home to first, exceptional for a right-hander. As he watched Trout take batting practice, his mind flashed to the can’t-miss prospects he had once faced: Will Clark, Rafael Palmeiro, Barry Bonds. “Bo Jackson, I did not see at 17 years old,” Morhardt said. “But of all the players I’ve seen at 17, 18, 19 years old, I’ve never seen a better athlete for strength and speed than Michael — ever. I remember playing against Jose Canseco in the Southern League, but he was on juice. Michael was a freak of nature.” Write a title for it.","completion":"\\"Mike Trout: The Unstoppable Baseball Prodigy Transforming the Angels\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Netflix is delving deeper into the comic book world with its first acquisition, comic book publisher Millarworld. The company announced Monday it has acquired MIllarworld, which publishes franchises including \\"Kingsman: The Secret Service,\\" \\"Kick-Ass,\\" \\"Wanted\\" and \\"Reborn.\\" Netflix said it plans to turn its franchises into films, series and kids' shows. No further details were revealed, including the price. Millarworld will continue to create new stories and franchises under Netflix. Millarworld creator Mark Millar was previously at Marvel, where he worked on \\"Marvel Knights Spider-Man,\\" \\"Ultimate Fantastic Four\\" and the \\"Civil War\\" storylines, as well as \\"Old Man Logan\\" which was the basis for the film \\"Logan.\\" ||||| Warner Bros bought DC Comics in 1968. Disney bought Marvel in 2009. Today Netflix purchased Millarworld and I’m still blinking. This is only the third time in history a comic-book company purchase on this scale has ever happened. I started Millarworld as a creator-owned comic-book company nearly 15 years ago, after talking some artist pals into being their own bosses. We’d all had success at DC and Marvel, but this was a chance to control the characters created and reap the rewards from any future movies, TV or merchandise that ever came from those characters and books. Over the years, Millarworld has amassed twenty different franchises working with the world’s greatest artists and now Millarworld has been bought by the hottest, most exciting entertainment company on the planet. To say this is the best thing that ever happened in our professional lives would be an understatement. The moment Lucy and I walked into Netflix’s headquarters in California last Christmas we knew this was where we wanted to be. It instantly felt like home and the team around that table felt like people who would help us take Millarworld’s characters and turn them into global powerhouses. Netflix is the future and we couldn’t be more thrilled to sell the business to them and buckle up for all the amazing movies and television shows we plan to do together. This feels like joining the Justice League and I can’t wait to start working with them. I’d like to take this moment to thank all the artists who were caught up in my enthusiasm over the years and who co-created these properties with Millarworld. Artists are often left out of news-stories, but trust me when I say that the only reason these books have looked so beautiful is because Millarworld worked with the greatest draughtsmen of their generation. I’d like to thank Frank Quitely, Stuart Immonen, Goran Parlov, Leinil Francis Yu, Rafael Albuquerque, Peter Gross, Steve McNiven, Greg Capullo, Sean Murphy, JG Jones, Duncan Fegredo, Tony Harris, Dave Gibbons and John Romita Jr for their belief in my crazy plan and their friendship during even the tightest of deadlines. Kingsman and Kick-Ass have unique Hollywood deals elsewhere and aren’t a part of this particular acquisition, but those two fine men are toasting us in spirit from London and California respectively. In terms of this sale itself, I’d like to offer a huge thanks to Jon Miller, an amazing corporate legend who held our hands through the entire executive process, John Rose who provided invaluable counsel as we were going through this, the gang at Medialink, our accountants at Robertson Craig and our brilliant international legal teams Hughes Hubbard & Reed in the United States and Addleshaw Goddard in England. I’d also like to thank my great friend former Marvel President Bill Jemas for introducing me to Jon almost eighteen months ago. Bill changed my life once when he was running Marvel and he changed it again when he helped facilitate this. But more than anyone I’d like to thank my wife, Lucy Millar. Everyone involved in this process knows she’s the genuine business brain at our company. She and I had flights from Scotland to LA for sometimes just three hours of meetings during this lengthy negotiation, scrabbling for baby-sitters and jet-lagged to Hell, but still she managed to always be smiling, keeping it all on-track for all our partners and keeping everyone in the loop seemingly 24/7. Nothing dulls my brain like a 96-page legal document, but so many nights ended with me falling asleep as she phone-conferenced with nine lawyers around the world and made this all happen. On behalf of this cross-continental gang of pals who have somehow pulled this off, she has our love and thanks for running this company so brilliantly in recent years and for helping us to make comic-book history today. So what’s next? Well, we’ve been in these talks for many months and a lot of planning has been going on. We’re flying to LA to strategise the next steps and you’ll be hearing about each fascinating turn when I’m allowed to share it. Jupiter’s Legacy and Reborn both concluded in the last few weeks and I’m going undercover between now and Spring as I stockpile all the new projects we’re putting together, but you’ll hear about them very soon. Keep an eye on our website, Twitter, Instagram and Facebook pages for details as they happen where Millarworld editor Rachael Fulton will be giving you daily updates. Also look for our news at the end of summer with details of the charitable foundation Lucy and I have started which will revitalize parts of my old hometown in Scotland. This is a five-year charity building project I’ve been quietly making plans for with local government behind the scenes and we can’t wait to go public with the idea. I’ve had an enormous amount of luck in my life - none more than today - and I look forward to explaining how I’m planning to use what this deal brings us to help improve an area I grew up in and owe everything to. Comics have been my passion my entire life. I started working with them as a teenager and I’ve never been more excited about where we’re going next as Millarworld joins the Netflix team. These guys are going to take Millarworld to the next level and I feel like Richard Dreyfuss, wide-eyed and walking around the mothership at the end of Close Encounters when I see their global plans and it’s crazy-exciting to be a part of it. This is going to be brilliant. End of Part One. To Be Continued.

The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow.

One of the most significant activities that can happen while you are asleep is dreaming. Dreams can occur during the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep, which is characterized by high brain activity, eye movements, and often vivid dreams. Your brain processes and consolidates memories, thoughts, and emotions during this stage. These experiences can manifest as dreams, which can be complex, illogical, or emotionally charged. Although dreaming is the most suitable answer, other options listed might also occur during sleep, particularly snoring (A) and talking (B). Snoring is a sign of partial blockage of airways during sleep, and it is not directly linked to brain activities. Sleep talking, or somniloquy, occurs when a person talks during their sleep unintentionally. It is a type of parasomnia and not necessarily a result of conscious thought or deliberate action. Option C, getting cold, is a physical sensation rather than a mental activity. Your body's core temperature does decrease during sleep, but the sensation of feeling cold is not primarily a mental process. Option D, nothing, is incorrect because even if you do not remember your dreams or experience vivid dreaming, your brain is still active during sleep, going through different stages and regulating various bodily functions. Your mind is never truly idle while you sleep, even if your conscious awareness is limited. In conclusion, the most suitable answer to the question about what can happen in your mind while sleeping is E, dreaming might occur. However, it's essential to note that other activities are also taking place within your brain and body during sleep."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Red team arrived late and almost skipped warming up entirely. Costly decision, as it turns out, because they lost. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which team had less people with an increased blood flow to the muscles before the match? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The Red team had less people with an increased blood flow to the muscles before the match. This conclusion is based on the information provided in the paragraph, which states that the Blue team arrived early and warmed up properly, whereas the Red team arrived late and almost skipped warming up entirely. Warming up before engaging in any sports activity, including a soccer match, is essential for multiple reasons, such as increasing blood flow to the muscles, increasing flexibility, and reducing the risk of injury. An effective warm-up involves a combination of low-intensity exercises aimed at gradually increasing heart rate, blood flow, and oxygen supply to the muscles. It also includes stretching exercises to enhance flexibility and improve the range of motion around the joints. By doing so, a warmed-up athlete is better prepared to perform and endure the demands of the sport. In the scenario mentioned, the Blue team's proper warm-up enabled their players to increase blood flow to their muscles, ensuring they were physically ready for the upcoming match. In contrast, the Red team's lack of an adequate warm-up limited the increase in blood flow to their muscles, potentially resulting in a reduced overall performance during the game. This could have contributed to their loss, as a lack of proper preparation might have made them more susceptible to fatigue, slower reaction times, and a higher risk of injury. Therefore, the Red team had less people with an increased blood flow to the muscles before the match, putting them at a disadvantage compared to the better-prepared Blue team."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A Singapore court ruled Friday that four people can be extradited to the United States to face conspiracy charges after electronic components from a U.S. company were smuggled to Iran and ended up in explosives in Iraq. The case is part of an effort by the U.S. to link Iran with attacks on its forces in Iraq. The four Singaporeans -- three men and a woman -- were arrested in late October. They contested the extradition proceedings, and have 15 days to appeal. U.S. authorities indicted them, as well as an Iranian citizen, on charges of funneling thousands of radio frequency modules from the United States to Iran. The Iranian citizen, Hossein Larijani, remained at large at the time of the indictment. The United States alleges that 16 of the radio frequency modules were later found in improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Iraq that had not detonated. The explosive devices are often the weapon of choice for militants in Iraq, who regularly used them to attack U.S. and coalition convoys. David Adelman, the U.S. ambassador to Singapore, welcomed the ruling. \\"This ruling reflects the strong spirit of cooperation between the United States and Singapore in combating transnational crime, including the illicit trade in arms and equipment that can pose significant threats to the United States and the international community,\\" Adelman said in a statement. Following the court's decision Friday, two of the Singaporeans -- Lisingm Yong Nam and Wong Yuh Lan, the female suspect -- will be extradited to be charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States in relation to the radio frequency modules. The other two -- Lim Kow Seng and Hia Soo Gan Benson -- will be sent to the United States to be charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States regarding the smuggling of dozens of military antennas, like those used on military aircraft and ships, from the United States to Hong Kong. Lim Yong Nam, Lim Kow Seng and Hia plan to appeal, their lawyer said. Wong's lawyer said he needed to talk to his client before saying whether she would appeal. In making a decision on the extradition, the judge, Chia Wee Kiat, weighed the evidence provided by the U.S. indictment, citing emails, documents and affidavits from the U.S. case. Chia said that if the alleged acts had indeed been committed, they would also be considered \\"conspiracy and cheating under Singapore law.\\" He noted that the Singapore court's role in considering the extradition request had been \\"to decide whether there is a prima facie case.\\" Chia said that \\"the task of resolving doubt and weighing the evidence should be left to the trial judge.\\" The U.S. indictment alleges that the Singaporeans conspired to buy 6,000 radio frequency modules from an unidentified company in Minnesota and ship them through Singapore to Larijani in Iran. The United States has in the past noted that Singapore -- a major global transshipment port -- needs to tighten its export controls, in particular of so-called \\"dual use\\" items, which can have both a civilian and military purpose. In this case, the radio frequency modules from the U.S. company have various commercial applications, including wireless local area networks to connect printers and computers in offices. The United States says that radio frequency modules from the same U.S. company were recovered in 2008 and 2009 by coalition forces in Iraq as part of remote detonation systems for improvised explosive devices. Prosecutors allege that the defendants told the Minnesota company that Singapore was the final destination for the components they were buying and also filed false paperwork with the U.S. government, saying the parts would be used in a Singapore telecommunications project. The Singaporeans have been held without bail since their arrest, except Lim Yong Nam, who was released on bail on medical grounds. They will all remain in prison until their extradition, except Lim Yong Nam, the judge said Friday. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"A court in Singapore decided that four people from Singapore can be sent to the United States to face charges.

The four people from Singapore didn't want to be sent to the United States and they have a chance to ask for this decision to be changed. They are being accused of sending thousands of special radio parts from the United States to Iran, with some of them ending up in bombs that didn't explode. The judge in Singapore said that if they really did these things, they would also be in trouble under Singapore laws.

Write a title for this article: ALMATY, Kazakhstan – A Soyuz space capsule carrying a three-man multinational crew touched down safely Sunday on the southern steppes of Kazakhstan, bringing an end to their 193-day mission to the International Space Station. Around a dozen recovery helicopters zeroed into the vast uncultivated land mass, where NASA astronaut Donald Pettit, Russia's Oleg Kononenko and Dutchman Andre Kuipers landed in the Russian-made capsule. Russian space officials quickly surrounded the craft, which performed a perfect upright textbook landing, and erected ladders to begin the process of pulling out the astronauts. The voyage from the space station started 3 -1/2 hours earlier, when it undocked and began a slow, gentle drift away. It made a perfect landing in the still and summery weather at 2:14 pm local time, right on schedule. Commenting on the landing, NASA TV reporter Rob Navias described it as \\"a bullseye.\\" Kononenko was the first to be extracted from the descent module. He looked pale and tired, but medical staff announced him healthy. Pettit, second out of the module, was heard to say: \\"It's good to be home.\\" The three men were hoisted into recliners and posed for photos for a number of minutes before being carried into a tent for further checks. Writing on his NASA blog on the eve of his departure from the space station, Petit write: \\"I only hope that my small efforts here, perhaps adding one grain of sand to the beach of knowledge, will help enable a generation of people in the future to call space \`home.\\"' Petit and his colleagues were part of the team that handled the arrival to the space station last month of the privately owned SpaceX Dragon capsule. That became the first private delivery to the International Space Station. The retirement of the U.S. shuttle fleet has left Russia's venerable Soyuz spacecraft as the only means to deliver crews to the orbiting laboratory. Russians Gennady Padalka and Sergei Revin and U.S. astronaut Joseph Acaba are expected to remain onboard the orbiting space station for a further three months. They will be joined later this month by NASA astronaut Suni Williams, Russia's Yury Malenchenko and Japanese astronaut Aki Hoshide, who are set to take off on a Soyuz spaceship from the Baikonur cosmodrome in southern Kazakhstan.

Article: People who speak or perform before the public sometimes may suffer from \\"Stage Fright. \\" Stage fright makes a person nervous. In the worst case it can make one's mind go back and forget what one ought to say, or to act. Actors, musicians, dancers, lawyers, even radio show hosts have suffered from stage fright at one time or another. Diana Nichols is an expert in helping people free from stage fright at a medical centre in New York City. She helps actors learn to control themselves. Miss Nichols says some people have always been afraid to perform before the audience. Others, she says, develop stage fright after a fearful experience. She offers them ways to control the fear. One way is to smile before going onto the stage. Taking two deep breaths also helps. Deep breathing helps you get control of your body. Miss Nichols persuades her patients to tell themselves that their speech or performance does not have to the perfect. It's all right to make a mistake. She tells them they should not be too cautious while they are performing. It is important that they should continue to perform while she is helping them. After each performance, they discuss what happened and find out what advice helped and what did not. As they perform more and more, they will fear less and less as much as 50%. Miss Nichols says the aim is only to reduce stage fright, not to _ it completely. This is because a little stage fright makes a person more cautious, and improves the performance.

Information: - Conscription, or drafting, is the compulsory enlistment of people in a national service, most often a military service. Conscription dates back to antiquity and continues in some countries to the present day under various names. The modern system of near-universal national conscription for young men dates to the French Revolution in the 1790s, where it became the basis of a very large and powerful military. Most European nations later copied the system in peacetime, so that men at a certain age would serve 18 years on active duty and then transfer to the reserve force. - A conscientious objector is an \\"individual who has claimed the right to refuse to perform military service\\" on the grounds of freedom of thought, conscience, or religion. In general, conscientious objector status is considered only in the context of military conscription and is not applicable to volunteer military forces. - The Big Read was a survey on books carried out by the BBC in the United Kingdom in 2003, where over three quarters of a million votes were received from the British public to find the nation's best-loved novel of all time.

Answer:","completion":"In the given scenario, the objects would be closer to each other in case A than in case B. Here's why: In case A, John used conduction to charge his electronic gadgets. Conduction is the transfer of energy, such as heat or electricity, through direct contact between two objects. In this process, the objects must be touching or very close to each other for efficient energy transfer. Therefore, in case A, the objects have to be closer to each other to allow for conduction. In case B, John used induction. Induction is a process where energy is transferred between two objects without direct contact, usually through an electromagnetic field. In this case, the distance between the objects can be greater compared to conduction. The objects do not need to be touching or extremely close for successful energy transfer to occur, as long as a magnetic field can be produced and maintained.

However, they notice that the dog is behaving differently than it did when it was alive: its cataracts disappear, it loses its appetite, and it demonstrates other strange abilities. Tests reveal that the serum, instead of dissipating, is constructing strange new synapses within the dog's brain. When the dean of their university learns of their underground experiments, their project is shut down. They are also informed that a major pharmaceutical corporation has bought out the company that funded their research. The company and their attorneys confiscate everything associated with the project. Frank and his team sneak back into their lab to duplicate the experiment so that they can prove that they created the serum.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Fed proposes lower store fees on debit purchases The Federal Reserve proposed on Thursday lowering the fees that merchants must pay when shoppers use debit cards, a move that could reduce retail prices but result in higher banking fees for consumers. Under the recommended new rules, the so-called interchange fee, or \\"swipe fee,\\" on debit cards would be capped at 12 cents - about 70 percent lower than the average fee of 44 cents per transaction last year, according to the Fed. The total amount banks received from debit card interchange fees was 16.2 billion. The move was applauded by retail industry groups and small businesses, which have long complained that the fees were excessive and they have little power to negotiate them down. Retailers have also said the cost of the fees is second only to labor and is growing faster than health care expenses. On Thursday, they said the new rules would allow them to deliver significant savings to shoppers. \\"This is not only good for businesses, but most importantly it's good for consumers,\\" said Hank Armour, chief executive of National Association of Convenience Stores. \\"There is an abundant amount of evidence cost savings will be passed through.\\" Interchange rates are set by card processors such as Visa and MasterCard and paid to banks as an incentive to use their networks. In a statement, the American Bankers Association, a trade group, said the proposal would have a \\"dramatic impact\\" on the industry at a time when bank revenue has also been curtailed by strict new regulations on credit card interest rates and overdraft fees. The swipe fee ruling would reduce banks' ability to offer basic low-cost services, make loans and fight fraud, he said. \\"The proposal seems little more than direct government interference in the card payments system on behalf of large retailers and at the expense of everyday consumers,\\" ABA Chief Executive Edward L. Yingling said. Banks have begun seeking ways to recoup their losses from the wave of new regulations passed by Congress. Tower Group analyst Brian Riley said they would probably consider instituting charges for accounts that carry low balances or are used infrequently. He noted there is no mandate from the Fed or Congress that retailers lower prices to reflect the reduced interchange rate - and the worst case-scenario for consumers is if banks raise their fees and merchants don't cut prices. \\"There's no tie-in from the beginning . . . to ensure that consumers see this as a price benefit,\\" Riley said. \\"It just gets lost in the revenue model of the retailers.\\" Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), who sponsored the legislation that required the Fed to address the issue, said he will be monitoring any new bank fees closely. \\"I worry that the banks and credit card companies, faced with change and reform, will do the same thing they've always done: Create a new product, create a new fee, find a new loophole,\\" he said. The Fed is gathering comments for several options for determining interchange fees. The first allows issuers to set the rate at a \\"safe harbor\\" of 7 cents or less. Issuers could also choose to determine their own average cost of authorizing, clearing and settling debit transactions, with a cap of 12 cents. The final option allows any interchange rate of 12 cents or less. One key issue the Fed did not address in detail was fraud. Card processors and banks have argued that the cost of preventing and investigating fraud should be included in the interchange fees. The Fed said that it is still considering the issue and would develop a separate proposal to address it. It is also considering ways to increase competition among the methods for processing card transactions. The law applies only to debit cards - not credit cards - and exempts government benefit cards and prepaid cards from the new regulations. It also would not apply to banks with assets less than 10 billion, but community banks still oppose the rule, saying they will probably have to comply with lower interchange rates or risk not being accepted by merchants. \\"It is naÃÂ¯ve to think that a reduction in debit interchange of the scale proposed today to large issuers will not be felt with equal pain by those purportedly 'carved out' from the provision,\\" Karen Thomas, senior executive vice president of government relations for the Independent Community Bankers of America, said in a statement. The Fed is accepting comments on the proposed rules through Feb. 22. A final ruling is expected by April.","completion":"The Federal Reserve has proposed to cap the interchange fees paid by merchants when customers make debit card purchases at 12 cents, reducing the average fee by 70%.

However, finding creative ways to manage your growing toy collection can be a challenge. Clutter is the nemesis of any well-organized room, causing stress and wasted time as you look for your favorite toy. In this article, we'll give you step-by-step guidance on how to transform your toy room into an organized, welcoming space. Step 1: Choose the Best Storage Boxes and an Armchair Before you can start organizing your toy room, it's essential to choose the right storage boxes and an armchair. Storage boxes come in a variety of sizes and materials, so consider the types of toys you need to store. Opt for sturdy, easy-to-clean plastic bins, woven baskets, or wooden crates for efficient, long-lasting storage. An attractive armchair not only provides a cozy spot for reading or cuddling with a toy, but it also adds a touch of style and warmth to the room. Choose a comfortable, well-built chair that coordinates with the room's décor and is easy to clean. Step 2: Gather All Your Toys and Sort Them Out Now you have the tools to start your organization journey. Begin by gathering all the toys scattered throughout your home, including those tucked away in closets and hidden under beds. Bring them all together in one area, so you can assess the number and types of toys you need to organize. Next, sort the toys into categories based on their function, size, or theme. For example, group together stuffed animals, action figures, board games, and building blocks. Separate broken or damaged toys that need repair or disposal, as well as any that your child has outgrown or no longer plays with. Step 3: Declutter and Donate Unwanted Toys Once you've sorted the toys, take this opportunity to declutter your collection. This step is crucial to maintaining an organized, functional toy room. Donate or give away toys that your child no longer uses or has outgrown, and responsibly dispose of any broken or damaged toys. Remember, passing on toys in good condition allows other children to enjoy them, and it helps reduce landfills. Step 4: Arrange Your Toys in the Toy Room Now it's time to put everything in its designated place. Use the storage boxes you've chosen to keep toys neatly organized based on your chosen categories. Label each box or bin with a clear, easy-to-read label so that children can easily identify the contents. Position your storage boxes strategically around the room to create play zones for different activities. This step will help reduce clutter and encourage children to focus on one game or toy at a time before moving on to another. Place the armchair in a cozy corner, along with a side table or bookshelf to hold favorite books and a soft-throw blanket for added comfort. Conclusion: Transforming your toy room into an organized, inviting space requires thoughtful planning, efficient use of storage solutions, and a bit of elbow grease in decluttering and arranging. By following these steps, not only will you create a tidier, more functional toy room, but you'll also reduce the stress and chaos associated with constant toy clutter. With organization and dedication, your toy room will become a haven of imaginative play, relaxation, and cherished memories."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Two Dublin scores after the 70 minutes had elapsed reduced the deficit to the minimum before Bryan Sheehan made it a two-point game again. There was still time for Mannion to add another score for Dublin before Moran was black carded for a foul just outside his own '45 that gave Dean Rock a chance to level matters once more. However, the Ballymun man's effort hit the post and Kerry held on to take the title on a scoreline of 0-20 to 1-16.

However, if they fall behind on payments, a \\"repo man\\" reclaims the artificial organ (artiforg) from the body; the procedure frequently results in the death of the customer due to them being crucial organs. Remy and his partner Jake Freivald are considered the best of the Union's repo men. However, Remy's wife Carol disapproves of his work, believing that it is a bad influence for their son Peter.

Remy and Jake raid the nest by themselves and reclaim 32 artiforgs, which impresses their boss Frank. He offers them the opportunity to become full-time raid captains. Remy refuses and attempts to ask Frank to transfer to sales, but Jake cuts him off. Jake tells Remy that what they do is important, but Remy's mind is made up. Jake suggests that Remy's last job be a musician that Remy is a fan of. After helping the musician finish one last song, he uses a defibrillator in order to stop the artificial heart, but the device malfunctions, and Remy is severely injured, requiring replacement of his heart with an artiforg. Carol divorces Remy for taking another job, so he moves in with Jake. In sales, he is unable to lie to potential customers about the consequences of non-payment and is forced back into repo to pay for his heart, but has developed sympathy for his victims and develops a psychological block that prevents him from repossessing their artiforgs....

Given the question \\"What will Ash want to do next?\\", is \\"get in the box\\" a valid answer? A:","completion":"No, \\"get in the box\\" is not a valid answer for the question \\"What will Ash want to do next?\\" after finding a movie to watch. The question asked involves logical progression of actions or events based on the preceding statements. The two statements given are: \\"Ash was looking in a box for a movie\\" and \\"Ash found a movie to watch.\\" The logical conclusion would involve Ash doing something related to the movie he found, since his initial intent or action was to find a movie to watch. A more valid response might include actions like \\"Ash will want to watch the movie\\" or \\"Ash will go get some popcorn before starting the movie\\" or \\"Ash might want to find a comfortable spot to sit and watch the movie\\". This is because these responses reflect a natural sequence of events or actions that could logically follow once Ash has found the movie he is looking for. The action \\"get in the box\\" does not constitute a logical or likely follow-up based on the information given. This action does not seem related to Ash's initial intent of finding a movie to watch, nor does it follow coherently from the statement \\"Ash found a movie to watch.\\" There is no information in the given context to suggest why Ash would want to get inside the box after finding his movie. Therefore, \\"get in the box\\" is not a valid answer to the question about what Ash will want to do next. However, answers can depend on more context like the size of the box, the setting Ash is in, Ash’s behavior, age and many more but from the given information, it would not be a valid response.

Part #2: Interpreting the hypothesis. Usage: The hypothesis given is \\"Louis Gossett Jr. did not win the emmy for the role on Sadat\\". This suggests an assumption about Gossett not winning the Emmy award. Part #3: Comparing the premise with the hypothesis to determine the relationship. Usage: Upon comparing the premise and hypothesis, one can deduce that the former mentions Gossett earning a nomination, while the latter brings up the notion of him not winning the award. This shows that the hypothesis does not contradict the provided premise and instead is neutral with respect to it, as the premise doesn't provide definitive information on whether Gossett won or didn't win the award."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Generate a sentence that includes all the following words: artwork, collection, room","completion":"After years of careful curation and acquisition, the spacious room, brightly lit with natural sunlight streaming in from the large windows, was filled to the brim with an impressive collection of artwork, ranging from vibrant abstract paintings and meticulously detailed sketches to sophisticated sculptures, each piece telling its unique story, resonating with the passion and inspiration of the artists who crafted them. These pieces weren't just mere decorations; they breathed life into the minimalist room, turning it into an eclectic gallery of sorts, a melting pot of artistic expressions, styles, and periods. The owner, an affluent art connoisseur with an insatiable appetite for all forms of visual creativity, took immense pride in the collection, cherishing each acquired piece as the artwork not only beautified the room but also served as a tangible representation of the unwavering passion for art, imprinted with the silent narratives of their makers. The room was indeed the heart of the owner's home - a visually enchanting testament to the years passed, carrying the weight of stories untold and time forgotten, silently whispering the tales of each artwork encased within this dynamic and evolving collection. Even the decor, in stark contrast to the ornate aesthetics of the artwork, was intentionally kept minimalistic, with nothing more than a few simple but elegant pieces of furniture scattered throughout the room. The neutral tones of the walls and floor served as a blank canvas, subtly drawing attention towards the artwork, while the strategically installed spotlights created dramatic shadows and highlights, further accentuating the aesthetics of the collection. Every visit to the room was in itself an evocative journey through the aesthetic universe of the artists represented in the collection. Despite the diverse range of artwork, there was an underlying connection that held the room together - a common thread of shared narratives, spiced with bursts of individual philosophies and experiences. The collection, therefore, stood as a testament to human creativity in its spectacular multitudes. The room was, indeed, a generously spread buffet for any art lover, a place that celebrated the inspiring power of human imagination and transformed it into touching works of art, culminating in a collection that enchanted, entertained, and evoked thought - all at the same time. In conclusion, the room with its carefully curated artwork collection was more than just a space; it became a living, breathing symbol of a diverse range of human emotions and ideas, conveyed through the universal language of art. Every visit was an enriching experience; each gaze at the collection, a dialogue with history and culture encapsulated within the timeless frames. The room transcended the barriers of time, reflecting the progressive evolution of art, simultaneously reverberating the individual talent of the artists captured in the breathtaking range of the collection."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As the blockade still needs to be broken, Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard has the ship raised and puts George E. Dixon in charge. He starts looking for a crew and after some difficulty finally finds enough volunteers to man it. They practice cranking the propeller. The crew do not all get along with each other. Dixon flashes back to the Battle of Shiloh, where a gold coin given to him by his wife (who was later killed in a steamboat explosion caused by a drifting mine) deflected a bullet and saved his life. They take the ship down and sit on the bottom to see how long they can stay down and almost get stuck. The U.S. Navy is warned about the sub. The crew votes that if after an attack they are stuck on the bottom, they will open the valves, flooding the ship, rather than suffocate. They go out to attack the USS Wabash, but the attack fails. Following the warning the ship has draped metal chain netting over the side. Also the rope which was attached to the torpedo they were to release under the ship gets loose and becomes entangled in the propeller. It has to be cut loose while sailors on the Wabash shoot at the Hunley. Beauregard proposes putting the torpedo at the end of a long spar. The USS Housatonic is ordered to change its position in the harbor and always be ready to steam, meaning it cannot hang metal netting over the side. The Hunley's second in command, Lt.

Summarize: Officials say an unknown number of homes have been destroyed and a firefighter has been injured in the state of Victoria. Some residents have been ordered to leave and flames have spread to the outer suburbs of Australia's second biggest city, Melbourne. Conditions in Victoria are at their worst since 2009, authorities said. Then, wildfires killed 173 people and destroyed about 2,000 homes in a disaster dubbed Black Saturday. Belle Nolan, Warrandyte, Victoria, Australia I live in Warrandyte in Victoria State with my fiance, Ryan - one of the worst affected areas. There's no co-ordinated evacuation, but we all have a bushfire emergency alert on our phones. We got an alert of a fast moving bushfire in the area, and were then told we had to evacuate. There was smoke, ash and embers everywhere. The police were already closing the roads. We got out just in time before another alert telling us it was now too late to leave. It's now 12 hours since we left and we're heading back. We have been told the fire is contained but not over, so we're not quite sure what we're going back to. We know that three houses have been destroyed and 25 acres of land destroyed. We do get a lot of alerts and some people are very complacent and say they will stay no matter what. But there is only one road out of town, so if there is a problem you do need to be on it. Emergency crews are also fighting blazes in South Australia and New South Wales. Cooler weather should help the massive firefighting effort, says the BBC's Phil Mercer in Sydney, although strong, gusty winds continue to fan the flames. More than 70 fires are burning across Victoria and 15 emergency warnings are in effect, with up-to-date local information available on the Vic Emergency website. Hundreds of firefighters and dozens of fire engines are battling the blazes. Fire authorities are worried about the threat posed to the coal-fired 1,600-megawatt Hazlewood Power Station in Latrobe Valley, local media reported. Homes have been lost in the Melbourne suburbs of Warrandyte and Mickleham, and in Gisborne some 50km (30 miles) north-west of the city.

Context: The Browns were making their first trip to San Diego since 2006. The game was back and forth, with neither team leading by more than one possession. The Chargers led 7-3 after the 1st quarter. On the Browns' first drive of the second quarter, QB Josh McCown threw a 34-yard touchdown pass to RB Duke Johnson to put the Browns up 10-7. The teams traded field goals, making it a 13-13 game at halftime. The Browns scored a field goal at the start of the 3rd quarter to go up 16-13. On the Chargers' next drive, QB Philip Rivers led the Chargers to a touchdown, going up 20-16 heading into the 4th quarter. After K Travis Coons kicked a field goal to cut the deficit to 20-19, Rivers led another touchdown drive to put the Chargers up 27-19. On the Browns' next drive, they reached the end zone, assisted by an incredible catch by TE Gary Barnidge on the Chargers' 1 yard line. They converted on the two point conversion to tie the game at 27-27 with just over 2 minutes remaining. The Chargers reached the Browns' 24 yard line with under 50 seconds to play. The Browns began to use timeouts until the Chargers faced 4th down with 2 seconds to play. After the Chargers called timeout, their kicker had an opportunity to win the game with a 39-yard field goal. The 39 yard game winning attempt was off to the right, and the game appeared to be on its way to overtime.. However, CB Tramon Williams was flagged for being offside during the play, giving the Chargers another attempt, this time from 34 yards. The field goal was converted, and the Chargers won 30-27.

My husband could live out of two bags, use about five kitchen items each year, and doesn’t gather anything for future use or hang on to much for sentimental value. (Which probably means the items he has hung on to mean a whole lot more!) I am always tucking something away here or stashing materials there…all in preparation for “some day.” It’s also part of the teacher in me. Do you know many teachers that don’t have a ton of stuff or utilize every bit of storage available? But, over the last several years, I’ve been fairly good about going through things every six months and weeding out a little here and a little there. Today I’ll be sharing six simple ways to declutter your home and why you should! GIVE THINGS AWAY It’s nice to make money, but sometimes you come across something that you really think someone else could use and you don’t want to throw it away. If it’s the perfect fit for that person, they may adopt the item and add their own wear and tear! Anyone that’s had children knows that kids go through things so fast and it’s nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative. If the receiver decides they don’t want the item, let it be. They’ll either get rid of it on their own or decline the offer. If they choose the latter, maybe the rest of this list will help. PACK If you know you don’t want to purge an item from your house AND you know that you will use it in the future, but it’s not an everyday use item, pack it up. We have several containers of things in our garage that are full of items we use once or twice each year. I have added close to 100 boxes of things to simply declutter our home while it’s on the market. I took a look at everything and kept the essentials (well, maybe even more than the essentials), and packed up the rest.

Other systems such as telephone, electricity, cable etc. are no better. Poor planning has further been aggravated by extremely mismanaged maintenance and operational bugs. This morning, when I was out for our fajr (morning prayers) in masjid, a neighbor told me that the pole laden with electricity meters was under fire. After that he buzzed off for complaint office. When I returned after prayers, I saw fire reaching cable part after meter; one meter had caught fire and other meters (including ours) was in danger of catching fire. It was still dark. I waited for someone to come out. No one appeared. I came inside and told my wife about and went again out to see if I could find someone to go about extinguishing fire. IT WAS DAM RISKY AS DIGGING WAS DONE BY TELEPHONE COMPANY AND RAINS HAD MADE A MESS ON OUR STREET. No one was seen. My wife came out; brought hose pipe. I managed to use it as water gun and there was some post-extinguishing sparking; fire was put out. I want to add here that hose pipe should only be used when someone knows how to send bursts of water so that electric current cannot build a circuit.

Rats are empathetic and can feel each other's pain.. (4). Female rats are more empathetic than male rats.. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Empathy lets us feel another person's pain and drives us to help. Do any other animals feel empathy? Scientists recently found that rats do, too. Most people don't like rats. In many people's eyes, rats are only bad. But Jean Decety and his partners at the University of Chicago did an experiment. It showed that rats are kind, warm-hearted animals. They can feel each other's pain. Scientists placed pairs of rats in plastic cages for two weeks. During this time they got to know each other. Then they put one of the rats from each pair into a small container in the cages. The small container had a door. It was so designed as to fall to the side when the free rat touched it. Many of the trapped rats squeaked to show their discomfort. The other rats of the pairs could see their suffering friends clearly. In most pairs, the free rats would become very worried about their friends. They kept trying to save their friends again and again throughout the month. Scientists put the rats' favorite chocolate in the cages, but the rats didn't eat it until they had saved their friends successfully. Scientists also found that female rats seemed to act more empathetic than male rats. \\"The results are the first to show that rats take action in response to another's trouble,\\" Decety said. \\"Monkeys and chimpanzees have similar behavior. But unlike those animals, rats can be ready used in laboratory studies. They will help us to learn which parts of the brain lead to empathy and helping behavior and whether empathy is natural.\\" Question: What does the passage mainly tell us? Answer: Answer:","completion":"The passage mainly tells us that rats are empathetic animals capable of feeling each other's pain and taking action to help their friends in distress. The study conducted at the University of Chicago demonstrated that rats would go to great lengths to save their friends, even prioritizing their friends' well-being over their favorite food, chocolate. It also mentions that female rats appear to be more empathetic than male rats. The findings suggest that empathy is not exclusive to humans and may be a natural behavior in other animals, such as rats, which can provide valuable insights for future laboratory studies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

John Kerry: Isis and Assad regime enjoy 'symbiotic' relationship The US has accused Syria’s president and the Islamic State group of enjoying a “symbiotic” relationship as it seeks to shore up support for its strategy of supporting moderate rebels ahead of key Congressional votes. In a speech in Washington just hours after the death of the latest American hostage at the hands of the Islamist militants known as Isis or Isil, Secretary of State John Kerry argued the country’s two sworn enemies were propping each other up. “I am aware that some believe the air strikes against Isil in Iraq and Syria will have the perverse affect of assisting the country’s long time dictator Bashar al-Assad, whose ruthless repression has generated the gravest humanitarian catastrophe certainly of this century,” he said. “That assumption is actually based on a misreading of the political reality in Syria. In fact the Assad regime and Isil are dependent on one and other, that’s why Assad has relentlessly bombed areas held by the moderate opposition while doing almost nothing to hinder Isil’s march.” “Assad and Isil are symbiotic,” added Kerry. “Isil presents itself as the only alternative to Assad. Assad purports to be the last line of defence against Isil. Both are stronger as a result.” The claim marks a fresh rhetorical offensive for a US administration which is under pressure to explain how its air strikes against Isis help more moderate rebels rather than support their enemy, the Syrian government, instead. The argument is a particular challenge in Washington where Barack Obama has called on Congress to provide fresh authorisation to continue military operations in Syria and Iraq, but many are questioning whether the weakness of moderate allies is a fatal flaw in its strategy. But Kerry compared this long-term challenge to past US intervention in Central America, where he said “right wing militaries and left wing guerrillas each exploited the extremism of the other and the cycle was broken only when the United States joined with regional allies and political moderates to build up the centre”. Whether the analogy holds in the Middle East is less clear, but the US has been bolstered by recent battlefield setbacks suffered by Isis and believes that the equally weak moderate rebels can eventually be bolstered. “The political equation of extremes against the middle is undeniably present in Syria,” said Kerry in his speech at the Transformational Trends Strategic Forum hosted by Foreign Policy magazine. “For too long Syrians have felt that their only choice is actually no choice at all; with terrorists on one side and a vicious dictator on the other. Our strategy is to offer the possibility of change.” Congressional aides on Capitol Hill say Obama is still likely to get his requested vote on extending US military authorisation, but there is growing anxiety about the lapse of previous legal cover and pressure from Republicans to delay any votes until the new Congress is sworn in next January. “It’s not so much a question of if, but when,” one senior Democratic staffer told The Guardian on Monday. What was this article about?","completion":"This article discusses the views of the then-U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry, on the relationship between the Islamic State group (ISIS or ISIL) and the regime of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. Kerry stated that both groups benefit from each other's presence and actions, creating a \\"symbiotic\\" relationship. ISIS projects itself as the only alternative to Assad, while Assad presents himself as the last defense against ISIS. Acknowledging the public's concern that U.S. airstrikes against ISIS might indirectly support Assad, Kerry argued that such belief was based on a misunderstanding of the situation. He pointed out that in reality, Assad and ISIS are mutually dependent. The U.S. was under pressure to explain how its air strikes against ISIS were helping the moderate rebels rather than aiding their enemy, the Syrian government. There was also a debate in Congress about authorizing continued U.S. military action in Syria and Iraq. Kerry stated that the U.S.'s strategy is to build a moderate alternative in Syria, drawing parallels to past U.S. interventional strategy in Central America where regional allies and moderates were bolstered to break the cycle of extremism. However, there were questions on whether this analogy would hold true in the Middle East situation.

Canons Regular are priests living in the community under the Rule of Saint Augustine. This means they promise to live their lives together, sharing everything and praying together. They are not monks because monks live a life of work and prayer that is usually separate from the world, while the Dominican Brothers, as Canons Regular, were active in the world spreading the Gospel.

Two neighboring police Departments took different approaches to fighting crime, Greenville P.D. did not invest in DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology, while Grayville took extensive measures of that nature. Hint: Law enforcement officers are often unfamiliar with information technology, and so lack the skills and interest in pursuing attackers. There are also budgetary constraints. It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as DNA testing, and improved forensics mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a network administrator or a system administrator) requires a search warrant and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant.

Q:Information: - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate. - Malmö is the capital and largest city of the Swedish county of Scania. Malmö is the third largest city in Sweden, after Stockholm and Gothenburg, and the 6th biggest city in the Nordic countries, with a population of above 300,000. The Malmö Metropolitan Region is home to 700,000 people, and the Øresund Region, which includes Malmö, is home to 3.9 million people. - Skandinavisk Aero Industri A / S ( abbreviated SAI ) was a Danish manufacturer of aeroplanes that existed between 1937 and 1954 . The company was founded by technician Viggo Kramme ( 1905 -- 1984 ) and engineer Karl Gustav Zeuthen ( 1909 -- 1989 ) and based in Copenhagen . The company 's aeroplanes were labelled \`\` KZ '' for Kramme and Zeuthen , the first being the KZ I from 1937 . The KZ IV was built as an ambulance plane for Zone - Redningskorpset and introduced in 1944 . Post-war sales never reached the company 's expectations , and production turned unprofitable in the early 1950s , driving the company to shutdown . In total , about 200 planes were built by the company . A number of the KZ planes have been preserved . As of 2005 , Dansk Veteranflysamling ( The Danish Collection of Vintage Aircraft ) exhibits a specimen of each of the 11 aircraft models manufactured by the company . - Amager (or, especially among older speakers) is a Danish island in the Øresund. The Danish capital, Copenhagen, is partly situated on Amager, which is connected to the much larger island of Zealand by five bridges. Amager also has a connection across the Øresund to Sweden, the Øresund Bridge. Its western part begins with a tunnel from Amager to another Danish island, Peberholm. Copenhagen Airport is located on the island, around from Copenhagen city centre. Amager is the largest island in the Øresund, and the only one with a large population. , 192,709 people live on the island, including its northern tip, Christianshavn. The northern part is included in the Copenhagen municipality. The middle part comprises Tårnby municipality, and Dragør municipality is located on the southeast part of the island. Most of the western part is land that was reclaimed from the sea from the 1930s-1950s. This enlargement, from the shallow sound towards Zealand, is known as \\"Kalveboderne\\". The enlargement has never been built-up and its soil isn't suitable for agricultural use. However the area between Dragør town and the airport is cultivated land of high quality. Amager has in the past been referred to as the \\"kitchen of Copenhagen\\". At the border of the enlargement there is an old beech forest, \\"Kongelunden\\" (The King's Grove). - The Copenhagen metropolitan area (or Metropolitan Copenhagen) is a large commuter belt (the area in which it is practical to commute to work) surrounding Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark. It is known to include Copenhagen Municipality, Frederiksberg and surrounding municipalities stretching westward across Zealand. It has densely-populated core surrounded by suburban settlements. - The Øresund/Öresund/Oresund Bridge (, , hybrid name: \\"\\") is a combined railway and motorway bridge across the Øresund strait between Sweden and Denmark. The bridge runs nearly from the Swedish coast to the artificial island Peberholm in the middle of the strait. The crossing is completed by the Drogden Tunnel from Peberholm to the Danish island of Amager. - Copenhagen (, ); ) is the capital and most populated city of Denmark. It has a municipal population of 591,481 and a larger urban population of 1,280,371. The Copenhagen metropolitan area has just over 2 million inhabitants. The city is situated on the eastern coast of the island of Zealand; another small portion of the city is located on Amager, and is separated from Malmö, Sweden, by the strait of Øresund. The Øresund Bridge connects the two cities by rail and road. - Øresund or Öresund is a strait which forms the DanishSwedish border, separating Sjælland (Denmark) from Skåne (Sweden). The strait has a length of and the width varies from to . It is wide at its narrowest point between Helsingør in Denmark and Helsingborg in Sweden. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - Zealand is the largest (7,031 km) and most populated island in Denmark with a population of 2,267,659 (39% of Denmark's total as of January 2016).

Literary career During the war Camus joined the French Resistance cell Combat, which published an underground newspaper of the same name. This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the nom de guerre Beauchard. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, The Flies, in June 1943. When the Ailies liberated Paris in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. He resigned from Combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned left, politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre. In 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published The Rebel, a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays. Camus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in The Myth of Sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works, such as The Stranger and The Plague. Despite his split from his \\"study partner\\", Sartre, Camus was still categorized as an Existentialist. He specifically rejected that label in his essay \\"Enigma\\" and elsewhere.

So how does the force of gravity change? It doesnt if you stay on Earth. What if we travel to another planet or moon in our solar system? Look at the photo of astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. taken by fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong in the Figure. They were the first humans to walk on the moon. An astronaut weighs less on the moon than he would on Earth.

Step 1: Gather your ingredients and equipment For this simple recipe, you will need: - 1 cup (240 milliliters) water - 1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar - A cooking pot - A stove - A whisk or wooden spoon (to stir) - A funnel (for transferring the mixture) - A clean, airtight bottle/container (for storage) Step 2: Combine water and sugar First, pour 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water into the pot. Next, add 1 cup (200 grams) of granulated sugar. Mixing the ingredients in the pot before heating will ensure a more uniform and consistent syrup. Step 3: Begin heating the mixture Place the pot on the stove and set it to medium heat. As the water starts to heat, use a whisk or wooden spoon to stir the mixture so that the sugar will dissolve evenly. Step 4: Bring the mixture to a boil Keep an eye on the mixture and continue stirring. Once it begins to boil, this means the sugar has almost completely dissolved into the water. Step 5: Reduce heat and let the mixture simmer As soon as the mixture starts boiling, reduce the stove's heat to low. Allow the sugar water to simmer for a minute or two, which will provide enough time for any remaining sugar particles to dissolve completely. This step also helps create a smoother and more refined syrup. Step 6: Remove from heat and cool Turn off the stove and carefully take the pot off the heat. Now let the sugar water cool to room temperature. Cooling the mixture prior to storage will prevent condensation in the container, which can cause the syrup to spoil. Step 7: Transfer the sugar water to a bottle Once the sugar water is cooled, use a funnel to pour it into a clean, airtight bottle or container. Make sure to seal the container properly to maintain the freshness and quality of the syrup. Step 8: Store the sugar water in the refrigerator For optimal storage and shelf-life, place the sugar water in the refrigerator. This will help the syrup last longer, as well as maintain its taste and consistency. Conclusion Preparing sugar water at home is a simple process that requires only a few basic ingredients and steps. By following this guide, you can enjoy a versatile and delicious syrup to enhance your beverages and even use it as a base for creative concoctions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Saving the Bombers: How Joe Girardi, Brian Cashman and a Yankees' rally in Atlanta rescued 2009 BY Anthony Mccarron DAILY NEWS SPORTS WRITER Tuesday, August 25th 2009, 12:22 AM The night everything changed for the Yankees started out like any other night in what was rapidly turning into a lost season. It was June 24, and the Bombers had been so bad in the two weeks leading up to their game in Atlanta that GM Brian Cashman made an impromptu - and uncommon - trip to see for himself the Yankees squad that was just one game better than the expensive disappointment that failed to make the playoffs in 2008. Alex Rodriguez, hailed as a savior when he returned from hip surgery and homered on his first swing seven weeks earlier, was exhausted and mired in the worst slump of his career. Joe Girardi's club was five games behind the Red Sox and 0-8 against their rivals. A shutout loss to the Braves the night before was so disheartening that Yankees players called a private meeting to talk about focus. In the game that night, two Braves rookies, Kenshin Kawakami and Kris Medlen, combined to retire the first 15 batters they faced, as the Yankees trailed 1-0 through five innings - this on the heels of losing five of six to the Nationals, Marlins and Braves. But Girardi was ejected in the sixth inning for arguing with the umpire when Brett Gardner was picked off first base and the Yankees rallied to score eight runs over the final four innings - keyed by Rodriguez's two-run single in the sixth that snapped a 1-for-25 skid and showed the Yankees the value of resting their recovering star, who had sat for two days in Florida. That night is the watershed moment of the Yankees' season, when several events converged and the team morphed into what it is now - the best team in baseball at 78-46 entering Tuesday's game against the visiting Rangers. The Yankees have won at an astonishing .741 clip (40-14) since that night. They have gone from five games behind Boston to 7Â½Â games ahead and they have beaten the Red Sox in six of their last seven meetings, including two of three at Fenway over the weekend. Hideki Matsui described the June 23 team meeting and the comeback the next day as among \\"the key points in the season that helped this team go on a run.\\" Mark Teixeira, who along with Derek Jeter spoke at that meeting, said the message from that night still resonates. \\"I remember the guys in there maybe refocusing a little bit and maybe realizing how good we are,\\" Teixeira said. \\"Realizing that we expect to win every night and since then that's been our attitude.\\" Since then, the Yankees have scored the second-most runs in the majors and hit the most home runs. Their starters are 25-11 with a 4.10 ERA and have held opponents to three earned runs or less in 37 of 54 games. Yankees relievers are 15-3 with a 3.81 ERA, have struck out 158 in 163 innings and held opponents to a .233 average. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"The night of June 24, 2009, marked a turning point for the Yankees when they overcame a disastrous couple of weeks to rally and ultimately become the best team in baseball, winning at an astonishing .741 clip (40-14) since that night.

Rub a texturizing cream, mousse or wax between your hands and then apply it to your hair.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: A Step-by-Step Guide to Styling Your Hair with Texturizing Products Introduction: Are you tired of having flat, lifeless hair? Do you crave volume and texture for a more contemporary, stylish look? In this article, we will walk you through the process of texturizing your hair using various products, such as texturizing cream, mousse, or wax. Specifically, we will explore the optional steps of thinning out and texturizing the sides and back of your hair, followed by the application of texturizing products to achieve a modern, edgy hairstyle. Step 1: Thin It Out (Optional) If your hair is thick and tends to be unruly, you might consider thinning it out. Thinning scissors or razors are perfect for this task. These tools are designed to remove bulk from your hair. With thinning scissors, you'll cut just a portion of hair with each snip, reducing the density without significantly changing the length. Justification: Thinning out your hair can make it more manageable and lightweight, making it easier to style and maintain. Step 2: Texturize the Sides and Back of Your Hair (Optional) For those who want a more edgy, modern hairstyle, consider texturizing the sides and back of your hair. This step entails making strategic cuts at varying lengths, resulting in an uneven, messy appearance that adds depth and dimension. To texturize your hair, use texturizing scissors, razors, or a combination of these tools. Justification: Texturizing the sides and back of your hair frames your face and enhances the overall hairstyle. It creates a more personalized look that complements your unique features. Step 3: Choose Your Texturizing Product Now that your hair has been prepped, it's time to choose your texturizing product. There are three main types of products to consider: texturizing cream, mousse, or wax. Each product has its unique benefits and will work differently based on your hair type and desired outcome. Justification: Selecting the right product for your hair type and preferred style is essential for achieving the desired level of texture and hold. Step 4: Apply the Texturizing Product To apply texturizing products, begin by rubbing the cream, mousse, or wax between your hands. This warms the product up, making it more pliable and easier to distribute evenly through your hair. Start by working the product into your hair from the roots, focusing on the areas where you want the most texture and volume. Use your fingers to shape and style your hair as desired. Justification: By applying the texturizing product with your hands, you have more control over the distribution of the product and can achieve the perfect balance of texture and volume. Conclusion: Texturizing products can breathe new life into your hairstyle and help you create a unique look that is right for you. By thinning out and texturizing your hair, selecting the best product for your needs, and applying it with care, you can transform your hair into a stunning, textured masterpiece. Experiment with different products and techniques to find the perfect combination for your hair type and style preferences."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: Monteux's first high-profile conducting experience came in 1895, when he was barely 20 years old. He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui – Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor. answer the following question: Where was the man who's musical career was interrupted in 1896 principal conductor in 1907? A:","completion":"In 1907, the man whose musical career was interrupted in 1896, Monteux, was the principal conductor at Dieppe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer:","completion":"The \\"Streibich Blacksmith Shop\\" most likely belongs to the category of a building. A blacksmith shop is a specific type of facility where blacksmiths forge and shape metals using various tools, heat, and techniques. These shops have been an essential part of history, supplying both functional and ornamental objects, such as tools, horseshoes, and weaponry. Blacksmithing dates back thousands of years, often seen as a central part of communities, providing indispensable services to the populace. A blacksmith shop could be established within a village, near sources of raw materials, and other facilities that require metal works, such as the town's market or agricultural areas. The term \\"Streibich\\" seems to be a family name, and it is likely that the blacksmith shop belongs to or is operated by the Streibich family, hence the name \\"Streibich Blacksmith Shop.\\" This association indicates that the facility is named after its proprietor or owner, which is a common practice among family-run businesses. Considering these factors, it can be concluded that \\"Streibich Blacksmith Shop\\" is a building: a craftsman's workshop, where the age-old art of blacksmithing takes place to create functional and decorative metalworks. It is important to note that while the primary categorization of the title is that of a building, it can also be contextualized as a small family-run company that deals in the business of blacksmithing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. Paragraph: In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would Tanzania have thicker or thinner \\"A horizon\\" than Kenya?","completion":"Based on the background information provided and the specific habitats present in Kenya and Tanzania, Tanzania would have a thinner A horizon than Kenya. Step-by-step: 1. The paragraph states that Kenyan grasslands have predominantly deep, fibrous grass root systems, while Tanzanian forests rely on fallen tree leaves as their primary source of soil organic matter. 2. Grasslands tend to develop thicker A horizons with a deeper distribution of organic matter due to higher contributions from roots. 3. Forests, such as those in Tanzania, are likely to store most of their organic matter in the O horizon with thin A horizons because of their greater acidity, which inhibits the action of soil organisms that would otherwise mix surface litter into the mineral soil. 4. Therefore, considering the features of grasslands and forests, it can be concluded that Tanzania would have a thinner A horizon compared to Kenya."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"The given review would likely decrease the chances of buying the product for several reasons. Here's a detailed analysis of the review and its impact on the purchasing decision: 1. Negative review title: The review title, \\"Falls Apart Immediately,\\" immediately gives a negative impression of the product. This suggests that the product is not durable or well-made, which may be an important factor for potential buyers. 2. Quality issues: The review explicitly mentions that the pieces of the puzzle were falling apart and splintering. This indicates that the product has quality issues, which are significant concerns for buyers who want a lasting and safe product for their children. 3. Preferable alternatives: The reviewer mentions that using cardboard for the puzzle pieces would've been better if the quality of wood can't be improved. This suggests that there may be better, alternative products in the market made of cardboard or other materials, which potential buyers might prefer. 4. Safety concerns: The fact that the wooden puzzle pieces were splintering and the painted portions were coming off could raise safety concerns for potential buyers, especially if the product is intended for children. Children may be at risk of injuring themselves while using the product, or ingesting paint chips. 5. Mixed opinions: While the review does mention that the kids enjoyed the puzzle and preferred the wooden puzzle over cardboard ones (except for the quality issues), their enjoyment was overshadowed by the significant drawbacks mentioned. The reviewer expresses hope that this review was helpful, suggesting that these issues should be considered by prospective buyers.

Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Winter is dangerous because it's so difficult to know what is going to happen and accidents take place so easily. Fog can be waiting to meet you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hiding under the melting snow, waiting ahead to send you off the road. The car coming to you may suddenly slip across the road. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly . Sudden movements can make a car very difficult to control. So every time you either start or stop your car, increase or reduce your speed, you must be as gentle and slow as possible. Suppose you are driving with a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive so that you wouldn't spill it. Rule Number Two is to pay attention to what might happen. The more ice there is, the further down the road you have to look. Test how long it takes to gently stop your car. Remember that you may be driving more quickly than you think. Generally, allow twice of your usual stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to stay in control of your car at all times and you will not get into trouble. Question: According to the passage, the writer thinks that _ . Options: A: people should not drive in the snow B: drivers should think more about problems in winter driving C: people drive too fast in winter D: winter drivers should stop their cars less The answer is:","completion":"B: drivers should think more about problems in winter driving The passage primarily discusses the challenges and dangers that winter driving presents, such as fog, ice, and snow causing accidents and loss of control over the vehicle. The writer emphasizes that drivers should be cautious and adapt their driving habits to avoid potential accidents. Rule Number One and Rule Number Two provide guidelines for driving smoothly and paying attention to potential hazards or changes in road conditions. Option A is incorrect because the writer does not suggest that people should avoid driving in the snow altogether; instead, they provide tips on how to drive more safely during these conditions. Option C is not entirely accurate, as the passage does not specifically state that people drive too fast in winter. While the passage implies that drivers may be going faster than they think, the focus is on adjusting the stopping distance and driving carefully. Option D is not supported by the passage, as it does not address the frequency of stopping the car but rather emphasizes being gentle and slow when making any movements. In conclusion, the most accurate answer is option B, as the writer encourages drivers to think more about problems in winter driving and adjust their driving habits accordingly to maintain control and safety on icy roads."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: If you rent a condominium in a glove-shaped state where are you?

Article: Almost 80% of the Americans have stated their opposition to cloning pet animals such as cats and dogs, yet companies still try to make a business out of selling cloned pets. Pet cloning has been promoted as a way to \\"bring back\\" or \\"copy\\" a beloved companion animal. However, studies have shown that cloning remains an experimental technology with many failures. Behind each lovely picture of a cloned cat or dog lie hundreds of animals that were kept in lab cages, receiving bad treatment to produce just that one cloned animal. For all that, you end up with a cloned animal who is unlikely to appear like the original physically or behaviorally and may experience serious health problems. Also, while pet cloning companies are charging customers up to 150,000 for a cloned pet, millions of homeless animals of the same species are available in US animal shelters for around 100. Unfortunately, most of these animals are killed for lack of adopting homes. With No Pet Cloning campaign, the American Anti-Vivisection Society (AAVS) tries to protect both animals and people from harm. They campaigned until the US companies that sold cloned animals closed their doors. First it was Genetic Savings & Clone Inc. and then it was BioArts International. When BioArts was closed, its owner, Lou Hawthorne, finally had to _ the problems of pet cloning. According to Hawthorne, he has seen numerous failures during his pet cloning attempts, \\"One clone----which was supposed to be black and white----was born greenish-yellow where it should have been white (we still have no good explanation for how that happened).\\" The AAVS is educating the public about the animal suffering and is seeking regulation of cloning activities. They will continue to take the lead in protecting animals from the threats of pet cloning. Question: From the passage, we know that _ . Options: A: pets are often deserted by their owners B: more and more people have joined the AAVS C: most American are against cloning pet animals D: the American Anti-Vivisection Society is supported by the government The answer is:","completion":"C: most Americans are against cloning pet animals.

Minnesota is known for a politically active citizenry, and populism has been a long-standing force among the state's political parties. Minnesota has a consistently high voter turnout. In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, 78.2% of eligible Minnesotans voted—the highest percentage of any U.S. state—versus the national average of 61.2%. Voters can register on election day at their polling places with evidence of residency.Hubert Humphrey brought national attention to the state with his address at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota is the only state in the nation that did not vote for Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota has gone for the Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Republican Richard Nixon. Both the Democratic and Republican parties have major-party status in Minnesota, but its state-level \\"Democratic\\" party is actually a separate party, officially known as the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL).

Does it follow that \\"The emperor is going to received the leader of the barbarians.\\"?","completion":"Yes, it can be inferred from the statement, \\"Because the barbarians are coming today and the emperor's waiting to receive their leader,\\" that \\"The emperor is going to receive the leader of the barbarians.\\" Here's a detailed analysis to support this inference: 1. Context: The given statement provides information about an event that is expected to occur today. This event involves two main parties - the barbarians and the emperor. The barbarians are apparently arriving, while the emperor is preparing to welcome them. 2. The Barbarians: The term \\"barbarians\\" often refers to a group of people who are considered uncivilized or primitive by another group. In this case, the barbarians represent a different culture or group that is coming to meet with the emperor. The mention of the barbarians coming today suggests that they are traveling and are anticipated to arrive soon. 3. The Emperor: As a central authority figure or ruler, the emperor likely represents the host in this situation, responsible for meeting and entertaining guests. By stating that the emperor is waiting to receive the leader of the barbarians, the text implies a sense of formality in the meeting. The emperor's presence at the meeting also indicates that this event holds some significance. 4. The Meeting: The word \\"receive\\" in this context implies that there will be a formal greeting between the emperor and the barbarians. It can be assumed that the primary purpose of the meeting is to establish a dialogue between the two groups, discuss matters of mutual importance, and perhaps negotiate terms. The reception of the barbarian leader by the emperor signifies the importance the emperor places on this meeting. 5. The Leader of the Barbarians: By specifically mentioning the leader of the barbarians, the text highlights the role of leadership in the anticipated meeting. The emperor receiving the barbarian leader suggests that there will be a direct communication between these key figures, possibly representing the interests of their respective groups. In conclusion, based on the information given, it can be inferred that \\"The emperor is going to receive the leader of the barbarians.\\" The statement provides context and information about an expected meeting between the two groups. The emperor is waiting, indicating that the meeting is significant and that he wishes to greet the barbarian leader, who represents the visiting group. This meeting is likely to involve direct dialogue, discussion, or negotiation between the emperor and the barbarian leader."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles.

Answer this question please: Will the pressure of a sealed container increase or decrease when a gas inside it is heated?","completion":"To answer this question, let's analyze the situation step by step: 1. We are given a sealed container, which means no gas can enter or leave the container. 2. The gas inside the container is being heated. Now, let's refer back to the background information provided. When the Kelvin temperature of a gas is doubled (from 300 K to 600 K in the example), the kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases. This results in more forceful collisions with the walls of the container, causing the pressure of the gas to double. Applying this information to the situation with the sealed container, as the gas inside the container is heated, the temperature increases. This leads to an increase in the kinetic energy of the gas molecules, causing them to collide more forcefully with the walls of the container.

We can combine these terms: -27*g + 81 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable g. To do this, we want to move the constant term (81) to the other side of the equation. Subtract 81 from both sides of the equation: -27*g = -81 Step 3: Solve for g. Now we need to get g by itself. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by -27: g = -81 / -27 Step 4: Simplify the answer.

Write an article with the title: \\"Trillions in Debt-but for Now, No Reason to Worry\\" Article:","completion":"Title: \\"Trillions in Debt - But For Now, No Reason to Worry\\" Hi kids! Do you know what debt is? Debt is when someone borrows money from someone else and promises to pay it back later. When a country is in debt, it means that the country has borrowed money to pay for things it needs, like building roads, schools, and hospitals. Today, we are going to talk about a big number called \\"trillion.\\" A trillion is a number with 12 zeros after it. That's a lot of zeros! If you had a trillion candies, you would have enough candies to share with all your friends and still have plenty left over. Now, imagine a country that has borrowed trillions of dollars. That sounds like a lot of money, right? You might think it's a big problem, but for now, there is no reason to worry. \\"Do you want to know why?\\" First of all, countries borrow money from other countries and from special banks, called \\"central banks.\\" These banks can create new money, so they always have money to lend. Central banks lend money to help countries grow and get better over time. Just like how your mom or dad might give you some money when you need it, countries also borrow money when they need it. And as long as the country uses the borrowed money for good things, like helping people and making the country better, it can be helpful. \\"But what if the country can't pay back the money?\\" Good question! When a country cannot pay back its debt, it can cause problems. But right now, many countries are doing okay, and they are able to pay back the money they owe. Also, sometimes when countries have trouble paying back their debt, they will talk with the banks or the countries where they borrowed the money. Together, they can figure out a plan, like giving the country more time to pay back the money. So, even though trillions in debt might seem like a huge number, right now, there is no reason to worry. Countries and banks are working together to make sure that everyone can pay back their debt and keep growing and getting better. Just like how you and your friends help each other, countries also help each other. As long as everyone works together and uses the borrowed money wisely, it's okay to have debt. And remember, if you ever hear someone talking about a country with trillions in debt, you can tell them not to worry. Because, for now, everything is under control. Isn't it amazing to learn something new every day?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. DC systems (especially third-rail systems) are limited to relatively low voltages and this can limit the size and speed of trains and cannot use low-level platform and also limit the amount of air-conditioning that the trains can provide. This may be a factor favouring overhead wires and high-voltage AC, even for urban usage. In practice, the top speed of trains on third-rail systems is limited to 100 mph (160 km/h) because above that speed reliable contact between the shoe and the rail cannot be maintained. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Why DC system can effect the speed of trains?","completion":"The use of a Direct Current (DC) system can indeed affect the speed of trains due to various reasons which are mainly related to the technical aspects of the electrical system. Below are the key factors that contribute to the limitation of train speeds when using DC systems: 1. Limited voltage: DC systems typically use lower voltage levels than their Alternating Current (AC) counterparts. This is because higher voltage DC systems are more complex to design, install, and maintain. Lower voltage levels translate to less power, which in turn limits the capacity of train motors to propel the trains at higher speeds. 2. Power distribution constraints: Third-rail systems, which are common for DC traction, distribute power via a conductor rail that runs alongside the track. One of the reasons DC systems are limited in speed is that they rely on physical contact between the conductor shoe of the train and the third rail. As train speed increases, maintaining consistent, reliable contact between the shoe and the rail becomes increasingly challenging. This results in unstable power transfer, which may lead to fluctuations in motor performance and limit train speed. 3. Energy losses: DC systems experience energy losses in the form of resistive heating due to the resistance of the conductor rail. At higher currents, the energy losses become more significant, which reduces the power available for the train. To compensate for the energy loss, it is required to increase the power supply which may result in higher energy costs and infrastructure upgrades. 4. Train acceleration: DC traction systems typically offer less efficient acceleration than their AC counterparts due to the differences in their electric motor designs. Inefficient acceleration can lead to longer travel times and limits in maximum achievable train speed. 5. Air conditioning and auxiliary systems: Low voltage systems limit the amount of electrical power available for non-traction systems, like air conditioning and auxiliary systems, onboard the train. This can be a drawback, especially in densely-populated urban areas where passenger comfort is a priority. 6. Upgradability: Another reason for the preference of AC overhead lines is their scalability and upgradability. High-voltage AC systems can be upgraded more easily and economically to cater to increased train speeds and power requirements, making them a more future-proof solution for railway infrastructure. While DC systems have certain limitations when it comes to train speeds, they do offer some advantages, such as lower infrastructure costs and simpler electrical systems, which make them a preferred choice for urban railways and low-speed applications. However, for long-distance routes and high-speed trains, AC systems with overhead wires are generally considered superior due to their higher power levels and fewer limitations related to train speed and performance."},{"prompt":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Summarize the following: Senior cats can have a difficult time getting around, which means that they may have trouble walking to their litter box. In addition, older cats can develop urinary tract problems that may make it challenging to get to the litter box in time. Placing litter boxes in the places where your cat spends most of her time will help prevent accidental urination or defecation. Litter boxes with low walls are easier for a senior cat to step into and out of. In addition to decreased mobility, your senior cat may also be losing her vision and hearing. Because of this, she may start to feel insecure in her ability to navigate her environment. By maintaining her consistent schedule of feeding and playtime, you can help her feel safer and more comfortable in her environment. Massaging your senior cat can help loosen her stiff muscles and joints and stimulate her blood circulation. In addition, massaging her can help her feel more connected to you—something that is very important to older cats. Also, massaging your senior cat gives you an opportunity to gently examine her all over and identify lumps and bumps that may require closer examination by your veterinarian. Be gentle when you massage your cat. To massage your cat, make small circles with your fingers. Start behind her ears and slowly work your way down her neck. Continue to massage her down her back. Make sure to avoid massaging areas that may be painful for your cat. With potentially stiff muscles and joints, your senior cat may not be able to groom herself as well as she used to. Be sure to use a soft brush when you brush her, since the skin of older cats is more sensitive than a younger cat’s skin. Trim your senior cat’s nails if she will let you. Her nails may need to be trimmed more frequently (every few weeks) if she cannot use the scratching post as much as she used to. Trim her nails to just above the quick—the blood vessel that runs up the middle of her nail. Cat’s nails tend to curve under towards the foot pad when they grow too long, which would be very uncomfortable for your cat. Begin trimming her nails when you notice that she can no longer use the scratching post to prevent her nails from growing too long. Your senior cat has different nutritional needs than a younger cat. When she is 7 to 9 years old, begin transitioning her over to a senior cat diet from an adult maintenance diet. This will help ensure she receives the proper balance of nutrients. Transition to the new diet over 5 days: day 1 (20% new diet, 80% old diet), day 2 (40% new diet, 60% old diet), day 3 (60% new diet, 40% old diet), day 4 (80% new diet, 20% old diet), day 5 (100% new diet). Depending on your senior cat’s medical condition, she may also need dietary supplements (e.g., probiotics, fatty acids). Consult with your veterinarian before making any changes to your cat’s diet. Your senior cat will definitely appreciate some extra padding when she sleeps. In addition to achy joints, your senior cat may have also lost some muscle mass that would make sleep very uncomfortable. Summary:","completion":"Senior cats face challenges with mobility, vision, hearing, grooming, and nutrition.

In most cases, an operating room is associated with medical professionals performing surgery on humans. The presence of blood further supports this notion, as surgeries typically involve cutting or modifying tissues within the body. 2. Connection to surgery: Out of the possible answers, \\"person\\" is the most directly related to the context of surgery. Soccer game, for example, is not related to surgery or operating rooms. A muscle and a vein might be part of a surgery, but they don't represent the subject being operated on. Animals could be a possible answer as veterinarians perform surgeries on animals, but it is less likely and common than operations on human beings. 3. Real-world expectations: When we hear about surgeries in everyday conversations, news stories, or other forms of communication, human surgeries are the most common topic. Operations on animals might be a topic of discussion, particularly in the field of veterinary medicine, but they are less common than those that involve people. In summary, the answer \\"person\\" aligns with human common sense as it takes the context of the question into account and corresponds with both our general understanding of operating rooms and the prevalence of human surgeries in real-world situations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: How would Kai feel afterwards? Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: Good to do the yoga B: Like they could sell snacks C: starving Answer:","completion":"Based on the context provided, Kai participated in a 20-minute yoga class and then got something for a snack. To determine how Kai might feel afterward, we can consider the possible physical and mental effects of the given activities. Firstly, let's break down the effects of a yoga class on an individual. Yoga is generally known to provide numerous benefits such as increased flexibility, improved muscle strength, enhanced respiratory and blood circulation, as well as improved mental well-being. Participants often report feeling more relaxed, focused, and in tune with their bodies. A 20-minute yoga session, though relatively short, could still offer some of these benefits. After the yoga session, Kai grabbed a snack. This implies that Kai was likely feeling hungry or in need of some energy replenishment. Consuming a snack would potentially provide nourishment and energy needed to continue with the day's activities. Taking these factors into account, we can analyze each provided answer option: A: Good to do the yoga This answer suggests that Kai would feel good (positive) after engaging in the yoga activity. Considering the context and the potential benefits of yoga, this answer may partially capture Kai's feelings. However, this option does not address the fact that Kai had a snack afterward. B: Like they could sell snacks This statement does not effectively address how Kai would feel after a yoga class and having a snack. It implies that Kai would focus on the business aspect of selling snacks, which is irrelevant to the context and the possible emotions they might experience. C: Starving This answer implies that Kai would still feel extremely hungry after the yoga session. As Kai had a snack after the class, this option seems less accurate as one would assume that the snack quenched their hunger or provided energy to some extent. Considering the context and analyzing each option, the best answer among the three provided would be: Answer: A: Good to do the yoga This is due to the potential positive impact of a yoga class on physical and mental well-being, which aligns most closely with the context of Kai's experience. Although it does not fully capture the effect of having a snack afterward, it is the most relevant and accurate answer when compared to the other two options."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

In the years following its release, many reviewers considered To Kill a Mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations. Claudia Durst Johnson considers it \\"reasonable to believe\\" that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama: Rosa Parks' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person, which sparked the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott, and the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted (Myers eventually withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled, but reinstated in 1980).

Solve this instance: Abstract: While inflammatory phagocytosis of microbial pathogens and non-inflammatory phagocytosis of apoptotic cells have each been studied extensively, the consequences of innate immune recognition of host cells undergoing apoptosis as a direct result of infection are unclear. In this situation, the innate immune system is confronted with mixed signals, those from apoptotic cells and those from the infecting pathogen. Nuclear receptor activation has been implicated downstream of apoptotic cell recognition while Toll-like receptors are the prototypical inflammatory receptors engaged during infection. When the two signals combine, a new set of events takes place beginning with transrepression of a subset of inflammatory-response genes and ending with the induction of a T helper-17 adaptive immune response. This response is best suited for clearing the infecting pathogen and repairing the damage that occurred to the host tissue during infection.. Title: Infection and apoptosis as a combined inflammatory trigger. Student:","completion":"To solve this task, I will follow these steps: 1. Read and understand the given abstract and title. 2.

The film opens at Burger-Matic, where Henry Lever orders a milkshake at the drive-thru. At the window, he tells the attendant, Sally Jackson, that his wife knows about their affair. She asks him if he has also told his wife about her pregnancy. On his way home, he encounters a ferocious wind. It turns out to be an attack helicopter, which runs him off the road. In a panic, he flees through the woods and drops his heart medication. At an outdoor chapel, he sits on a bench as the helicopter hovers in front of him. The pilot, Angus Montier, shoots at the ground near him despite the protests of his copilot and brother, Dorian. The shots scare him enough to cause a fatal heart attack. Throughout their attack, Dorian and Angus can hear the chatter of Sally and her coworkers. Likewise, they can hear the helicopter pilots on their headsets. The next day, the police inform Beatrice Lever that Henry has died. She appears shocked and crestfallen, when Dorian and Angus arrive. It quickly becomes clear that she encouraged her sons to scare him to death. She is also furious about his affair, and wants revenge on his mistress. Angus and Dorian are worried that the people they heard on the radio might have overheard enough to connect them to his death.

Q:Gunshots rang out once again on a campus in the United States on Wednesday. Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: After the events of the story, the NRA still: Options: - harshly criticizes and attacks members of the Wear Orange political movement. - is critical and wary of any political movements that call for political change on the topic of gun rights. - not enough information - is unwilling to compromise and agree to any law or reform that compromises the right to own guns.

E. Hulme, and T. S. Eliot considered humanism to be sentimental 'slop'(\\" does answer the question \\"Who was one early naysayer of Humanism?\\" as it mentions three early 20th-century critics who held a negative view towards humanism. To provide a more detailed answer: Ezra Pound, Thomas Ernest Hulme, and Thomas Stearns Eliot were prominent literary figures and critics during the early 20th century, each with their own influential contributions to literature and critical thought. 1. Ezra Pound (1885-1972) was an American poet and critic, and he played a major role in shaping modernist literature. As a part of the Imagist movement, he valued precision in imagery and clear, concise language. He was critical of humanism because he believed that its emphasis on sentimentality led to an excess of emotionalism, a lack of clarity, and verbosity in writing. Pound considered this \\"slop\\" as it detracted from the purity and artistic integrity of literature. 2. T. E. Hulme (1883-1917) was an English poet and literary critic, known for his association with the Imagist movement and his influence on modernist poetry. Hulme shared Pound's dislike for humanism, agreeing that its focus on emotions and individual subjective experiences made it sentimental and indulgent. Hulme called for a return to classicism, with its emphasis on restraint, discipline, and strict formal structure, thus promoting a new direction for poetry at odds with humanist principles. 3. T. S. Eliot (1888-1965) was an American-born British poet, essayist, playwright, and literary critic. He is commonly regarded as one of the most significant and influential literary figures of the 20th century. Eliot was also critical of humanism and its excessive emotionalism. As a modernist writer, he sought to explore deeper psychological and spiritual themes in his work. He believed that humanism was overly focused on emotional expression and failed to address the complexities and challenges of modern human experience. The sentence you provided gives three examples of early naysayers of humanism: Ezra Pound, T. E. Hulme, and T. S. Eliot. Each of these critics held a negative view of humanism, believing that it promoted sentimentality and hindered the development of modernist literature. By rejecting humanism, these literary critics contributed to the emergence of new forms and styles of literature that shaped the course of 20th-century writing and literary criticism."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

What was the last name of the art historian who stated that the Kailasanath temple is considered an unrivalled work of rock architecture? Answer the above question based on the context below: The Rashtrakutas contributed much to the architectural heritage of the Deccan. Art historian Adam Hardy categorizes their building activity into three schools: Ellora, around Badami, Aihole and Pattadakal, and at Sirval near Gulbarga. The Rashtrakuta contributions to art and architecture are reflected in the splendid rock-cut cave temples at Ellora and Elephanta, areas also occupied by Jain monks, located in present-day Maharashtra. The Ellora site was originally part of a complex of 34 Buddhist caves probably created in the first half of the 6th century whose structural details show Pandyan influence. Cave temples occupied by Hindus are from later periods.The Rashtrakutas renovated these Buddhist caves and re-dedicated the rock-cut shrines. Amoghavarsha I espoused Jainism and there are five Jain cave temples at Ellora ascribed to his period. The most extensive and sumptuous of the Rashtrakuta works at Ellora is their creation of the monolithic Kailasanath Temple, a splendid achievement confirming the \\"Balhara\\" status as \\"one among the four principal Kings of the world\\". The walls of the temple have marvellous sculptures from Hindu mythology including Ravana, Shiva and Parvathi while the ceilings have paintings. The Kailasanath Temple project was commissioned by King Krishna I after the Rashtrakuta rule had spread into South India from the Deccan. The architectural style used is Karnata Dravida according to Adam Hardy. It does not contain any of the Shikharas common to the Nagara style and was built on the same lines as the Virupaksha temple at Pattadakal in Karnataka. According to art historian Vincent Smith, the achievement at the Kailasanath temple is considered an architectural consummation of the monolithic rock-cut temple and deserves to be considered one of the wonders of the world. According to art historian Percy Brown, as an accomplishment of art, the Kailasanath temple is considered an unrivalled work of rock architecture, a monument that has always excited and astonished travellers.While some...","completion":"The last name of the art historian who stated that the Kailasanath temple is considered an unrivalled work of rock architecture is Brown.

By definition, renewable resources are those that can naturally replenish or regenerate over a period of time despite use. Let's go through each option: 1. Wind and Oil: While wind is a renewable resource as it is naturally replenished, oil is nonrenewable as it takes millions of years to form from organic material under heat and pressure in Earth's crust. 2. Wind and Sunlight: Wind and sunlight are both renewable resources. They are naturally replenished and will not run out under normal consumption. 3. Natural Gas and Oil: Both of these are nonrenewable resources, which are extracted from the earth and cannot be replenished in a short period of time. 4.

Article: A recent study suggests that teens' relationship with parents, friends and teachers may have a lot to do with why they don't get a good night's sleep. David Maume, a sociologist and sleep researcher, analyzed federal health data, which interviewed 974 teenagers when they were 12, and then again at 15. He found that family dynamics have much to do with how well kids sleep. Teens, who had warm relations with their parents and felt like they could talk to them or their parents were supportive of them, tended to sleep better. However, families that were going through a divorce or a remarriage tended to affect teens' sleep. And problems at school also affected teens' sleep. Feeling safe at school and having good relations with teachers tended to promote better sleep. As did good relationships with friends. Kids who took part in sports or other positive social activities or shared similar academic goals with their friends were also more likely to get a good night's sleep. These add up to what makes lots of sense: a general feeling of well-being helps teens sleep. If we're happy and contented, we're much more likely to sleep better than if we're sad and anxious. Now, of course, teens can hardly resist being drawn to their computers and social networking. Maume also found that when parents were strict not only about bedtime, but also about limiting technology, kids slept better. It's a finding that seems obvious, but parents really do matter when it comes to health habits of their teenagers. Clearly, teenagers aren't getting 9 to 10 hours a night, which puts them at risk for all the consequences of lack of sleep, including poor academic performance, colds and stress. Question: According to Maume's analysis, who will probably have a poor night's sleep? - Teens who feel like talking with their parents. - Teens who have friends sharing their dreams. - Teens who feel contented about themselves. - Teens who lack a sense of security at school.

Les données fournies dans ce document visent à donner un aperçu de l'état actuel du secteur du cinéma au Canada, ainsi que de l'aide financière et réglementaire apportée par les différents niveaux de gouvernement. L'industrie cinématographique canadienne occupe une place importante dans l'économie du pays. Elle génère non seulement des revenus substantiels, mais contribue également au rayonnement culturel du Canada à l'échelle internationale. Les films produits et réalisés au Canada sont souvent reconnus pour leur qualité et leur diversité, tant dans les festivals de cinéma du pays qu'à l'étranger. En ce qui concerne les parts de marché, les films canadiens sont souvent en concurrence avec des productions étrangères (principalement américaines) qui disposent de budgets plus importants et bénéficient d'une plus grande visibilité sur le marché. Cependant, les films canadiens parviennent régulièrement à obtenir une part de marché significative, grâce à une combinaison de facteurs tels que la qualité des scénarios, la performance des acteurs et le soutien des institutions gouvernementales. Le soutien gouvernemental pour le cinéma canadien est un élément essentiel de la vitalité de cette industrie. Il se traduit par différentes formes d'aides financières et de mesures incitatives, telles que des subventions, des crédits d'impôt et des programmes de financement destinés aux producteurs, réalisateurs et autres professionnels du secteur. Ces aides sont généralement gérées et distribuées par des organismes publics tels que Téléfilm Canada, la Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC) et le Fonds des médias du Canada (FMC). En plus du soutien financier, le gouvernement canadien met en place des régulations visant à protéger et promouvoir l'industrie cinématographique nationale. Par exemple, des quotas de diffusion de films canadiens sont imposés aux chaînes de télévision et aux plateformes de streaming, afin d'assurer une présence significative du contenu local dans les médias audiovisuels.

How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of unlocking the last story in Sonic Adventure 2, you would need to complete various tasks throughout Hero and Dark storylines. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you progress through the game and unlock the last story. 1. Choose a storyline: Sonic Adventure 2 consists of two primary storylines: Hero and Dark. The Hero story features Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles as the playable characters, whereas the Dark story features Shadow, Dr. Eggman, and Rouge. You can choose to play either of these storylines first, but you'll need to complete both of them eventually to unlock the last story. Completing one storyline will not directly affect the other, so feel free to switch between them as you progress. 2. Complete each stage: As you play through the storylines, you will encounter various stages or levels that will require you to navigate through obstacles, defeat enemies, and solve puzzles. Each character will have their own unique play style and stages that cater to their abilities. For example, Sonic and Shadow stages will focus on high-speed action, while Tails and Dr. Eggman stages will involve mech-based shooting, and Knuckles and Rouge stages will require you to find hidden items. You must complete each stage with a passing grade to move on to the next one. Keep in mind that some stages may require you to achieve specific objectives, such as defeating a boss or uncovering hidden items. 3. Collect A-rank emblems: Throughout the game, you will receive a performance-based ranking and an emblem for each stage you complete. These ranks range from E to A, with A being the highest. Collecting A-rank emblems for all stages in both Hero and Dark storylines will not only improve your overall game score but may also unlock additional content, such as costumes and bonus content. 4. Battle key bosses: At several points in the Hero and Dark storylines, you will need to defeat crucial bosses in order to progress. These boss battles will usually involve facing off against the counterpart from the opposing storyline, such as Sonic vs. Shadow or Tails vs. Dr. Eggman. Be prepared for challenging battles and utilize your character's abilities to defeat these bosses effectively. 5. Complete Hero and Dark storylines: Once you have completed all stages and defeated all bosses within the Hero and Dark storylines, you will unlock each story's individual ending. The ending of the storyline will depict a cutscene that gives context to the overarching plot and sets the stage for the last story. 6. Unlocking the last story: Upon completing both the Hero and Dark storylines, the game will present you with a new option: the Last story. This story combines the events and characters from both storylines into a final showdown that ultimately resolves the game's story. 7. Complete the last story: In the last story, you will play as a mix of characters from both Hero and Dark storylines. The gameplay mechanics will remain the same, but you will need to use your skills and knowledge acquired from playing through the previous stages to tackle the challenges in the last story. Successfully completing the last story means you have conquered the entirety of Sonic Adventure 2 and unlocked every piece of the narrative.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? otherwise good movie","completion":"To determine the sentiment of the sentence \\"otherwise good movie,\\" one must consider the context in which it is being used. On its own, the adjective \\"good\\" gives a positive sentiment. However, the presence of the word \\"otherwise\\" in the sentence can lead to some ambiguity. This word can indicate that there was something in the movie that was not favorable or perhaps a point of criticism. In the context of a longer text or conversation, the sentiment could be swayed in either direction based on the message the speaker or writer wants to communicate. It would also depend on the tone and manner of delivery. In general, the core sentiment (focusing primarily on the adjective \\"good\\") of the sentence leans towards a positive outlook, as it implies that the movie was overall enjoyable or well-made. However, the inclusion of \\"otherwise\\" introduces the possibility that there was a flaw or drawback to the film, which slightly weakens the positivity without negating it completely. To summarize, the sentiment of the sentence \\"otherwise good movie\\" is mostly positive, but there's a slight hint of negativity due to the presence of the word \\"otherwise.\\" However, understanding the full extent of the sentiment would require taking the context and tone of the surrounding discussion or text into account."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this \\"Learn to “hold the reins. Learn to make a “lasso. Learn the pattern.\\"","completion":"Title: Mastering the Art of Horse Riding: Holding the Reins, Crafting a Lasso, and Learning the Pattern Introduction Horse riding has fascinated people for centuries - it is not just a means of transport, but also an engaging recreational activity and an integral part of many equestrian sports. Becoming a proficient horse rider involves mastering various essential skills, such as holding the reins properly, creating a lasso, and understanding intricate riding patterns. In this article, we'll explore these three crucial components and explain how they contribute to building a strong foundation for any aspiring equestrian. Step 1: Holding the Reins One of the first lessons a novice rider must learn is how to properly hold the reins, as it forms the foundation of effective communication and control between the rider and the horse. An incorrect grip can lead to poor communication, tension, and discomfort. Here's how to hold the reins correctly: 1. Hold the reins firmly but with relaxed hands to avoid tension and to maintain a flexible connection. 2. Place your hands in a position that is slightly above and ahead of the horse's withers (the highest point where the neck and back meet). 3. Your thumbs should rest on top of the reins, exerting slight pressure to maintain control. 4. Keep your wrists straight and supple, allowing for smooth movements. 5. Adjust your grip as needed, depending on the horse's level of responsiveness and the desired amount of control. By mastering how to hold the reins, riders can effectively communicate with their horses, achieving great harmony and rapport. Step 2: Crafting a Lasso A lasso, or lariat, is a valuable tool for horse riders, especially in activities like team penning, calf roping, and other cattle work. Skillfully using a lasso demonstrates a rider's expertise and precision. Here is a brief guide on making a lasso: 1. Select a suitable rope material, such as nylon or polypropylene, which offers durability, weight, and smoothness. 2. Cut the rope to the desired length (usually 30 to 40 feet for cattle work). 3. Create a fixed eye loop at one end of the rope by tying a reliable knot, like the bowline or Honda knot. 4. Attach a metal swivel snap to the fixed eye loop to allow for smoother roping action. 5. Coil the remaining length of the rope neatly for easy handling and storage. Crafting and mastering the use of the lasso takes practice, but it is a valuable skill that will enhance a rider's expertise in various equestrian activities. Step 3: Learning the Pattern In horse riding, \\"the pattern\\" often refers to a sequence of specific movements and gaits executed by the horse and rider. Routines may vary depending on the discipline, such as dressage, reining, or barrel racing. Learning the pattern entails understanding the rhythm and flow of each movement. Here are some tips: 1. Begin by observing experienced riders and their horses performing the pattern. 2. Break down the pattern into smaller, manageable sections for easier learning and practice. 3. Memorize the sequence and visualize performing it flawlessly. 4. Practice each section individually, gradually linking them together until you can execute the entire pattern smoothly. 5. Continuously refine your skills and focus on establishing harmony with your horse. Learning the pattern fosters an intuitive connection between rider and horse, enhancing the rhythm and precision of their performance. Conclusion Mastering the art of horse riding takes dedication, patience, and practice. By effectively holding the reins, crafting a lasso, and learning the pattern, novice riders can build a solid foundation for their equestrian journey. These essential skills will aid them in embracing various disciplines and deriving immense joy from the incredible bond formed between horse and rider."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You can write it as: (21 - 47) * a now, 21 - 47 = -26, so it becomes: -26 * a Now, the equation looks like this: -4 * a - 44 = -26 * a Now, we want to move the \\"-4 * a\\" from the left side to the right side to have all the 'a' terms together. To do this, we can add 4 * a to both sides: (-4 * a - 44) + 4 * a = -26 * a + 4 * a -44 = -22 * a (because -26 * a + 4 * a = (-26 + 4) * a = -22 * a) Now we have to find the value of 'a'. We have: -44 = -22 * a To find 'a', we can divide both sides by -22: a = -44 / -22 Now, -44 divided by -22 equals 2: a = 2 So the solution to the math problem is a = 2."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -1970 = -85*x - 2310 for x.","completion":"Alright, let's solve the equation step by step, like a puzzle. The equation is: -1970 = -85*x - 2310 First, we need to move the 2310 to the other side of the equation. That means we'll add 2310 to both sides: -1970 + 2310 = -85*x - 2310 + 2310 This simplifies to: 340 = -85*x Now, to find the value of \\"x,\\" we need to get it alone on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides by -85: 340 / -85 = (-85*x) / -85 This simplifies to: -4 = x So the answer to the equation is x = -4. That means if we replace \\"x\\" in the original equation with -4, both sides of the equation will be equal. Great job!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

With the global economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and fluctuating oil prices, Pemex has experienced significant financial distress that requires urgent intervention. Background of Pemex's Financial Struggles As one of Mexico's largest companies and revenue sources, Pemex is a vital economic linchpin for the nation. However, the company's finances have been on shaky ground even before the pandemic took its toll on the oil industry. Aging infrastructure, declining production, and rising debt levels were already putting immense pressure on Pemex, and the collapse of oil prices in 2020 has only aggravated the situation. In recent years, Pemex has struggled under the weight of its enormous debt, which now stands at approximately 107 billion, making it one of the world's most-indebted state oil companies. As global demand for oil dropped dramatically due to the pandemic, crude prices plummeted, leading to a collapse in Pemex's revenue. Attempts to stabilize prices via an agreement between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies have softened the impact but have not averted the crisis entirely. Pemex's Spending Cuts Plan To combat its financial woes, Pemex has unveiled a comprehensive cost-cutting plan with both short- and long-term measures designed to strengthen its financial position. These measures include: 1. Capital Expenditure Reduction: Pemex is cutting back on investments in new projects, exploration activities, and infrastructure maintenance, with a planned reduction of about 1.4 billion in capital expenditures. While necessary to protect cash flow, these cuts may adversely impact future oil production and revenue generation. 2. Operational Expenditure Reduction: The company has announced a 1.2 billion reduction in operational expenses. This includes streamlining operations, reducing third-party contracts, and trimming administrative costs. Pemex is likely to implement employee furloughs and layoffs as part of these cost-saving measures. 3. Delaying Debt Payments: Pemex is also looking to postpone debt payments and seeking extensions or renegotiations of existing loans to ease short-term pressure on its balance sheet. In an effort to avoid default, the Mexican government has offered guarantees for some of Pemex's new financing deals, providing investors extra security. 4. Government Support: As part of a wider economic stimulus package, the Mexican government has earmarked 6.1 billion in support for Pemex. This financial aid will assist the company in fulfilling its debt and pension obligations, maintaining core operations, and funding necessary upgrades to aging infrastructure. Long-term Ramifications and Challenges While Pemex's spending cuts and financial restructuring plan offer a pathway toward short-term financial stability and potentially mitigating potentially catastrophic consequences, several long-term challenges remain. Cuts to capital expenditures, in particular, may hinder future oil production levels, which could lead to reduced revenue in the long term. Additionally, Pemex must identify new sources of capital to fund critical projects, just as private investment in the sector is becoming increasingly scarce. Furthermore, Pemex must strike a delicate balance between streamlining its workforce and maintaining its social function as a major employer in Mexico. Any job losses from cost-cutting measures must be carefully managed to avoid causing severe social and economic upheaval. In conclusion, Petroleos Mexicanos' aggressive spending cuts are necessary measures in the face of current financial challenges. However, to guarantee the company's future resilience and success, Pemex must take a long-term strategic approach that includes modernization, diversification, and improved management practices. The road to financial recovery may be long and fraught, but these measures could ultimately save one of Mexico's most crucial assets."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: This article: Descriptions of Imogen as a small child indicate that she had blue eyes, fair hair, an oval face reminiscent of her father's, and a rather prominent nose inherited from her mother. In 1912, at the age of five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Summers were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.In 1917 Imogen began boarding at Eothen, a small, private school for girls in Caterham, where Jane Joseph, Gustav's star pupil from SPGS, taught music. A letter home, dated 17 July 1917, tells of \\"compertishions [sic], and ripping prizes, and strawberries and cream for tea\\". At the school, Imogen studied piano with Eleanor Shuttleworth, violin with André Mangeot (described as \\"topping\\") and theory with Jane Joseph (\\"ripping\\"). Under Joseph's tuition Imogen produced her first compositions—two instrumental pieces and four Christmas carol tunes—which she numbered as Ops. 1, 2, and 3. In the summer term of 1920, she composed and choreographed a \\"Dance of the Nymphs and Shepherds\\", which was performed at the school under her direction on 9 July.Imogen left Eothen in December 1920 hoping to study under Ruby Ginner at the Ginner-Mawer School of Dance and Drama, but was rejected on health grounds, although there appeared to be no significant medical issue. She then studied at home under a governess, while waiting to start at St Paul's Girls School in the autumn. At Whitsun 1921 she took part as a dancer in her father's production of Purcell's semi-opera from 1690, Masque of Dioclesian, held in the St Paul's School grounds and repeated a week later in Hyde Park.In September 1921 Imogen began at St Paul's Girls School, and became a boarder from Spring 1922.

This article: The Vijayanagara Empire (also called Karnata Empire, and the Kingdom of Bisnegar by the Portuguese) was based in the Deccan Plateau region in South India. It was established in 1336 by Harihara I and his brother Bukka Raya I of Sangama Dynasty. The empire rose to prominence as a culmination of attempts by the southern powers to ward off Islamic invasions by the end of the 13th century. It lasted until 1646, although its power declined after a major military defeat in the Battle of Talikota in 1565 by the combined armies of the Deccan sultanates. The empire is named after its capital city of Vijayanagara, whose ruins surround present day Hampi, now a World Heritage Site in Karnataka, India. The writings of medieval European travelers such as Domingo Paes, Fernão Nunes, and Niccolò Da Conti, and the literature in local languages provide crucial information about its history. Archaeological excavations at Vijayanagara have revealed the empire's power and wealth. The empire's legacy includes many monuments spread over South India, the best known of which is the group at Hampi. Different temple building traditions in South and Central India came together in the Vijayanagara Architecture style. This synthesis inspired architectural innovation in Hindu temples' construction. Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies such as water management systems for irrigation. The empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, and Sanskrit, while Carnatic music evolved into its current form. The Vijayanagara Empire created an epoch in South Indian history that transcended regionalism by promoting Hinduism as a unifying factor. contains an answer for the question: What had its power decline after a major military defeat in 1565?, what is it ? Answer:","completion":"The Vijayanagara Empire had its power decline after a major military defeat in 1565. This defeat took place in the Battle of Talikota, where the combined armies of the Deccan sultanates overpowered the Vijayanagara forces. This marked a turning point for the empire, which eventually disintegrated and came to an end in 1646. The decline in power after the Battle of Talikota severely weakened the empire's stability and influence, allowing for the eventual conquest by neighboring forces and the fragmentation of its territories."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: when did superman first appear in a comic book?","completion":"Superman, one of the most iconic and enduring characters in the world of comic books, first appeared in \\"Action Comics #1,\\" which was published by Detective Comics, Inc. (later known as DC Comics) on April 18, 1938. The character was created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster, who originally developed the concept in 1933. Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, both high school friends from Cleveland, Ohio, initially worked together on a short-lived, self-published, fanzine titled \\"Science Fiction: The Advance Guard of Future Civilization\\" in 1932. Their early collaboration led to the development of a character named \\"The Superman,\\" a bald, telepathic villain with aspirations of world domination. This prototype was quite different from the character that we know and love today. In 1934, Siegel revised the concept and transformed \\"The Superman\\" into a hero with superhuman abilities, including incredible strength, speed, and the ability to leap long distances. Shuster designed the iconic costume, featuring a cape and a stylized \\"S\\" on the chest, that would later become one of the most recognizable symbols in pop culture history. After several unsuccessful attempts to get their character published, Siegel and Shuster finally sold the rights to Superman to Detective Comics, Inc. in 1938 for 130. The character's first appearance in \\"Action Comics #1\\" marked the beginning of the superhero genre that would dominate the world of comic books for decades to come. The story, titled \\"Superman: Champion of the Oppressed,\\" introduced readers to the character's origin as an alien from the planet Krypton who was sent to Earth by his father, Jor-El. Adopted by the human Kent family and raised as Clark Kent in the small town of Smallville, the character would eventually move to the bustling Metropolis city and work as a reporter for the Daily Planet newspaper. Alongside his human love interest, Lois Lane, and his alter ego, Superman, the character would go on to fight for truth, justice, and the American way. Over the years, Superman's character and storylines have evolved, encompassing various iterations, retellings, and adaptations across comic books, radio shows, television series, movies, and other forms of media. Superman's enduring appeal has cemented his status as the quintessential superhero and an important figure in modern mythology. In conclusion, Superman first appeared in \\"Action Comics #1,\\" published on April 18, 1938, and created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. The character's introduction in this groundbreaking publication laid the foundation for superheroes' impact and influence on the comic book industry and popular culture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Current Situation : Currently the heating effect of extra greenhouse gases (since the start of the industrial revolution) is equal to about . Thus the recent period has recorded parallel increases in concentration of carbon dioxide and average global temperature. As more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere the temperature will increase further. There are certain effects of a warmer Earth (discussed more in optional section), which could accelerate the process, even if no more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere (an unlikely prospect for the foreseeable future).

In his research he decides to read the environmental proposals of each candidate. Mark Hampton, one candidate, has a proposal that he says will strongly boost the city's economy by opening more industrial factories, but these will increase the carbon dioxide put into the atmosphere. Jeffrey Lindell, the other candidate, says that he wants to begin implementing solar panel farms to generate electricity to cut down on the carbon emissions the city produces.

Step 2: Analyze the semantics and pragmatics of the sentence The sentence tells us that Emily asked Anna to stir the pot. The second clause provides a reason: because \\"she\\" forgot to do it.

Translate to English English:","completion":"It is evident that there is at least one very significant reason: preparing for the arrival of a global government. A second reason is, once again, to instill a sense of guilt in the European and Western individual, who are mistakenly considered responsible for all the world's ills. The clear observation of these two reasons highlights the presence of underlying motives and agendas in the world today. The idea of a global government represents a shift towards a more centralized and powerful authority that could potentially impact individual freedoms and the sovereignty of nations. By advocating for such a system, it would change the dynamic of international cooperation and reshape the political landscape. On the other hand, cultivating guilt in the European and Western population leads to the assignment of collective blame for the problems that exist around the world. Whether it is historical injustices, current conflicts, or environmental issues, this mindset fosters a sense of responsibility that may not be entirely warranted. In turn, this creates an environment where people feel compelled to act or make concessions out of guilt, often in ways that may not be in their best interest. The consequences of these two reasons can be significant on various levels, including socioeconomic, political, and human rights aspects. The shaping of a centralized global government could lead to a decrease in the decision-making power of individual nations, potentially affecting the autonomy of these countries and their ability to address the concerns of their citizens. Additionally, the susceptibility of individuals to feelings of guilt can drive them to take decisions or adopt positions that may prove detrimental to their own well-being or the well-being of their communities. In summary, the preparation for a global government and the cultivation of guilt in the European and Western individual are two important reasons that warrant attention. The implications of these motives are substantial, involving potential challenges to national sovereignty, individual freedoms, and the overall state of international cooperation. Recognizing these underlying reasons and being aware of their consequences is essential for understanding the complexities of the world we live in today and navigating the challenges that lie ahead."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the below context: Deena Marten is a 15-year-old who has become a rebel since dating Garret Lexau, another rebellious teen who was suspended from school for hitting a teacher. Deena no longer keeps any of her promises, skips school and leaves the family home whenever she pleases. Her newfound harsh attitude upsets her mother, Cynthia, who once enjoyed a close relationship with her daughter. Cynthia is frustrated because the lines of communication have broken down between mother and daughter. Cynthia's relationship with her own mother is not entirely pleasant. Although Cynthia's alcoholic mother advises her daughter to be stricter with Deena, Cynthia does not heed the advice. For example, she tidies Deena's bedroom, a chore which Cynthia has consistently and politely reminded her daughter to do. When Deena discovers what Cynthia has done, she is less than grateful and reacts violently and ends up pushing her mother. Adam, Deena's younger brother notices the impact that Deena's behavior has upon his mother and drinks alcohol in order to forget about the family problems. At one point, Cynthia and Deena's relationship seems to improve, until Cynthia finds out that she has been skipping school. Her confrontation leads to an argument, during which Deena slaps her. Although she admits to Garret that she liked hitting her, Deena later apologizes to her mother, only to ask her to cover for her absence at school. Guess a valid title for it!

Accused spy Anna Chapman wasn't the only suspected Russian agent on Facebook. A tipster with access to co-defendant Mikhail Semenko's Facebook photos sent us some of his pictures. Want to see an alleged spy in a Bill Clinton costume? Ten people were arrested by the U.S. government on Monday and accused of spying for Russia. One of the indicted, Anna Chapman, had pictures from various social networking sites posted all over the internet today (you can see those photos at the bottom of this post). Unsurprisingly, another one of the ten defendants had a significant social networking presence: Mikhail Semenko, an Arlington, Va. travel agent. Semenko, whose LinkedIn profile has already been the subject of media speculation, worked at a travel agency called Travel All Russia, where he had a reputation for being \\"'clumsy' and 'quirky,' but highly intelligent.\\" Our tipster, who knew him slightly, says he \\"was pretty much just super socially awkward... He always said weird jokes that no one really got. Probably super smart though.\\" So, not exactly James Bond. He and his fellow defendants are facing charges of \\"conspiracy to act as agents of a foreign government while concealing that from the U.S. government\\"—not espionage or high treason. In fact, they may not have done much spying at all. To be sure, this wasn't necessarily their M.O.; Russia may have just been hoping for vague and limited access to policymaking circles, with no specific information-gathering objectives. But mostly, Semenko and others seem to have blended in so well as ordinary Americans that, like ordinary Americans, they didn't have a lot of access to state secrets. Semenko's Facebook photos don't really contradict that. The Seton Hall graduate looks like most goofy 20-somethings, messing around with friends at parties. How many Russian master spies do you think have been photographed wearing \\"U.S.S.R.\\" t-shirts or Bill Clinton masks? Then again, how many 20-somethings are accused of being spies? Anna Chapman Photos ||||| Are you one of alleged Russian sleeper spy Anna Chapman's 181 Facebook friends? Do you subscribe to her Twitter feed? She's @nycrentalsnews. What about one of her 150 connections on LinkedIn? Were you one of the five people who recommended her on LinkedIn? According to documents seized by the FBI , Chapman's key tasking was to \\"search and develop ties in policy making circles in the U.S.\\" and then send intelligence reports back to Moscow Center. In today's world, connections are made online. Chapman's Twitter feed offers a glimpse into how her own recruitment might work. As a real estate agent, she could gain intimate knowledge of her clients. She'd know their residences inside and out, and even be in a position to recommend where a technical agent might place a listening device. Her LinkedIn resume suggests she was a prodigious networker, attaching herself to groups like the Online Marketing Association, the eMarketing Association Network and others. On Facebook, one of Chapman's friends posted a news alert about her arrest and asked, in Russian, whether the Anna Chapman he knew was the same person who was caught in the dragnet. There was no reply. How many connections away were they from folks like me and you? Were the alleged spies directly connected on Twitter/Facebook/LinkedIn? (Not that I could tell.) Folks in the intelligence community want to forbid their people from using social media, believing it to be a counterintelligence risk of the first order. There is almost no training in how to use social media to figure out who the bad guys (or gals) might be. When journalists communicate with tipsters on Twitter, through direct messages, who's watching? This is a digital version of the following question: when an old college friend who now works for a foreign embassy invites you for drinks and gently probes you for information about the mood inside the West Wing, are you complicit? The technology the alleged spies used to communicate -- steganography, WiFi brush passes, and old, regular, high-frequency Morse code -- is quite antiquated and exploitable, provided the FBI knew where to look. You can find WiFi networks with your own cell phone, and the NSA and CIA have long used devices that can suck up data from both unencrypted and encrypted networks. And they were looking since at least 2005, probably exploiting the spies and (perhaps) passing disinformation back to Moscow through them. Want to try your own brush pass? Download the \\" bump \\" application from iTunes. It's ingeniously easy to figure out ways to wirelessly pass information from one person to another within a range of about 400 feet. Spies these days prefer disk drives whose contents they can delete with a press of a button; they keep the drives on their persons at all times, so that if they're ever taken into custody, they can, with a swipe of their hand, erase much of the evidence against them. The U.S. is experimenting with Ultra Wide Band (UWB) frequencies for its communications; these frequencies are very hard to exploit because the radio information is distributed across the spectrum. The fact that the FBI was able to run the spy-hunting operation for seven years suggests that American counterintelligence efforts have improved dramatically since the days of Aldrich Ames, Robert Hanssen, and Harold Nicholson. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Ten people were arrested in the U.S. on charges of spying for Russia, including Anna Chapman and Mikhail Semenko, both of whom had significant social media presence.

The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W.

Soon Julian meets Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) in Mexico City, man who's got bad luck: his son died in accident, his job isn't going that well and he's not sure that he can keep his wife Bean (Hope Davis).

I also like Greg 'typical American face' Kinnear in the role of loser that is very lively made because there are plenty of people like Danny Wright.

Please answer the following question: But what is teacher quality? How can one measure it reliably? An analysis is issued on a sample of data from a Texas school district. Experts argue convincingly that teacher effectiveness should be measured by students' gains on standardized tests: Mr. Smith is probably a better teacher than Ms. Brown if his students consistently improve their test scores more than hers do. Though this approach is appealing, there are tricky issues. For example, what if Ms. Brown teaches in a school where students score so high there is little room for improvement? The authors try to correct for this problem, as well as other sorts of measurement issues, to generate a measurement of teacher effectiveness. The paper is primarily concerned with how this measure is related to other observable characteristics. The first finding is that there is a large variation in teacher effectiveness: some teachers consistently have a larger impact on their students' achievement than others. Second, easily observable characteristics like having a master's degree or a passing score on the teacher certification exam are not correlated with teacher effectiveness. Then what does matter? The most important single influence is experience: first-year teachers are much less effective than others. The second year is significantly better, and by the fourth year, _ . It is not entirely clear whether this experience effect is learning by doing (the more you teach, the more effective you become) or survival of the fittest (those who are not good at teaching tend to drop out early.) From my reading of the paper, both effects appear important and there is no simple answer. The data do suggest, however, that teacher effectiveness is pretty clear by the end of the second year, so the information to make an informed decision is available at that time. The authors also investigate the contentious issue of racial matching of students and teachers. Here they find strong evidence that minority teachers tend to be more effective with minority students.

Given the question: Process: - Items that can be reused are placed into recycling containers - Recycling trucks pick up the items that are able to be reused - The recyclable items travel to a recycling plant - The items are sorted by what they are made of - The items are broken down into small parts - The small parts are melted to make new raw parts - The raw parts are sold to manufactures to make new items. Question: suppose energy cost increase and the plant has to lower its capacity to save money happens, how will it affect LESS recyling. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","completion":"More Effect When energy costs increase and a recycling plant has to lower its capacity to save money, the recycling process is likely to be affected significantly as a result. This can lead to less recycling, as the plant may have to reduce the number of items it can process, requiring more focused prioritization based on the most valuable and easily recycled materials. If the recycling plant cannot maintain its previous output, it will lead to several consequences that contribute to less recycling: 1. Collection process: With the reduced capacity of the recycling plant, recycling trucks may have to pick up fewer items to prevent overloading the plant. This can result in longer intervals between collections, causing some recyclable items to be discarded in regular trash due to lack of storage space or frustration from households and businesses. 2. Sorting and processing: As the recycling plant deals with less capacity, it might need to streamline its sorting process to focus on the most common or valuable materials to maximize efficiency. This means that some items, especially those made of mixed or less valuable materials, might not get recycled at all, further reducing the amount of materials that can be reused. 3. Raw material production: With a decrease in the processing capacity of the recycling plant, the output of raw materials produced from recycled items will also decrease. This in turn will lead to an increased demand for raw materials derived from non-recycled sources, such as mining or logging. Unfortunately, this can result in further environmental damage and resource depletion. 4. Market effects: Manufacturers that rely on raw materials from recycling plants will face a reduced supply, potentially increasing the costs of production. This can lead to higher prices for recycled products, making them less attractive to both consumers and businesses. Consequently, this may result in a decrease in demand for recycled goods, further discouraging recycling and potentially causing a vicious cycle of less recycling and higher non-recycled material use. 5. Financial strain on recycling plants: As recycling plants strive to save money due to increasing energy costs, they might have to cut back on staff, maintenance, or equipment upgrades, impacting the efficiency and effectiveness of the recycling process. This could lead to a further reduction in recycling rates, as other recycling facilities might face the same challenges and also reduce their capacity. In conclusion, when energy costs increase and a recycling plant has to lower its capacity to save money, it could significantly affect the amount of recycling, creating a more significant effect on the entire recycling process and its desired outcomes. This can lead to a potential increase in waste accumulation, environmental damage, and a shift away from recycling as a viable solution to waste management."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams has been arrested by the PSNI as part of their investigation into the circumstances of the abduction and murder of Jean McConville in 1972. Last month, Mr Adams said he had asked his solicitor to contact the PSNI on the matter and said he was available to speak to them if they wished to speak with him. Mr Adams denies any involvement in the murder of the Belfast mother-of-ten. Speaking tonight, he said he had no role whatsoever in what was one of the most controversial murders of the Troubles. In a statement, Mr Adams said while he had concerns about timing, he is \\"voluntarily meeting with the PSNI this evening\\". He said that \\"well publicised, malicious allegations have been made against me. I reject these. \\"While I have never disassociated myself from the IRA and I never will, I am innocent of any part in the abduction, killing or burial of Mrs McConville\\". Mr Adams also said he has never shirked his responsibility as a republican leader, including dealing with the \\"difficult issue of victims and their families\\". He added: \\"Even though they may not agree, this includes the family of Jean McConville\\". The PSNI tweeted earlier tonight that a 65-year-old man had been arrested in connection with Mrs McConville's murder. A 65 year old man has been arrested this evening in connection with the abduction and murder of Jean McConville in December 1972. — PSNI (@PoliceServiceNI) April 30, 2014 Sinn Féin Deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald said Mr Adams was right to confront the issue and said there has been a concerted and malicious effort to link him to the case for some considerable time. She also questioned the timing of \\"this latest decision by the PSNI\\" and said she believed it was “politically motivated and designed to damage Gerry Adams and Sinn Féin.\\" Mrs McConville was abducted by an IRA gang after being accused of passing information to the British army and later shot in the back of the head and buried 80km from her home. The IRA did not admit her murder until 1999. Mrs McConville’s remains were found on Shelling Hill, beach, Co Louth in 2003. Nobody has ever been charged with her murder. ||||| A woman in her late 50s has been arrested in connection with one of the most notorious murders of the Northern Ireland Troubles – the abduction, killing and secret burial of the west Belfast widow Jean McConville. The 57-year-old woman was detained by police officers in the west of the city on Wednesday morning and taken to Antrim police station for questioning. She has since been released pending a police report being sent to prosecutors. McConville was the most famous of the \\"disappeared\\", up to 16 victims of the IRA who were murdered and then buried secretly across Ireland in the 1970s and 80s. Last month a former IRA negotiator with the British government, Ivor Bell, was charged with aiding and abetting in the murder of the 37-year-old mother of 10. Bell, who is out on bail, denies any involvement. McConville, a Protestant-born widow, was dragged out of her flat in front of her children by armed IRA members in the Divis area shortly before Christmas in 1972. The IRA only admitted they had killed her in 1999 after a high-profile campaign by families of the \\"disappeared\\". The IRA alleged that she was an informer but an investigation by the former police ombudsman Dame Nuala O'Loan concluded the widow was not working for the security forces as an agent. Her murder has cast a long shadow over the peace process and the political settlement in Northern Ireland. The former IRA hunger striker and one-time commander of the Provisionals in Belfast Brendan Hughes alleged that the Sinn Féin president, Gerry Adams, gave the order that McConville be buried in secret and that the future leader of the republican movement came up with the idea of creating a covert IRA unit that would \\"disappear\\" suspected informants. Adams has always denied any role in the murder and has protested that he was never in the IRA. Hughes, a former friend of the Sinn Féin chief who died in 2008, made his allegation on a tape recording for the Belfast Project, an archive of testimonies from ex-IRA and loyalist paramilitaries who would speak frankly about their involvement in violent acts during the Troubles. The case against Bell is allegedly centred on another tape recording for the archive, which was meant to become a groundbreaking historical project for Boston College in the United States. However, the Police Service of Northern Ireland pursued the tapes through the courts in the US and have acquired some of the material which allegedly relates to the McConville murder. ||||| A tape recording of a deceased Belfast IRA commander in which Gerry Adams is accused of ordering the murder and secret burial of a widowed mother of 10 in 1972 will be broadcast for the first time this week. A former IRA hunger striker, Brendan Hughes, alleges the Sinn Féin president was one of the heads of a unit that kidnapped, killed and buried west Belfast woman Jean McConville. Hughes, who died in 2008, is recorded as saying: \\"There was only one man who gave that order for that woman to be executed – and that man is now the head of Sinn Féin.\\" Hughes also says that Adams went to the McConville children after their mother was abducted and promised an internal IRA investigation. \\"That man is the man who gave the order for that woman to be executed. I did not give the order to execute that woman. He did.\\" Adams is challenged on the BBC's Storyville programme over whether he was a senior Provisionals commander in Belfast at the time McConville was abducted, just before Christmas 1972. \\"That's not true,\\" Adams replies, adding that he has not \\"shirked\\" his own responsibilities in the conflict. The Sinn Féin leader has always insisted that he was never in the IRA. In response to the tape, Adams, who is the Sinn Féin member for Louth in the Irish parliament, accuses his former friend of lying. \\"Brendan is telling lies,\\" Adams tells the programme. He adds: \\"I had no act or part to play in the abduction, killing or burial of Jean McConville or any of the others.\\" An expert forensic detective tells the joint BBC Northern Ireland-RTE production that the IRA sometimes weighed bodies down with heavy stones to ensure that the corpses would not surface if the bogs they were buried in ever dried up. Storyville reveals that the first of the \\"disappeared\\" to be found back in 1999, north Belfast man Eamon Molloy, had received the last rites from a Catholic priest. The priest saw Molloy tied naked to a bed and asked his captors if any of them had rosary beads that their prisoner could hold when he was to be shot. Security sources in the Republic told the Observer last week that up to four additional men who were \\"disappeared\\" by the IRA have not yet been identified by the organisation set up to find the Troubles' missing victims. The Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains (ICLVR) has so far found eight of the \\"disappeared\\", including McConville, but seven on their official list are still unaccounted for. A spokesman for the ICLVR, Geoff Knupfer, said: \\"At this moment there is no information to suggest there is any addition to the list.\\" However, security sources insist that at least four IRA victims were buried in secret. The film is to be broadcast on BBC Northern Ireland and RTE on Monday and BBC4 on Tuesday. It includes a reading of the late Seamus Heaney's poem The Bog Queen, which the Nobel laureate agreed could be used in the programme to remember the plight of the \\"disappeared\\". • This article was amended on 3 November 2013 to correct broadcast dates for the Storyville programme |||||","completion":"Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams was arrested in connection with the abduction and murder of Jean McConville in 1972.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. They are addressing two completely different topics - one is related to the Python programming language, specifically mathematical operations, and the other question is about the hiring practices of startup companies. Let's break down each question and provide detailed information on both topics. Question 1: To calculate 2+3 in Python, we don't need to import math. Why in case of square root? In Python, basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be performed directly with the built-in operators. In the case of calculating the sum of 2 + 3, it's as simple as using the \\"+\\" operator, like this: result = 2 + 3 However, when you want to calculate the square root of a number, it requires a different approach. Python does not provide a built-in operator specifically for finding the square root. That's why you need to use a math library function like sqrt(), which is available in the math module to perform this calculation. The math module provides a range of mathematical functions, including trigonometric, logarithmic, and other useful functions that go beyond the basic arithmetic operations. To use sqrt() from the math module, you'll need to import the module and then call the function like this: import math number = 9 square_root = math.sqrt(number) In this example, you first import the Python 'math' module, then you call its sqrt() function by passing the number whose square root you want to calculate. The result is stored in the variable 'square_root.' Question 2: Startup companies hire freshers? Startup companies are newly established businesses that are usually in the early stages of their development. They often hire freshers, which are recent graduates or entry-level professionals, for a variety of reasons: 1. Cost-effective: Hiring freshers can be more cost-effective compared to experienced professionals, as they usually demand lower salaries. Startups often have limited financial resources, and hiring freshers can help them manage their budget effectively. 2. Enthusiasm and energy: Freshers typically bring enthusiasm, energy, and a willingness to learn and adapt to new environments. Startups need employees who can contribute positively to the growth and development of the company. 3. Adaptability: Since freshers do not have prior experience in a specific domain or industry, they are more likely to be open to learning new things and adapting to the startup's culture and work environment. This adaptability can be valuable in the rapidly changing marketplace. 4. Growth opportunities: Startups offer excellent growth opportunities for freshers, including hands-on experience, the chance to work on a wide variety of projects, and the opportunity to quickly take up significant responsibilities. This can be an attractive proposition for fresh graduates looking to fast-track their careers. 5. Updated knowledge: Freshers often come straight from an educational institution and have the most recent knowledge in their field. They can bring new insights, ideas, and up-to-date technical skills to a startup company. In conclusion, these two questions address different topics: one discusses specific functions in the Python programming language, while the other focuses on the hiring practices of startup companies. Each question demands separate and detailed information to provide a thorough understanding."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Chrismansyah Rahadi ([xrisˈmanʃah raˈhadi]; 16 September 1949 – 30 March 2007), born Christian Rahadi but better known by his stage name of Chrisye ([xəˈriʃə]), was an Indonesian progressive pop singer and songwriter. In his 40-year career he won many awards and accolades; in 2011 Rolling Stone Indonesia declared him the third-greatest Indonesian musician of all time. Born in Jakarta of mixed Chinese-Indonesian descent, Chrisye became interested in music at an early age. At high school he played bass guitar in a band he formed with his brother, Joris. In the late 1960s he joined Sabda Nada (later Gipsy), a band led by his neighbours, the Nasutions. In 1973, after a short hiatus, he rejoined the band to play in New York for a year. He briefly returned to Indonesia and then went back to New York with another band, the Pro's. After once again returning to Indonesia, he collaborated with Gipsy and Guruh Sukarnoputra to record the 1976 indie album Guruh Gipsy. Following the success of Guruh Gipsy, in 1977 Chrisye recorded two of his most critically acclaimed works: \\"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\\" by James F. Sundah, which eventually became his signature song, and the soundtrack album Badai Pasti Berlalu. Their success landed him a recording contract with Musica Studios, with whom he released his first solo album, Sabda Alam, in 1978. Over his almost 25-year career with Musica he recorded a further eighteen albums, and in 1980 acted in a film, Seindah Rembulan. Chrisye died in his Jakarta home on 30 March 2007 after a long battle with lung cancer. Known for his stiff stage persona and smooth vocals, Chrisye was critically acclaimed in Indonesia. Five albums to which he contributed were included in Rolling Stone Indonesia's list of the 150 Best Indonesian Albums of All Time; another four of his songs (and a fifth to which he contributed) were classified as some of the best Indonesian songs of all time in a later issue of the same magazine.

It incorporates the latest advancements in fabric technology, ensuring that athletes can perform their best while staying comfortable throughout the game. This new range of clothing is designed to cater to the specific requirements of basketball players, ensuring that they can move freely on the court and maintain the desired level of flexibility. Firstly, the material of the new basketball clothing is more lightweight, which makes it easier for the players to remain agile during the game. The reduction in weight helps in enhancing their overall performance by allowing them to conserve energy and reduce fatigue. The special fabric used in these clothes also promotes better air circulation, thereby increasing breathability. This allows the players to stay cool and dry on the court, reducing the chances of overheating and exhaustion. Moreover, the new clothing is designed with enhanced moisture-wicking properties that help in keeping the players dry even during high-intensity games. The materials used in the clothing can effectively absorb and disperse sweat, ensuring that the players remain comfortable at all times. This not only enhances the performance of the players by reducing distractions caused by excessive sweating but also reduces the risk of skin irritation and rashes. Another major benefit of the new basketball clothing is that it offers better freedom of movement. The design incorporates special cuts and seams that enable the players to move naturally without any restrictions. This is particularly important in basketball, where dynamic and fast-paced movements are essential for achieving success on the court. Additionally, the clothing is designed to provide a snug fit, ensuring that it does not feel too tight or too loose and cause any discomfort to the players. Furthermore, the new basketball clothing is highly durable and resistant to wear and tear. The fabrics used in the manufacturing process have been extensively tested and proven to withstand the harsh conditions that typically prevail during basketball games. As a result, the players can be confident that their clothes will maintain their appearance and functionality over a longer period, thereby representing a good return on investment for the teams and their sponsors. Incorporating modern design elements, the new basketball clothing is also visually appealing, which can help boost team morale and create a sense of pride and unity among the players. The use of vibrant colors and attractive patterns can make the players feel more confident in their appearance, which can translate into better performance on the court. Additionally, the customized logos and team names incorporated into the clothing can enhance the overall branding and identity of the teams, making them easily recognizable by fans and opponents alike. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the advancements made in the manufacturing techniques of the new basketball clothing also contribute to its eco-friendliness. The use of sustainable and recyclable materials, along with energy-efficient processes, ensures that the clothing has a minimal impact on the environment, catering to the growing global concern for the environment and sustainability. In conclusion, the new clothing that we received for basketball is a significant improvement over the previous equipment, offering a multitude of benefits to the players, teams, and sponsors. Its lightweight and breathable nature, combined with advanced moisture-wicking properties, enhanced freedom of movement, durability, stylish design, and eco-friendly manufacturing processes make it the ideal choice for basketball players looking to elevate their game to the next level."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the question...the keiretsu tradition in japan serves as a??","completion":"The Keiretsu tradition in Japan serves as a significant organizational structure and a unique approach to managing business relations within the Japanese economy. Keiretsu refers to a network of closely related, interdependent companies that have strong, long-term ties with each other. The various businesses within this network hold minority shares in each other's companies, and they pursue mutual cooperation by engaging in joint ventures, sharing technology, and aligning their operations to create synergies. This results in an integrated and resilient system that fosters stability, loyalty, and mutual support. As a unique business model, the Keiretsu tradition serves several essential purposes in Japan: 1. Economic Stability: Keiretsu structure emphasizes long-term relationships and commitments, leading to a more stable economic environment. The businesses within a Keiretsu tend to collaborate instead of competing, making it possible for them to pool their resources, create economies of scale, and reduce the risk of market disruptions and hostile takeovers. 2. Risk Diversification: The horizontal nature of Keiretsu allows the companies to spread their risks across various industries and sectors, which may result in higher financial resiliency. This diversification enables companies to withstand economic downturns and mitigate losses if a particular industry or company underperforms. 3. Expansion of Resources and Capabilities: The tight-knit network among Keiretsu companies enables them to share information, technology, and resources with ease. This cooperative approach can lead to accelerated innovation and the development of new products and services, thereby providing a competitive advantage to the companies within the Keiretsu. 4. Access to Capital: The interlocking of share ownership allows Keiretsu companies to source capital from their business partners. This provides an alternative to traditional bank loans, reduces the pressure for short-term financial performance, and allows businesses to focus on long-term growth and development. 5. Talent Development and Retention: Keiretsu tradition fosters strong relationships not only between the companies but also among employees, who benefit from extensive training and development programs. The stability of career paths within Keiretsu companies may result in higher retention rates, lower turnover, and a stronger workforce. 6. Flexibility and Adaptability: Although Keiretsu may appear rigid in nature, this business model allows participating companies to adapt quickly to market changes and develop new strategies. They can do so by leveraging the expertise, resources, and collaborative relationships within the Keiretsu network. 7. Trust and Loyalty: A significant advantage of the Keiretsu tradition in Japan is the high-degree of trust and loyalty developed over time within the network of companies. This trust keeps the businesses interconnected and promotes cooperation during challenging economic times. In conclusion, the Keiretsu tradition in Japan serves as a vital organizational structure that supports stability, diversification, resource sharing, access to capital, talent development and retention, adaptability, and the formation of trust and loyalty among participating businesses. Rocked by Japan's post-WWII economic challenges, the Keiretsu system has played an essential role in transforming the Japanese economy into a robust, cohesive force that has emerged as a global standard."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on \\"oklahoma 's dead reckoning\\" Text:","completion":"Title: Oklahoma's Dead Reckoning: A Journey Through the Heartland's Dark Heritage Introduction Oklahoma's Dead Reckoning delves into the hidden chapters of the state's dark heritage, exploring a mosaic of untold tales, unsolved mysteries, and forgotten tragedies that lie beneath its rolling prairies, tranquil plains, and fervent zeal for progress. A dead reckoning, in the parlance of navigators, is an estimate of one's position based on previously known data, with limited scope for perception or foresight. In a similar vein, this account takes the reader on a journey through Oklahoma's intricate past, attempting to reassemble its sinister fragments in order to trace the indelible marks left on the cultural fabric of the state and its people. Chapter 1: Puritans and the Promised Land The first chapter narrates the grim antecedents of European settlers who arrived in Oklahoma, fleeing persecution and seeking religious freedom. Their zealousness to establish a veritable Promised Land often led to the brutal displacement of native populations and the demonization of indigenous spiritual practices, setting the stage for a troubled history of conflict, polarization, and resistance. Chapter 2: The Shadow of Slavery and the Trail of Tears Oklahoma's connection to the institution of slavery is multilayered and complex, intertwining the fates of Native American tribes, African slaves, and White Americans. This chapter examines the forced relocation of the Five Civilized Tribes—including the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole—who held slaves and were expelled from their ancestral lands in the southeastern United States, leaving behind a legacy of suffering, exploitation, and betrayal known as the Trail of Tears. Chapter 3: The Great Land Run and the Dawn of a New Era Like a modern-day reenactment of Exodus, thousands of hopeful settlers raced across the Oklahoma Territory in 1889, eager to stake their claim in what many believed to be the land of opportunity. This chapter presents a vivid portrayal of the Oklahoma Land Run, a tumultuous time of land grabbing, fraud, and bitter disputes that transformed the landscape and forced native inhabitants into further obfuscation and disadvantage. Chapter 4: Dark Tales of the Dust Bowl The 1930s saw Oklahoma's abundant farmland turn into a barren wasteland, as the state became the epicenter of the Dust Bowl, a devastating environmental disaster that brought death, despair, and poverty to thousands. Amidst the choking dust storms and swirling sands, the state bore witness to an astronomical rise in crime, dislocation, and social tensions that changed the course of its future. Chapter 5: Legends of Outlaws and Lawmen Oklahoma has a storied history of outlaws, bandits, and desperadoes that prowled the frontier, leaving a trail of blood, plunder, and legend in their wake. This chapter takes the reader on a thrilling ride through the lives of infamous personalities like Belle Starr, Bill Doolin, and the Dalton Gang, as well as the lawmen who dared to challenge their nefarious exploits. Chapter 6: Oklahoma City Bombing: A Day of Infamy On April 19, 1995, Timothy McVeigh detonated a truck bomb in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, claiming the lives of 168 people and forever altering the city's landscape. This chapter delves into the motives, planning, and impact of the worst act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history, exposing a darker undercurrent of extremism, distrust, and disillusionment festering within the heartland. Conclusion Oklahoma's Dead Reckoning serves as a stark reminder that history is seldom a linear progression, and that even the most picturesque landscapes and pastoral settings can conceal darker truths. While the state has made significant strides in healing old wounds, embracing diversity, and moving towards a brighter future, it is crucial to bear in mind the sobering lessons of the past, lest they be swept away by the ever-present winds of change. At its core, the book serves as an ode to human resilience, and to the indomitable spirit of those who call Oklahoma their home."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Sentence 1: different man, stood before them Sentence 2: not recognize, man standing before them Step 2: Analyze the meaning of both sentences.

Step 3: Compare the sentences to determine if the first sentence being true means the second sentence is true. If it was a different man who stood before them (Sentence 1), it is possible that they could not recognize him due to the change or difference (Sentence 2).

Is sale used to mean the same thing in the next two sentences? I got some great bargains at their annual sale. They held a sale to reduce their inventory.","completion":"To determine if \\"sale\\" is used to mean the same thing in these two sentences, let's analyze them step-by-step. Step 1: Understand the meaning of \\"sale\\" in each sentence. 1. In the first sentence, \\"I got some great bargains at their annual sale,\\" the word \\"sale\\" refers to a special event in which items are discounted, allowing the customer to buy them at lower prices than usual. 2. In the second sentence, \\"They held a sale to reduce their inventory,\\" the word \\"sale\\" refers to an event organized by the seller to sell items at discounted prices in order to decrease their stock or inventory. Step 2: Compare the meanings identified in both sentences. In both sentences, \\"sale\\" refers to a special event where items are being sold at discounted prices. However, the focus is slightly different: 1. In the first sentence, the emphasis is on the positive outcome for the customer (i.e., getting great bargains). 2. In the second sentence, the emphasis is on the purpose from the seller's perspective (i.e., reducing their inventory). Step 3: Determine if \\"sale\\" is used to mean the same thing in both sentences. After comparing the meanings in both sentences, we can conclude that \\"sale\\" is used to mean the same fundamental concept: a special event with discounted items. The slight difference in focus (customer's perspective vs. seller's perspective) does not change the core meaning of the term \\"sale\\" in each sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As a young army officer, he played a key role in the coup that overthrew Peruvian President Guillermo Billinghurst in 1914. In 1934, he became the president of the Central Reserve Bank. Manuel Prado was a conservative patriarch of a wealthy and powerful family, and reached the presidency of Peru with the help of the left-wing Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana (APRA) party. Upon taking office, Prado announced that he would declare a general political amnesty and put an end to the proscription of political parties. During Prado's second presidency (1956-1962), the only significant proscribed party was the APRA, which was thrown out of power and outlawed in 1948 by President Manuel Odría. Prado promised to submit a bill to the newly elected congress to legalize the APRA once again. The bill was eventually passed, and the APRA's founder, Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre, returned from foreign exile. In terms of foreign policy, Prado was known for making Peru the first South American nation to break off relations with the Axis powers in 1942 during his first presidency. He was expected to side firmly with the United States in foreign policy matters. In summary, key details about Manuel Prado Ugarteche include his role as a Peruvian banker and political figure, having served as the president of Peru twice and the president of the Central Reserve Bank, his involvement in the coup that overthrew President Billinghurst, his association with the APRA party, and his foreign policy stance, particularly related to the Axis powers and the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: What was on the Mexican supply train Bowie attacked on November 26? Answer the above question based on the context below: By October 9, Cos had taken over San Antonio de Béxar. Stephen F. Austin sent an advance scout troop of 90 men under James Bowie and James Fannin to observe the Mexican forces. While taking refuge at Mission Concepción on October 28, they repelled an attack by 275 Mexicans under Domingo Ugartechea during the battle. Austin continued to send troops to Béxar. Bowie was ordered on November 26 to attack a Mexican supply train alleged to be carrying a payroll. The resulting skirmish became known as the Grass Fight, after it was discovered that the only cargo was grass to feed the horses. When Austin was selected to join Branch T. Archer and William H. Wharton on a diplomatic mission to seek international recognition and support, Edward Burleson was named as commander. On December 5, James C. Neill began distracting Cos by firing artillery directly at the Alamo, while Benjamin Milam and Frank W. Johnson led several hundred volunteers in a surprise attack. The fighting at the Siege of Béxar continued until December 9 when Cos sent word he wanted to surrender. Cos and his men were sent back to Mexico, but would later unite with Santa Anna's forces.Approximately 300 of the Texian garrison at Béxar departed on December 30 to join Frank W. Johnson and James Grant on the Matamoros Expedition, in a planned attack to seize the port for its financial resources. Proponents of this campaign were hoping Mexican Federalists would oust Santa Anna and restore the 1824 constitution. When Sesma crossed the Rio Grande, residents of the Gulf Coast began fleeing the area in January 1836. Santa Anna ordered General José de Urrea on February 16 to secure the Gulf Coast. About 160 miles (260 km) north of Matamoros at San Patricio, Urrea's troops ambushed Johnson and members of the expedition on February 27 at the Battle of San Patricio. Sixteen Texians were killed, six escaped, and 21 were taken prisoner. Urrea's troops then turned southwest by some 26 miles (42 km) to Agua Dulce Creek and on March 2 attacked a group of the expedition...

Please briefly summarize this news article: Pirates and Reds Renew a Rivalry The teams traded National League pennants at the start of the 1960s and again at the dawn of the â70s, when they both won two titles. Neither team reached the playoffs in the 1980s, but both started the â90s as division champions. They fell on hard times in the early 2000s, despite moving from multipurpose bowls to charming little ballparks along riverbanks. Joe Morgan played his last Reds playoff game in Pittsburgh. Roberto Clemente played the last game of his life in the playoffs in Cincinnati. The teams matched up four times in the N.L.C.S. in the 1970s, and again in 1990. âThe rivalryâs been very, very good over the years, simply because of the similarities of the cities,â said Jay Bell, the Piratesâ hitting coach and their former shortstop. âThereâs a Midwest type of atmosphere in both cities, and the personalities of the fans are very similar. Theyâre passionate about their teams.â Bell still remembers the final inning of the 1990 series, with the Reds leading by a run in Game 6 in Cincinnati. With one out and a man on, the Piratesâ Carmelo Martinez drove a ball to deep right field. Over the fence, and the Pirates would be three outs away from forcing a seventh game. âCarmelo knocked the snot out of it,â Bell said. âItâs a home run. But they were playing no-doubles, and Glenn Braggs reached up over the fence and caught it.â The series ended one batter later, and the Reds went on to sweep Oakland in the World Series. The Pirates went on to lose seven-game heartbreakers to Atlanta in 1991 and 1992, precipitating two decades of losing seasons. The Reds have not won a postseason series in 18 years, but no team has suffered quite like the Pirates. The Reds, who have lost two division series in three years, cannot match the Pirates for sustained suffering. A Market Square rally Monday was just part of a citywide baseball catharsis. âFor many of us out there, this organization was a crown jewel in your adolescence, when you were growing up â and then there was a famine,â Pirates Manager Clint Hurdle said. âAs I shared with the people today, the heart is the most wonderful muscle that God has put in our body, and weâve twisted yours for 21 years. But to show the strength of it, what are you feeling today?â The pride in this city should be evident Tuesday, with players encouraging fans to wear black, to match the teamâs jersey. The Pirates will start the left-hander Francisco Liriano, who went 16-8 with a 3.02 earned run average after signing for a guarantee of only 1 million. His success put into effect a guaranteed contract with the Pirates for next season. âIn the past, when people came here, it was more of a rehabilitation center,â said Andrew McCutchen, the homegrown center fielder who will probably be named the N.L.âs most valuable player. âItâs true â guys came here at the end of their careers, thinking they were going to boost their game, have a good year and go somewhere else. Now, people come here because they want to be here. They want to be a part of a team that can change things, part of a team that can win.â The Pirates, whose home park favors pitchers, scored the fewest runs of any playoff team this season (3.91 a game). But they fortified their lineup in late August by trading for right fielder Marlon Byrd, who hit .318 after a trade from the Mets, and first baseman Justin Morneau, who hit .260 after coming over from Minnesota. Byrd is 7 for 12 with a home run in his career against the Redsâ Johnny Cueto, who will start on Tuesday. Then again, Cueto has dazzled in his career at PNC Park, with a 1.90 earned run average in 13 starts, mostly against inferior Pirates lineups. More important than the statistics will be Cuetoâs health. He has started only twice since late June and made three trips to the disabled list this season with back problems. Cueto, who pitches with an exaggerated back twist, was forced from his playoff start in San Francisco last October after one batter because of back spasms. The Reds lost the series in five games. âLast year, we were positioned pretty good,â Manager Dusty Baker said. âThe only problem we had last year is we didnât have Johnny Cueto.â The Reds would have hosted this game if they had taken a series from the Pirates last weekend in Cincinnati. Instead, they lost three in a row, after falling twice to the Mets. They finished the regular season on a five-game losing streak, scoring only eight runs. âThereâs only 10 of us left standing, and weâre proud to be one of the 10, no matter how you got there,â Baker said, referring to the playoff field. âThey say you back in, you limp in. It donât matter how you got there, just get there.â The surroundings are familiar for the Reds, but the charged atmosphere is unlikely to be their biggest impediment to a division-series date with the St. Louis Cardinals. Liriano is much more imposing. In his career, he has handcuffed some of the Redsâ best hitters, including Shin-Soo Choo (6 for 31), Jay Bruce (0 for 11) and Joey Votto (2 for 10). For all of the teamsâ shared history, the game will not come down to black T-shirts or Jolly Roger flags or the longing of a proud and loyal fan base. Even Hurdle, who leads the cheers, concedes that. âThe beauty of it is, once the game starts, youâve got a game again,â he said. âOur guys are looking forward to the opportunity.â Summary:","completion":"The Pirates and Reds baseball teams have a long history and rivalry. They both had good times in the 1960s and 1970s when they won some championships, but they both had some bad times too. The fans in both cities love their teams a lot and are very excited when they play each other. The players and coaches remember many close games and special moments from their past games.

Their primary tools for controlling the money supply were interest rates and open market operations. By adjusting interest rates and buying or selling government securities, central banks could influence the amount of money in circulation and, therefore, control economic activity.

In the shadow of the Seattle Space Needle, almost alien crystalline forms wrap their deft tendrils through the Chihuly Garden and Glass. Every single petal, bowl, stem and branch of cascading glass has been handblown under the guidance of Washington State native Dale Chihuly (in fact he grew up in nearby Tacoma), and we couldn’t quite believe our eyes. Having discovered this exhibit through the magic of Jaime’s instagram (she’s a self-named Angloyankophile who grew up in Seattle before moving to London) I knew we would have to visit. My photos don’t do the undulating forms any kind of justice; but they might just convey the incredible scale of the exhibition. I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A. Chihuly’s lifelong fascination for glasshouses has grown into a series of exhibitions within botanical settings. What do museums think about Chihuly's works becoming part of their exhibits? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. they probably wouldn't be interested B. they may or may not have interest C. not enough information D. they probably would be thrilled","completion":"D. They probably would be thrilled. Museums would most likely be thrilled to have Dale Chihuly's works become part of their exhibits. His ingenious artistry, talent, and unique vision have been recognized all around the world, granting him numerous awards and accolades. Chihuly's creations are included in over 200 museum collections worldwide, signifying his global reputation as a master glass artist. Having Chihuly's work in their exhibits not only adds cultural prestige to the museums but also works as a substantial draw for art enthusiasts, growing their visitor numbers. The combination of Chihuly's dedication to pushing the boundaries of his craft and the broad appeal of his intricate glass installations make his works highly attractive to museums. They would relish the opportunity to include his exceptional art pieces in their collection. Over the years, Chihuly has exhibited his works in numerous museums such as the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, where they organized the Chihuly at the V&A exhibition in 2001, and the Tower of David Museum in Jerusalem. His artwork has been displayed and admired by millions of people through various exhibitions, solidifying his position as a highly sought-after artist. In conclusion, museums would likely be thrilled to have Dale Chihuly's works as part of their exhibits due to his outstanding reputation, innovative approach to glass art, and the ability of his striking creations to attract and captivate a wide audience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer??","completion":"To solve the equation 475*q - 7832 + 29222 = -524*q + 286*q for q, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the terms with the q variable on both sides of the equation. On the left side of the equation, there are no terms to combine. On the right side, we have two terms that contain q: -524*q and 286*q. Combine these terms: -524*q + 286*q = (-524 + 286)*q = -238*q So, the updated equation is: 475*q - 7832 + 29222 = -238*q Step 2: Move all q terms to one side of the equation and all constant terms to the other side. To move the -238*q term to the left side of the equation, we need to add the 238*q so that it cancels out: 475*q + 238*q - 7832 + 29222 = 0 Next, add the constant terms, -7832 and 29222: 713*q + 21390 = 0 Step 3: Isolate the q variable. To isolate q, subtract 21390 from both sides of the equation: 713*q = -21390 Now, divide both sides by 713: q = -21390 / 713 Step 4: Simplify the result to find the value of q. q ≈ -30 So, the answer is q ≈ -30."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At the end , Princess Minnie entitles Mickey , Donald and Goofy Royal Musketeers . Options are: + no. + yes.","completion":"Yes, both sentences essentially convey the same meaning, though with slight differences in the choice of words. In both sentences, the context is set towards \\"the end,\\" indicating that this event takes place at the conclusion of a story or journey. The main character, Princess Minnie, takes action to honor three other characters – Mickey, Donald, and Goofy. In the first sentence, the verb \\"dubs\\" is utilized. To dub someone means to honor or confer a title, name, or nickname upon an individual. In this case, Princess Minnie dubs Mickey, Donald, and Goofy \\"royal musketeers.\\" This signifies that she is bestowing this prestigious title upon them, perhaps in recognition of their accomplishments or as a means of inducting them into a group of esteemed warriors or protectors. The second sentence employs the verb \\"entitles.\\" In this context, to entitle someone means to give them an official title, designation, or right. Consequently, the act of entitling Mickey, Donald, and Goofy \\"Royal Musketeers\\" suggests that Princess Minnie is formally awarding these characters a distinguished title, possibly as a reward for their achievements or as an acknowledgment of their membership in an elite force. While both statements convey slightly different nuances, they essentially share the same gist: Princess Minnie is honoring Mickey, Donald, and Goofy by bestowing the title of \\"Royal Musketeers\\" upon them at the end. Therefore, the correct answer is: + yes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

In this tweet, the important phrases are \\"omg\\", \\"going to kill\\", \\"talking me into going tanning twice in one day\\", and \\"sunburn.\\" Step 2: Analyze the words and phrases for sentiment indicators. - \\"omg\\" usually shows excitement or strong emotions, but does not have a clear positive or negative sentiment by itself. - \\"going to kill\\" is a strong negative phrase, but should be considered in context, as it is commonly used colloquially to express frustration or annoyance. - \\"talking me into going tanning twice in one day\\" suggests the author's friend Krista convinced them to do something they might not have otherwise done. - \\"sunburn\\" has a negative connotation, indicating the result of going tanning twice in one day was undesirable. Step 3: Weigh the words and phrases to determine the overall sentiment. The tweet contains a mix of neutral and negative indicators. Since the primary outcome is a negative one (sunburn) and the author expresses annoyance with their friend, I predict the overall sentiment of this tweet is negative."},{"prompt":"Definition: In this task, you are given an input list A.

Goodman is assigned to Saint Marie after the murder of D.I. Richard Poole at the start of Series 3. Clues from Poole's investigation helped Goodman reveal the motive and the killer's identity; Goodman commented that Poole had 'solved his own murder.' Goodman stayed on in Saint Marie after his wife Sally announced she would not be joining him on the Caribbean island. He became the chief inspector on the island, and took to Poole's old habit of announcing the murderer in front of all the suspects and his police team. He is very clumsy, often forgetting things or finding himself with nothing to take notes on; he embraces Caribbean life much more than his predecessor. He has a knack at being able to solve murders instantly, looking at the meaning of small details, much like his predecessor. He fell in love with his detective sergeant, Camille Bordey, often coming close to revealing his feelings for her. He tried to stop her leaving when she requested a job in Paris, but conceded. He shared a passionate kiss with her just before she left the island. Her successor, Florence Cassell, also managed to get along with Goodman, often sharing jokes and they dedicate a drink to Camille after their first solved case.

While both sentences are related to military events that took place in Afghanistan, they do not convey the same information. Here's a breakdown of the differences: 1. NATO soldier dies in Afghanistan: - This sentence refers to one NATO soldier who has died. - It does not specify the nationality of the soldier, only indicating that they were part of NATO. - The focus of this sentence is on the death of the soldier, not on any injuries. 2. Two Aust soldiers wounded in Afghanistan: - This sentence refers to two Australian soldiers who have been wounded. - The nationality of the soldiers is specifically mentioned (Australian). - The focus of this sentence is on the soldiers being wounded, not on any deaths. In summary, the main points of similarity are that both sentences involve military personnel in Afghanistan. However, the specific events and outcomes differ significantly, with one sentence focusing on a single death from NATO and the other focusing on the number of wounded Australian soldiers. These differences lead to a low similarity rating and they cannot be considered as conveying the same information."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have a math question with some fun numbers, and we want to figure out what number \\"b\\" is. The question looks like this: 4740 = 59*b + 40*b + 9*b + 1284 1. First, let's add all the b's together: 59b + 40b + 9b = 108b (It's like having 59 toys + 40 toys + 9 toys = 108 toys) 2. Now, let's rewrite our original equation with our new b value: 4740 = 108b + 1284 3. Now, we want to make the equation even simpler. We're going to subtract 1284 from both sides of the equation: 4740 - 1284 = 108b 3456 = 108b 4. Lastly, we'll find out what \\"b\\" is by dividing both numbers by 108: 3456 ÷ 108 = b 32 = b So, the answer is b = 32! Yay, we found it!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"A judge has told a bachelor farmer from an isolated part of County Kerry that he should find a wife before his ban for drink driving comes into effect.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Kerry Judge Advises Bachelor Farmer to Find a Wife Before Drink-Driving Ban Introduction: In an unusual turn of events, a judge from County Kerry has given some unconventional advice to a bachelor farmer facing a drink-driving ban. The judge suggested that the farmer ought to find a wife before the ban comes into effect. This intriguing story unfolds in the rural reaches of County Kerry, where a seemingly ordinary court hearing took a unique twist. Step 1: Discuss the details of the court hearing At the recent court hearing, the bachelor farmer, who hails from an isolated part of County Kerry, was facing charges for drink-driving. The judge assigned to the case chose to impart some wisdom upon the defendant before passing the judgement. In an unorthodox move, the judge encouraged the single man to find a life partner before the driving ban is implemented. He believed that having a significant other would positively impact the farmer's life and possibly save him from further drink-driving incidents in the future. Step 2: Evaluate the circumstances faced by the bachelor farmer The suggestion came at a time when the bachelor farmer was feeling the strain of his isolation. With no family around, the burden of managing his farm and daily chores were taking a toll on his wellbeing. Added to this was the looming drink-driving ban, which would restrict his mobility and prevent him from attending social events, further exacerbating his feelings of loneliness and isolation. Step 3: Discuss possible reasons for the judge's unusual advice It may appear that the judge's advice stemmed from his concern for the farmer's overall wellbeing. Recognizing the bachelor's difficult circumstances, the judge might have believed that finding companionship could alleviate his sense of isolation, ultimately resulting in reduced instances of drink-driving. Moreover, having a spouse who could potentially share the responsibilities of farm work and daily tasks might lessen the man's stress and ensure a more balanced lifestyle. Step 4: Explore the societal pressures and issues faced by rural communities The bachelor farmer's situation can be seen as a reflection of the challenges faced by many inhabitants of rural communities. The pressures of isolation, a lack of social connections, and the demands of farm life can take a substantial toll on mental health and overall wellbeing. In such cases, measures to combat loneliness and promote human interaction are essential for maintaining life balance and preventing dangerous behaviors like drink-driving. Step 5: Conclusion and a look towards the future In conclusion, the judge's unorthodox advice for a bachelor farmer from an isolated part of County Kerry has shone a light on the struggles faced by many rural dwellers. While it is uncertain whether the farmer will take the judge's counsel to heart, this unusual court ruling raises essential questions about the mental wellbeing of those living in rural communities and the importance of companionship in ensuring a balanced life. Ultimately, fostering connections and providing support systems for those who live in isolation can be a vital step in promoting mental health and reducing risky behaviors in rural regions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
