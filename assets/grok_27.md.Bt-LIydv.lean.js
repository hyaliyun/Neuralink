You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please write a short summary for the following article: My Instagram: Kiana Gibson For Roslindale resident Kiana Gibson (@kiana29), taking pictures for Instagram is an absolutely crucial part of the week. “I have photography withdrawal if I don’t do it after a few days,” the 37-year-old pre-kindergarten associate teacher says, laughing. As one of three moderators for the popular IGers Boston account (@igersboston), Gibson works not just to populate her own feed with scenic snaps, but also to help find shots for the group and cultivate one of the photography-sharing app’s fastest-growing local communities. Q. How would you characterize your personal account? A. My personal profile is mostly street photography. My style is everyday life and the beauty of the city, through my lens. It’s all of architecture, people, and popular landmarks. Q. Do you go to specific areas or all over? A. I tend to walk in the well-known tourist areas, such as Beacon Hill, downtown, Boston Public Garden, and the Copley area. Q. What catches your eye, subject-wise? A. A lot of times, I’m inspired by the weather. When it’s rainy, that can make the bricks on the streets shiny, and I’ll go out and shoot someone with a cool umbrella. I find myself inspired by snow as well — I go out and shoot things that might look different, like the George Washington statue in the Boston Public Garden, which just looks so much cooler in the snow. And the littlest thing will catch my eye. Three or four weeks ago, I shot someone holding two red bags, one in each hand, and that caught my eye, so it can really be as simple as that. Q. What makes a good photo ? A. It’s the connection you can make with the photo. I might find a cool building downtown and take the photo of the building. Architecturally, it just looks really cool, and when I post it to Instagram, the people who follow me can make a connection with that place. They might say they walked past it when they visited Boston, or that they walk past it every day — and that they’re excited to see it. It’s not just about me — it’s also about the connections others can make with it. Q. Is there a recent photo you took that you’re particularly proud of? A. There’s a rooftop photo that I had taken from the Taj. The subject is the Prudential, and behind the Prudential is the sunset. It’s something you can’t particularly see from the ground, but from above, you can see the sunset starting to come in, and the color that it brings to the background of the city. I like that one a lot.

Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Robin and Samantha are both bodybuilders preparing for a competition. Both of them are trying to change their skin complexion to help their appearances at the competition. Robin begins exposing her skin to high amounts of UV light several days a week. Samantha decides not to use any UV light and instead just uses lotion to help her skin. and a hint : The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. Please answer this question : Who will produce lower amounts of melanin? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, Samantha will produce lower amounts of melanin as compared to Robin. This is because the amount of melanin produced is determined by both heredity and exposure to UV light. Since Robin is exposing her skin to high amounts of UV light several days a week, her melanocytes will be stimulated to produce more melanin. On the other hand, Samantha is not using any UV light and is only using lotion for her skin, so her exposure to UV light is significantly lower, leading to a lower melanin production."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

I don't pretend to be an authority on actors who have played Othello, but I've never witnessed a performance of the play, on film or on stage, wherein Othello was portrayed with more humanity and authenticity. According to the biographical notes, Fishburne never received any professional training as an actor. Perhaps this explains why his acting, in this beautifully edited film, comes over as so believable and so powerful. Instead of chewing the scenery in the approved fashion for such high-powered roles, Fishburne's portrayal is focused more on Othello's love for his wife, and on his profound sadness at her supposed betrayal, than on violence and vengeance. In a word, the performance is understated, and made far more impressive by Fishburne's extremely intelligent interpretation than it otherwise would have been. The acting throughout is superb, and the (abridged) speeches gain grace from their light editing. (Even Shakesspeare, after all, can be improved upon, now and again -- and if that be treason, make the most of it!

All taxable dividends and interest which exceed the 1,250 single exemption or the 2,500 joint exemption are taxable at the rate of 6%. The state's sales and use tax rate for most items is 7%. Food is taxed at a lower rate of 5.25%, but candy, dietary supplements and prepared food are taxed at the full 7% rate. Local sales taxes are collected in most jurisdictions, at rates varying from 1.5% to 2.75%, bringing the total sales tax to between 8.5% and 9.75%, one of the highest levels in the nation.

Context: TL:DR: I un-professionally get mad at a customer and verbally slam the door on her way out. I was working a shift at a chain cafe one afternoon in England, it was during the lunch rush, so we had a back up of customers lined up to the exit. See the problem with the chain is that all of our customers mostly range from midlife crisis to half-a-foot in the grave, so once a customer lines up, they don’t leave and they extend the queue. Plus this is a chain cafe so I've got a manager who's constantly on my back to speed up because someone is on her back to drive numbers up: this results in the line putting stress on my air-hostess smile, but they don't call it work for nothing. Now I'm not the only one stressed, a customer lines up during lunch, they're hungry and wish that Euclidean laws would suspend themselves so that they did not have to deal with the fact that I can't deal with a customer at the speed of light. Well one eldritch horror declares that my coffee took too long and does her rendition of the 1933 Hitler speech to the rest of the customers with an addendum that she will take her business elsewhere. Now my chain are pretty big in England, so if a customer wants to slap me around with a ‘customer is always right’ the script dictates that I do everything in my power to make sure they come back, and Cthulu knows this, well: I'm stressed, I don't like her face and she's given me an opportunity for me to give her the polite ‘fuck off'. All I say is ‘Good’ and move on to the next customer. Hitler-lite phones my corporation to voice a complaint, so a suit comes out and asks the team who did it, I fess up so I can save the time and not have a reason to hate one of my co-workers.

Step 2: Iterate through the string from index i=1 to i=len(string) - 1 to check for palindrome substrings with center at each character in the string. That is, check the characters on both sides of the center and expand outwards. Step 3: Since palindrome substrings can have even or odd lengths, we should repeat the check for both possibilities at each center: 3.1: Check for even-length palindrome substring: - Initialize left=i-1 and right=i. - While left >= 0 and right < len(string) and string[left] == string[right]: - Increment the substring length by 2. - Decrement left by 1 and increment right by 1. - If substring length is greater than maxLength, update maxLength and start. 3.2: Check for odd-length palindrome substring: - Initialize left=i-1 and right=i+1. - While left >= 0 and right < len(string) and string[left] == string[right]: - Increment the substring length by 2. - Decrement left by 1 and increment right by 1. - If substring length is greater than maxLength, update maxLength and start.

Good, with that point set, I can comment on the movie: I have no idea on how it is enjoyable to the Japanese audiences, Mamoru Oshii is quite a good director- despite the overly pedantic postmodern stuff in the style of Talking Head, and even that was curious and somehow interesting- and I am surprised he came up with this. It may just be one of those lost-in-translation cases, I am afraid it is, but as a European viewer watching the film with subtext overloaded English subtitles I just thought it was horrible. The jokes seemed bad, the script was overcooked- I mean, give the audience a break, and shut up a little you damn narrator- to the point of almost making my head explode over an overkill of fast-paced speaking and absurd action. However, I thought the animation was really cool. The idea is great, and it is well exploited in those animated scenes. However, the eye-candy finishes as soon as the characters are left aside to start with an endless not funny at all mumbo-jumbo speech over still pictures. It just makes you want to fast forward to the next cut-out hysterical characters scene. I read Mamoru Oshii is actually planning on a sequel for this. The idea was good but horribly exploited. Maybe the second part will bring up the good parts of this first one and actually make an interesting movie, or maybe it will be more and more over-narrated scenes. But hell, if you thought Talking Head was dense, Amazing Lifes of Fast Food Gifters will give cause you a stroke. Of course, all this comment is based on the experiences of someone who is European.

Understand the task: You are given a list of numbers, for example: [52, 41.917, -72.056]. 2. Guidelines: You need to remove any number that is not a whole number (integer) and provide the final list with whole numbers only. If there are no whole numbers in the list, return an empty list (\\"[]\\"). 3. Use the guidelines to find the answer: a. Check each number in the list to see if it is a whole number or not. b. If the number is a whole number, keep it in the list. c. If the number is not a whole number, remove it from the list. d. After going through all the numbers, check if the list is empty or not. e. Return the list of whole numbers or an empty list if all numbers were non-whole numbers. 4. Apply these steps to the given example of [52, 41.917, -72.056]: a. 52 is a whole number, so we keep it. b. 41.917 is not a whole number, so we remove it from the list. c. -72.056 is not a whole number, so we remove it from the list. d. After the process, we have the list: [52]. 5. Answer: Therefore, for the given example list [52, 41.917, -72.056], the answer would be [52]."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Laughter in Hell Movie plot: Edward L. Cahn's \\"Laughter in Hell\\" (1933), a pre-code flick by a director I've loved since his Z-Grade but very affecting \\"Runaway Daughters\\" (1956), made specifically for Florida drive-ins and starring grrrls on the verge and their having-crossed-over parents (alcoholic, \\"inappropriate,\\" cruel, deluded, unfeeling). Then there's Italian second cuz Fabbio, who envisions them 'daughters' as a stable of working girls. Laughter in Hell stars serial priest portrayer Pat O'Brien at an early, almost good-looking stage wearing suiting cut to the quick like it's 21st Century Japanese couture. Depths of the Depression, but everyone wore suits, especially the poor, with scads of material saved under a \\"trim\\" silhouette.

Answer the following question: Question: what affects the money supply I found the following answer on Google: There are several ways to define \\"money,\\" but standard measures usually include currency in circulation and demand deposits (depositors' easily accessed assets on the books of financial institutions). Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is correct. The money supply is usually measured by considering currency in circulation and demand deposits. However, I will expand on this topic to provide a more detailed answer. The money supply can be affected by various factors, which can be broadly categorized into three groups: 1. Actions by Central Banks: Central banks are responsible for managing the money supply in a country. They can influence the money supply through several tools, such as: a. Open market operations: Central banks can buy or sell government bonds to affect the money supply. When a central bank purchases bonds, it increases the amount of money circulating in the economy. Conversely, selling bonds takes money out of the economy, decreasing the money supply. b. Changing the reserve ratio: This refers to the percentage of reserves that commercial banks must hold against their deposit liabilities. By increasing the reserve ratio, central banks can reduce the amount of money available for lending, ultimately leading to a decrease in the money supply. Conversely, lowering the reserve ratio can increase the money supply. c. Adjusting interest rates: Central banks can influence the money supply by altering short-term interest rates. Lowering interest rates can encourage borrowing and spending, which can lead to an increase in the money supply. Conversely, raising interest rates can discourage borrowing and spending, and, as a result, decrease the money supply. 2. Banking Activities: Commercial banks also play a significant role in affecting the money supply. a. Fractional reserve banking: Commercial banks are only required to hold a fraction of their deposits as reserves, and they can lend out the remainder. This process of creating money through lending can either increase or decrease the money supply, depending on the demand for loans. b. Deposit creation: When customers deposit money in their accounts, banks can lend this money to other customers. The deposited funds become part of the money supply as new loans are extended, thus increasing the money supply. 3. Economic Factors: Various economic factors can also influence the money supply. a. Economic growth: As an economy grows, businesses may need more funds to expand, and consumers may be more willing to spend. This can lead to an increase in borrowing, which ultimately increases the money supply. b. Inflation: Inflation can affect the money supply as central banks may respond to higher inflation by tightening monetary policy (e.g., raising interest rates), which can reduce the money supply. Conversely, in times of low inflation or deflation, central banks may loosen monetary policy (e.g., lowering interest rates), which can increase the money supply. In summary, the money supply is influenced by a combination of central bank policies, commercial banking activities, and prevailing economic conditions. Currency in circulation and demand deposits are important components of the money supply, and various factors can affect their levels."},{"prompt":"Facts: - position: goal keeper - currentclub: flambeau de l’est - birth date: 27 july 1995 - name: arakaza macarthur Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of arakaza macarthur .

The reviewer expresses their dissatisfaction with the movie and points out several reasons as to why they did not enjoy it. Firstly, they mention that life is too short for movies like this, implying that watching the movie was a waste of their time. Secondly, they criticize David Schwimmer's acting and role in the film, stating that he plays the same type of character as in 'Friends', which they found disappointing. They also question Schwimmer's acting abilities and the roles he is offered, suggesting that he might not be versatile enough to play diverse characters. Lastly, they express frustration at the film for wasting the talents of other accomplished actors, such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Barbara Hershey, Toni Collette, and Carol Kane. This shows that the reviewer had higher expectations for the movie, given the cast, and found it underwhelming and disappointing.

Gimbel was self-taught in music and following initial employment with music publisher David Blum, progressed to become a contract songwriter with Edwin H. Morris Music.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the song where there is a chorus of women's voices wordlessly by the composer who was inspired by Walt Whitman? Vaughan Williams' program note for A Sea Symphony discusses how the text was to be treated as music. The composer writes, \\"The plan of the work is symphonic rather than narrative or dramatic, and this may be held to justify the frequent repetition of important words and phrases which occur in the poem. The words as well as the music are thus treated symphonically.\\" Walt Whitman's poems inspired him to write the symphony, and Whitman's use of free verse became appreciated at a time where fluidity of structure was becoming more attractive than traditional, metrical settings of text. This fluidity helped facilitate the non-narrative, symphonic treatment of text that Vaughan Williams had in mind. In the third movement in particular, the text is loosely descriptive and can be \\"pushed about by the music\\", some lines being repeated, some not consecutive in the written text immediately following one another in the music, and some left out entirely.Vaughan Williams was not the only composer following a non-narrative approach to his text. Mahler took a similar, perhaps even more radical approach in his Eighth Symphony, presenting many lines of the first part, \\"Veni, Creator Spiritus\\", in what music writer and critic Michael Steinberg referred to as \\"an incredibly dense growth of repetitions, combinations, inversions, transpositions and conflations\\". He does the same with Goethe's text in Part Two of the symphony, making two substantial cuts and other changes.Other works take the use of text as music still further. Vaughan Williams uses a chorus of women's voices wordlessly in his Sinfonia Antartica, based on his music for the film Scott of the Antarctic, to help set the bleakness of the overall atmosphere. While a chorus is used in the second and third movements of Glass's Seventh Symphony, also known as A Toltec Symphony, the text contains no actual words; the composer states that it is instead formed \\"from loose syllables that add to the evocative context of the overall orchestral texture\\".

Input: Reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly hydrogen peroxide, and the proteins that regulate them play important roles in the migration and adhesion of cells. Stimulation of cell surface receptors with growth factors and chemoattractants generates ROS, which relay signals from the cell surface to key signaling proteins inside the cell. ROS act within cells to promote migration and also in nonmigrating cells to influence the behavior of migrating cells. Hydrogen peroxide has also been suggested to act as a chemoattractant in its own right, drawing immune cells to wounds.

While thinking about what to write, put down any idea that comes to you, even if it seems far-fetched or unlikely to be successful. One mediocre idea may lead to a better one. Find a topic that grabs your attention and thrills you. Your excitement and interest will make it easier for you to keep the project going and keep it to a high standard, and hopefully it will rub off on the reader as well. A serious writing project doesn't need to be a full-length book. Crafting a short story can be a difficult and rewarding challenge, and may be a more time-effective way to practice your skills. Keep a notebook for writing down observations, overheard conversations, and sudden ideas encountered in your daily life. When you read or hear something that makes you laugh, think, or want to repeat it to someone else, write it down and think about what makes it effective. You may prefer to keep your ideas in a digital file, such as a Word document or Google Doc. This makes it easier to develop your ideas or insert them into other documents. If you use Google Docs, you can also access your work from several devices. You may use this notebook or file to collect unfamiliar words as well. Use whatever technique works best for you, or try out several if you don't have an established process yet. You can make an outline, put a collection of notes on cards and arrange them until they are in order, or draw a tree or map. Your outline may have nothing but a rough order of the events or topics covered, or it may be a more detailed scene-by-scene summary. Building some kind of structure in advance can help keep you going on days when you're feeling low on creativity. There are many types of organizational software for writers, such as Scrivener or TheSage. You could also use a simple Word document or Google Docs. With Google Docs, you can access your writing from any device. It's fine to deviate from your plan, but if you abandon it entirely, stop and consider the reasons behind the chance. Build a new plan to guide you through the altered work, and keep you thinking consciously about how you want to get through it. While a work of nonfiction requires you to know your subject, even a fiction book will benefit from research. If your main character is a glassblower, read a book on glassblowing and use the right terminology. If you are writing a book set before you were born, interview people who lived during that time, or who spoke to parents and grandparents who did. In the case of fiction writing, you may be able to dive in to the first draft before you start your research. Try writing without pause for as long as you can. Do not stop to change your word choice or correct your grammar, spelling, or punctuation. This is one of the most common recommendations for making sure that you actually finish what you start. Once you have a first draft, reread it and rewrite it. You are looking for errors in grammar and spelling as well as style, content, organization, and coherence. If there are any passages you dislike, get rid of them and write them again from scratch. Critiquing your own work is an important skill, and it takes plenty of practice, just like writing itself.. Give yourself time between writing and editing, if at all possible. It is better to wait a good length of time, but even a short break can give you some of the necessary distance and detachment to edit well. Get feedback on your work in progress from interested readers, whether they are friends, fellow writers, or readers of your writing blog. Try to accept criticism without getting angry or upset; even if you don't agree with the specifics, knowing what parts of your work people dislike can be valuable for focusing your editing. Don't be afraid to make drastic changes, even cutting whole sections of the project or rewriting it from a different character's perspective. Continue the cycle of feedback and editing as you explore how to perfect your work. If it feels like running in place, remember you are practicing skills that will help you in all your future writing. You can always take a break to write something fun and ridiculous, just to remind yourself that writing can be a blast. Summary:","completion":"When starting a writing project, jot down all your ideas, even those that initially seem mediocre or implausible, as they can lead to better ideas. Choose a topic that excites and interests you to maintain your project's momentum and quality. Writing projects do not need to be full-length books; short stories can also provide a worthwhile challenge. Keep a notebook or digital file for recording observations, conversations, sudden ideas, and unfamiliar words encountered in daily life. Utilize organizational tools like an outline, note cards, or software like Scrivener, but be ready to adjust your plan as needed. In both nonfiction and fiction writing, research is valuable for authenticity. Write first drafts quickly without worrying about corrections; editing comes later. Taking breaks between writing and editing can improve your ability to spot errors. Getting feedback from others is crucial for refining your work accordingly, and don't be afraid to make drastic changes if needed. See the entire process as a chance to develop your writing skills, and remember to have fun with it too."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

She suspects that Harold's right hand man, Jeff, knows more than he has been letting on about the attacks, while Jeff simultaneously starts to fear that Harold might be onto him and tries to prevent people from talking through intimidation. After some detective work, Harold confronts Jeff, who confesses that he sent Harold's friend Colin on a job to Belfast to deliver money raised by Irish Navvies (construction workers) to the IRA. When Harold discovers Jeff accepted a job to deliver funds to the IRA, he becomes extremely angry and vows to destroy the IRA in London. Jeff advises against this and explains that the IRA aren't just annoyed about some of the money which had gone missing, but also wrongly hold Harold responsible for the murder of three IRA men. Under intense questioning, Jeff confesses that the IRA threatened to kill him and he was so scared that he \\"put the finger\\" on Harold, who loses his temper and kills him with a broken whisky bottle. Harold forces Councillor Harris to organise a meeting with the IRA, and appears to offer them Â£60,000 in return for a ceasefire but double-crosses them by having them shot and killed along with Harris. Having taken out the top men, Harold believes his problem is solved and...","completion":"In the movie, who informs the American visitors that they are under attack from an unknown enemy, causing them to suspect Harold's right-hand man, Jeff, of knowing more about the attacks?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question 2: Can I learn riding gear bikes on a KTM Duke 200? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is asking about the best biking riding gears suitable for all terrain in India, while question 2 is asking if the person can learn to ride gear bikes on a KTM Duke 200. Here are detailed answers to both questions: Question 1: What are the best biking riding gears for all terrain in India? To tackle various terrains in India, a rider requires appropriate gear and protection. The best biking riding gears for all terrains in India would include the following: 1. Helmet: A good quality helmet is essential for any rider. Look for a helmet that meets safety standards, fits well, has proper ventilation, and provides a clear visor. 2. Riding Jacket: A riding jacket should be made of high-quality abrasion-resistant material, such as Cordura, leather or mesh, and it should have proper ventilation for hot weather conditions. The jacket should have CE-certified armor for added protection in the shoulders, elbows, and back. 3. Riding Pants: Like a riding jacket, riding pants should also be made of abrasion-resistant material with CE-certified armor in the hip and knee areas. Pants should offer a comfortable fit and have proper ventilation. 4. Riding Gloves: Good-quality gloves are essential for protecting your hands. They should have a snug fit, be made of abrasion-resistant material, and have reinforced palms, knuckle protection, and ideally, touchscreen compatibility. 5. Riding Boots: For all terrains, invest in high-quality riding boots that offer excellent protection for your feet, ankles, and lower legs. They should be made of abrasion-resistant material and should have sturdy soles for better grip on varied surfaces. 6. Knee and Elbow Guards: Additional knee and elbow guards can provide extra protection in case of falls or accidents. 7. Body Armor: A body armor vest can provide extra protection for the chest and back in case of an accident. 8. Neck Brace: A neck brace can help to prevent neck injuries during a crash. 9. Rain Gear: Waterproof jackets, pants, and gloves are essential for riding in the unpredictable Indian monsoon season. Question 2: Can I learn riding gear bikes on a KTM Duke 200? Yes, you can learn to ride gear bikes on a KTM Duke 200. However, it is essential to keep the following points in mind: 1. KTM Duke 200 is a performance-oriented motorcycle with a powerful engine, and it may not be the best option for a beginner learning to ride a gear bike. Consider starting with a less powerful, more beginner-friendly bike like a 100-125 cc commuter bike. 2. If you have prior experience riding geared scooters or similar vehicles, you may find it easier to learn on the KTM Duke 200. Make sure you are familiar with the motorcycle's controls and handling before starting. 3. Take a professional training course or find a knowledgeable mentor to help you learn to ride the KTM Duke 200 properly. Proper guidance can make a significant difference in your learning experience. 4. Practice in a safe and controlled environment, such as an empty parking lot or closed roads, before taking the bike onto public roads. It is essential to gain confidence and experience before navigating traffic and difficult road conditions. In conclusion, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. The first question is about the best biking riding gears for all terrains in India, while the second question is about learning to ride geared bikes on a KTM Duke 200."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Bill and Bob were two brothers. they were both into physical exercise, but Bill chose weight lifting, and Bob running. Which brother had smaller muscles? Hint: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it.

You know how your mom or dad might cook you a yummy dinner, but they eat something different that's maybe a little healthier? The chefs at the Chinese takeaway were doing that too. They were cooking food for themselves that didn't have as much fat or oil as the food they made to sell.

Theodore Roosevelt Jr. ( ROH-z@-velt; October 27, 1858 - January 6, 1919) was an American statesman and writer who served as the 26th President of the United States from 1901 to 1909. He also served as the 25th Vice President of the United States from March to September 1901 and as the 33rd Governor of New York from 1899 to 1900. As a leader of the Republican Party during this time, he became a driving force for the Progressive Era in the United States in the early 20th century. His face is depicted on Mount Rushmore, alongside those of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln. Theodore Roosevelt Jr. was born on October 27, 1858, at East 20th Street in New York City. He was the second of four children born to socialite Martha Stewart \\"Mittie\\" Bulloch and businessman and philanthropist Theodore Roosevelt Sr. He had an older sister, Anna (nicknamed \\"Bamie\\"), a younger brother, Elliott, and a younger sister, Corinne. Elliott was later the father of First Lady Anna Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of Theodore's distant cousin, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. His paternal grandfather was of Dutch descent; his other ancestry included primarily Scottish and Scots-Irish, English and smaller amounts of German, Welsh, and French. Theodore Sr. was the fifth son of businessman Cornelius Van Schaack \\"C.V.S.\\" Roosevelt and Margaret Barnhill. Theodore's fourth cousin, James Roosevelt I, who was also a businessman, was the father of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Mittie was the younger daughter of Major James Stephens Bulloch and Martha P. \\"Patsy\\" Stewart. Through the Van Schaacks, Roosevelt was a descendant of the Schuyler family. Roosevelt's youth was largely shaped by his poor health and debilitating asthma. He repeatedly experienced sudden nighttime asthma attacks that caused the experience of being smothered to death, which terrified both Theodore and his parents. Doctors had no cure. Nevertheless, he was energetic and mischievously inquisitive. His lifelong interest in zoology began at age seven when he saw a dead seal at a local market; after obtaining the seal's head, Roosevelt and two cousins formed what they called the \\"Roosevelt Museum of Natural History\\". Having learned the rudiments of taxidermy, he filled his makeshift museum with animals that he killed or caught; he then studied the animals and prepared them for display. At age nine, he recorded his observation of insects in a paper entitled \\"The Natural History of Insects\\". Roosevelt's father significantly influenced him. His father was a prominent leader in New York's cultural affairs; he helped to found the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and had been especially active in mobilizing support for the Union during the Civil War, even though his in-laws included Confederate leaders. Roosevelt said, \\"My father, Theodore Roosevelt, was the best man I ever knew. He combined strength and courage with gentleness, tenderness, and great unselfishness. He would not tolerate in us children selfishness or cruelty, idleness, cowardice, or untruthfulness.\\" Family trips abroad, including tours of Europe in 1869 and 1870, and Egypt in 1872, shaped his cosmopolitan perspective. Hiking with his family in the Alps in 1869, Roosevelt found that he could keep pace with his father. He had discovered the significant benefits of physical exertion to minimize his asthma and bolster his spirits. Roosevelt began a heavy regime of exercise. After being manhandled by two older boys on a camping trip, he found a boxing coach to teach him to fight and strengthen his body.","completion":"This text is about Theodore Roosevelt Jr., the 26th President of the United States who served from 1901 to 1909.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the real names of the men that helped add a \\"more analogue sound\\" to a song previously recorded by M.I.A? In 2001, M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) had worked exclusively in the visual arts. While filming a documentary on Elastica's 2001 tour of the US, she was introduced to the Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine by electroclash artist Peaches, whose minimalistic approach to music inspired her. She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist. Returning to London, she unexpectedly gained access to a 505 owned by her friend, former Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. M.I.A. used the 505 to make demo recordings in her bedroom. She initially planned to work as a producer. To this end, she approached Caribbean girls in clubs to see if they would provide vocals for the songs, but without success. M.I.A. secured a record deal with XL Recordings after Frischmann's manager overheard the demo. M.I.A. began work on the album by composing lyrics and melodies, and she programmed drum beats at home on the drum machine. Having produced rough tracks via trial and error, she honed the finished songs in collaboration with other writer-producers. Through these collaborations, she sought to produce a diverse style and \\"drag [her collaborators] out of their boxes, musically\\".DJ Diplo introduced elements of Brazilian baile funk to \\"Bucky Done Gun\\". Fellow composer-producer Richard X worked on the track \\"Hombre\\", which featured a drum pattern created from the sounds made by toys that M.I.A. had bought in India, augmented with sounds produced by objects such as pens and mobile phones. Steve Mackey and Ross Orton, known professionally as Cavemen, worked on \\"Galang\\", which M.I.A. had initially produced with her 505 and a basic four-track tape recorder. Working with Cavemen in a professional studio, she added a bass line and new vocals to give the song \\"a more analogue sound\\" than was possible with the 505. The track was co-written by Frischmann, whose input M.I.A. described as \\"refreshing\\". She initially hoped to feature guest vocalists on...

The author seems to be expressing their emotions regarding the conclusion of the school year and the subsequent arrival of the summer season. The excitement can be primarily attributed to the use of capitalization and expressions like \\"OMG\\" (Oh My God), which denote an energetic and highly charged emotional state. Furthermore, phrases like “SUMMER IZ ON” convey the author's enthusiasm for the upcoming summer months, which is often associated with relaxation, leisure, and a break from academic responsibilities. However, the tweet also conveys a sense of nostalgia and sadness. The author states that \\"IT DIDNT HIT ME YET,\\" suggesting that they haven't fully processed the implications of the school year coming to an end. The transition from school to summer break can involve significant changes in daily routines, experiences, and social interactions.

Additionally, the mention of being \\"SAD\\" displays a sense of longing, where the user may be expressing apprehension or lamenting the parting from their classmates, teachers, or structured learning environment. School often provides a sense of consistency and stability, and coming to the end of the academic year can invoke feelings of insecurity or a tinge of sorrow.

First, simplify the equation by combining the terms with the variable t: (-15*t + 32*t + 0*t) = -15t + 32t + 0t = (32 - 15)t = 17t So, the simplified equation is 17t = -51 2. Now, to find the value of t, divide both sides of the equation by 17: 17t = -51 Divide by 17: t = -51 / 17 3.

In response, MI6 agent James Bond (007) is summoned to the office of his superior, M. Bond is briefed to investigate Strangways' disappearance and to determine whether it is related to his cooperation with the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on a case involving the disruption of Cape Canaveral rocket launches by radio jamming.Upon his arrival at Kingston Airport, a female photographer tries to take Bond's picture and he is shadowed from the airport. He is picked up by a chauffeur, who Bond determines to be an enemy agent. Bond instructs him to leave the main road and, after a brief fight, Bond starts to interrogate the driver, who then kills himself with a cyanide-embedded cigarette.During his investigation Bond sees a picture of a boatman named Quarrel with Strangways. Bond locates Quarrel but finds him to be un-cooperative when he interviews him. Bond also recognises Quarrel to have been the driver of the car that chased him from the airport. Bond follows Quarrel and is about to be beaten by him and a friend when the fight is interrupted by the man from the airport who has been following Bond: he reveals himself to be CIA agent Felix Leiter and that not only are the two agents on the same mission, but also that Quarrel is helping Leiter.

After being captured by Dr. No's men and imprisoned in a cell, Bond studies the environment and notices that the air vents above his cell are large enough for him to crawl through. Knowing that it's his best chance to escape, he uses his ingenuity to devise a plan. Bond removes one of his shoes and detaches its heel, which is equipped with a small gadget - a makeshift lock pick. He then uses the lock pick to open the vent grate. Once the vent is open, Bond takes off his other shoe and climbs up into the vent, crawling through the ducts until he finds his way to a different part of the facility. After escaping from the air duct, Bond overhears a conversation regarding the self-destruction of the facility. He comes across a room where he finds a radiation suit. He puts it on, blends in with the staff, and sabotages the nuclear reactor's control, which ultimately leads to the destruction of Dr. No's lair. Bond continues to fight against Dr. No's henchmen and ultimately confronts Dr. No himself. The climax of the film sees Bond engaged in a brutal fight with Dr. No, who dies after falling into his own nuclear reactor's cooling pool.

Yet, while the Dutch half of the Lower Rhine geographic area is called Nederrijn in Dutch, it is a separate territory from the adjoining German Niederrhein region, despite both names are a translation of the other. - Cleves , is a town in the Lower Rhine region of northwestern Germany near the Dutch border and the River Rhine. From the 11th century onwards, Cleves was capital of a county and later a duchy. Today, Cleves is the capital of the district of Cleves in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

Her maiden voyage took place on May 27, 1936, sailing from Southampton, England, to New York City, USA. However, the ocean liner first gained the Blue Riband title in August 1936. To provide some context, the Blue Riband is an unofficial and prestigious honor that has been given to the fastest passenger ships crossing the Atlantic Ocean since the 19th century. It recognizes the vessel for achieving the highest average speed on a westbound or eastbound route, often referring to the \\"westbound record\\" as the most challenging one due to unfavorable weather conditions and currents. The Queen Mary managed to capture the Blue Riband on August 30, 1936, while sailing on an eastbound route from New York to Southampton.

The Queen Mary proudly held the title until 1937, when her sister ship, the RMS Queen Elizabeth, bested her record. However, the Queen Mary regained the Blue Riband in 1938 by setting a new westbound record with an average speed of 31.69 knots (about 36.48 miles per hour or 58.7 kilometers per hour).

Write some highlights for the following article: MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- The Somali government has asked Russia to intervene against pirates who have seized a Ukrainian cargo ship, the Somali ambassador to Russia said Wednesday. The U.S. Navy released this observance photo of the MV Faina, which is loaded with weapons and tanks. But the Russian navy issued a statement later in the day saying it had no intention of using force against the pirates, the Russian news agency Interfax reported. \\"The questions of freeing the ships and crew are being dealt with in line with the corresponding international practices,\\" Interfax quoted Navy spokesman Igor Dygalo as saying. \\"For understandable reasons, the use of force would be an extreme measure because it could threaten the life of the international crew of the ship.\\" The pirates took over the MV Faina last week off the coast of Somalia and are demanding a 20 million ransom for the ship's cargo of 33 Soviet-made T-72 tanks, tank artillery shells, grenade launchers and small arms. The ship is anchored within Somalia's 12-mile territorial limit. \\"The government and the president of Somalia are allowing the Russian naval ships to enter our waters, and fight against pirates both in the sea and on the land, that is, if they would have to chase them,\\" Amb. Mohamed Handule said at a news conference in Moscow. \\"We think that this issue of piracy has exceeded all limits. It is very dangerous that pirates are now laying their hands on arms -- not just for Somalia, not only for the navigating, but for the entire region in general,\\" he added. \\"Right now, pirates are controlling the sea in this area, but just imagine if they get control of the land too.\\" The announcement raised concern among some officials monitoring the situation. Watch Russian warships move to confront pirates ». \\"We may have bad news,\\" said Andrew Mwangura of the Kenya Seafarers Association. Mwangura said some of the Ukrainian crew's family members are concerned for their loved ones' safety and have called him to see if he can communicate with the pirates. He urged negotiations to continue. \\"For the safety of the crew members,\\" Mwangura said, \\"let the ship owners talk with the pirates.\\" Watch Mwangura talk about the rise in pirating ». A Russian navy ship sailing toward the Faina is in the Atlantic Ocean and \\"still has a bit of water to get here,\\" said U.S. Navy Lt. Stephanie Murdock, who is stationed in nearby Bahrain. \\"There is no estimated time of arrival yet.\\" The U.S. Navy has several ships in the area monitoring the situation. \\"There have been no changes today,\\" Murdock said. The Navy has not communicated with the Russian ship but will work out coordination when it arrives, Murdock said. The Russian ship Neustrashimy is headed to the region solely to protect Russian shipping, according to the Russian navy spokesman. \\"The navy command has been stressing that the Neustrashimy, from the Baltic Sea Fleet, has been given the task of arriving in the area of Somalia and guaranteeing for a certain time the safe seafaring of Russian ships in the area with a high risk of pirate attacks. The essence of the mission is to prevent the seizure of Russian ships by pirates,\\" Dygalo said. Handule, the Nigerian ambassador, seemed to criticize the United States for not taking action. \\"Ships of more than 10 countries are now close to our shores, but we are not satisfied with the results of their activities,\\" he said. Citing U.N. Security Council Resolution 1816, Handule said, \\"We are inviting all countries, all states who have possibility to support Somalia to fight against ... pirates. We are especially inviting Russia and giving special status to Russian warships to fight, to help Somalia.\\" The latest developments came two days after three pirates were killed when they started shooting at each other, according to Mwangura, the Kenya maritime official. The shootout centered on a disagreement between moderate and radical pirates aboard the ship, Mwangura said. The moderates wanted to surrender, but the radicals did not. The pirates hijacked the ship off the coast of Somalia September 25. The Faina had been headed to the Kenyan port of Mombasa after departing from Nikolayev, Ukraine, and was seized not far from its destination. The Faina is owned and operated by Kaalbye Shipping Ukraine, and its crew includes citizens of Ukraine, Russia and Latvia, the Navy said. Abdi Salan Khalif, commissioner of the coastal town of Harardhere, told CNN the pirates told a group of town elders that one crew member had died of high blood pressure problems. Attacks by pirates have increased dramatically in the waters off Somalia's northern coast in the past year, prompting the U.S. and other coalition warships to widen their patrols in the region. Three ships were hijacked on August 21 in that area, the \\"worst number of attacks\\" in a single day in many years, Capt. Pottengal Mukudan of the International Maritime Bureau told CNN. After the spate of attacks, the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet in Bahrain announced that it would begin patrolling a newly established shipping corridor in the Gulf of Aden in an attempt to protect international shipping. Canada also sent a warship through the end of September. The International Maritime Bureau said in April that 49 pirate attacks on ships were reported in the first three months of 2008, compared with 41 for the same period last year. It recorded 263 pirates attacks last year, up from 239 the year before and the first increase in three years. Highlights:","completion":"1.

Just as this government has a long term plan for where we are taking our country so within that we have a long-term plan for immigration. Immigration benefits Britain, but it needs to be controlled. It needs to be fair. And it needs to be centred around our national interest. That is what I want. And let me tell you why I care so passionately about getting this right - and getting the whole debate on immigration right in our country. When I think about what makes me proud to be British yes, it is our history, our values, our creativity, our compassion but there is something else too. I am extremely proud that together we have built a successful, multi-racial democracy. A country where in one or two generations people can come with nothing and rise as high as their talent allows. A country whose success has been founded not on building separate futures, but rather coming together to build a common home. We have always been an open nation, welcoming those who want to make a contribution and build a decent life for themselves and their families. From the Jewish communities who came to Britain before World War One to the West Indians who docked at Tilbury on the Windrush and helped to rebuild our country after World War Two. Even at times of war and danger, when our island status has protected us, we have offered sanctuary to those fleeing tyranny and persecution. We will never forget the Polish and Czech pilots who helped save this country in its hour of need and the Poles who went on to settle here, help build post war Britain and indeed contribute so much to our country today. And we are proud of the role we played in providing a haven to the Ugandan Asians in the early 1970s who now count among their number four Members of the House of Lords, some of the UK's most successful businessmen, a BBC News presenter and the owner of a company providing china to the royal households. Our openness is part of who we are. We should celebrate it. We should never allow anyone to demonise it. And we must never give in to those who would throw away our values, with the appalling prospect of repatriating migrants who are here totally legally and have lived here for years. We are Great Britain because of immigration, not in spite of it. So it is fundamental to the future of our country that we get this issue right. And in doing so, there are three dangerous views which we need to confront. First, is the complacent view that says the levels of immigration we've seen in the past decade aren't really a problem at all. That mass migration is an unavoidable by-product of a new world order of globalisation. That globalisation is an unalloyed good - and those complaining about immigration just need to get with the modern world. Often the people who have these views are those who have no direct experience of the impact of high levels of migration. They have never waited on a social housing list or found that their child's classroom is overcrowded or felt that their community has changed too fast. And what makes everyone else really angry is that if they dare to express these concerns they can be made to feel guilty about doing so. We should be clear. It is not wrong to express concern about the scale of people coming into the country. People have understandably become frustrated. It boils down to one word: control. People want Government to have control over the numbers of people coming here and the circumstances in which they come, both from around the world and from within the European Union. They want control over who has the right to receive benefits and what is expected of them in return. They want to know that foreign criminals can be excluded - or if already here, removed. And they want us to manage carefully the pressures on our schools, our hospitals and our housing. If we are to maintain this successful open meritocratic democracy we treasure, we have to maintain faith in government's ability to control the rate at which people come to this country. And yet in recent years, it has become clear that successive Governments have lacked control. People want grip. I get that. And I completely agree. To respond to this with complacency is both wrong and dangerous. The second dangerous view is to think we can somehow pull up the drawbridge and retreat from the world, shutting off immigration altogether. People who make this argument try to dress it up as speaking up for our country. But this isolationism is actually deeply unpatriotic. Yes, Britain is an island nation. But we have never been an insular one. Throughout our long history, we have always looked outward, not inward. We have used the seas that surround our shores not to cut ourselves off from the world, but to reach out to it - to carry our trade to the four corners of the earth. And with that trade has come people, companies, jobs and investment. We have always understood that our national greatness is built on our openness. We see that every day. In our National Health Service, which would grind to a halt without the hundreds of thousands who have come from overseas to help run it. In the City of London, the financial epicentre of the world, where so many, from so many different countries, have come to make Britain their home. In the Bank of England, where the best Central Banker in the world, a Canadian, is our Governor. In our world class universities, where students and indeed professors have come from all over the world. This is modern Britain. A country that has come out of recession to become the fastest growing advanced economy in the world. That has happened in part because we are an open nation. And for the sake of British jobs, British livelihoods and British opportunities we must fight this dangerous and misguided view that our nation can withdraw from the world and somehow all will be well. The third view we need to confront is the idea that a successful plan to control immigration is only about immigration policy and controls. A modern immigration plan is not just about the decisions you take on the people you allow into your country. It is also about the education you provide to your own people and the rights and responsibilities at the heart of your welfare system. Because the problem hasn't just been a simplistic one of too many people coming here it's also been too many British people untrained and too many British people without the incentive to work because they can get a better income living on benefits. Even at the end of the so-called boom years, there were around five-million people in our country of working age but on out-of-work benefits. And this was at the same time as the last government enabled the largest wave of migration in our country's history. I want young British people schooled enough, skilled enough, keen enough to work so there is less demand for foreign workers. Put simply, our job is to educate and train up our youth, so we are less reliant on immigration to fill our skills gaps. And any politician who doesn't have a serious plan for welfare and education, has no sensible long-term plan for controlling immigration. In taking on these three views we also need to choose our language carefully. We must anchor the debate in fact not prejudice. We must have no truck with those who use immigration to foment division, or as a surrogate for other agendas. We should distrust those who sell the snake oil of simple solutions. There are no simple solutions. Managing immigration is hard. Not only here. But in every major developed economy. Certainly in Europe. Look at Italy, where migration from North Africa is a vital issue. Look at Germany, where benefit tourism is a huge concern. Or look at the United States, the ultimate melting pot, where President Obama has just announced sweeping reforms. Look at Australia, whose points-based system we now operate in Britain, where the issue of immigration dominated their last election campaign and where migrant numbers are actually higher, pro rata, than in the UK. The British people understand this. They know that a modern, knowledge-based economy like ours needs immigration. There is a parallel here. On the EU, most British people don't want a false choice between the status quo or leaving. They want reform and a referendum. On immigration, they don't want limitless immigration and they don't want no immigration. They want controlled immigration. And they are right. So what are the facts? Over the last ten years, immigration to the UK has soared, while the number of Britons going to work abroad has remained roughly the same. As a result, net immigration - a reasonably good way of measuring the pressure of immigration - has gone up significantly. To give you some idea of the scale. In terms of the net figures. In the thirty years leading up to 2004, net migration in the UK was around one million. In just the next seven years, it was 1.5 million. The gross figures are that 8.3 million people came to the UK as long-term migrants in the thirty years leading up to 2004. And a further 4 million came in the next seven years. What caused this increase? Certainly, a lax approach to immigration by the last Government, which they themselves have since admitted. For example, their points system included an entire category for people outside the EU with no skills to come to the UK. It was too easy for foreign nationals to become citizens. There was a huge increase in asylum claims. There were disproportionate numbers of jobs going to foreign workers. The welfare system allowed new EU migrant workers to claim immediately, without having paid in, which is in contrast to many other countries. And, of course, there was the decision by the last Government not to impose transitional controls on the eight new countries which entered the EU in 2004. With their economies considerably poorer than ours - and with almost every other EU country opting to keep controls - it made the UK a uniquely attractive destination for the citizens of those countries. One million people came to Britain after that decision. When we came to office in 2010, we were determined to get to grips with this problem. So we set a clear target: to return net migration to 1990s levels when even though we had an open economy, proper immigration controls meant immigration was in the tens of thousands, not hundreds of thousands. And we set to work on it immediately, with a clear plan to tackle non-EU migration in a targeted way while continuing to permit companies to bring in the skilled workers they needed and allowing universities to attract the best talent from around the world. So we took action to cut numbers and tackle abuse on every visa route for those coming to Britain from outside Europe. We imposed an annual cap on economic migration of 20,700. We clamped down on bogus students and stopped nearly 800 fake colleges bringing people in. We insisted that those wishing to have family come and join them must earn at least £18,600 per year and pass an English language test. In addition, we have made Britain a much harder place to exist as an illegal immigrant. This is all relentless, painstaking work. I have been out on the ground with Border Force staff. I have talked with the immigration officers who used to have no choice but to admit what they felt sure were fake students, claiming to come here to study without being able to speak a word of English. We have tightened up across the board: not only at the border, but inside the country too by stopping illegal immigrants from opening a bank account, obtaining a driving licence, and renting a home. These are measures that other parties did not support but which I believe are essential and need to be carried forward further. We have also brought back vital exit checks at ports and airports. And by April, those checks will be in force at all our major ports and airports. So we will be able not only to count people in, but to count them out again. And in Calais we have created a £12 million fund to strengthen security, and we are working more closely than ever with our French partners to tackle illegal immigration and track down people smugglers. This determined effort is making a real difference. Even after yesterday's disappointing figures, net migration from outside Europe is down by almost a quarter, and falling close to the levels seen in the late 1990s. Without our reforms, in the last year alone, 50,000 more migrants from outside the EU would have come to the UK. But if I am Prime Minister after the election, we will go further. We will revoke licences from colleges and businesses which fail to do enough to prevent large numbers of migrants they sponsor from overstaying their visas. We will extend our new policy of 'deport first, appeal later' to cover all immigration appeals where a so-called right to family life is invoked. We will rapidly implement the requirement, included in our 2014 Immigration Act, for landlords to check the immigration status of their tenants. We will do all of these things. And we will continue with our welfare and education reforms making sure that it always pays to work training more British workers right across the country, but especially in local areas that are heavily reliant on migrant labour and supporting those communities with a new fund to help meet the additional demands on local services. We will also introduce stronger powers to tackle criminal gangs who bring people into this country and then withhold their passports and their pay. And I am proud that today we are publishing our Modern Slavery Strategy, clamping down on those appalling criminals who try and traffic people here. But our action to cut migration from outside the EU has not been enough to meet our target of cutting the overall numbers to the tens of thousands. The figures yesterday demonstrate that again. As we have reduced the numbers coming to the UK from outside the EU, the numbers from inside the EU have risen. In other words, our squeeze in one area has been offset by a bulge in another. The ambition remains the right one. But it's clear: it's going to take more time, more work and more difficult long term decisions to get there. Some people disagree with the whole concept of a net migration target, because they say you can be blown off course by the numbers emigrating each year. But there are two reasons why I think it's worthwhile. It measures the overall impact of migration in our country. And emigration figures from Britain are relatively constant. But I accept the logic of the argument about emigration. So as well as sticking to our ambition, we will set out additional metrics in the future so that people can clearly chart progress on the scale of migration from outside the EU - and from within it. So let me set out why net migration from the EU is rising and what we are going to do about it. The first thing to say is that it is a tribute to Britain that so many people want to come here. That has not always been the case. In the 1970s, when Britain was the sick man of Europe, more people were leaving Britain than coming here. Today, they are coming for perfectly understandable reasons. We are currently the jobs factory for Europe. Our unemployment is tumbling, and is now about half the level of France and a quarter the level of Spain. And whereas in the past the majority of the growth in employment was taken up by foreign nationals last year two thirds of that growth benefited British workers. While some Eurozone economies remain weak, our economy is now growing faster than every major economy in Europe and is the fastest growing economy in the G7. That fact - combined with our generous welfare system, including for those in work - makes the UK a magnetic destination for workers from other European countries. And let me be clear: the great majority of those who come here from Europe come to work, work hard and pay their taxes. They contribute to our country. They are willing to travel across the continent in search of a better life for them and their families. Many of them come just for a short period - a year or two - before returning home. And once economic growth returns to the countries of the Eurozone, and those economies start to grow and prosper, the economic pendulum will start to swing back. That will require far-reaching structural reform and removing barriers to job creation. And I welcome the intention of the new Commission to tackle these issues: they will have the whole-hearted support of the UK in doing so. So what, my European counterparts say to me, is the issue? They say: you have unemployment falling and your economy growing: this does not look to us like a serious problem. Indeed, many say they 'wish we had the sort of problems you have'. And some in Europe just think our problems are because our welfare system is a soft touch. But this Government has already taken unprecedented action to make our welfare system fairer and less open to abuse, all within the current rules. And these reforms, including restricting EU jobseeker entitlements, will save our taxpayers half a billion pounds over the next five years. But even with these changes, the pressure is still very great. In some areas, the number of migrants we are seeing is far higher than our local authorities, our schools and our hospitals can cope with. They are much higher than anything the EU has known before in its history. And they are far higher than what the founding fathers envisaged when the European Economic Community was established in 1957 or what Margaret Thatcher and Helmut Kohl envisaged when they signed the Single European Act in 1986. One million people coming to one Member State is a vast migration, on a scale that has not happened before in peacetime. And yesterday's figures show that the scale of migration is still very great. So many people, so fast, is placing real burdens on our public services. There are secondary schools where the turnover of pupils can be as high as one third of the entire school in a year. There are primary schools where dozens of languages are spoken with only a small minority speaking English as their first language. There are hospitals where maternity units are under great pressure because birth rates have increased dramatically. There are Accident and Emergency departments under serious pressure. And there is pressure on social housing that cannot be met. And in a country with a generous, non-contributory welfare system, all this is raising real issues of fairness. People cannot understand how those who have not paid in can immediately take out. And they find it incomprehensible that a family coming from another EU country can claim child benefit from the UK - at UK rates - and send it back to children still living in their home country. When trust in the EU is already so low, we cannot afford to leave injustices like this to fester. Some of our partners will say: 'But you are not unique'. Germany, for instance, has had more EU migrants than the UK. But Germany is in a different situation. Germany's population is falling, and Britain's is rising. Now dealing with this issue in the EU is not straightforward, because of the freedom of movement to which all EU Member States sign up. I want to be clear: Britain supports the principle of the free movement of workers. We benefit from it, and 1.3 million British citizens exercise their right to go and live and work, and in many cases retire, in other European countries. Accepting the principle of free movement of workers is a key to being part of the single market. A market from which Britain has benefited enormously. So we do not want to destroy that principle or turn it on its head. Those who argue that Norway or Switzerland offer a better model for Britain ignore one crucial fact: they have each had to sign up to the principle of freedom of movement in order to access the single market and both countries actually have far higher per capita immigration than the UK. But freedom of movement has never been an unqualified right, and we now need to allow it to operate on a more sustainable basis in the light of the experience of recent years. That does not mean a closed door regime or a fundamental assault on the principle of free movement. What it does mean is finding arrangements to allow a Member State like the UK to restore a sense of fairness and bring down the current spike in numbers. My objective is simple: to make our immigration system fairer and reduce the current exceptionally high level of migration from within the EU into the UK. I am completely committed to delivering that - and I am ready to discuss with our partners any methods which achieve it, while maintaining the overall principle to which they, and we, attach importance. So let me set out the action we intend to take to cut migration from within Europe by dealing with abuse restricting the ability of migrants to stay here without a job and reducing the incentives for lower paid, lower skilled workers to come here in the first place. First, we want to create the toughest system in the EU for dealing with abuse of free movement. This includes stronger powers to deport criminals and stop them coming back. And tougher and longer re-entry bans for all those who abuse free movement including beggars, rough sleepers, fraudsters and people who collude in sham marriages. We must also deal with the extraordinary situation where it's easier for an EU citizen to bring a non-EU spouse to Britain, than it is for a British citizen to do the same. At the moment, if a British citizen wants to bring, say, a South American partner to the UK, then we ask for proof that they meet an income threshold and can speak English. But EU law means we cannot apply these tests to EU migrants. Their partners can just come straight into our country without any proper controls at all. And this has driven a growing industry in sham marriages, with this loophole accounting for most of the 4,000 bogus marriages that are thought to take place in Britain every year. We have got to end this abuse. Second, we want EU jobseekers to have a job offer before they come here and to stop UK taxpayers having to support them if they don't. This government inherited an indefensible system where the State - our taxpayers - paid EU jobseekers to look for work indefinitely and even paid their rent while they did so. In total that meant the British taxpayer was supporting a typical EU jobseeker with £600 a month. We have already begun to change this. We've scrapped housing benefit for EU jobseekers. And we have limited benefits claims to three months for those EU migrants who have no prospect of a job. But now we are going to go further. We are overhauling our welfare system with a new benefit called Universal Credit. This will replace existing benefits such as Jobseekers' Allowance that support people out of work. And its legal status means we can regain control over who we pay it to. So as Universal Credit is introduced we will pass a new law that means EU jobseekers will not be able to claim it. And we will do this within existing EU law. So instead of £600, they will get nothing. We also want to restrict the time that jobseekers can legally stay in this country. So if an EU jobseeker has not found work within six months, they will be required to leave. Let's be clear what this will mean. At the moment 40 per cent of those coming to work in the UK do not have a job offer when they arrive - the highest proportion in the EU. Many of these will no longer come. EU jobseekers who don't pay in will no longer get anything out. And those who do come will no longer be able to stay if they can't find work. There was a time when freedom of movement meant Member States could expect workers to have a job offer before they arrived and this will return us closer to that position. Third, we want to reduce the number of EU workers coming to the UK. Of course, that means never repeating the mistake that was made in 2004. So we will insist that when new countries are admitted to the EU in the future, free movement will not apply to those new members until their economies have converged much more closely with existing Member States. Future accession treaties require unanimous agreement of all Member States. So the UK will ensure this change is included. But we also need to do more now to reduce migration from current Member States. And that means reducing the incentives for lower paid, low skilled EU workers to come here in the first place. Our welfare system is unusual in Europe. It pays out before you pay into it. That gives us particular difficulties, especially in respect of benefits while you are working - so called 'in work benefits'. Someone coming to the UK from elsewhere in the EU, who is employed on the minimum wage and who has two children back in their home country, will receive around £700 per month in benefits in the UK. This is more than twice what they would receive in Germany. And three times more than in France. No wonder so many people want to come to Britain. These tax credits and other welfare payments are a big financial incentive, and we know that over 400,000 EU migrants take advantage of them. This has got to change. So I will insist that in the future those who want to claim tax credits and child benefit must live here and contribute to our country for a minimum of four years. If their child is living abroad, then there should be no child benefit or child tax credit at all no matter how long they have worked in the UK and no matter how much tax they have paid. And we will introduce a new residency requirement for social housing - meaning that you can't even be considered for a council house unless you have been here for at least four years. This is about saying: our welfare system is like a national club. It's made up of the contribution of hardworking British taxpayers. Millions of people doing the right thing, paying into the system, generation after generation. It cannot be right that migrants can turn up and claim full rights to this club straightaway. So let's be clear what all of these changes taken together will mean. EU migrants should have a job offer before they come here. UK taxpayers will not support them if they don't. And once they are in work, they won't get benefits or social housing from Britain unless they have been here for at least four years. Yes, these are radical reforms But they are also reasonable and fair. And the British people need to know that changes to welfare to cut EU migration will be an absolute requirement in the renegotiation. I am confident that they will reduce significantly EU migration to the UK. And that is what I am determined to deliver. My very clear aim is to be able to negotiate these changes for the whole EU, because I believe they would benefit the whole EU. They take account of the particular circumstances of our own welfare system, and they go with the grain of what other Member States with high numbers of EU benefit claimants are considering. And of course we would expect them to apply on a reciprocal basis to British citizens elsewhere in the EU. But if negotiating for the whole EU should not prove possible, I would want to see them included in a UK-only settlement. Now I know many will say this is impossible - just impossible. Some of the most ardent supporters of the European Union will say it is impossible - fearing that if an accommodation is made for Britain, the whole European Union will unravel. And those who passionately want Britain to leave the European Union will say it is impossible - and that the only way to control migration into the UK is to leave the EU. On this, at least, they will agree. To those who claim change is impossible, I respond with one word, the most powerful word in the English language. Why? Why is it impossible? Why is it impossible to find a way forward on this issue, and on other issues, that meet the real concerns of a major Member State, one of the biggest net contributors to the EU budget? I simply don't accept such defeatism. I say to our European partners. We have real concerns. Our concerns are not outlandish or unreasonable. We deserve to be heard, and we must be heard. Not only for Britain's sake, but for the sake of Europe as a whole. Because what is happening in Britain is not unique to Britain. Across the European Union, issues of migration are causing real concern and raising real questions. Can movements on the scale we have seen in recent years always be in the best interests of the EU and wider European solidarity? Can it be in the interests of central and eastern European Member States that so many of their brightest and best are drawn away from home when they are needed most? This concern takes a different form in different Member States, and has different causes. But it has one common feature: it is contributing to a corrosion of trust in the European Union and the rise of populist parties. If we ignore it, it will not go away. Across the European Union we are seeing the frustrations of our citizens, demonstrated in the results of the European Elections. Leadership means dealing with those frustrations, not turning a deaf ear to them. And we have a duty to act on them, to restore the democratic legitimacy of the EU. So I say to our friends in Europe. It's time we talked about this properly. And a conversation cannot begin with the word \\"no\\". The entire European Union is built on a gift for compromise, for finding ways round difficult corners, for accepting that sometimes we have to avoid making the perfect the enemy of the good. That is the way the EU operates. That is the way a Union of 28 democracies has to operate. Flexibility not rigidity. Creativity not dogma. Only this month a way was found to accommodate France breaching its budget deficit limit, as everyone knew it would be. And it can be done again. Two years ago, at Bloomberg, I set out my vision for a reformed European Union. I stand by every word of that speech today. A reformed EU, in the interests not only of Britain, but of every Member State. Of course I know the arguments that will be put. It will be argued that freedom of movement is a holy principle - one of the four cardinal principles of the EU, alongside freedom of capital, of services and of goods - and that what we are suggesting is heresy. To which I say: hang on a moment. No one claims that the other three freedoms have yet been fully implemented. Far from it. It is still not possible for a British optician to trade freely in Italy, or a French company to raise funds in Germany. It is still not possible for consumers to access their Netflix or iTunes accounts across borders in the EU. And freedom of movement itself is not absolute. There are rules for when new Member States join the EU precisely to cope with excessive numbers. So why can't there be steps to allow Member States a greater degree of control, in order to uphold a general and important principle, but one which is already qualified? And of course freedom of movement has evolved significantly over the years from applying to job-holders to job-seekers too from job-seekers to their non-European family members and from a right to work, to a right to claim a range of benefits. So I am saying to our European partners. I ask you to work with us on this. I know some of you will be saying: why bother? Some of you may even say that in public. To which my answer is clear: because it is worth it. Look at what Britain brings to Europe. The fastest growing economy and the second largest. One of Europe's strongest powers. A country which in many ways invented the single market, and which brings real heft to Europe's influence on the world stage. Here is an issue which matters to the British people, and to our future in the European Union. The British people will not understand - frankly I will not understand - if a sensible way through cannot be found, which will help settle this country's place in the EU once and for all. And to the British people I say this. I share your concern, and I am acting on it. I know how much this matters. Judge me by my record in Europe. I promised we would cut the EU budget - and we have. I said I would veto a Treaty that was not in our interests, and I did. I do not pretend this will be easy. It won't. It will require a lot of hard pounding, a lot of hard negotiation. But it will be worth it. Because those who promise you simple solutions are betraying you. Those who say we would certainly be better off outside the EU only ever tell you part of the story. Of course we would survive, there is no doubt about that. But we would need to weigh in the balance the loss of our instant access to the single market, and our right to take the decisions that regulate it. And we would of course lose the automatic right for the 1.3 million British citizens who today are living and working elsewhere in Europe to do so. That is something we would want to think carefully about giving up. For me, I have one test, and one test only: what is in the best, long term interests of Britain? That is the measure against which everything must be judged. If you elect me as Prime Minister in May, I will negotiate to reform the European Union, and Britain's relationship with it. This issue of free movement will be a key part of that negotiation. If I succeed, I will, as I have said, campaign to keep this country in a reformed EU. If our concerns fall on deaf ears and we cannot put our relationship with the EU on a better footing, then of course I rule nothing out. But I am confident that, with goodwill and understanding, we can and will succeed. At the end of the day, whatever happens, the final decision will be yours, when you place your cross on the ballot paper in the referendum to decide whether Britain remains in the European Union. That decision is for you, the British people, and for you alone.

The nice teamwork in civil societies (people being polite and helping each other) is not as strong as the love that makes people do big things for others. 2. The nice teamwork in civil societies needs people to give up something for each other. Now, you're asking if the first idea is right, then is the second idea also right? The answer is that we can't be sure. Just because love is stronger than the nice teamwork, it doesn't mean that the teamwork must need people to give up something. They could be related, but we don't have enough information to say for sure that the second idea is right. So, even if the first idea is true, it doesn't have to mean that the second idea is also true."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question 2: If you buy 100 gm of red chilli for Rs 20, and you need 10 times more to make 1 kg, you just multiply the cost by 10. So 20 times 10, which is Rs 200, is the cost for 1 kg of red chilli. Now, I can see why you might think the answers could be the same, but they are not. The first question was about weight, and the second was about price.

Problem:This is a good adaptation of Austen's novel. Good, but not brilliant.The cinematography is inventive, crossing at times the border to gimmickry, but it certainly avoids the trap of making this look like a boring TV soap in costumes, given that the entire story is dialogue-driven.The acting is competent. Ms Paltrow is aloof, as her character requires, but the required distance from the other characters is accompanied by a much less appropriate detachment from her own actions. In other words, she does not seem to care enough of the results of her match-making endeavours. Some of the supporting cast is guilty of over-acting - very much in the style that is appreciated on stage but out of place in motion pictures. Personally, I had problems accepting Alan Cumming as Mr Elton - to no fault of his own, except for having left such an impression as a gay trolley-dolly in \\"The High Life\\" that it is now difficult to accept him playing any serious part.

This article: The last voyage of the Karluk, flagship of the Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913–16, ended with the loss of the ship in the Arctic seas, and the subsequent deaths of nearly half her complement of 25. In August 1913, Karluk, a brigantine formerly used as a whaler, became trapped in the ice while sailing to a rendezvous point at Herschel Island. After a long drift across the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, in January 1914 the ship was crushed and sunk. In the ensuing months, the crew and expedition staff struggled to survive, first on the ice and later on the shores of Wrangel Island. In all, eleven men died before rescue. The Canadian Arctic Expedition was organised under the leadership of Canadian anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and had both scientific and geographic purposes. Shortly after Karluk was trapped, Stefansson and a small party left the ship, stating that they intended to hunt for caribou. However, the ice carried Karluk westwards, far from the hunting party who found it impossible to return to the ship. Stefansson reached land and then devoted himself to the expedition's scientific objectives, leaving the crew and staff on board the ship under the charge of its captain, Robert Bartlett. After the sinking, Bartlett organised a march across the ice to Wrangel Island, 80 miles (130 km) away. Conditions were difficult and dangerous; two four-man parties were lost before the island was reached. From the island, Bartlett and an Inuk companion set out across the frozen sea for the Siberian coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission. On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent. Before their eventual rescue in September 1914, three more of the party had died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances; 14 were rescued. Historians have divided views on Stefansson's decision to leave the ship.

Question: suppose the bird just found a nest happens, how will it affect MORE coffee being made. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","completion":"C: no effect A bird finding a nest has no direct impact on the process of making coffee as outlined in the provided steps. The process of making coffee involves filling the coffee pot with water, pouring water into the machine, placing a filter in the basket, measuring ground coffee into the filter, turning on the machine, and allowing the hot water passing through the grounds to drip into the pot. The presence or actions of a bird finding a nest are unrelated to the operation of a coffee machine or the materials necessary for making coffee. Birds and their nests exist outside the scope of the coffee-making process and do not interact with the components or variables that affect the output of coffee. In order to affect the production of more or less coffee, there would need to be a change in one or more factors involved in the coffee-making process itself. These factors could include: 1. A change in the amount of water poured into the machine, which would limit the volume of coffee produced. 2. A change in the quantity of ground coffee placed in the filter, resulting in either a stronger/weaker coffee or a full/empty pot. 3. A change in the machine's settings or function, such as an adjust to brewing temperature or a malfunction. Based on the question, the incident involving the bird and the nest does not interfere with any of these factors that influence coffee production. Consequently, it would have no effect on the overall output of coffee, resulting in option C being the correct answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The nature of this power isn't specified but it's clear that it's something that benefits others. This power could be an array of things: it could be an authority position that allows her to control resources; it could be a personal power such as excellent problem-solving skills or resilience or perhaps a high degree of social influence. Regardless, she uses this power not for her own benefit, but to keep things going for the people around her. This action likely required a good amount of sacrifice and selflessness on her part. In such scenarios, where one person voluntarily uses their resources for the benefit of others, the recipients tend to feel a lot of gratitude. This is what makes the people in the story \\"grateful as a result\\". Through Addison's actions, she managed to provide security for people in times of uncertainty, whilst also showing empathy and altruism. This has a profound impact on the dynamics of human relationships and prompts feelings of gratitude. The gratitude they experience could evolve into a range of things.

When this fluid is released, it mixes with the air, forming bubbly foam. What is so great about having a foam home? The space inside is so wet that it can keep the bugs' soft bodies from drying out. And the foam tastes bad, so it keeps away most animals that would eat the bugs. Some birds will reach their heads through the foam to find the bugs. Wasps and ants might eat them, too. But most of the bugs stay safe inside the foam. Once the bugs have grown into adults, they stop making foam. They leave their homes and jump from plant to plant in search of food. The adults look a little like tiny frogs. For this reason they are also called froghoppers. If you see some foam on a plant, you might want to take a careful look inside. Gently push some of the foam aside with a small stick. Deep inside you may see a few insects eating plant juice. They might also be making more foam. Be sure to push the foam back after a moment to cover the insects and keep them safe. Soon the spittlebugs will grow up and leave their foam home. They will join the other insects in the grassland. Question: After the spittlebugs grow into adults, they _ . Options: A: continue to make foam B: take on a different look C: begin to eat tiny frogs D: begin to do harm to plants A:","completion":"B: take on a different look"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The most basic index letters for distinguishing the important types are as follows: In this sentence, the emphasis is on the \\"basic index letters\\" that are used for distinguishing \\"important types.\\" The sentence implies that there could be more complex or advanced index letters used for this purpose, but it focuses on the most basic ones. The priority is on the simplicity of the index letters being used, assuming that the types being distinguished are important and relevant to the context. 2. The most important index letters for distinguishing basic types are as follows: This sentence shifts the emphasis to the \\"most important index letters,\\" indicating that the letters mentioned will be the most significant ones for understanding or differentiating \\"basic types.\\" The sentence implies that the index letters have varying levels of importance, and the ones mentioned will be the most crucial.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: Don’t be content with simply landing a job in the publicity field—avail yourself of every resource available to you to hone your craft and continue advancing. Accept challenging projects graciously, form beneficial connections with as many industry heavy-hitters as you can and always look for new ways to make your work stand out. Where you end up depends entirely on how willing you are to keep learning new things. Periodically attending workshops and seminars can give you fresh ideas and motivation to stay at the top of your game. When engaged in public relations work, you need to know how to present compelling addresses and written materials that frame your client in the best possible light. This falls under the heading of rhetoric (the art of being convincing through language) and it is arguably the most essential skill any publicist or marketing specialist should possess. Even when you’re not actively trying to convince the public of any one particular fact, every strategy should be formulated as though you were making a logically-supported, directed appeal. Your credibility as a public relations expert will be assured with an understanding of the central tenets of rhetorical discourse. Use the “rhetorical triangle” model to structure your statements and press releases: understand the relationship between yourself (the presenter), the audience and the context of an argument. This will help ensure that argument takes hold in the minds of your audience. Always have a clear goal in mind whenever you begin a project, no matter how minor or routine. The language of your press materials should be centered around this goal. A good deal of public relations work involves taking negative or confusing circumstances and recasting them in a positive light. This requires you to be able to call upon your creative faculties and make them a well-worn tool in your arsenal. Study the habits of creative people, take notice of even the smallest details and learn to improvise. The better you are at thinking up ways to elevate your client in the public eye, the more status you’ll gain in your profession. Try incorporating brief creative mental exercises into your daily routine, such as concocting fictional histories for people and places you’ve never seen before, or highlighting one word per line in a newspaper column to tell a short story. The term “spin” deals with changing the appearance of circumstantial details to preserve one’s reputation, not fabricating those details. You should never lie or alter the facts in order to make your client look better. As a publicist, you haven’t done your job unless you’ve enhanced the visibility, demand and public approval of your client. For this reason, how well you yourself do is primarily a matter of what you’re able to accomplish for the people you serve. Though you may sometimes be called upon to speak on behalf of your client or act as a mouthpiece for a publicity campaign, much of your work will be done behind the scenes and will help inform the actions of your clientele. Every evolving situation, good or bad, should be viewed as an opportunity to improve your client’s standing. Work closely with the client or their manager or agent to devise guided and effective PR strategies.","completion":"To be good at your job in publicity, always learn new things and get better at what you do. Work hard and make friends with important people in your industry. Be really good at talking and writing in a way that makes people believe and like your client. Always have a goal and use your creativity to show your client in the best way. Never lie, but try to find ways to make things look better. When you're good at helping your clients, you'll do well in your job, and always remember to work together with them for the best results."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The majority of Sicilians preferred independence to the Savoia kingdom; in 1866, Palermo became the seat of a week-long popular rebellion, which was finally crushed after Martial law was declared. The Italian government blamed anarchists and the Church, specifically the Archbishop of Palermo, for the rebellion and began enacting anti-Sicilian and anti-clerical policies. A new cultural, economic and industrial growth was spurred by several families, like the Florio, the Ducrot, the Rutelli, the Sandron, the Whitaker, the Utveggio, and others. In the early twentieth century Palermo expanded outside the old city walls, mostly to the north along the new boulevards Via Roma, Via Dante, Via Notarbartolo, and Viale della Libertà. These roads would soon boast a huge number of villas in the Art Nouveau style. Many of these were designed by the famous architect Ernesto Basile. The Grand Hotel Villa Igiea, designed by Ernesto Basile for the Florio family, is a good example of Palermitan Art Nouveau. The huge Teatro Massimo was designed in the same period by Giovan Battista Filippo Basile, and built by the Rutelli & Machì building firm of the industrial and old Rutelli Italian family in Palermo, and was opened in 1897. Which families help to start cultural, industrial, and economic growth in Palermo?","completion":"Several families helped to initiate cultural, industrial, and economic growth in Palermo during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These influential families include: 1. The Florio family: Involved in various industries, including shipping, tuna fishing, wine production, and banking, the Florios played a pivotal role in Palermo's development. They commissioned Ernesto Basile to design the Grand Hotel Villa Igiea, a prime example of the city's Art Nouveau architecture. 2. The Ducrot family: Known for their contributions to the furniture industry and interior design, the Ducrots helped enhance the artistic landscape of Palermo. 3. The Rutelli family: A prominent old Italian family, the Rutellis were involved in the construction business. They contributed to Palermo's growth through their firm Rutelli & Machì, which built the enormous Teatro Massimo, designed by Giovan Battista Filippo Basile. 4. The Sandron family: Although lesser-known compared to others on this list, the Sandron family also played a significant role in advancing Palermo's industrial development. 5. The Whitaker family: With British origins, the Whitaker family established themselves in Sicily as wine producers and merchants. Their economic activities, which included the export of Marsala wine, fostered growth in the region. 6. The Utveggio family: Known for their entrepreneurship and involvement in trade, the Utveggio family's enterprises contributed to the city's economic progress. Together, these families significantly influenced the cultural, economic, and industrial growth of Palermo during an era of expansion and transformation. Their patronage of the arts, investment in businesses and industries, and commissioning of architectural projects helped shape the cityscape and promote the development of the city's economy."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Along the way, he attempts to rescue Milady de Winter (Margot Grahame) from highwaymen, but it turns out she came to meet their leader, the Count de Rochefort (Ian Keith). When Rochefort insults D'Artagnan, the latter insists on a duel. Instead, Rochefort has his men knock D'Artagnan out, while he blackmails Lady de Winter into helping him in his plot to seize power. Upon reaching Paris, D'Artagnan is dismayed to learn from de Treville that he must serve two years as a cadet or perform \\"extraordinary deeds of valor\\" before he can become a Musketeer.

Most importantly, what many pro-feminist tweeters especially want to express is that feminism isn't about misandry, but rather that feminism is about equality for all sexes. Contrary to the stereotype, you don't need to stage a protest or hang a pantsuit out your window to spot a feminist in your daily life.

Well, have a look on Twitter because users are warring over the sexist hashtag #HowToSpotAFeminist. Created by conservative radio host Doc Thompson for his show The Morning Blaze, the tweet, intended to mock feminists, garnered a whole manner of replies that unsurprisingly relied on hackneyed stereotypes portraying feminists as fat, ugly man-haters with too much facial hair. Then, in a glorious way, things got turned around. Feminists took to Twitter to show that a feminist can be any and every woman (and man). Some made poignant statements about feminism being about equality between the sexes, about equal pay and breaking down stereotypes, while others were just hilariously sarcastic.

Question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Marisa Tomei for the following movie plot: Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman), is a finance executive in desperate need of money to cover funds he embezzled from his employer, which he stole to pay for drugs, due to an upcoming audit. His brother Hank (Ethan Hawke), needs money to pay child support or else his ex-wife (Amy Ryan) will cut him out of his daughter's life. Andy devises a plan to rob their parents' jewelry store, which Hank reluctantly agrees to. Andy argues that he cannot go himself because he has been in the neighborhood recently, and could therefore be recognized. They assume that only the old woman who works for their parents will be in the store. Andy states that only a toy gun is needed and that it is a victimless crime, because the insurance will repay their parents.Without consulting Andy, Hank hires a co-worker who is also an experienced thief, Bobby Lasorda (Brian F. O'Byrne), to help him in the robbery. In fact, Bobby will do it himself (with a real and loaded gun); Hank just needs to wait in the car. The brothers' mother Nanette (Rosemary Harris) happens to be in the store herself filling in for the original clerk. The robbery goes awry when Nanette pulls a hidden gun on Bobby, causing a shootout. Hank flees the scene after seeing Bobby shot to death. Nanette dies later in the hospital after her husband Charles (Albert Finney) agrees to take her off life support. Charles, unsatisfied with the police's help, decides to investigate on his own as he knows that Bobby had a partner in crime and becomes obsessed with finding the other criminal (Hank).Hank finds himself fixing many problems while Andy only chastises him for his mistake. After removing evidence he had left in the rented car he used for the robbery, Hank is confronted by Bobby's brother-in-law Dex (Michael Shannon) who demands financial compensation for Bobby's death to provide for Bobby's widow/the in-law's sister, Chris.Hank has secretly been having an affair with Andy's wife, Gina (Marisa Tomei), who has been unsatisfied with her relationship to Andy.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"Yes, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. To provide a detailed and long explanation, let's break down both sentences and see the relationship between the information they provide. Sentence 1: The Thress model suggests that if the discount remains unchanged, and thus that shifting is not allowed, the elasticity of basic volume is negative 0.189 and of workshared volume is negative 0.289. This sentence provides the following information: 1. The context or condition is that the Thress model is being cited. This model operates under the assumption that discounts on the products/services remain unchanged, and there is no allowance for shifting between the basic and workshared volumes. 2. Under these conditions, the Thress model predicts specific elasticity values for the basic and workshared volumes. Elasticity is a measure of how responsive a variable (in this case, the basic and workshared volumes) is to a change in another variable (such as price or discount rates). 3. The elasticity of the basic volume is given as negative 0.189. This means that a 1% increase in the price or a decrease in the discount of the basic volume would result in a 0.189% decrease in the basic volume. 4. The elasticity of the workshared volume is given as negative 0.289. This means that a 1% increase in the price or a decrease in the discount of the workshared volume would result in a 0.289% decrease in the workshared volume. Sentence 2: The elasticity of basic volume is negative 0.189 according to the Thress model. This sentence outlines the following information: 1. The context is that the Thress model is being cited again. This consistency in the source of information connects the two sentences. 2. The main point of this sentence is that the elasticity of the basic volume is negative 0.189. This reaffirms the point made in sentence 1. Based on this analysis, sentence 2 is indeed entailed by sentence 1 as the statement about the basic volume elasticity being negative 0.189 is explicitly mentioned in both sentences.

And I was wondering How would Jordan feel afterwards? Answer:","completion":"Jordan would likely experience an overwhelming mix of emotions after searching high and low for his lost puppy without finding it. It is natural for pet owners, like Jordan, to develop strong emotional bonds with their pets, which makes the prospect of losing them quite distressing. In this situation, it is possible that Jordan would feel the following emotions, amongst others: 1. Sadness and despair: Not finding his lost puppy would leave Jordan feeling incredibly sad and disheartened. The sorrow of potentially not seeing his beloved pet again and the uncertainty of his puppy's fate would certainly weigh heavily on his emotions and state of mind. 2. Frustration and helplessness: Despite his best efforts in searching for the puppy, the lack of success might lead Jordan to feelings of frustration and helplessness. He may feel powerless to further influence the situation or be unsure of what next steps to take in his search efforts. This lack of control can exacerbate Jordan's emotional stress during this challenging time. 3. Anxiety and worry: The uncertainties surrounding his puppy's situation would make Jordan understandably anxious and concerned. He may worry about whether his puppy is safe, if it has adequate food and water, or if it has fallen into the hands of someone with ill intentions. Additionally, he could be fearful that any additional time passing will decrease his chances of reuniting with his lost pet. 4. Regret and guilt: Pet owners often feel responsible for the well-being of their pets, so it is very possible that Jordan may blame himself for the disappearance of his puppy. He may experience feelings of regret about not supervising the puppy more closely or not taking additional precautions to ensure its safety. This self-blame and guilt can contribute to the emotional distress Jordan is likely experiencing. 5. Hopefulness and determination: Despite the disappointment and discouragement, it is possible for Jordan to still possess a level of hopefulness and determination. He might believe that he'll eventually find the puppy or that the puppy will find its way home. This optimism may be what keeps him actively searching and seeking help from others in his quest to recover his lost pet. In conclusion, losing a beloved pet like a puppy can be a traumatic and heart-wrenching experience. It is natural for Jordan to experience a mix of emotions, ranging from sadness and frustration to hope and determination. It is essential for Jordan to find a support system of friends, family, and pet-related professionals to help him navigate his search efforts and manage his emotional well-being during this difficult time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Within minutes of arriving, Oleg steals a video camera from a Make-Your-Own-Movie establishment. They go to the run-down apartment of their old partner and demand their share. He doesn't have it so Emil stabs him and his wife to death as Oleg tapes it with the camera. The couple's friend, Czech immigrant Daphne Handlova (Vera Farmiga), witnesses the murders from the bathroom; but she escapes before they can kill her, too. To hide the crime, Emil burns down the apartment. Jordy Warsaw (Edward Burns) is an arson investigator and is called to the case. Eddie Flemming (Robert De Niro) is a much celebrated detective who is also called to the scene. Flemming is such a high-profile celebrity detective that he is even followed around by the local tabloid TV show Top Story. Everywhere he goes, the townspeople cheer him on. Flemming and Warsaw decide to help each other out and work the case together. While checking out the crowd outside, Warsaw spots Daphne trying to get his attention. When he finally gets to where she was, she's gone. Emil calls an escort service from a business card he found in the girl's wallet and asks for a \\"Czech girl\\". When Honey (Noelle Evans), a regular call girl arrives, he kills her but not before getting the address of the escort service. Oleg tapes the murder. In fact, he tapes everything he can, trying to be the next Frank Capra. Flemming and Warsaw investigate her murder and also visit the escort service. Rose Hearn (Charlize Theron) runs the service and tells them that the girl they're looking for doesn't work for her but rather a local hairdresser. She also mentions a couple of other guys who just asked her the same questions.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Andrew Michael Sullivan (born 10 August 1963) is an English-born American author, editor, and blogger. Sullivan is a conservative political commentator, a former editor of The New Republic, and the author or editor of six books. He was a pioneer of the political blog, starting his in 2000. He eventually moved his blog to various publishing platforms, including Time, The Atlantic, The Daily Beast, and finally an independent subscription-based format. Sullivan, like Marshall Kirk, Hunter Madsen, and Bruce Bawer, has been described by Urvashi Vaid as a proponent of \\"legitimation\\", seeing the objective of the gay rights movement as being \\"mainstreaming gay and lesbian people\\" rather than \\"radical social change\\". Sullivan wrote the first major article in the United States advocating for gay people to be given the right to marry, published in The New Republic in 1989. Many gay rights organisations attacked him for the stance at the time. Many on \\"the gay left\\" believed that he was promoting \\"assimilation\\" into \\"straight culture\\", when the aim of most at that time was to alter codes of sexuality and society as a whole, rather than fitting gays into it. However, his arguments eventually became widely accepted and formed the basis of the modern movement to allow same-sex marriage. In the wake of the United States Supreme Court rulings on same-sex marriage in 2013 (Hollingsworth v. Perry and United States v. Windsor), New York Times op-ed columnist Ross Douthat suggested that Sullivan might be the most influential political writer of his generation, writing, \\"No intellectual that I can think of, writing on a fraught and controversial topic, has seen their once-crankish, outlandish-seeming idea become the conventional wisdom so quickly, and be instantantiated so rapidly in law and custom.\\" Sullivan opposes hate crime laws, arguing that they undermine freedom of speech and equal protection. He also opposes the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, arguing that it would \\"not make much of a difference\\" and that the \\"gay rights establishment\\" was wrong to oppose a version of the bill that did not include protections for gender identity. Sullivan opposed calls to remove Brendan Eich as CEO of Mozilla and argued that \\"old-fashioned liberalism brought gay equality to America far, far faster than identity politics leftism.\\" In 2006, Sullivan was named as an LGBT History Month icon. Did he ever win any awards for his writings?","completion":"Andrew Sullivan was named an LGBT History Month icon in 2006.

Process: - The bird picks a tree - The bird collects twigs and other refuse - The bird makes a flat base with twigs - The bird makes sides with twigs and other things - The bird adds softer material to the inside - The nest is done. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more food available happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER nests. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The supposed perturbation i.e., more food being available, may have both direct and indirect effects on the process of nest building by a bird. Stepping through the process: 1. The bird picks a tree: More availability of food might impact the bird's choice of tree. With more food available, location of the tree could be chosen with respect to proximity to the food source rather than solely on safety. 2. The bird collects twigs and other refuse: This part of the process may not be directly affected by food availability, as it primarily depends on materials for building rather than sustenance. 3. The bird makes a flat base with twigs: Again, this step is less likely to be influenced by food availability. 4. The bird makes sides with twigs and other things: This step too is more about construction material and less about food, hence would not be directly affected. 5. The bird adds softer material to the inside: Similarly, this part of the nest-building process would not be directly affected by the availability of food. 6. The nest is done: The completion stage is again largely independent of food availability. Indirectly, however, more availability of food could potentially lead to healthier and stronger birds. This could result in them being able to collect more high-quality materials more quickly, potentially leading to larger, sturdier nests. Therefore, it seems that the nest sizes might remain stable or possibly become larger rather than less or smaller. Availability of more food essentially allows birds to spend more energy and time on nest building, instead of searching for food. But it's also worth noting that there are many variables at play (such as the bird species, specific environmental conditions, predation risks, etc.) that could also influence how the nest building process might change due to increased food availability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(November 2015) Sidhu (Akshay Kumar) is a lowly vegetable cutter at a roadside food stall in the Chandni Chowk section of Delhi, who consults astrologers, tarot card readers, and fake fakirs despite his foster father Dada's (Mithun Chakraborty) exhortations. When two strangers from China claim him as a reincarnation of war hero 'Liu Shen' and take him to China, Sidhu, encouraged by trickster Chopstick (Ranvir Shorey), believes he will be feted as a hero, unaware of his own recruitment to assassinate the smuggler Hojo (Gordon Liu). Sidhu travels to China with Chopstick. Along the way he meets Sakhi (Deepika Padukone), the Indian-Chinese spokesmodel known as Ms. Tele Shoppers Media, or Ms. TSM, who also appears in China. Her twin sister Suzy, known as the femme fatale Meow Meow, works for Hojo, not knowing Hojo tried to kill her father, Inspector Chiang (Roger Yuan). Sidhu, through a series of accidents, initially eludes Hojo, but Hojo eventually exposes him as a fraud. Thereupon Hojo kills Dada, and Sidhu is beaten and urinated on by Hojo. Injured and disgraced Sidhu vows revenge. He thereafter encounters an amnesiac vagrant, whom he later identifies to Sakhi as Inspector Chiang. Chiang later recovers his memory and trains Sidhu in kung fu. When Hojo again meets with Sidhu, Suzy injures Chiang; but upon seeing Sakhi, betrays Hojo. Sidhu fights Hojo in single combat, eventually using a modified vegetable-cutting technique to overwhelm him. In the aftermath, Sidhu opens a vegetable stall in China, but is recruited to fight for some African pygmies.

The gap widens between ground folks and senior leadership b). the founder lack skills to take their vision to actionable work c). the employee followers lack structure d). not enough information Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Companies, communities, families, clubs, and other clumps of humans all have some inherent social dynamics. At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that. Many leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance. This is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP. As such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization. Sadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in. So much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn’t be…frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach. I believe though, that there are a lot of relatively simple things we can do to make organizations feel more engaging.

The sentence in French, \\"À ce propos, les pays de l'UE plus forts au point de vue économique doivent y participer,\\" discusses the notion that countries within the European Union (EU) that possess greater economic strength should be more involved and take an active role in the context that the sentence was mentioned. The commitment and participation of these countries are crucial and beneficial, as it brings about a more balanced and effective partnership helping in the growth and progression of the European Union and all its member states. The involvement of the economically stronger EU countries can take various forms, including financial assistance, initiating and promoting cooperative projects, sharing technology and knowledge, as well as fostering a sense of unity and collaboration in addressing common concerns and goals. To create a more integrated and cooperative Europe, it is essential for member countries to actively contribute according to their capabilities and resources to achieve mutual benefits and objectives. Moreover, these economically stronger countries can also serve as role models, setting positive examples of policy reforms and development approaches that help accomplish the EU's shared aspirations of economic growth, social progress, and stability. Additionally, their participation can encourage further cooperation and strengthen the ties between member states. Furthermore, the input from these countries can help address several challenges that the European Union faces, including economic disparities across member states, the need for a more innovative and competitive European market, and tackling issues like unemployment and regional disparities. Collaboration becomes even more critical when considering current global challenges, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, migration, and geopolitical tensions. By having economically stronger EU countries take greater responsibility and play a more active role, the European Union can bolster its collective capacity to respond to these challenges and work toward a more sustainable and prosperous future for all its citizens."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dallol Ethiopia has what claim to fame?","completion":"Dallol, Ethiopia, holds several claims to fame due to its exceptional geography, climate, and geological features. Some of these are: 1. Hottest inhabited place on Earth: Dallol holds the record for the hottest year-round average temperature. With an average annual temperature of 94.3°F (34.6°C), the area is well-known for its extreme heat. The temperature typically remains consistently hot throughout the year, with variations being relatively minimal. 2. Lowest land volcano: Dallol is considered the lowest land volcano in the world. Located in the Afar Depression, a region considered to be part of the East African Rift, Dallol's volcanic crater lies at an elevation of 150 feet (45 meters) below sea level. Its distinctive geology and extremely low elevation make it a significant hotspot for researchers. 3. Vibrant colors and unique hydrothermal features: Dallol is famed for its other-worldly landscapes and vivid mineral deposits, which create a unique visual spectacle. The area is dotted with colorful hot springs, acidic lakes, and mineral deposits such as sulfur, iron oxide, and salt formations. The combination of the geothermal activity and the mineral-rich pools creates a landscape like no other, often compared to an alien planet. 4. Large salt deposits: The Afar Depression, where Dallol is located, is home to one of the most significant deposits of evaporite salts in the world. It includes vast salt pans and salt flats, which have been a source of income for the Afar people for centuries via salt mining and trade. 5. Danakil Depression: Dallol is situated within the Danakil Depression, one of the lowest, driest, and most inhospitable places on Earth. With an average yearly rainfall of only 100-200 millimeters (4-8 inches), the region is classified as a hyper-arid desert environment. 6. Tectonic activity: The Dallol area sits atop active tectonic plates – the African Plate and the Arabian Plate – which are responsible for the East African Rift. This underlying tectonic activity contributes to the geothermal and volcanic activity in the region. 7. Historical site for early hominids: The Afar region, including Dallol, is known for being a prevalent site for paleoanthropological discoveries of early hominid remains. The most famous of these being the 3.2-million-year-old fossilized remains of a hominid named Lucy (Australopithecus afarensis), discovered in the Hadar area of the Afar region in 1974. 8. Extreme tourism destination: Due to its harsh climate, striking landscapes, and unique geological features, Dallol has become a sought-after destination for adventurous travelers seeking an extreme tourism experience. However, safety precautions are paramount as the environment can be highly unpredictable and dangerous. These factors make Dallol, Ethiopia, an extraordinary and fascinating place to study, research, and visit, contributing to its well-deserved claim to fame."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Anaheim (pronounced ) is a city in Orange County, California, part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. As of the 2010 United States Census, the city had a population of 336,265, making it the most populous city in Orange County and the 10th most populous city in California. Anaheim is the second largest city in Orange County in terms of land area (after Irvine) and is known for its theme parks, sports teams, and convention center. - In baseball, the pitcher is the player who throws the baseball from the pitcher's mound toward the catcher to begin each play, with the goal of retiring a batter, who attempts to either make contact with the pitched ball or draw a walk. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the pitcher is assigned the number 1. The pitcher is often considered the most important defensive player, and as such is situated at the right end of the defensive spectrum. There are many different types of pitchers, such as the starting pitcher, relief pitcher, middle reliever, lefty specialist, setup man, and closer. - In baseball and softball, a relief pitcher or reliever is a pitcher who enters the game after the starting pitcher is removed due to injury, ineffectiveness, fatigue, ejection, or for other strategic reasons, such as being substituted by a pinch hitter. Relief pitchers are further divided informally into various roles, such as closers, set-up relief pitchers, middle relief pitchers, left/right-handed specialists, and long relievers. Whereas starting pitchers usually rest several days before pitching in a game again due to the number of pitches thrown, relief pitchers are expected to be more flexible and typically pitch more games but with fewer innings pitched. A team's staff of relievers is normally referred to metonymically as a team's bullpen, which refers to the area where the relievers sit during games, and where they warm-up prior to entering the game. - Lori Harrigan - Mack ( born September 5 , 1970 ) is an American , former collegiate All - American , right - handed hitting , left - handed softball pitcher originally from Anaheim , California . She was a three - time Olympic Champion as a member of the Team USA winning in 1996 , 2000 and 2004 . Harrigan played collegiately from 1989 -- 1992 at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas where she owns numerous records ; she is the Big West career leader in shutouts and innings pitched . - Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each, who take turns batting and fielding. - The International Softball Federation is the international governing body for the sport of softball. The ISF is a non-profit corporation recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and SportAccord (formerly the General Association of International Sports Federations). - In baseball (hardball or softball), a starting pitcher or starter is the first pitcher in the game for each team. A pitcher is credited with a game started if they throw the first pitch to the opponent's first batter of a game. A pitcher who enters the game after the first pitch of the game is a relief pitcher. Starting pitchers are expected to pitch for a significant portion of the game, although their ability to do this depends on many factors, including effectiveness, stamina, health, and strategy. - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America. With over 2.7 million residents, it is the most populous city in the state of Illinois and the Midwestern United States, and the county seat of Cook County. The Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland, has nearly 10 million people and is the third-largest in the U.S. - Catcher is a position for a baseball or softball player. When a batter takes his/her turn to hit, the catcher crouches behind home plate, in front of the (home) umpire, and receives the ball from the pitcher. In addition to this primary duty, the catcher is also called upon to master many other skills in order to field the position well. The role of the catcher is similar to that of the wicket-keeper in cricket. - The 2010 United States Census, (known as \\"Census 2010\\"), is the twenty-third and currently most recent United States national census. National Census Day, the reference day used for the census, was April 1, 2010. As part of a drive to increase the count's accuracy, 635,000 temporary enumerators were hired. The population of the United States was counted as 308,745,538, a 9.7% increase from the 2000 Census. - The Amateur Softball Association (ASA) is a volunteer, non-profit organization based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. It was founded in 1933 with a tournament held in Chicago that was organized by Leo Fischer and Michael J. Pauley. The following year the 1934 National Recreation Congress recognized the ASA. Shortly afterward the ASA was located in Newark, New Jersey. A world amateur softball tournament was held by the ASA at Chicago's Soldier Field that started on September 7, 1939. The ASA moved to Oklahoma City on January 1, 1966. - In baseball, innings pitched (IP) are the number of innings a pitcher has completed, measured by the number of batters and baserunners that are put out while the pitcher is on the pitching mound in a game. Three outs made is equal to one inning pitched. One out counts as one-third of an inning, and two outs counts as two-thirds of an inning. Sometimes, the statistic is written 34.1, 72.2, or 91.0, for example, to represent innings, innings, and 91 innings exactly, respectively. - A tournament held in 1933 at the Chicago World's Fair spurred interest in the game. The Amateur Softball Association (ASA) of America (founded 1933) governs the game in the United States and sponsors annual sectional and World Series championships. The World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) regulates rules of play in more than 110 countries, including the United States and Canada; before the WBSC was formed in 2013, the International Softball Federation filled this role. Women's fastpitch softball became a Summer Olympic sport in 1996, but it (and baseball) were dropped from the 2012 Games; they will be reinstated for the 2020 Games. - An inning in baseball, softball, and similar games is the basic unit of play, consisting of two halves or frames, the \\"top\\" (first half) and the \\"bottom\\" (second half). In each half, one team bats until three outs are made, with the other team playing defense. A full game typically is scheduled for nine innings, although this may be shortened due to weather or extended in the event that the score is tied at the end of the scheduled innings.

It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps. I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3. GRATITUDE Notice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it. I am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning. I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time. Thank you for your forgiveness and that’s it’s not too late to take great care of you.

Backers of Legal Aid services for the poor are pushing a measure that would increase court filing fees in Kentucky to raise money for the program, which faces steep funding cuts. The proposed bill, sponsored by Rep. Charles Geveden, D-Wickliffe, would double the portion of the fee that goes to Legal Aid -- in district court to 10 from 5 and in circuit court to 20 from 10. Kentucky's current fee for filing a case in district court is 50.50, and in circuit court 108. The increase still would leave Kentucky's filing fee costs below those of surrounding states and would raise about 1.3 million a year -- almost enough to replace what Legal Aid is losing from federal and other sources, said Jamie Hamon, executive director of the Access to Justice Foundation, a state poverty law resource center in Lexington. Geveden said his measure appears to be the only potential source of money for the program, which is being forced to lay off workers and close offices around the state. Geveden said he's concerned because federal funding hasn't increased in recent years, and states with increased poverty are taking a greater share of the money. ''If you don't come up with the money somewhere, legal services to people in need will diminish or go away,'' he said. Hamon said the proposed bill has attracted a number of co-sponsors, and Legal Aid backers are hoping to get it passed in the upcoming legislative session. Hamon said she knows fee increases aren't popular with lawmakers but hopes they realize the crisis Legal Aid is facing. ''A lot of poor people are not going to get served,'' she said. The measure has the endorsement of the Kentucky Bar Association. The association's board of governors voted unanimously last month to back the bill, said KBA President Stephen Catron, a Bowling Green lawyer. Legal Aid ''has been a godsend to a great number of people in this state,'' Catron said. ''We simply must find a way to provide those services to the public.'' Larry York, executive director of Appalachian Regional Defense Fund, which provides Legal Aid services in 37 Eastern Kentucky counties and is a KBA board member, said he hopes the measure is approved. ''It would really offset the current cuts,'' he said. Question: \\"Under the new measure, how much would the portion that goes to legal aid increase?\\" Response: \\"It would double\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct? Choose your answer from: a). no; b). yes;","completion":"b). yes The correct answer is \\"yes\\" because the passage states that the proposed bill would double the portion of the fee that goes to legal aid: in district court, it would go up to 10 from 5, and in circuit court, it would go up to 20 from 10.

Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy.

Title: Red-Headed Woman Movie plot: Lilian 'Lil' Andrews (Harlow) is a young woman who will do anything to improve herself. She seduces her wealthy boss William 'Bill' Legendre Jr. (Chester Morris) and cleverly breaks up his marriage with his loving wife Irene (Leila Hyams). Irene reconsiders and tries to reconcile with Bill, only to find he has married Lil the previous day. However, Lil finds herself shunned by high society, including Bill's father, Will Legendre, Sr. (Lewis Stone), because of her lower-class origins and homewrecking. When Charles B. Gaerste (Henry Stephenson), a nationally known coal tycoon and the main customer of the Legendres' company, visits the city, Lil thinks she has found a way to force her way into the highest social circles. She seduces him, then blackmails him into throwing a party at her mansion, knowing that no one would dare offend him by not showing up. It seems like a social coup for Lil, until her hairdresser friend and confidante Sally (Una Merkel) points out that all the guests have left early to attend a surprise party for Irene (who lives across the street). Humiliated, she decides to move to New York City, even if it means a temporary separation from her husband. Will finds Lil's handkerchief at Gaerste's place and correctly guesses what Lil has done. He shows his evidence to his son, who hires detectives to watch Lil. They find that she is conducting not one, but two affairs, with Charles and his handsome French chauffeur Albert (Charles Boyer). Bill shows Charles damning photographs. When Lil learns that Charles has found out about her, she returns to Bill, only to find him with Irene. Furious, she shoots him, but he survives and refuses to have her charged with attempted murder. However, he does divorce her, and remarries Irene. Two years later, he sees her again, at a racetrack in Paris, in the company of an aged Frenchman. He discreetly hides Irene's binoculars.

Help as much as you can. To live a happy, healthy, balanced life, you must learn to focus your energy on well-being. Self-care on all levels should be an integral part of your lifestyle. There is an abundance of information available about the benefits of eating well and exercising regularly to sustain a healthy mind and body. In fact, I write about both regularly. But today I want to move in a little different direction. In addition to those two very basic and critical activities, there are a number of other things you can to improve your mental health and overall well-being. By incorporating them into your daily life, you will be better able to manage most challenges – including struggles with self-doubt, anxiety, and mild depression. Practices that Focus Your Energy on Well-being Accept Your Feelings Stuffing or ignoring your emotions is more damaging than it is helpful. Everyone has emotions. They are a natural part of being human. Bottling them up may seem like a good solution in the moment, but when you do it all the time, you are potentially creating a time bomb that will eventually explode. Unfortunately, you are hurting yourself as you hold them in and you run the risk of hurting those you love when the eruption finally occurs. Rather than acknowledging what you are feeling and allowing yourself to experience emotions, you may medicate, rationalize, blame, bury, deny, smother, drink, or stuff them (pretend they don’t exist). Emotions have become the enemy and many people will do anything to avoid them – especially the big three: fear, anger and sadness. It takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy to avoiding your feelings and creates high levels of stress and anxiety. Don’t stuff your emotions! Let yourself laugh, cry, scream, yell, or pound something (preferably a pillow, grass, sand – not the wall or someone else). Do whatever you need to do, probably in private is the best choice. But, if emotions erupt in public, excuse yourself and let it rip. This is nature’s way of releasing stress. Don’t beat yourself... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What is probably true about the author?

Let the lip gloss harden, then use it whenever you want a touch of color or sparkle on your lips. Article:","completion":"Title: The Simple Way to Create Custom Lip Gloss at Home Introduction The art of crafting your personalized lip gloss at home has gained popularity in recent years, providing a fun and creative way for people to express themselves through their makeup. By making your lip gloss, you can customize both the color and sparkle you desire, resulting in a unique lip product that complements your style and personality. Not only is it a cost-effective alternative to commercial lip glosses, but it also allows for a more sustainable choice by reusing and refilling containers instead of buying new ones constantly. In this article, we will guide you through the process of transferring your homemade lip gloss mixture to a small container, allowing it to harden and be ready for use whenever you want. Step 1: Gather Your Ingredients To create your customized lip gloss, you will need the following items: 1. A base – This can be either a clear lip gloss, petroleum jelly, or a mixture of coconut oil and beeswax. 2. Colorant - For adding color to your lip gloss, choose pigments like cosmetic-grade micas, natural food coloring or crushed, lipstick shavings. 3. Sparkle - For added shimmer, consider using cosmetic-grade glitter or mica powder, responsibly sourced and skin-safe. 4. Flavor or scent (optional) - To personalize the lip gloss further, add a couple of drops of essential oils or edible extracts for a unique scent or flavor boost. Step 2: Mix Your Ingredients Combine your base, colorant, sparkle, and optional scent or flavor in a small mixing bowl. Make sure to stir the ingredients until they are fully incorporated and reach a smooth and uniform consistency. You may need to adjust the proportions of the colorant and sparkle to achieve the desired shade and shimmer effect. Step 3: Prepare Your Container Choose a small and suitable container for your lip gloss. You can opt for a new container or repurpose an old or empty lip gloss tube. Thoroughly clean and sanitize the container before filling it with the lip gloss mixture. Step 4: Transfer the Mixture Using a spatula or a small spoon, carefully transfer your lip gloss mixture into the selected container. This step may be a bit tricky, especially if you chose a small container with a narrow opening. To make this process easier, you can use a disposable piping bag or a small plastic bag with a corner snipped off, allowing you to squeeze the mixture effortlessly into the container with precision. Step 5: Let the Lip Gloss Harden Once you have filled the container with the lip gloss mixture, close it tightly, and let the lip gloss harden. This process may take a couple of hours up to an entire day, depending on the type of base used in the mixture. Placing the container in the refrigerator can help speed up the hardening time. Step 6: Enjoy Your Custom Lip Gloss After your lip gloss has hardened, it's finally ready for use! Apply your lip gloss with the help of a lip brush or your fingertips whenever you want to add a touch of color or sparkle to your lips. Remember to store your lip gloss in a cool and dry place, away from direct sunlight or extreme temperatures, to preserve its quality. Conclusion Creating and using your custom lip gloss not only offers immense satisfaction, but also presents an opportunity for exploring your creativity and personal style. By following these simple steps to transfer, harden, and use your lip gloss, you can enjoy the benefits of a one-of-a-kind product while being a conscientious consumer in terms of cost and sustainability. So, gather your ingredients and start experimenting to discover your unique lip gloss look today!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The net effect is calculated through the formula: net effect = x + y + (xy/100) Where x is the first change and y is the second change. In this case, x is -25 (representing a reduction in the price) and y is 75 (representing an increase in sales). Now using the formula: Net effect = -25 + 75 + (-25*75/100) Net effect = 50 - 18.75 = 31.25 However, since the options given are integers only, we round this up to 31 (since 31.25 is much closer to 31 than to 32).

Most of the native population was not Hellenized, had little access to Greek culture and often found themselves discriminated against by their Hellenic overlords.

Greek cities and colonies may have exported Greek art and architecture as far as the Indus, but these were mostly enclaves of Greek culture for the transplanted Greek elite. The degree of influence that Greek culture had throughout the Hellenistic kingdoms was therefore highly localized and based mostly on a few great cities like Alexandria and Antioch. Some natives did learn Greek and adopt Greek ways, but this was mostly limited to a few local elites who were allowed to retain their posts by the Diadochi and also to a small number of mid-level administrators who acted as intermediaries between the Greek speaking upper class and their subjects.

Essentially, sentiment analysis classifies a piece of text as having a positive or negative sentiment. The user submitted a Yelp review regarding a food order where the customer was dissatisfied with the amount and quality of fish, also noted that the burrito was on the 'skinny' side and missed sour cream. The words and phrases in the review such as \\"Where's the fish\\", \\"2 tiny pieces\\", \\"burnt\\", \\"soggy, old lettuce\\", \\"skinny side\\" , and \\"didn't have sour cream\\" , are clear indicators of dissatisfaction, and hence classified as negatives. Step 1: Read through the review to try and understand the overall sentiment. Step 2: Look for any explicit positive or negative phrases - in this case, there are several negative phrases. Step 3: Assess the weight of these phrases in the context of the whole review. Step 4: Classify the sentiment of the review. After taking these steps into consideration, the review expresses dissatisfaction with not just one but multiple elements of the food order. Therefore, I would classify this review as \\"NEGATIVE\\". The multiple negative observations made by the user indicate a negative overall sentiment towards the restaurant's food."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The application of the vernacular did not entail a rejection of Latin, and both Dante and Boccaccio wrote prolifically in Latin as well as Italian, as would Petrarch later (whose Canzoniere also promoted the vernacular and whose contents are considered the first modern lyric poems).

No, these two sentences do not mean exactly the same thing, although their differences might seem subtle at first glance. In the first sentence: \\"Dragan Umičević (born October 9, 1984, in Dubica, SFR Yugoslavia) is a Swedish hockey player of Serbian descent.\\" The description labels Dragan Umičević as a \\"Swedish hockey player of Serbian descent.\\" This statement implies that he identifies as a Swedish hockey player but has Serbian ancestry. In this case, it is suggested that he may hold Swedish nationality and likely competes on behalf of Sweden in international hockey events. In the second sentence: \\"Dragan Umičević (born October 9, 1984, in Dubica, SFR Yugoslavia) is a Serbian ice hockey player of Swedish descent.\\" Here, Dragan Umičević is described as a \\"Serbian ice hockey player of Swedish descent.\\" Inverting the terms from the first sentence, this statement now implies that he identifies as a Serbian ice hockey player but has Swedish ancestry.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options： A. drinking B. playing poker C. sit D. talk E. being greedy A:","completion":"When having food, the most suitable option among the given choices is A. drinking. Drinking is a common act of consumption that accompanies food consumption. It is not only a natural complement to eating, but it is also essential to our overall health and well-being. Drinking, especially water, while eating is essential for a variety of reasons: 1. Maintaining hydration: As humans, we require an adequate intake of fluids to keep our bodies functioning optimally. Thus, drinking during meals helps us maintain our fluid balance, as both food and beverages contribute to our daily fluid intake. 2. Aiding digestion: Drinking water and other liquids can facilitate the breakdown and digestion of food in our stomachs. Consuming beverages such as water or tea can help dissolve food particles, making it easier for the digestive system to process and absorb nutrients. 3. Lubrication and protection: Drinking during meals can create a lubricating effect that helps protect the throat and esophagus. Water, for instance, can moisten and soften food, making it simpler to swallow without causing discomfort or irritation. 4. Enhancing taste and flavors: Beverages can complement the flavors of food and enhance the overall dining experience. For example, pairing a glass of wine with a specific dish can result in a more enjoyable and elevated sensory experience due to the combination of flavors and aroma. 5. Facilitating social aspects of eating: In many cultures, sharing drinks during meals is a social activity that fosters conversation, bonding, and celebration. Drinking is often an important aspect of gatherings, as it helps create a relaxed environment, encourages interaction, and signifies hospitality. Therefore, while consuming food, it is most fitting to also engage in the act of drinking, as it not only complements our meals but also plays a crucial role in our health, digestive processes, and social interactions. Other options, such as playing poker (B), sitting (C), talking (D), or being greedy (E), are not as relevant or suitable in answering the above question about acts of consumption during meals."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question 1: What are some effective ways to minimize/avoid taxes if one gets total salary compensation of 250k in California? Question 2: How much personal income tax would you pay in total in San Francisco, California, if you had 80,000 in salary? Select from: (a). no. (b). yes. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"To answer Question 1, here are some effective ways to minimize or avoid taxes on a total salary compensation of 250k in California: 1. Contribute to a 401(k) or retirement account: Max out your annual contribution to reduce taxable income. 2. Utilize tax-advantaged accounts: Contribute to Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) or Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs), which allow you to use pre-tax dollars for qualified medical expenses. 3. Invest in tax-exempt municipal bonds: Interest from these bonds is generally exempt from federal and state income taxes. 4. Deduct mortgage interest: If you own a home, you can deduct mortgage interest on your tax returns. 5. Deduct property taxes: California allows deductions on state and local property taxes up to a certain limit. 6. Benefit from tax credits: Look for opportunities to claim tax credits, such as education or childcare expenses. Remember to consult a tax professional for personalized advice on minimizing or avoiding taxes based on your specific situation. For Question 2, in order to calculate the personal income tax for an 80,000 salary in San Francisco, California, we need to consider federal income tax, state income tax, and any local taxes (if applicable). Here's the step-by-step calculation: Step 1: Calculate federal income tax 1. Identify the federal tax brackets for the given income. 2. Apply the income tax rates based on the tax brackets. 3. Add up the federal income tax liabilities based on each tax bracket. Step 2: Calculate California state income tax 1. Identify the California state tax brackets for the given income. 2. Apply the state income tax rates based on the tax brackets. 3. Add up the California state income tax liabilities based on each tax bracket. Step 3: Add federal and state income taxes 1. Sum the federal income tax and California state income tax amounts obtained from step 1 and step 2. San Francisco does not have local income taxes, so the total personal income tax liability will be the sum of federal and state income taxes. Given the available options: (a) no and (b) yes, it is clear that: Questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is about minimizing or avoiding taxes on a 250k salary in California, while Question 2 is about calculating personal income tax on an 80,000 salary in San Francisco, California. So, the answer is (a) no."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Make use of the article to answer the questions. Have you ever listened to young children talking in the playground? They are always boasting. They say things like, \\"My Dad's car is bigger than your Dad's,\\" and \\"My Mom is smarter than yours.\\" They particularly like to boast about their families. There were three little boys, Harry, Ted and Gavin, who were always boasting. Gavin was the worst. Everything about his family was always the best or the biggest or the most expensive. Whatever the others said, he could always go on better. One day when they were walking to school, Harry said, \\"My father had a bath twice a week,\\" Ted spoke next. \\"That's nothing,\\" he said. \\"Having a bath twice a week is dirty. My father has a bath every day, sometimes twice a day.\\" Ted looked at Gavin. Now it was his turn. But what could he say? \\"This time,\\" Ted thought, \\"I'm going to win.\\" Gavin didn't know what to say. He couldn't say that his father had a bath three times a day. That was silly. He walked on in silence. Ted smiled at Harry, and Harry smiled back. They were sure that for once they had beaten Gavin. They reached the school gates. Still Gavin said nothing. \\"We've won,\\" Ted said to Harry, but he spoke too soon. On the way home, Gavin said, \\"My Dad is so clean that he doesn't have to bathe at all.\\" 1. What does it say children on the playground are always doing? Numbered answers:","completion":"1. The article states that children on the playground are always boasting. They often make different kind of claims, particularly about their families. For example, who has the bigger car, or whose mother is smarter. Harry, Ted, and Gavin, the three little boys mentioned, were no exception. They were always engaged in such boasting, with Gavin being noted as the worst since all things about his family were reportedly always the 'best', 'biggest', or the 'most expensive'. 2. It explains that in their display of playful competitiveness, these kids continually tried to outdo each other. Thus, whatever one kid said, another would attempt to downplay that by stating something about their family which was allegedly better or superior. This underscores the relentless nature of their boasting in the playground, as the desire to emerge as the 'winner' in these exchanges was a dominant theme evident in their interactions. 3. At one point, the boasting involved how often their respective fathers bathed. Harry's father bathed twice a week and Ted's father took a bath every day—sometimes twice a day. This put Gavin in a challenging position because he couldn't outdo Ted's argument without sounding ridiculous. The two boys thought they had finally gotten the upper hand over Gavin. However, Gavin surprised them later by saying that his Dad was so clean that he didn't need to bathe at all. 4. Gavin's silence at the school gates initially gave a sense of victory to Ted and Harry. Nevertheless, his later claim demonstrated that the boasting was not limited to school or playground. In essence, the habitual bragging observed in the children extended their interactions beyond the playground and was carried into different aspects of their daily lives. In summary, the article explains that young children on the playground are always in a state of friendly competition, incessantly boasting about their families in various ways to support their claims of superiority."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The earliest signs of people on Jamaica are the remains of the Arawak, an AmerIndian society that originated on the north coast of South America. Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517. Question: \\"After Esquival arrived, did the Spanish remain in Nueva Sevilla?\\" Response: \\"No, they moved from Nueva Sevilla to Villa de la Vega due to mosquitoes and unhealthy conditions\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question."},{"prompt":"Title: truth in reviewing Review: I'll get right to my point.

And if you hate spiders already, then this video of the unusual critter is sure to be your worst nightmare. The footage shows a yellowish arachnid with unusual black markings all over its body, but that's far from the weirdest thing about the bizarre spider. In the video, it's possible to see the spider's retinas moving around inside its jelly-like head, before the beady orange eyes eventually fix on the camera. As the spider susses out its surroundings, it makes freaky jerking movements, prompting some viewers to suggest the creature is not from this planet. The moving retinas and shifty movements were enough to seriously spook commenters on YouTube, where the video was first shared. One likened the creature to an \\"alien\\", whilst the Star reports that one viewer claimed they would \\"never sleep at night\\" if they came across one of the critters in their house. And another spooked viewer said: \\"I can see it thinking\\" As out-of-this-world as the spider may seem, it turns out that the creature is indeed native to this planet, and is an Ecuadorian breed of jumping spider. Jumping spiders are believed to be one of the most intelligent breeds of spider, and have been known to watch and stalk their prey for hours before striking. This isn't the first time we've all be stunned by an unusual spider however, and you can be sure that it won't be the last. Earlier this year, we revealed that Britain may have been invaded by a breed of spider whose bite will give victims a painful, four-hour long erection, before killing them.

In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed. The food not digested is released as waste.

Student:","completion":"Part #1: Understanding the 'poster' sentence Usage: The poster's statement: \\"Remember the Battle of Gettysburg today, and all those who have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of #Freedom.\\" Here, the poster is reminiscing the Battle of Gettysburg, acknowledging the sacrifices made, and invoking the context of freedom. Part #2: Interpreting the 'response' Usage: The responder's statement: \\"That phrase is open to interpretation, especially when defining freedom in the context of slavery, state's rights, and economy-type favoring tariffs, but yes honor those who fought for what they believed in - hopefully they knew what it was.\\" The responder is slightly critical of the original poster's ambiguous usage of the term 'freedom', but also agrees that those who fought should be honored.

A conservative legal group, Judicial Watch, obtained the emails as part of a lawsuit against the State Department. The Democratic presidential nominee said the emails did not involve her or relate to the foundation's work. The emails, which were heavily redacted, came from Mrs Clinton's first three months as secretary of state in 2009. The latest batch was not included in the more than 30,000 emails Mrs Clinton turned over to the State Department last March as part of an investigation. Can Hillary Clinton give a straight answer on emails? Hillary Clinton's 'emailgate' diced and sliced In one email exchange, Clinton Foundation official Doug Band asked Mrs Clinton's top aides, Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin, to find a job for a foundation associate at the State Department. Ms Abedin replied: \\"We all have him on our radar. Personnel has been sending him options.\\" However, State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau told ABC News that the State Department hires political appointees through a \\"variety of avenues\\". \\"State Department officials are regularly in touch with a range of outside individuals and organisations including non-profits, NGOs, think tanks, and others,\\" she said. Mrs Clinton's campaign addressed the emails highlighted by Judicial Watch, suggesting that Mr Band was acting as former President Bill Clinton's personal assistant and not in his role as the head of the Clinton Global Initiative. \\"They are communications between her aides and the president's personal aide, and indeed the recommendation was for one of the Secretary's former staffers who was not employed by the foundation,\\" a statement said. Why they hate Hillary in Trump country Are the Democrats too confident? Three reasons Hillary could lose In another instance, Mr Band asked Ms Abedin and Ms Mills to put Lebanese-Nigerian billionaire, Gilbert Chagoury, in contact with the State Department's \\"substance person\\" on Lebanon. Mr Band said the billionaire foundation donor was a \\"key guy there [Lebanon] and to us\\". The newly released batch also included an email to Mrs Clinton from Stephen Roach, then-chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, who said he was scheduled to testify to Congress and was \\"happy to help in any way I can.\\" Mr Roach then met with Mrs Clinton over the summer for 30 minutes, according to Clinton calendars obtained by the AP. Mrs Clinton's campaign did not immediately address the email exchange with Mr Roach. The Democratic nominee has been mired in controversy over her use of a personal email server while at the State Department, prompting a federal investigation and undermining her trustworthiness among public opinion. FBI Director James Comey announced in July that though Mrs Clinton was \\"extremely careless,\\" his investigation did not find any evidence of criminal wrongdoing. Republican presidential rival Donald Trump's campaign responded to the latest revelations, saying it was \\"more evidence that Hillary Clinton lacks the judgment, character, stability and temperament to be within 1,000 miles of public power\\". Summary:","completion":"In a new batch of unreleased emails obtained by conservative legal group, Judicial Watch, it has been revealed that a Clinton Foundation official asked for help in finding a job for a foundation associate within Hilary Clinton's Department of State.

Fangio won the 1957 event, and had set fastest times during practice for the 1958 race. On 23 February 1958, two unmasked gunmen of Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement entered the Hotel Lincoln in Havana and kidnapped Fangio at gunpoint. The motive was simple: By capturing the biggest name in motorsport the rebels were showing up the government and attracting worldwide publicity to their cause. But despite the shocking news spreading across the globe, President Batista would not be outdone and ordered the race to continue as usual while a crack team of police hunted down the kidnappers. They set up roadblocks at intersections, and guards were assigned to private and commercial airports and to all competing drivers. Fangio was taken to three separate houses. His captors allowed him to listen to the race via radio, bringing a television for him to witness reports of a disastrous crash after the race concluded. In the third house, Fangio was allowed his own bedroom but became convinced that a guard was standing outside of the bedroom door at all hours. The captors talked about their revolutionary programme which Fangio had not wished to speak about as he did not have an interest in politics. Convinced that he was not in danger he went on to develop a case of Stockholm Syndrome, admitting afterwards that he sympathised with his captors' actions: \\"Well, this is one more adventure. If what the rebels did was in a good cause, then I, as an Argentine, accept it.\\" Fangio was released after 29 hours and he remained a good friend of his captors afterwards. The captors motives were to force the cancellation of the race in an attempt to embarrass the Batista regime. After Fangio was handed over to the Argentine embassy soon after the race, many Cubans were convinced that Batista was losing his power because he failed to track the captors down. The Cuban Revolution concluded in January 1959, cancelling the 1959 Cuban Grand Prix. The Fangio kidnapping was dramatized in a 1999 Argentine film directed by Alberto Lecchi, Operacion Fangio.

We can do this by following these steps: Step 1: Add 615905 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant on the left side. 421 * y - 615905 + 615905 = -628535 + 615905 Simplifying, we get: 421 * y = -12630 Step 2: Now, we need to get y by itself. To do this, we must divide both sides of the equation by 421. (421 * y) / 421 = -12630 / 421 Since 421 / 421 = 1, we have: y = -12630 / 421 Step 3: Simplify the fraction on the right side of the equation. y ≈ -12630 / 421 ≈ -30 So, the solution to the given equation is y ≈ -30."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To simplify the equation, we can sum these terms. -415215*m + 415141*m = (-415215 + 415141)*m = -74*m So the equation becomes: 0 = -74*m + 296 Step 2: Isolate the variable 'm' In order to solve the equation for 'm', we want to isolate 'm' on one side. To do this, we can subtract 296 from both sides. 0 - 296 = -74*m + 296 - 296 -296 = -74*m Step 3: Solve for 'm' We now have a simpler equation: -296 = -74*m To find the value of m, we can divide both sides by -74: (-296) / (-74) = (-74*m) / (-74) 4 = m So, the value of m that solves the equation is m = 4."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

During its subsequent two and a half centuries of rule from the new capital established at Edo, the Tokugawa organized a tightly controlled coalition of some 260 daimyo in strategic strongholds throughout the country. The allegiance of this highly privileged and prestigious group was ensured by cementing their ethical principles in the code of bushido, \\"The way of the warrior\\": loyalty to one's master, defense of one's status and honor, and fulfillment of all obligations. Loyalty was further enforced by holding the vassals' wives and children hostage in Edo. All roads into Edo, the most famous being the Tokaido Highway, had checkpoints for guns coming in and for wives going out. One of the most effective ways of keeping a tight rein on the country was to cut it off from the outside world, to keep Japan Japanese. At first, Ieyasu Tokugawa was eager to promote foreign trade. He wanted silk and encouraged the Dutch and British as good, nonproselytizing Protestants just interested in trade. But he didn't like the Portuguese and Spanish Catholic missionaries, who he felt were undermining traditional Japanese values. He banned their activities in 1612 and two years later ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and unrepentant Japanese converts. Executions and torture followed. Converts were forced to renounce their faith by trampling crucifixes and effigies of Jesus and Mary. The Catholic Church has counted 3,125 martyrs in Japan from 1597 (beginning under Hideyoshi) to 1660. In 1635 the Japanese were forbidden, on pain of death, to attempt to travel abroad, and Japanese citizens already overseas were prevented from returning, in case they brought back subversive Christian doctrines. Western books were banned, as were Chinese books that mentioned Christianity.

The nail was apparently named after the practice of hammering brass nails into the counter at shops where cloth was sold . On the other hand , R D Connor , in The weights and measures of England ( p 84 ) states that the nail was the 16th part of a Roman foot , i.e. , digitus or finger , although he provides no reference to support this . Zupko 's A dictionary of weights and measures for the British Isles ( p 256 ) states that the nail was originally the distance from the thumbnail to the joint at the base of the thumb , or alternately , from the end of the middle finger to the second joint . An archaic usage of the term nail is as a sixteenth of a ( long ) hundredweight for mass , or 1 clove of 7 pound avoirdupois ( 3.175 kg ) . - In geometric measurements, length is the most extended dimension of an object. In the International System of Quantities, length is any quantity with dimension distance. In other contexts \\"length\\" is the measured dimension of an object. For example, it is possible to cut a length of a wire which is shorter than wire thickness. - An inch (abbreviation: in or ) is a unit of length in the imperial and United States customary systems of measurement now formally equal to yard but usually understood as of a foot. Derived from the Roman uncia (\\"twelfth\\"), \\"inch\\" is also sometimes used to translate related units in other measurement systems, usually understood as deriving from the width of the human thumb. Traditional standards for the exact length of an inch have varied in the past, but since the adoption of the international yard during the 1950s and 1960s it has been based on the metric system and reckoned as exactly 2.54cm. Name. The English word \\"inch\\" was an early borrowing from Latin \\"\\" (\\"one-twelfth; Roman inch; Roman ounce\\") not present in other Germanic languages. The vowel change from Latin /u/ to English // is known as umlaut. The consonant change from the Latin /k/ to English /t/ or // is palatalisation. Both were features of Old English phonology. \\"Inch\\" is cognate with \\"ounce\\", whose separate pronunciation and spelling reflect its reborrowing in Middle English from Anglo-Norman \\"unce\\" and \\"ounce\\". - A yardstick is a straightedge used to physically measure lengths of up to a yard (0.9144 metres or three feet) high. Yardsticks are flat wooden boards with markings at regular intervals. - The yard (abbreviation: yd) is an English unit of length, in both the British imperial and US customary systems of measurement, that comprises 3 feet or 36 inches. It is by international agreement in 1959 standardized as exactly 0.9144 meters. A metal yardstick originally formed the physical standard from which all other units of length were officially derived in both English systems. What is the relationship between 'nail ' and 'unit of length'? A:","completion":"The relationship between 'nail' and 'unit of length' lies in the fact that a 'nail' refers to a specific unit of length that was historically used for measuring cloth and certain weights and measures. This term has its origins in the old practice of hammering brass nails into the counter at shops where cloth was sold, as a system of measuring cloth. The nail as a unit of cloth measurement is generally considered a sixteenth of a yard or 2.25 inches (5.715 cm). There are alternative theories about the origins of the term 'nail,' such as R.D. Connor's suggestion that it was the 16th part of a Roman foot, or Zupko's proposal that it was originally the distance from the thumbnail to the joint at the base of the thumb, or from the end of the middle finger to the second joint. In a different context, an archaic usage of the term 'nail' refers to a sixteenth of a (long) hundredweight for mass, or 1 clove of 7-pound avoirdupois (3.175 kg). In the context of geometric measurements related to length, the yard, foot, inch, and subsequently the nail are units used to measure objects in the British imperial and US customary systems. These units, including the nail, provide ways to quantify the size of items based on a consistent standard, which is essential for commerce and daily life. Therefore, the relationship between 'nail' and 'unit of length' signifies the historical usage and the practical application of the term 'nail' as a means of measuring length and distance in certain domains."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: After more than a year of effort, attorneys with Northwest Justice Project earlier this week told 25 families in a mobile home park here that they can keep their homes and no longer need to fear eviction. The East Wenatchee City Council has entered into an Interlocal Agreement with the Wenatchee Housing Authority authorizing the Authority to purchase and maintain the Mobile Park Plaza mobile home park. Located just north of the Wenatchee Valley Mall, the park had been threatened with closure for more than a year. \\"We cannot say enough about how relieved we are that this is over,\\" said Manuel Luna, one of the residents of Mobile Park Plaza. \\"We were afraid that no solution would be found, and that our families would have no place to go. We are very grateful for the help of our attorneys. Without them, we would not have saved our homes. We are also thankful for the help of the Housing Authority, the City Council and Mayor Steve Lacy.\\" Formerly owned by local businessman Dan Jennings, Mobile Park Plaza had been home to 45 low-income families, many of them Latino farm workers. In October 2000 Jennings gave the park residents notice of his intent to close the park effective November 30, 2001. While some park residents decided to move, others, including 25 families, organized an informal association to relocate or save their homes. Unable to afford private legal counsel, the families asked for help from legal services attorneys at the Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services. In the succeeding months, these attorneys worked with representatives of the Greater Wenatchee Housing Authority, the state Office of Community Development, Chelan County, the City of East Wenatchee, state legislators, Jennings and others to secure funding and find a solution. \\"There seemed to be a never-ending set of obstacles,\\" said Patrick Pleas, an attorney with Northwest Justice Project. \\"Mr. Jennings had financial considerations, the City had growth and economic development considerations, and the State and Housing Authority had their own concerns. Thankfully, hard work and good will from all parties allowed us to find a solution that works for everyone.\\" Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services are non-profit organizations that provide civil legal assistance to low-income individuals and families throughout Washington state. Members of the state's Access to Justice Network, these organizations work with thousands of volunteer attorneys to ensure that justice is available to those who face critical legal problems and can't afford private legal counsel.

Solve this problem.","completion":"To solve the equation -2*g + 6 = -3*g for g, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Identify the variable we are solving for. In this equation, we are solving for the variable g. Step 2: Re-arrange the equation to get terms with the variable on one side and the constant on the other side. To do this, let's add 3*g to both sides of the equation to isolate g terms on the right side: -2*g + 6 + 3*g = -3*g + 3*g (3*g - 2*g) = -2*g + 3*g Step 3: Simplify both sides of the equation by combining like terms. g + 6 = 0 Step 4: Isolate the variable by moving the constant term (the integer number) to the other side of the equation. To do this, we need to subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: g + 6 - 6 = 0 - 6 g = -6 The solution to the equation -2*g + 6 = -3*g is g = -6."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This significant development is just another hurdle for the team as they try to recover from a series of setbacks and disappointing performances. Step 1: Establish the context for the surgery The season has been challenging for the Athletics, with numerous injuries plaguing the roster and adversely affecting team performance. Recently, it was announced that Anderson will be out for an extended period of time following a successful Tommy John surgery to repair his injured elbow. The decision to undergo surgery was made after Anderson consulted with team doctors and specialists and determined that it was the best course of action to ensure a full recovery and return to his previous form. Step 2: Explain the impact of the surgery on the team Brett Anderson's absence from the Athletics' pitching rotation due to the surgery will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the team's performance down the stretch. Anderson was considered a cornerstone of the rotation, and his absence leaves a glaring hole that will need to be filled by inexperienced or underperforming pitchers on the roster. Furthermore, the prolonged recovery period for Tommy John surgery can be as long as 12-18 months, which means that Anderson may not be available to contribute to the team until late next season, at the earliest. Step 3: Mention potential replacements for Anderson While it is impossible to replace a talent like Brett Anderson, the Athletics will need to explore potential roster changes to offset the loss. Some options include internal promotions from their minor league teams, signing available free agents, or exploring trades with other clubs. Some possible candidates for promotion from within the organization include Jesús Luzardo and Daulton Jefferies, both promising young pitchers who have displayed impressive performances in the minor leagues. Step 4: Discuss the long-term implications for the Athletics and Anderson The Tommy John surgery is undoubtedly a significant setback for both the Athletics and Brett Anderson. While there is a high success rate for pitchers returning from the procedure, there are no guarantees, and the long recovery process will be critical for Anderson to regain his former prowess on the mound. For the Athletics, Anderson's injury serves as a stark reminder of how quickly a team's fortunes can change due to unforeseen circumstances. Moving forward, management must carefully evaluate their roster depth and develop contingency plans to better adapt to such changes and setbacks in the future. Conclusion: Despite the surge of adversity, the Oakland Athletics remain optimistic and are committed to overcoming their challenges to field a competitive team. The loss of Brett Anderson to Tommy John surgery is undoubtedly a significant blow, but the organization has weathered such storms before. The true test for the Athletics will be their ability to adapt, learn and grow from this experience, ultimately emerging as a stronger and more resilient team in the face of adversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But years later they ruptured leaving her with painful, lopsided breasts.","completion":"Title: The Importance of Researching Your Choices Once upon a time, there was a lady named Susan Calvert. Susan was worried because she thought her chest looked more like a boy's - it was not as big as she wanted it to be. So, she decided to change that by getting an operation to make her chest bigger. This operation is called \\"breast augmentation.\\" Sometimes, we need to stop and think about things before we do them. That is called \\"research.\\" Research helps us know more about stuff, so we can make good choices. But Susan, in a hurry, didn't do her research before the operation. She just wanted her chest to look bigger, quickly. Susan met a doctor who said he could make her chest bigger with something called \\"implants.\\" Implants are like soft, squishy balloons filled with a special gel. The doctor put them inside Susan's chest to make her boobs look bigger. The doctor told Susan that her implants would last forever, just like toys that never break! However, after some years, something bad happened. The implants broke (like balloons popping) and Susan's chest started to hurt. Her boobs didn't look nice anymore - they were uneven, like one shoe being smaller than the other. Susan was really sad and wished she had done her research before getting the operation. So, the important lesson in Susan's story is to always do your research. It's good to learn about things before we make decisions. If we don't take the time to research and think about what we want to do, we might end up like Susan, with a painful and unhappy experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As we delve into understanding the official figures and analysing the potential implications of this record-breaking inflation rate, one must begin at the source: understanding the role of inflation as an essential element of a country's financial wellbeing. Understanding Inflation Inflation is the rate at which the price of goods and services rises over time. Central banks, including the Bank of England, closely monitor inflation to ensure economic stability. A high inflation rate signifies rising costs for consumers, whereas a low inflation rate or deflation usually indicates weak consumer demand and a sluggish economy. In a healthy economy, a small and consistent level of inflation is typical, ensuring that businesses can raise prices and wages without causing huge disruptions to financial markets. The Current UK Economy Amid the unprecedented challenges of Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK has faced significant economic headwinds. In February, the inflation rate dropped to zero percent, marking the lowest level ever recorded since the inception of official records. This was, in part, due to a drop in energy, fuel, and clothing costs. The sudden decrease in inflation can also be attributed to the Bank of England's quantitative easing programme, which is aimed at injecting liquidity into the economy during turbulent times. Analysing the Factors Behind the 0% Inflation Rate 1. Energy Prices: As the world continues to combat climate change and gravitate towards environmentally-friendly energy sources, the prices of fossil fuels have dropped. The reduced global demand for energy during the pandemic has also led to market oversupply, causing a downward pressure on energy prices. 2. Lower Fuel Costs: Alongside energy costs, the decrease in fuel prices played a vital role in the UK's plummeting inflation. With COVID-19 restrictions in place and limited opportunities for travel, overall demand for fuel dropped, contributing to reduced prices. 3. Clothing and Footwear: Businesses in the fashion industry have experienced reduced sales volumes due to the pandemic, leading to discounts and sales promotions to incentivise consumers to spend. This, in turn, has caused prices in clothing and footwear to decrease, creating deflationary pressure. 4. Import Prices: An appreciating pound sterling has reduced import costs, allowing domestic UK businesses to obtain goods at lower prices. Imported goods such as food items, essential consumer items, and intermediate goods have consequently become more affordable, leading to a drop in overall prices across the UK. The Implications of a 0% Inflation Rate While a zero percent inflation rate may initially appear to be a positive phenomenon, allowing consumers to purchase goods and services at consistent prices, there are long-term risks involved. 1. Consumers may delay purchases, expecting further decreases in prices, which could reduce demand, leading to unemployment and business closures. 2. Inflation rates near zero make it difficult for the Bank of England to use conventional monetary policy tools, such as adjusting interest rates, to stimulate economic activity. 3. A prolonged period of near-zero inflation or deflation may lead to increased debt burdens on households and businesses, as debt repayments become a larger proportion of income when prices are falling. Conclusion The record-breaking zero percent inflation rate in February signals the UK's continued struggle to maintain economic stability in the face of challenging global circumstances. As the government and central bank devise strategies to address the risk of deflation and economic stagnation, it remains crucial to address the underlying factors contributing to the country's weakened economic performance. Through targeted economic policies and collaborative efforts with other nations, the UK can move towards restoring a healthy level of inflation that supports its economic recovery."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Often, foreign exchange controls can result in the creation of black markets to exchange the weaker currency for stronger currencies. This leads to a situation where the exchange rate for the foreign currency is much higher than the rate set by the government, and therefore creates a shadow currency exchange market. As such, it is unclear whether governments have the ability to enact effective exchange controls.[1] Paragraph: On March 2015 Japans economy soared. There was a likelihood that the Japanese yen would rise in value. In the wake of this event, Japanese Government adjusted the price of Japanese Currency Yen in accordance with the going market price. On the other hand, at he same time, UK was having economic downturn. There was a likelihood that the UK Currency Pound Sterling would go down. Fearing public backlash, UK Government kept the price of the Pound Sterling at the same level. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which currency would most likely be exchanged in the black market, Pound Sterling or Yen? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given paragraph, the Pound Sterling would most likely be exchanged in the black market. This is due to the government's decision to keep the price of the Pound Sterling at the same level despite the economic downturn, which likely made the official exchange rate inconsistent with the market value. In such situations, black markets often emerge for the undervalued currency (the Pound Sterling in this case), as people will be looking to exchange at a rate that is closer to the real market value rather than the artificially maintained official rate. In contrast, the Japanese yen, whose price was adjusted in accordance with the going market price, would be less likely to be the subject of black market trades."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- As the mosque debate dominates the summer spin cycle, a new Pew Research Poll shows that an increasing number of Americans believe that Barack Obama is a Muslim -- now up to 18 percent from 11 percent in March 2009. At the same time, only a third of Americans say Obama is a Christian, down from nearly 50 percent last year. And while the biggest jumps in believing Obama is Muslim come from self-described conservative Republicans -- from 18 percent to 34 percent -- the number of Democrats who describe Obama as Christian fell from 55 percent to 46 percent. Independents -- while being the group least likely to want professions of religious beliefs from politicians -- have also fallen in with the drift. The birther myths build off this sense of Obama as a sinister fraud, casting","completion":"doubt on not only his religious beliefs but also his citizenship and legitimacy as the President of the United States. These claims have been fueled by conspiracy theories and mistruths spread across the internet and social media, as well as by some political commentators and public figures who have given credence to the falsehoods. Despite consistently providing evidence that he was indeed born in Hawaii and debunking the \\"birther\\" conspiracy theories, Obama still faced an uphill battle to prove his Americanness to the public. His Kenyan heritage, unique name, and diverse upbringing have contributed to building a perception among some Americans that he is alien and unfamiliar. As the mosque debate intensified during the summer, it only served to deepen the divisions over Obama's religious beliefs and cultural background. However, on September 1, 2010, the White House answered public concerns by issuing a brief statement in which President Obama directly confronted the issue. \\"I am an American, and I am a Christian. I have a deep respect for the Islamic faith, but it is important for everyone to understand that these rumors about my religion are false. My faith is rooted in Christianity and the teachings of Jesus Christ,\\" he stated. The President's statement generated mixed reactions, with some political analysts arguing that it was a necessary step to quell the rumors and squash the conspiracies about Obama's background, while others expressed concerns that the statement validated the false claims and hate speech that had been circulating about him for quite some time. In an effort to promote unity and understanding, the Obama administration launched a series of interfaith dialogues and events aimed at fostering a deeper appreciation for diversity and combatting religious discrimination. These efforts were met with varying degrees of success, but they laid the groundwork for a broader discussion about the role of religion and religious identity in American politics and society. Over time, the number of people who believed that President Obama was a Muslim gradually decreased as more information about his faith and background became widely available. However, the lingering doubts and conspiracy theories revealed a deep undercurrent of mistrust and misunderstanding among the American public that would take years to repair. In the long run, the mosque debate and the controversy surrounding President Obama's religious beliefs underscored the growing influence of misinformation and conspiracy theories in shaping public opinion, as well as the importance of promoting tolerance, understanding, and the democratic values that America was founded upon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lieutenant Mark Hoffman is called in to listen to the tape, which informs Hoffman that he, too, will be tested as he is now \\"the last man standing.\\"The scene shifts to a mausoleum, where Trevor and Art are chained to a large winch. Trevor's eyelids have been sewn together, as has Art's mouth, making communication between them impossible. When the winch begins pulling them together, Trevor, out of panic, attacks Art, who kills Trevor to retrieve a key from the latter's collar. In a later flashback, Art finds two items waiting for him elsewhere in the mausoleum: a recorded message from Jigsaw and an envelope containing instructions.It has been six months since the disappearance of Detective Eric Matthews, and four days since Detective Allison Kerry vanished, as noted by Hoffman. The police discover Kerry's corpse, still hanging in the harness of the inescapable trap that killed her in Saw III. After cautioning Lieutenant Daniel Rigg for barging through an unsecured door, Hoffman is introduced to FBI Agents Strahm and Perez, who deduce that Amanda Young, Jigsaw's apprentice, would need assistance with Kerry's trap, indicating that there is another accomplice to the murder.That evening, Rigg is attacked in his home and Hoffman disappears. When Rigg comes to, a videotape informs him that Matthews is in fact still alive, with 90 minutes to save himself, and that Hoffman's survival is at stake as well. He then undergoes his first test, in which he finds a woman named Brenda. Jigsaw advises Rigg to walk away, and to \\"see what I see,\\" as written on the wall, but Rigg's natural instinct to help those in need clouds his judgment. When Rigg removes the pig mask covering Brenda's face, he triggers a trap device that begins to slowly tear her scalp from her head. He succeeds in freeing her.

I recently read a piece about a guy in his late 30s who took up learning guitar as a hobby and actually became a proficient player. Then I read about a young man who decided to devote an hour a day learning about something just for fun — including banjo, juggling and astrophysics. Those pieces revved me up to go out and learn something new. Although I love that journalism allows me to dabble in a range of topics, I miss the thrill of structured, focused education. Im not talking about going back to school full-time for a degree program, but taking a course or even reading a book to learn something just for the sake of it, such as a new language or skill.

The problem isn’t just that my aging brain makes it harder to absorb new information. It’s squeezing in the time. But when you think about it, a dedicated hour or even half-hour a day isnt that hard to fit in; I surely accumulate that much time watching TV, reading, exercising or futzing round the house. Maybe I could listen to an instructional tape while jogging? Or read some educational nonfiction before bed instead of my go-to novels or mysteries? Or take a web course instead of vegging out to Modern Family? Despite my gung-ho intentions to learn, I have a feeling that I may simply be too undisciplined–and tired–at the end of the day to make this happen at this young-kid stage of my life.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many theories exist to explain the origin of the 260-day count?","completion":"Title: Exploring the Theories Behind the Origin of the 260-Day Count Introduction The 260-day count, known as the Tzolkin, holds a significant place in the Mesoamerican ancient calendrical systems. This count was followed primarily by the Maya, Zapotec, and other Mesoamerican civilizations. The enigmatic origin of the 260-day count has been subject to numerous debates among archaeologists, anthropologists, and historians. Several theories strive to explain the reason behind the choice of 260 days and the overall significance of this calendar cycle. In this article, we delve into the various theories to better understand why the Tzolkin was such an important part of the Mesoamerican cultures. The Divine Creation Theory One perspective argues that the 260-day count originates from divine creation, with the days representing the time it took the gods to develop the world. According to Mesoamerican mythology, the gods created the Earth and the Tzolkin calendar. Since it's justifiable to believe that no time elapsed before the creation, the calendar had to start with day one (1 Imix in the Maya calendar). As the 260-day cycle ends, the count restarts again, signifying the cyclical nature of life and the continuing divine connection to the gods. The Astronomical Theory The astronomical theory is perhaps the most dominant explanation, attributing the origin of the 260-day count to celestial phenomena. Since ancient Mesoamerican cultures were deeply engrossed in the study of the skies, they closely monitored the movements of celestial bodies. In this context, the Tzolkin might have played an integral role as a means to predict eclipses, solstices, equinoxes, and planetary alignments. Certain astronomical phenomena, such as the synodic period of Venus, Mars, and other planets, are believed to be connected to the 260-day cycle. For instance, the synodic period of Venus is approximately 584 days, while that of Mars is 780 days. Interestingly, when their synodic periods are at their closest conjunction, they harmonize with the Tzolkin at 260 x 3 = 780 days. The Agricultural Theory Another well-known theory posits that the origin of the 260-day calendar is found in agricultural cycles. Mesoamerican peoples were largely dependent on agriculture for their subsistence, which could be the reason for developing a calendar synchronized with the natural world. The primary agricultural crop cultivated by these civilizations was maize, which played a crucial role in their culture as it was considered a sacred entity. The growing period for maize coincides with the length of the Tzolkin cycle in different ways, depending on the region. For example, in highland Oaxaca, the planting season spans about 260 days, while in some highland Maya areas, the agricultural cycle is 2 x 260 days. This connection could explain the cultural significance attached to the Tzolkin. The Human Gestation Theory The human gestation theory associates the 260-day count with the average duration of human pregnancy, which is about 266 days or approximately nine months. Ancient Mesoamerican societies highly valued fertility, childbirth, and the bonds between generations. Therefore, they might have created a calendar cycle that resonated with the gestational period and symbolized the link between life, time, and continuity. In Maya culture, there is evidence of art and rituals celebrating fertility and childbirth. A connection between the 260-day calendar and human gestation would serve as an important reminder of the perpetuity of life and the essential role women played in the creation and maintenance of life. Conclusion While numerous theories have been proposed to explain the origin of the 260-day count, uncertainty prevails, as no single theory has been established as definitive. However, these theories elucidate the complexity and sophistication of the ancient Mesoamerican cultures and their deep connection to the natural world, spirituality, and cosmos. As research into this field progresses, it is only a matter of time before more insights are discovered that may shed further light on the enigma that is the 260-day count."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Title: Halloween H20: 20 Years Later Movie plot: On October 29, 1998, Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens), Dr. Sam Loomis' former colleague, returns to her home in Langdon, Illinois, to find it has been burglarized. After having her neighbor Jimmy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and his friend Tony call the police, Jimmy searches the house and finds nothing. While waiting for the police, Marion discovers a file is missing, the one on Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), Michael Myers' sister. She also realizes that someone has been in her house and immediately rushes back over to Jimmy's house, where she finds him and Tony dead. Michael Myers (Chris Durand) appears, and kills Marion. Michael leaves the house with Laurie's file. On Halloween, two days later, Laurie Strode awakens from a nightmare, having to be calmed by her son, John (Josh Hartnett).

Answer:","completion":"The current name of the city, whose previous name is the same as the movie featuring the song \\"Humma Humma,\\" is Mumbai. The song \\"Humma Humma\\" is from the Bollywood film \\"Bombay\\" released in 1995. The city of Bombay was officially renamed as Mumbai in 1995 due to political changes and to honor the local Marathi culture. Mumbai, which is the capital city of Maharashtra, is the most populous city in India and holds significant importance economically, commercially, and culturally. It is also known as the financial capital of the country, with major institutions such as the Reserve Bank of India, the Bombay Stock Exchange, and the National Stock Exchange of India being headquartered in the city. Mumbai's rich history dates back several centuries, with evidence of various dynasties ruling the region. The city got its name from the local deity \\"Mumba Devi.\\" It witnessed control of several empires throughout history, such as the Maurya Empire, the Gupta Empire, and the Rashtrakuta dynasty, to name a few. The city started gaining prominence during the 16th century when the Portuguese took control of the area and named it \\"Bombaim,\\" meaning \\"Good Bay.\\" Later, as part of the dowry, the city was handed over to the British Empire in 1661. The British anglicized the name to \\"Bombay,\\" and it became a significant trading and administrative hub during the British Raj in India. As mentioned earlier, the city was officially renamed Mumbai in 1995, following political changes and a demand by the right-wing party Shiv Sena to emphasize the local Marathi culture. Additionally, the renaming was aimed at undoing the English influence on the regional names, reflecting the postcolonial identity of India. In conclusion, the current name of the city, whose previous name is the same as the movie featuring the song \\"Humma Humma,\\" is Mumbai. This movie is the Bollywood blockbuster \\"Bombay\\" from 1995.

Senator Hinch says if the government reneges on the \\"breakthrough\\" whistleblower deal he and crossbench colleague Nick Xenophon would retaliate. \\"Hell hath no fury like a crossbencher's scorn,\\" Senator Xenophon said. The pair secured amendments to protect and compensate union whistleblowers while also obtaining an undertaking from the government to extend the same protections - or stronger ones - to whistleblowers in the corporate and public sectors. A parliamentary inquiry will examine the whistleblower protections in the legislation and if it recommends a stronger regime for corporate and public sector whistleblowers, the government will establish an expert advisory panel to draft legislation to implement those reforms. The legislation needs to be introduced by December 2017 and dealt with no later than June 30, 2018, according to the undertaking.

What is the difference between a tuxedo and a normal suit?","completion":"Yes, both questions have the same meaning, and they are asking about the differences between a tuxedo and a suit (sometimes referred to as a regular suit or a normal suit). To answer this question, I will perform the following steps: 1. Define 'tuxedo' and 'suit.' 2. Compare their characteristics and purposes. Step 1: Define 'tuxedo' and 'suit.' A tuxedo is a type of formal attire worn by men, mainly for evening events and black-tie occasions. It typically consists of a black or midnight blue jacket, formal trousers, a waistcoat or cummerbund, and a black bow tie. A suit, on the other hand, is a more versatile attire worn by men for various occasions, including business meetings, weddings, and casual events. It usually comprises a matching jacket and trousers, a collared shirt, and a tie. Step 2: Compare their characteristics and purposes. There are several differences between a tuxedo and a suit: 1. Fabric: Tuxedos often use high-quality, lustrous fabrics like satin or silk on the lapels, buttons, and side stripes of trousers. Suits tend to have more subtle fabrics and typically do not feature these contrasting materials. 2. Lapels: Tuxedo jackets generally have peak or shawl lapels, while suits can have peak, notch, or shawl lapels. 3. Trouser stripes: Tuxedo pants typically have a satin or silk stripe running down the outside leg seam, while suit pants do not. 4. Waist covering: Tuxedos are worn with a waistcoat or a cummerbund, while suits often have a belt or, sometimes, suspenders. 5. Shirt and ties: Tuxedos are generally worn with a wing or turn-down collar shirt and a black bow tie, while suits are worn with a collared shirt and a long tie. 6. Occasion: Tuxedos are specifically designed for formal occasions, while suits can be worn for a range of events from casual to formal. In conclusion, the questions are indeed asking for the same information, which involves comparing the features and purposes of tuxedos and suits."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Question: If your trouser fly is unfastened what should you do? Options: - do up - tie up - zip up - pick up - button up Explain why a human would choose \\"zip up\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"zip up\\" to answer the question above for several reasons. Here's the step-by-step justification for that choice: 1. Understand the context: The context of the question is referring to a trouser fly, which is the opening in the front of a pair of trousers that allows for ease of dressing and using the restroom. This context helps narrow down the appropriate response. 2. Analyze the options: a. 'do up' - This phrase is ambiguous and could refer to various actions, such as doing up one's hair or dressing up. It doesn't specifically address the issue of an unfastened trouser fly. b. 'tie up' - Tying up refers to using a knot, like with shoelaces or a ribbon. Most trouser flies have either a zipper or buttons, so this option doesn't apply. c. 'zip up' - This phrase directly addresses the problem of the unfastened trouser fly. Many trousers have zippers that need to be zipped up in order to fasten the fly securely. This option is the most accurate and relevant to the situation. d. 'pick up' - This phrase refers to lifting something up or collecting items, and doesn't relate to the context of fastening a trouser fly. e. 'button up' - While this option seems relevant, as some trousers have buttoned flies, it is less common than zippers, and \\"zip up\\" is the better choice for a general response. 3. Choose the most appropriate option: Based on the analysis, \\"zip up\\" is the most accurate and relevant choice as it directly addresses the issue of an unfastened trouser fly in the vast majority of cases. Therefore, a human would choose \\"zip up\\" as the answer because it is the option that best addresses the specific issue of an unfastened trouser fly, and is the most common solution across different types of trousers."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Information: - Lyon or (more archaically) Lyons (or ) is a city in east-central France, in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, about from Paris and from Marseille.

An April 2014 Wesleyan Student Assembly survey that found 47% of respondents felt less safe in fraternity spaces also contributed to the review, Roth said in a statement. \\"The trustees and administration recognize that residential fraternities have contributed greatly to Wesleyan over a long period of time, but we also believe they must change to continue to benefit their members and the larger campus community,\\" Roth and Joshua Boger, the chair of the university's board of trustees, wrote in a joint statement on Monday.

Keeping to a daily routine was easier for Monica than Victoria because Select from the following. a). Monica had good self discipline.. b). Victoria had good self discipline..","completion":"Keeping to a daily routine was easier for Monica than Victoria because Monica had good self-discipline, which allowed her to create a structured schedule and adhere to it consistently. This self-discipline played a significant role in Monica's ability to maintain her daily routine, as she had developed habits and behaviors that supported her goals and helped her stay organized and focused throughout the day. Monica's self-discipline manifested in various ways that were essential to her successfully maintaining a daily routine. She had a strong sense of time management, ensuring that she allocated proper time to her work and personal tasks without allowing one area to overwhelm the other. Monica's determination and dedication to her routine were also apparent, as she would prioritize her daily tasks without getting easily distracted by external factors or procrastination. In contrast, Victoria struggled to keep a daily routine, as she did not possess the same level of self-discipline as Monica. While Victoria may have had some structure to her day, her lack of self-discipline often led her to spend time on tasks that were not essential or to procrastinate, losing sight of her priorities. This tendency to be more lax with her daily schedule resulted in her struggling to maintain consistency, causing her to often fall behind on work or personal goals. Moreover, Monica's self-discipline extended to other areas of her life as well. She maintained a healthy diet and exercise routine, knowing that these habits contributed positively to her overall well-being and productivity. By prioritizing her health and well-being, Monica was better equipped to stay focused and engaged with her daily tasks, further solidifying her ability to consistently adhere to her routine. Victoria, on the other hand, may not have placed the same emphasis on maintaining a healthy lifestyle, which could have impeded her ability to stick to her daily routine. Without the energy and motivation derived from a balanced diet and regular exercise, she may have felt more lethargic and less motivated to complete her daily tasks, making it challenging to maintain a consistent routine. In summary, keeping to a daily routine was easier for Monica than Victoria because Monica had good self-discipline which enabled her to effectively manage her time, prioritize her tasks and maintain a healthy lifestyle. This discipline allowed Monica to stay focused, organized, and consistent in her daily routine, while Victoria's lack of self-discipline resulted in her struggling to uphold the same level of consistency in her daily life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was on the Mexican supply train Bowie attacked on November 26? By October 9, Cos had taken over San Antonio de Béxar. Stephen F. Austin sent an advance scout troop of 90 men under James Bowie and James Fannin to observe the Mexican forces. While taking refuge at Mission Concepción on October 28, they repelled an attack by 275 Mexicans under Domingo Ugartechea during the battle. Austin continued to send troops to Béxar. Bowie was ordered on November 26 to attack a Mexican supply train alleged to be carrying a payroll. The resulting skirmish became known as the Grass Fight, after it was discovered that the only cargo was grass to feed the horses. When Austin was selected to join Branch T. Archer and William H. Wharton on a diplomatic mission to seek international recognition and support, Edward Burleson was named as commander. On December 5, James C. Neill began distracting Cos by firing artillery directly at the Alamo, while Benjamin Milam and Frank W. Johnson led several hundred volunteers in a surprise attack. The fighting at the Siege of Béxar continued until December 9 when Cos sent word he wanted to surrender. Cos and his men were sent back to Mexico, but would later unite with Santa Anna's forces.Approximately 300 of the Texian garrison at Béxar departed on December 30 to join Frank W. Johnson and James Grant on the Matamoros Expedition, in a planned attack to seize the port for its financial resources. Proponents of this campaign were hoping Mexican Federalists would oust Santa Anna and restore the 1824 constitution. When Sesma crossed the Rio Grande, residents of the Gulf Coast began fleeing the area in January 1836. Santa Anna ordered General José de Urrea on February 16 to secure the Gulf Coast. About 160 miles (260 km) north of Matamoros at San Patricio, Urrea's troops ambushed Johnson and members of the expedition on February 27 at the Battle of San Patricio. Sixteen Texians were killed, six escaped, and 21 were taken prisoner. Urrea's troops then turned southwest by some 26 miles (42 km) to Agua Dulce Creek and on March 2 attacked a group of the expedition... A:","completion":"The Mexican supply train that Bowie attacked on November 26 was discovered to be carrying only grass used for feeding horses. The train was initially alleged to be carrying a payroll, thus the attack was intended to disrupt Mexican forces resources.

Bellamy is convinced of his guilt but Anne is less sure. Much of her practice is with troubled young people and she feels there is more to the story than the police evidence. Anne visits Harry in prison. He is depressed and distrustful but finally agrees to talk to her. Harry's story is that he took a Bentley Continental car to impress a girl but when she went off with another boy decided to take the car for a spin before dumping it. Swerving to avoid another car he burst a tyre but could not find any tools in the boot to change the wheel. He asked the driver of a car parked in the copse nearby for help but he was occupied with his girl and refused. Harry was spotted by a policeman on a bike who stopped to help. He flagged down a lorry to ask to borrow a jack. The lorry stopped but the passenger immediately produced a gun and shot the policeman. Harry managed to grab the gun off the killer as the lorry drove away. Shortly after, a police car arrived and Harry was arrested. Anne believes Harry's story and tries to persuade Bellamy of Harry's innocence. She interviews Harry several times and begins to follow up some aspects of his story. She visits the gang that Harry hung out with in a café in Battersea and they agree to help her by trying to find the couple in the parked car. She also visits Taplow, the man whose car was stolen, several times and finds his account unconvincing.

Next question: who played michael myers in the rob zombie halloween movie?","completion":"In the Rob Zombie-directed Halloween movies, the character of Michael Myers was primarily portrayed by Tyler Mane. Tyler Mane, born Daryl Karolat, is a Canadian actor and former professional wrestler. He stands at an imposing height of 6 feet 8 inches (2.03 m), which made him an imposing figure for the role of the infamous killer, Michael Myers. Prior to his role in the Halloween remakes, Tyler Mane was known for his work as a professional wrestler and for portraying Sabretooth in the 2000 film X-Men. Rob Zombie, a musician, filmmaker, and screenwriter, reimagined the classic Halloween slasher films, originally directed by John Carpenter, in two films released in 2007 and 2009. The first movie, titled Halloween (2007), is a partial remake and partial reimagining of the 1978 original film. The story explores the origins of the character Michael Myers and delves into his childhood, providing a deeper understanding of the character's motives. The second film, Halloween II (2009), is a direct sequel to Zombie's 2007 film and provides a unique take on the story, further developing the saga of Michael Myers and Laurie Strode. In both of these films, Tyler Mane brings a terrifying physical presence to the role of the masked serial killer. Though Tyler Mane's portrayal of Michael Myers was well-received by many horror fans, there were others who found the reinterpretation of the classic character to be too different from the original depiction by Nick Castle in John Carpenter's Halloween (1978). Consequently, the Rob Zombie-directed Halloween films have been met with mixed reviews from both fans and critics. Despite the mixed reception, Tyler Mane's portrayal as Michael Myers remains an integral part of the Halloween franchise and the character's history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Here is a news article: It came without warning. It would start with a howling noise from a senior football player at Sayreville War Memorial High School, and then the locker room lights were abruptly shut off. In the darkness, a freshman football player would be pinned to the locker room floor, his arms and feet held down by multiple upperclassmen. Then, the victim would be lifted to his feet while a finger was forced into his rectum. Sometimes, the same finger was then shoved into the freshman player’s mouth. This disturbing hazing within the storied Sayreville football program, as told to NJ Advance Media on Wednesday by the parent of a player in the program, happened almost every day in the locker room this fall, he said. The allegations — revealed for the first time — provide details to the events that sparked a criminal investigation by local and county police, and prompted the cancellation of the remainder of the Sayreville football season this week by Superintendent of Schools Richard Labbe. The parent, informed by his son and other parents close to the investigation, is the first to come forward to reveal the hazing practices Labbe has characterized as “incidences of harassment, intimidation and bullying as constituted by the definition within the anti-bullying statute that took place on a pervasive level, on a wide-scale level, and at a level in which the players knew, tolerated, and in general accepted.” According to the parent, whose identity is being protected because the parent feared retribution against the family and the player, the routine was initiated when an upperclassman would enter the locker room and make a wolf call or howling noise. “[For] 10 seconds, the lights would go off and they would grab a freshman and they would go on,” the parent said. “Right on the floor. … It was happening every day. They would get the freshmen.” He added: “Kids would just sit around and witness [stuff] like this.” Detectives from the Middlesex County Prosecutors Office and the Sayreville Police Department are investigating the allegations, but officials have refused to reveal any specifics about the case. The parent said his son and several other Sayreville players have been questioned by police. No charges have been filed. The parent also said he is in the process of retaining an attorney. “These parents here, they’re in shock,” the parent said. “We never expected anything like this to happen. Your kid, he’s going to school, school’s got to be a place where you think the kid is the safest.” When told of the specific allegations over the phone Wednesday, Labbe declined to comment. He referred to his previous comments calling the allegations “very serious.” The Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office declined comment on the allegations detailed by the Sayreville parent. Also, David Abromaitis, a detective in the office, declined comment Wednesday when reached by phone. The parent said the “ringleaders” involved in the hazing are seniors. Madeline Thillet, speaking at Tuesday night’s board of education meeting, said her son was one of the members of the team interviewed by investigators. She downplayed the hazing while protesting the cancellation of the season. “I was at the police station with him when they were questioning him,” she said. “They were talking about a butt being grabbed. That’s about it. No one was hurt. No one died. I don’t understand why they’re being punished. I think that the forfeited game was punishment enough.” The parent said he could not “understand how none of the coaches were aware of it. As a coach, you know what’s going on in your clubhouse. You know what’s going on in the locker room.” On Oct. 1, Labbe said he was alerted to an anonymous allegation made to Sayreville police about a serious incident of inappropriate conduct —possibly more — by members of the football team. The next day, the matter was turned over to the Middlesex County prosecutor and Labbe canceled Sayreville’s football games — varsity, junior varsity and freshman contests — last weekend against rival South Brunswick. Then, on Friday, in a separate incident, an attorney for assistant coach Charles Garcia said his client had resigned after details of his arrest for steroids possession surfaced. On Monday, Labbe announced he was canceling the rest of the season. The hazing allegations have turned Sayreville’s no frills, blue-collar community upside-down, as both local and national news vans and media reporters have descended on the town, scouring the streets and interviewing people in parking lots and strip malls. Many Sayreville residents have expressed outrage over the cancellation of the football season. The varsity team, nicknamed the Bombers, has made the playoffs in each of the past 20 seasons, and Sayreville has captured three state championships over the past four years, feeding nearby Rutgers University with a host of elite players. Sayreville longtime football coach George Najjar declined comment when reached by phone Wednesday. More than a hundred Sayreville residents attended Tuesday night’s previously scheduled board of education meeting to urge the members to reconsider the decision to cancel the season. The crowd, at times, grew heated and animated, but the board affirmed the decision to end the football season. Afterward, about a hundred people gathered under the lights on the football field, lingering for about 15 minutes, gazing across the impressive stadium, until it was time to go home.

The decision came after an emotional meeting that lasted more than two hours at the school with Labbe and parents of football players. The decision to cancel the season affects all levels of play -- freshman, junior varsity and varsity, Labbe said. The Sayreville Police Department and Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office are investigating allegations, and based upon the initial findings, \\"there was enough evidence to substantiate there were incidents of harassment, intimidation and bullying that took place on a pervasive level, on a wide-scale level, and at a level in which the players knew, tolerated and in general accepted,\\" Labbe said after the meeting. He added: \\"This is a very sad day in Sayreville.\\" Labbe did not identify the victims or alleged perpetrators, and said the school district will determine punishment if charges are filed against the alleged perpetrators. The announcement is sure to rock the New Jersey high school football community and the storied Sayreville program, which has won three state championships in the past four years. Parents emerged from the meeting tense and angry, with many speeding away without speaking to reporters. \\"It’s bogus,\\" said Curtis Beckham, whose son is on the varsity team. \\"They’re holding the kids accountable and not holding the coaching staff and the teachers accountable. I don’t think what they’re doing is fair. A lot of the students who are innocent, they’re suffering.\\" \\"I'm outraged that their season is taken away from them and they did nothing wrong,\\" added Theresa Tamburri, whose daughter is a freshman cheerleader at Sayreville. \\"Let them play. Give them their season back. Give them what they worked hard for.\\" The meeting was called after it was revealed by Labbe last week that \\"inappropriate conduct of a significant and serious nature\\" had taken place within the Sayreville football program. Several people with knowledge of the allegations told NJ Advance Media the inappropriate conduct was hazing, and one parent said freshmen football players would \\"stampede\\" to the locker room after practices to get dressed before senior players entered. Sayreville canceled games across all levels of play this past weekend, and Labbe hinted last week more games could be forfeited. Unable to calm angry parents at last week's press conference, Labbe called for a private session -- closed to the media -- with parents on Monday night. The parking lots at Sayreville High filled shortly before 7 p.m. with cars decorated with Bombers flags, stickers and pennants. Men wearing football varsity jackets and state championship T-shirts and holding a Sayreville flag crowded around the back of the school and acted aggressively toward reporters, warning them not to take photographs or attempt to speak to parents after the meeting. The men followed reporters throughout the parking lot, and more than once, one of the men declared, \\"Not in our town!\\" Before the hazing allegations surfaced Friday, Charles Garcia, an assistant coach on the varsity team, was arrested and charged with possession of steroids following a traffic stop in Somerset County, police said. Garcia has not commented, but his attorney said the coach had resigned his position. Sayreville head coach George Najjar also has been silent since news of the arrest and the hazing allegations have come to light. He declined to comment Friday when approached by a reporter. When asked about the coaching staff and what role they may have played in the bullying, Labbe said he \\"cannot comment on personnel matters.” Tamburri, the mother, said that the cheerleaders and marching band will also not be able to perform the rest of the season. Her daughter, Jennifer Tamburri, a freshman cheerleader, said the school community is reeling from the news. \\"Everybody was crying when they heard,\\" Jennifer Tamburri said. \\"It's just terrible seeing everyone so upset.\\" Vernal Coleman and Jeremy Schneider of NJ Advance Media contributed to this report.

Play a memory game.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Unleashing the Power of Your Memory: Strategies for Effective Learning Introduction In today's fast-paced society, having an excellent memory plays a vital role in achieving success in various aspects of life. Whether you're a student, a professional, or simply someone who wants to improve their learning abilities, it's essential to know the most effective techniques to boost your memory. This article explores various memory-enhancing strategies, such as studying in intervals, self-quizzing, using sensory information, and playing memory games. 1. Studying in Intervals Learning in short, focused sessions followed by breaks - also known as interval studying - has been proven to significantly improve retention. This technique, based on the Pomodoro principle, involves breaking study sessions in manageable chunks, typically of 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break. The logic behind this approach draws from cognitive research, which reveals that our brains tend to fade out when focusing on a single task for an extended duration. By introducing breaks into study sessions, we allow our brains to rest and recharge, leading to improved focus and better retention of information. As a result, interval studying promotes an optimal learning environment. 2. Self-Quizzing Self-testing or quizzing is a powerful method of reinforcing our memory of new concepts. When we quiz ourselves, we engage in active recall, forcing our brains to retrieve information we've learned. This process solidifies new pathways in our memory, effectively enhancing recall. Moreover, self-quizzing allows us to identify areas of weakness that require further attention. Upon identifying these areas, it becomes easier to allocate additional study time and resources to reinforce the knowledge. Thus, self-testing is not only an effective method for memory enhancement but also offers a detailed roadmap for focused improvement. 3. Using Sensory Information Incorporating multiple senses in the learning process can lead to enhanced recall of information. When we use multiple senses to absorb data, our brain stores this information in different regions. As a result, multiple pathways are formed, making it easier to recall the learned material. For instance, when you're studying a new topic, you can use visual aids, listen to an audiobook or watch instructional videos, engage your sense of touch by writing or drawing, and even use mnemonics that involve taste or smell. This multisensory approach allows you to store the information in different ways, leading to better retrieval and stronger memory. 4. Playing Memory Games Games that challenge your memory can be a fun and engaging way to boost your cognitive abilities. By playing memory games, your brain undergoes mental exercise that strengthens the connections between different regions, leading to improved memory performance. There are various types of memory games available, such as puzzles, matching games, and association games. These games not only stimulate your brain, but they also help maintain your mental agility and cognitive resilience, making the learning process more effective and enjoyable. Conclusion Sharpening your memory skills has a wide range of benefits, both in personal and professional settings. By implementing the strategies outlined in this article – studying in intervals, self-quizzing, using a multisensory approach, and playing memory games – you can strengthen your cognitive abilities and achieve optimal learning outcomes. So, why wait? Start employing these techniques today and unlock the full potential of your memory."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is very important that you answer your doctor’s questions accurately and honestly, as some drugs are not suitable to be taken in conjunction with Botox treatments. Even health supplements such as vitamin tablets and fish oils should be brought to your doctor’s attention, as these can thin the blood and cause more bruising post-treatment.

I have watched quite a few Cold Case episodes over the years, beginning with Season 1 episodes back in 2003-2004. And while most have been good, this particular episode was not only the best of the best, but has few rivals in the Emmy categories. Though some may not agree with the story content (i.e. the male-to-male romantic relationship), I doubt that anyone could watch this without being deeply moved within their spirit. The story is essentially about a case that was reopened, based on the testimony from a dying drug dealer. The two central actors are two police officers in the 1960's named Sean Coop (aka, the cold case victim who goes by his last name, Coop) and his partner, Jimmy Bruno. In the story, Coop is single, a Vietnam war vet, with a deeply troubled past. Jimmy, however, is married, with children no less. Both are partners on the police force and form not only a friendship, but a secret romantic relationship that they both must hide from a deeply and obviously homophobic culture prevalent at that time. The flashback scenes of their lives are mostly in black and white, with bits of color now and then sprinkled throughout. Examples include their red squad car, the yellow curtains gently blowing by the window in Jimmy's bedroom, where Jimmy's wife watched Coop and Jimmy drink, fight, and then kiss each other while being in an alcohol-induced state. I found it interesting that only selected items were colored in the flashback scenes, with everything else in black and white. I still have not figured out the color scheme and rationale. The clearly homophobic tension between fellow patrol officers and the two central actors only heightens the intensity of the episode. One key emotional scene was when Coop was confronted by his father after the baptism of Jimmy's baby. In this scene, Coop's father, Sarge, who was a respected fellow officer on the force, confronts Coop about the rumors surrounding Coop's relationship with Jimmy. One can feel sorry for Coop, at this point, as the shame and disgrace of Coop's father was heaped upon Coop - \\"You are not going to disgrace our family...and you're not my son, either.\\" - clearly indicative of the hostile views of same-sex relationships of that era. Additional tension can also be seen in the police locker room where Coop and another officer go at it after Coop and Jimmy are labeled \\"Batman and Robin homos\\". As for the relationship between Coop and Jimmy, it's obvious that Coop wanted more of Jimmy in his life. Once can see the tension in Jimmy's face as he must choose between his commitment to his wife and kids, his church, and yet his undying devotion to Coop. In the end, Jimmy walks away from Coop, realizing that he cannot have both Coop and his family at the same time. Sadly, Coop is killed, perhaps because of his relationship with Jimmy, but Coop may also have been killed for his knowledge of drug money and police corruption that reached higher up in the force. The most moving scene in the whole episode was when Coop, as he sat dying from gunshot wounds in his squad car, quietly spoke his last words over his police radio to his partner: \\"Jimmy...we were the lucky ones. Don't forget that.\\" The soundtrack selection was outstanding throughout the episode. I enjoyed the final scene with the actor Chad Everett, playing the still grieving Jimmy, only much older by now, and clearly still missing his former partner, Coop. I highly recommend this episode and consider it the best. It is without a doubt the most well-written, well-acted, and well done of all Cold Case episodes that I've ever seen.

Q: Is this product review positive? Title: Just Great! Review: Brought back memories of my teen years when these tunes were just recorded. Great sound. Answer: The answer is:","completion":"Yes, this product review is positive. There are several reasons that one can infer this from the given information: 1. The title of the review itself is \\"Just Great!\\"; this exclamation signifies enthusiasm and satisfaction with the product, hinting at the reviewer's overall positive experience. 2. The reviewer mentions that the product has \\"brought back memories of [their] teen years,\\" which implies that the product was successful in eliciting feelings of nostalgia. This connection to fond personal memories often leads to a favorable evaluation of the product. Additionally, the reviewer is clearly appreciative of the connection to their past experiences, which would contribute to their positive perspective. 3. Another significant point mentioned in the review is the product's \\"great sound.\\" This statement directly commends the quality of the product, focusing on one of its primary features. When a reviewer emphasizes an aspect like sound quality, it demonstrates that the product has met or exceeded expectations in crucial areas of performance. 4. Furthermore, the reviewer's mention of their teen years, along with the reference to the time when \\"these tunes were just recorded,\\" indicates that they are likely knowledgeable about the material and consider themselves an experienced listener. Their positive review carries greater weight since they are familiar with the context during which the music was produced. Therefore, a positive review from someone with such a background speaks volumes about the product's quality and appeal. 5. Lastly, the review's overall tone is upbeat and complimentary. There is an absence of any negative comments or criticisms, which supports the idea that the reviewer's experience was primarily positive.

What is the answer: The USA purchased Alaska in 1867 from which country?","completion":"The United States of America purchased Alaska in 1867 from the Russian Empire. This historical event, known as the Alaska Purchase, took place during the tenure of U.S. Secretary of State, William H. Seward, during President Andrew Johnson's administration. The Russian Empire had experienced financial strains and was struggling to preserve and maintain its extensive territories. Facing an imminent threat of being possibly overpowered by the British Empire, which already had interests in the North American Pacific Coast, Russia decided to sell Alaska to the USA. This decision was driven by the belief that pitching the sale to the USA would be a strategic move to counter Britain and avoid engaging in a high-stakes military conflict. In this context, the Russian Tsar Alexander II initiated negotiations with the United States, which culminated in William H. Seward's agreement to purchase the vast territory for 7.2 million, an amount that equated to approximately two cents per acre. The treaty, signed on March 30, 1867, was largely facilitated by the Russian Minister to the United States, Eduard de Stoeckl. The Alaska Purchase was a subject of controversy and criticism in the United States at the time. Many detractors referred to the acquisition as \\"Seward's Folly\\" or \\"Seward's Icebox,\\" implying that the new territory was a colossal waste of resources. However, subsequent valuable discoveries of gold, timber, fish, and later, oil, proved these initial reactions to be short-sighted. Over time, Alaska's strategic geographical location proved to be advantageous for the United States, particularly during World War II and the Cold War. In January 3, 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed a proclamation admitting Alaska as the 49th state of the United States of America. To sum up, the USA purchased Alaska in 1867 from the Russian Empire, in a historic agreement known as the Alaska Purchase. The decision to sell Alaska was mainly driven by Russia's willingness to counter Britain's influence and its own financial challenges. The acquisition turned out to be a valuable long-term investment for the United States, which benefitted not only from Alaska's abundant natural resources but also from its strategic geographical position."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Attach crochet thread to your crochet hook using a slipknot, then work up 21 chain stitches. Check the \\"Tips\\" section for information on making slip knots and chain stitches. You can vary the length of this foundation chain, but make sure that your chains equal a number divisible by your intended groupings plus one. A standard grouping will be five stitches, so your chain count should be a multiple of five plus one extra: 21, 26, 31, 36, etc. The extra chain will be your turning chain. You won't work into it, so in essence, it only exists to make the edge of the lace look smoother. Crochet thread will give your lace a light, delicate appearance. If you want to crochet thicker lace, though, you can use a lightweight or worsted weight yarn instead of thread. Keep in mind that a heavier yarn will require a larger crochet hook, as well. Insert the hook into the second chain from the hook, wrap the yarn over the hook, and draw the loop back through to the front of the stitch. Slide the tip of a knitting needle or dowel into this loop. The size of your knitting needle or dowel will determine how large your loops are and how big your rows will be. A larger circumference will create bigger lace rows. Draw up loose loops in the remaining 19 stitches of your foundation chain. Slide the needle across the chain and into each loop, gathering all 20 loops onto the handle of the needle at the same time. For each stitch, insert the hook into stitch, yarn over it, and draw a loop up through to the front. Insert the knitting needle into that loop before moving onto the next stitch. Slide your crochet needle underneath the first five loops. Make one chain stitch through the top of this grouping to close it. You can either remove the knitting needle as you work on your groupings or keep it in. Do whichever option feels easiest for you. Work five single crochets into the middle of all five loops in your grouping. See the \\"Tips\\" section for instructions on single crocheting. Note that the number of single crochets you make will depend on the number of loops in your grouping. Five loops in your grouping means five single crochets; four loops in your grouping would mean four single crochets, and so on. This step completes your first grouping. Insert your hook through the next five loops, chain one, then single crochet through the centers five times. Continue this step until you have created groupings for all of your original loops across the row. For a set of 20 loops, you will have four groupings. The single crochets you worked up in your first row will provide the base for your second row. Draw up loose loops from each of these single crochet stitches to start your second row, using the same technique used for the first row. Insert the crochet hook through the stitch, yarn over, and pull the loop through to the front. Slide this loop onto the knitting needle before moving onto the next stitch. This row should have the same number of loops in it as your first row. As before, you need to gather the loops into groupings and single crochet into each grouping. Do this across the row until you run out of loops. Insert your crochet hook into five loops, chain one, then single crochet five times into the middles of all the loops on your hook. Repeat across the row. Follow this same pattern to create as many rows of broomstick lace you need. Draw up loose loops from the stitches in the previous row and form groupings from those loops. When you reach the end of your lace piece, cut the yarn, leaving a 2-inch (5-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten off the crochet thread. Any remaining excess should be carefully woven into the back of the piece to hide it from sight and further secure the thread. Summary:","completion":"This article teaches you how to make broomstick lace by creating chain stitches, forming loop groupings, and single crocheting them together using a crochet hook and a knitting needle or dowel."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Boys' Life is the official youth magazine of the Boy Scouts of America, first published in 1911. It serves as a platform for the scouts to learn about outdoor activities, personal development, and citizenship.

Galaxy Science Fiction, on the other hand, was a popular American science fiction magazine first published in 1950. Its founding editor, H. L. Gold, intended it to be a magazine that showcased high-quality socio-political science fiction stories. Galaxy Science Fiction published works of many famous authors, such as Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, and Frederik Pohl. It played a significant role in shaping American science fiction during the mid-20th century. Though the print run ceased in 1980, it later resurfaced as an online magazine.

Add 1868*t to both sides to eliminate the t term from the left side: -1868*t + 1868*t - 33748 = -334*t + 1868*t This results in: -33748 = 1534*t Step 3: Solve for t Now that we have isolated the variable term, we can solve for 't'.

Eritrea has achieved significant improvements in health care and is one of the few countries to be on target to meet its Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets in health, in particular child health. Life expectancy at birth has increased from 39.1 in 1960 to 59.5 years in 2008, maternal and child mortality rates have dropped dramatically and the health infrastructure has been expanded. Due to Eritrea's relative isolation, information and resources are extremely limited and according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) found in 2008 average life expectancy to be slightly less than 63 years.

Venus is known as the Earth' \\"twin\\" because the planets are so like each other in size. The diameter of Venus is about 7,520 miles (12,100km), about 400 miles (644km) smaller than that of the earth. No other planet comes closer to the earth than Venus. At its nearest approach it is about 25,000,000 miles (402,000,000km) away. As seen from the earth, Venus is the first planet or star that can be seen in the western sky in the evening. At other times, it is the last planet or star that can be seen in the eastern sky in the morning. When Venus is near its brightest point, it can be seen in the daylight. Early astronomers called the object that appeared in the evening Hesperus, and Phosphorus in the morning. Later they realized these two objects were the same planet. They named it Venus in honor of the Roman goddess of love and beauty. Which of the following is NOT a fact about Venus? A) It's the nearest neighboring planet of the earth. B) It used to be called Phosphorus and Hesperus. C) It's usually 25,000,000 miles away from the earth. D) It can sometimes be seen together with the sun in the sky.

Article: Many times when children make a mistake,starting with breaking a window while playing football or skipping classes and ending with stealing something or fighting with another child,parents are always blamed by the society for not having known how to educate their offsprings .The situation is not that easy to explain. Parents always look for the best interest of their children and many times they are ready to take measures only for their sake.They know their children are suffering when they are forced to stay indoors or when they have no money,but they have to teach them a lesson so that they won't repeat the same mistakes over and over again.When a child realizes that his father is talking seriously about him not being allowed to do something,he understands the seriousness of his deeds and he knows he will think twice before making the same mistake again. These are the cases of the responsible parents,who suffer when they see that their children are not happy but who resist the temptation of forgiving them so easily so that they realize the gravity of their actions not only at present but also in the future. On the other hand there are parents who always find excuses for their children's behavior,who never consider they make mistakes or if they just do what they call \\"childish\\" things. When you buy your children everything he has ever dreamt of or when you tell him he can wear a necklace even if he is only 13,he will become so spoiled that he won't take into consideration anything of what you are telling him later on.He will get to the point where he steals from the house or from a shop so that he can afford to buy cigarettes or drugs.

In \\"Eternal Prisoner,\\" Madame White Snake's bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning \\"he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.\\" Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale.

Their reliable information enabled NC House Democrats to weather the storm and become the only legislative chamber in the Southeast where Democrats gained seats.” Representative Grier Martin North Carolina House Democratic Caucus Campaign Committee “We came to PPP after a public poll in the San Jose Mayoral race showed our opponent ahead by 8 points. They found our candidate (Sam Liccardo) ahead by 3 points and that allowed us to be able to push back with the press against the perception that our opponent was now a strong favorite in the race. Sam ended up winning by 2 points and is now the next Mayor of San Jose. PPP worked very fast and had a very accurate read on the electorate when we needed them” Eric Jaye Storefront Political Media “We were in a \\"safe\\" district, but in a \\"bad\\" year, and our opponent started receiving independent expenditures. We needed a read on whether the opponent was gaining traction. For a week, our non-solution was to lose sleep. Then, we asked PPP to do a poll. In less than 24 hours, and for a reasonable price, we were able to get the peace of mind that we didn't need to ratchet up our direct mail. In the end, the PPP poll gave us a result that allowed us to save money on additional mail.

One had it passing with 53% of the vote, one had it passing with 55%, and one had it passing with 56%. Our bond ended up getting 54%, right in line with what they’d been telling us. Their polls were a cost effective way of letting us know that we were on the right track throughout the campaign, and now more than 42,000 students in Marion County will benefit from this additional community investment in our public schools.” Ray Seaman Yes for Marion (FL) Schools “PPP helped us navigate a very tricky path as we needed to win nearly all of our competitive races in districts where Senator McConnell and other national Republicans enjoyed substantial leads throughout the campaign. PPP was not only extremely accurate , their affordability allowed us to initially test 25 districts, strike those from our program that were not competitive and focus the bulk of our resources on those races where we knew we could make a difference.

Scott Brown by a slight margin, a Public Policy Polling survey concluded Tuesday. Brown, attempting to retain the seat he won in a 2010 special election against Attorney General Martha Coakley, is facing Democratic competition from Warren, Middleton immigration attorney Marisa DeFranco and corporate lawyer James Coyne King. The poll of 936 Massachusetts voters conducted between March 16-18 showed Warren carrying a 5 percentage point lead over Brown, with 46 and 41 percent respective support. The poll, conducted by the Democratic polling company, has a 3.2 percent margin of error. Several nonpartisan polls over the past month, including one conducted by Western New England University through a partnership with The Republican and MassLive, have showed Brown holding a solid lead over Warren. This poll concluded that voters are split as to whether Brown is the independent voice for the Bay State he says he is with 41 percent saying he is and another 41 percent saying he is “a partisan voice for the national Republican Party.\\" Warren's overall favorability rating sits at 46 percent with 33 percent holding an unfavorable view of her. Brown's job approval was 45 percent with 42 percent of those surveyed saying they disapprove of what he is doing in the U.S. Senate. Among voters according to party affiliation, Brown has 89 percent support from Republicans, 17 percent from Democrats and 48 percent of independents, the poll concluded. Warren's support came from 72 percent of Democrats, 36 percent of independents and three percent of Republicans. “Scott Brown’s still strong with independents, but not nearly as strong as he was in 2010,” said Dean Debnam, president of Public Policy Polling in a statement. “Elizabeth Warren’s doing 20 points better with those voters than Martha Coakley did, and that’s why she has a small early lead in this race.” And despite Republican attempts to paint Harvard University, Warren's place of employment, as elitist, the poll concluded that a majority of people have a favorable impression of the school. Of those asked, 57 percent said they have a positive impression of Harvard while only 19 percent said they hold an unfavorable view. Public Policy Polling Mass.

A routing number consists of a five digit transit number (also called branch number) identifying the branch where an account is held and a three digit financial institution number corresponding to the financial institution. The number is given as one of the following forms, where XXXXX is the transit number and YYY is the financial institution number: Can we conclude that is the transit number the same as a routing number?","completion":"No, we cannot conclude that the transit number is the same as a routing number, as these terms refer to different concepts within the banking system, although they are related and sometimes used interchangeably. It is important to distinguish between the two correctly to avoid confusion. Transit Number: The transit number, as you mentioned, is a five-digit number (also called a branch number) that identifies the specific branch where an account is held. This number is unique to a particular branch within the same bank and helps in streamlining transactions and operations. Transit numbers are used primarily within a country's banking system for domestic transactions, especially in countries like Canada. Routing Number: On the other hand, a routing number is a combination of a transit number and a financial institution number, which is typically a nine-digit code used in the United States and some other countries. It is used to identify a financial institution and its branch location to facilitate electronic funds' transfers, including wire transfers, ACH transfers (Automated Clearing House), direct deposits, bill payments, and other transactions. The routing number consists of two parts: 1. Transit Number (or Branch Number): As mentioned before, this is a five-digit code that identifies the specific branch of a financial institution where the account is held. 2. Financial Institution Number: This is a three-digit code that represents the financial institution or bank itself. In the U.S., routing numbers can also be found in the format XXXXYYYYZ, where XXXX is the Federal Reserve Routing Symbol, YYYY is the financial institution number, and Z is the check digit. The Federal Reserve Routing Symbol consists of a 4-digit code representing the Federal Reserve Bank district and the Federal Reserve Bank that serves the financial institution. To summarize, while the transit number forms a part of the routing number and is crucial in identifying a specific branch within a bank, it is not the same thing. The routing number provides a more comprehensive identification by including both the transit number and the financial institution number, allowing for smoother and error-free electronic transactions. So, it is essential to differentiate between these two numbers and use them only for their intended purpose within the banking system."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer: Charlie LeGrand for the following movie plot: Nineteen-year-old high school student Danny Fisher (Elvis Presley) works before and after school in order to support his father (Dean Jagger) and sister Mimi (Jan Shepard). After Danny's mother died, his grieving father lost his job as a pharmacist, and moved his impoverished family to the French Quarter in New Orleans. At work one morning, Danny rescues an older woman, named Ronnie (Carolyn Jones), from her abusive date. After a taxi ride to Danny's high school, she kisses him. Danny responds to some schoolmates' teasing by kissing Ronnie back and then punching one of them in the face. That earns him a trip to the principal's office. Miss Pearson (Helene Hatch), his teacher, tells Danny that he will not graduate. Principal Mr. Evans (Raymond Bailey) is sympathetic, but powerless to help, so Danny decides to drop out of school.When he leaves the school grounds, three young men take him into an alley. Their leader, Shark (Vic Morrow), wants revenge for Danny hitting his brother. Danny defends himself so well that Shark invites him to join them. Later, Mr. Fisher tries to convince his son to stay in school. Instead he helps Shark's gang shoplift at a \\"five-and-dime\\" by singing \\"Lover Doll\\" to distract the customers and staff. Only Nellie (Dolores Hart), a young woman working at the snack bar, notices his complicity in the theft, but she does not turn him in. Danny invites Nellie to a fictitious party in a hotel room; finding nobody else there, she starts crying and leaves after admitting that she still wants to see him again, but not under those conditions.That night, Danny meets Ronnie again at \\"The Blue Shade\\" night club, where he is working.

The Sundance Film Festival has long been a platform for indie filmmakers to showcase their most unique and thought-provoking works. One such film that left a lasting impression in 2015 was \\"6 Desires: DH Lawrence and Sardinia\\" directed by Mark Cousins. A filmmaker known for his visually stimulating and experimental style, Cousins takes viewers on an exploration of the connection between D.H. Lawrence and the Mediterranean island. Body: :Discuss Cousins' approach to telling the story, which includes blending travelogue, literary analysis, and personal diary. :Analyze the primary source materials Cousins uses—the novel \\"Sea and Sardinia\\" and Lawrence's letters. :Describe the challenges the film faced, including disconnect between the viewers and the content, as well as the disjointed narrative. :Tease out the intended meaning of the film's title and how it relates to both Lawrence and Cousins. Cousins approaches the task of telling this story by employing a blend of travelogue, literary analysis, and streams of consciousness. The film is grounded in the primary source materials of Lawrence's novel \\"Sea and Sardinia\\" and his personal letters, which reveal a deeply personal and intimate connection with Sardinia. However, the film is not without its challenges. As Cousins dives headfirst into the thoughts and emotions of Lawrence during his time in Sardinia, the viewer must be prepared for a disjointed narrative. It's often difficult to connect to the film's subject matter, as the audience is left feeling that the true essence of the story lies hidden beneath layers of abstraction. The title of the film, \\"6 Desires: DH Lawrence and Sardinia,\\" is intended to reflect the six separate journeys undertaken by Lawrence and his wife, Frieda, during their stay on the island. As such, viewers might expect to find the same number of desires within each segment. However, what becomes clear is that the film's true focus is not only on Lawrence's encounters but also on Cousins' own personal journey. This duality serves to blur the lines between the characters, resulting in a more immersive experience for the audience. Conclusion: :Discuss the overall impact of the film and the emotions it evokes. :Describe how the film shines a light on the lesser-known aspect of Lawrence's life and work. :End with a nod to the unconventional filmmaking techniques employed by Cousins. Though it may leave some viewers feeling lost and struggling to engage with its content, \\"6 Desires: DH Lawrence and Sardinia\\" is ultimately a unique and thought-provoking exploration of the lesser-known aspects of one of the world's greatest literary figures. As with any experimental endeavor, some may question its merit or coherence, but the film remains a testament to the power of unconventional storytelling. Cousins' unconventional filmmaking, coupled with the beautiful and haunting imagery of Sardinia, invites viewers to reconsider the life and work of D.H. Lawrence through a new lens. Undoubtedly, \\"6 Desires: DH Lawrence and Sardinia\\" is a true Sundance standout, even if it leaves some viewers lost somewhere over The Rainbow."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A new study published today by the scientific journal Addiction shows that alcohol consumption of individuals appears to increase with the number of friends in their drinking group. The impact of drinking group size on alcohol use is stronger for men than women. Most alcohol use among young people occurs in a social context, and peer substance use has long been established as an important predictor of alcohol and other substance use among youngsters. Past research suggests that the mere presence of others seems to have an effect on drinking behaviour, but most of those studies relied on data gathered from experiments performed in artificial laboratory settings or from surveys conducted after drinking sessions have ended, which are notoriously inaccurate. This new study used internet-based questionnaires that study participants completed on their own smartphones to survey almost 200 young adult drinkers in Switzerland every hour while they were drinking in real-life situations, asking them to report the number of friends present and number of drinks they had consumed. Results showed that as the number of friends present increased, so did the number of drinks an individual consumed per hour. This suggests that messages aimed at reducing risk among young drinkers should aim to combat this tendency. The arrival of more drinking buddies at the college bar on a Friday night may be cause for delight, but not necessarily a call for another round of drinks. # Addiction is a monthly international scientific journal publishing peer-reviewed research reports on alcohol, illicit drugs, tobacco, and gambling as well as editorials and other debate pieces. Owned by the Society for the Study of Addiction, it has been in continuous publication since 1884. Addiction is the number one journal in the 2013 ISI Journal Citation Reports Ranking in the Substance Abuse Category (Social Science Edition). Membership to the Society for the Study of Addiction is £85 and includes an annual subscription to Addiction. ||||| In the UK, frequent drinking becomes more common in middle to old age, especially amongst men, according to research published in the open access journal, BMC Medicine. Doctors are seeing a growing number of cases of alcohol misuse among the elderly and this finding supports concerns that older people might be abusing alcohol. Teenagers favour bouts of irregular heavy drinking episodes, only drinking once or twice a week, but as we grow older we shift into a regular drinking pattern. A substantial proportion of older men drink daily or most days of the week, while a majority of women tend to drink monthly or on special occasions. In the UK, the majority of the adult population consume alcohol and the harm associated with alcohol affects all society. Lead author, Dr. Annie Britton, from University College London said \\"Understanding how drinking behaviour fluctuates throughout life is important to identify high risk groups and trends over time. Research on the health consequences of alcohol needs to incorporate changes in drinking behaviour over the life course. The current evidence base lacks this consideration. Failure to include such dynamics in alcohol is likely to lead to incorrect risk estimates.\\" This is the first attempt to harmonise data on drinking behaviour from a wide range of population groups over their lifespan with repeated individual measures of consumption. The findings show how drinking behaviour changes over our lifetimes, from adolescence through to old age, and could be used to design public health initiatives and sensible drinking advice. The researchers looked at both the average amount of alcohol consumed per week and the frequency of drinking. The findings were based on over 174,000 alcohol observations collected over a 34 year period, spanning from 1979 to 2013, from participants born in different eras. Drinking patterns change more for men than for women, but both follow a similar pattern; a rapid increase in alcohol intake during adolescence leading to a peak in early adulthood, followed by a plateau in mid-life, and then a decline into older ages. For men, mean consumption of alcohol rose sharply during adolescence, peaked at around 25 years at 20 units (160g) per week, roughly the equivalent of drinking 10 pints of beer. This declined and plateaued during mid-life, before dropping to 5-10 units, approximately 3-5 pints of beer per week, from around 60 years. Women followed a similar pattern, but reached a lower peak of around 7-8 units per week, around 4 pints of beer. Previous studies linking alcohol consumption with associated harm typically used just one measure of alcohol intake. \\"We have shown that people change the way they consume alcohol as they age, and as such, studies reliant on a single measure of alcohol intake are likely to be biased. It is essential that the dynamic nature of exposure to alcohol over the life span is incorporated into the estimates of harm.\\" # Media Contact Alanna Orpen PR Assistant BioMed Central T: +44 (0)20 3192 2054 E: alanna.orpen@biomedcentral.com Notes to editors 1.

New research shows how your social circle can affect your alcohol habits. (Photo: Getty Images) Hitting the town this weekend? The bigger your posse, the more you’ll end up drinking, a new study suggests. Results of a small study, published in the journal Addiction, show an association between the number of people present in the group while out on the weekend and the number of alcoholic beverages consumed in an hour. The study included 183 young adults in Switzerland with an average age of 23, about half of whom were women. Researchers had them complete cell phone questionnaires on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings over the course of five weekends. The questionnaires asked how much alcohol they consumed and the number of friends present at different hours of the evening (8 p.m, 9 p.m., 10 p.m., 11 p.m., and midnight). Related: Which Is Healthier: Marijuana or Alcohol? Number of friends present in the group seemed to decrease throughout the course of the night on Thursdays, stay stable throughout the course of the night on Fridays, and increase from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Saturdays. The average number of friends ranged from 1.9 to 6.4 for the men, and 1.8 to 5.7 for the women. Overall, researchers found that the more friends present in the group, the more alcohol a person consumed (this effect was stronger for men than for women). Researchers also found that drinking pace accelerated as the evening went on, especially on Fridays and Saturdays. (The researchers posited this is due to the “school night” effect of Thursdays.) “It appears that other factors, such as decreasing self-control as levels of inebriation increase or being increasingly involved in nightlife activities, such as dancing or playing drinking games, may be responsible for the acceleration in drinking pace,” the researchers write. Related: Alcohol Poisoning Kills 6 Americans Daily: You’ll Be Surprised By Who Even though the study was conducted only in French-speaking young adults in Switzerland, the researchers said the findings may still be generalizable to people of similar age elsewhere in the world (though they said more research is needed to confirm this). And since the study only looked at drinking at 8 p.m. and onward, more research is also needed to see how drinking earlier in the evening — also known as “pre-drinking” — could affect results. Alcohol consumption is incredibly common among young adults, with some data suggesting more than three-quarters of people ages 21 to 24 are “current drinkers.” However, many young people drink more than health experts recommend — more than half of young men and more than two-fifths of young women drink more than the daily recommended limit (one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men).

Tropical Storm Manuel has swept onto Mexico's Pacific coast while Hurricane Ingrid swirls offshore on the other side of the country, and heavy rains and landslides caused at least 24 deaths and led authorities to evacuate thousands. Stormy conditions led some communities in affected states to cancel Independence Day celebrations planned for Sunday and Monday. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Manuel began to weaken as soon as it made landfall near the port of Manzanillo on Sunday afternoon, but remains a threat to produce flash floods and mudslides. It is predicted to dissipate by Monday. Scroll down for video. Torrential: A couple wades in a flooded street in Acapulco following tropical storm Manuel which landed on the Pacific coast of Mexico on September 15. Destruction: Residents try to repair a broken bridge in Chilpancingo, Guerrero state, Mexico following the passage of Tropical Storm Manuel on September 15. Evacuated: Inhabitants leave an area affected by floodings of Guamol river at Itsmo de Tehuantepec, Oaxaca, Mexico. In the southern coastal state of Guerrero, authorities said a landslide on the outskirts of Acapulco buried a house and killed six family members. Three people were swept to their deaths by a river, also on the edge of the resort city. A collapsing wall killed one person in the city. Elsewhere in Guerrero, six people died when their pickup truck skidded on a rain-swept highway in the mountains, and landslides killed two more people. The rains caused some rivers to overflow, damaging hundreds of homes and disrupting communications for several hours. Manuel had maximum sustained winds of about 40mph (65kph) and was moving to the northwest at 9mph (15kph) late Sunday afternoon. Its center was about 35 miles (60 kilometers) northwest of Manzanillo. Man power: Army soldiers work to pull their vehicle out of a flooded portion of road caused by Tropical Storm Manuel in the city of Chilpancingo, Mexico on Sunday. Rains from Ingrid caused landslides that killed three people in the central state of Puebla, and a woman died when a landslide buried her house in Hidalgo state. In the southern state of Oaxaca, which was affected by both storms, authorities said a child died after being swept away by a swollen river and a teenager was killed by a landslide. The hurricane center said Ingrid, the second hurricane of the Atlantic storm season, could reach the Mexican mainland by Monday morning. Manuel was expected to dump 10 to 15 inches of rain over parts of Guerrero and Michoacan state, with maximums of 25 inches possible in some isolated areas. Authorities said those rains would present an especially dangerous threat in mountains, where flash floods and mudslides were possible. Extreme weather: Rain water pours into the beach due to heavy rains caused by Tropical Storm Manuel. Mayhem: A car lies on its side after a portion of a hill collapsed due to heavy rains in the Pacific resort city of Acapulco. Helpless: Mexican marines carry an elderly woman to a shelter after her home was flooded by rains caused by tropical storm Manuel. Ingrid also was expected to dump very heavy rains. It had maximum sustained winds of 75mph (120 kph) and was centered about 125 miles (200 kilometers) east-northeast of the port city of Tampico as it moved northwest at 3mph (6kph). A hurricane warning was in effect from Cabo Rojo to La Pesca. From all angles: This image taken Sunday at 2:45am EDT shows Hurricane Ingrid in the Gulf of Mexico approaching the coast and Tropical Storm Manuel just off the western coast of Mexico. In Tamaulipas state to the north, where Ingrid was expected to come ashore, the government said in a statement that Independence Day festivities were cancelled in the cities of Tampico, Madero and Altamira. The September 15 and 16 celebrations commemorate Mexico's battle of independence from Spain. Officials in the Gulf state of Veracruz began evacuating coastal residents Friday night, and civil protection authorities said more than 6,600 people have been moved to shelters or the homes of family and friends. More than 1,000 homes in Veracruz state had been affected by the storm to varying degrees, and 20 highways and 12 bridges had damage, the state's civil protection authority said. A bridge collapsed near the northern Veracruz city of Misantla on Friday, cutting off the area from the state capital, Xalapa. A week ago, 13 people died in the state when a landslide buried their homes in heavy rains spawned by Tropical Depression Fernand.

(CNN) -- Argentina's star-studded line-up began their World Cup campaign with a 1-0 victory over Nigeria in their Group B opener in Johannesburg on Saturday. A goal from defender Gabriel Heinze after six minutes was all that separated the two teams after an inspired display from Nigeria goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama. But South Korea ended the day on top of the group following a 2-0 victory over Greece in Port Elizabeth earlier on Saturday. Goals from Lee Jung-Soo and Park Ji-Sung gave the 2002 semifinalists a comfortable win over the 2008 European cvhampions. Argentina 1-0 Nigeria. Enyeama could do little to stop Heinze's powerful early header from a Juan Sebastian Veron corner, but he kept his team alive with a string of acrobatic saves to deny World Player of the Year Lionel Messi. Diego Maradona was delighted to secure his first victory as a World Cup coach, but critical of his strikers for failing to make the game safe. \\"When you don't kill things off in front of goal you can pay a heavy price. They almost got a draw -- we missed loads of chances,\\" Maradona told AFP. \\"Players such as Leo Messi and Higuain knocked in around 60 goals last season between them, yet today it was almost as if they couldn't set their sights on goal. \\"But the win means we can be calm -- we are in the right track.\\" Enyeama's tip over from a Messi shot led to the early corner from which the unmarked Heinze scored to spark scenes of wild celebration on the Argentina bench, led by Maradona. Messi and Gonzalo Higuain might both have had hat-tricks as Argentina's attacking flair was evident, but at the other end Nigeria also had opportunities to salvage a point. Midway through the second half, Taye Taiwo found space to toe-poke a shot from the edge of the area which went just wide of Sergio Romero's left-hand post. CNN's World Cup twitter.buzz. As the clock ticked down, Enyeama blocked Messi as he looked certain to score but in a swift counter attack Nigeria then had their best chance of the match as Aiyegbeni Yakubu crossed from the right and Kala Uche made a hash of his volleyed attempt from 10 meters out. At the final whistle it was a deserved victory for Argentina, but they will face a sterner test in their next match in five days' time against South Korea. Nigeria, who have lost five and drawn once since their last World Cup finals victory in 1998, will be looking to break that winless run against the Greeks, who also have a poor record in football's global showpiece. South Korea 2-0 Greece. Goals from Lee Jung-Soo and Park Ji-Sung earned South Korea a comfortable 2-0 win against a poor Greek side, who never looked like getting on the score sheet. Central defender Lee opened the scoring in the seventh minute, volleying home from close range from a well directed free-kick delivered by Ki Sung-Yong. South Korea should have gone 2-0 up after 23 minutes when Monaco striker Park Chu-Young was sent through on goal by a defense-splitting pass from the boot of Park Ji-Sung, but goalkeeper Alexandros Tzorvas saved to send the ball onto the roof of the net. The second half carried on where the first finished off, and it was no surprise when Park Ji-Sung added a second goal after 52 minutes. Latching on to a mistake made by Loukas Vyntra, the Manchester United midfielder swept forward into the penalty area before coolly slotting past a helpless Tzorvas. The goal did seem to finally wake Greece from their slumber, and striker Theofanis Gekas forced a fine save from Jung Sung Ryon in the 80th minute, but it was a rare moment of skill in a woeful display. Moments later, Lee Chung-Young nearly added a third for South Korea at the other end. The result means Greece continue their winless World Cup finals record.

With these objectives in mind, let's analyze each option: A. Office: While placing the floor lamp in the office could be a suitable choice, it does not necessarily guarantee that it will be out of the way. Depending on the size and layout of the office, the lamp could still obstruct the room's flow or take up valuable space. B. Desktop: Placing the floor lamp on a desktop is an impractical option. Floor lamps are typically tall and meant to stand on the ground rather than elevated surfaces like a desktop. This may not only be an inefficient use of space but could also pose a safety hazard. C. Corner: Corners are often the ideal location for placing floor lamps. They provide a discrete area that is out of the way while ensuring that the light shines evenly across the room. Additionally, corners typically do not obstruct pathways or clutter valuable floor space. D.

Carlos Condit explains why he returned to fight Demian Maia after hinting at retirement It was less than nine months ago that Carlos Condit was contemplating retirement after dropping a very close split decision to former welterweight champion Robbie Lawler at UFC 195. In the days following the loss, Condit spoke honestly about the long-term damage fighting inflicts on an athlete's mind and body, especially considering he's been competing professionally for more than 13 years with nearly 40 fights on his record. As recently as June, Condit stated that it would probably take a rematch with Lawler or a second bout with former foe Nick Diaz to get him committed to even taking another fight inside the Octagon. So when Condit was announced as the opponent for Demian Maia in the main event for FOX UFC Fight Night this Saturday in Vancouver it came as a shock to many, especially considering how close he seemed to calling it a career just a few months earlier. \\"It is a number of things, but Demian Maia for all intents and purposes is definitely a contender,\\" Condit said when explaining to FOX Sports why he decided to take this fight. \\"I feel like if his style was a little more exciting, he would definitely be the No. 1 contender with all the wins that he has and the guys that he's beaten. \\"So I feel like — no, I don't feel like, I know — this is basically a No. 1 contender eliminator, which kind of doesn't mean a whole lot these days because people are coming and jumping in line and whatever. But I think beating Demian without a doubt gives me legitimacy to give me another title shot very quickly.\\" As much as Condit hinted at retirement after the loss to Lawler, the one thing he makes clear ahead of his return to action is that he never actually lost the desire to fight again. Condit still loves the feeling of stepping into the cage and dueling with another human being in the ultimate form of combat, but he also understands that there will come a day when it's time to walk away. In Condit's mind, he'd prefer to make that decision than to have that decision made for him. \\"It never really went away. I still have it,\\" Condit said about the fire that fuels him to fight. My thoughts on this are I want to be done with the sport before the sport is done with me. I want to quit with a little bit of fire left. I don't want to be just doing this and going through the motions. While Condit never truly closed the door on fighting again, he did seem resigned to sit out the rest of 2016 to focus on some family commitments like the birth of his new baby that's due in September. But when UFC president Dana White came calling with this opportunity and a fight that could put him back into the Octagon with the welterweight title on the line, Condit just couldn't resist. \\"As far as the timing, it was kind of out of left field,\\" Condit explained. \\"I got a call from Dana (White) and he wanted me to do this fight late summer and I wasn't planning on fighting until January. I've got a new baby going to be born in September so I was going to kick back and wait to fight until after that, but it also kind of made sense to go ahead and get a fight out of the way right before the baby's born so I don't have to worry about doing another camp for a while and just focus on my family.\\" Condit knew when he got offered the fight with Maia he knew this could possibly be the toughest stylistic matchup he could face in the UFC right now. Maia is a superb grappler, who rarely looks to engage with an opponent on the feet and instead prefers to drag them to the mat where he can apply his world-class Brazilian jiu-jitsu skills. Fellow welterweight Matt Brown recently found out as a knockout striker just how tough it can be to even land a shot on Maia after the Brazilian wrapped him up like a boa constrictor for three rounds before earning the submission win in the final moments of the bout. On paper, Condit knows that Maia is probably the worst possible fighter for him to face while searching for his signature highlight reel knockout, but that's exactly why this was the perfect matchup to prove he deserves another shot at the gold. \\"He is a stylistic nightmare for a lot of guys, even good grapplers. Because he's just so good in that realm. Hey, if I could get an easier stylistic matchup to get to the No. 1 contender's spot, hell yeah, I'd definitely want to go that route. But it's Demian Maia who they wanted me to fight and I'm excited to try and solve this puzzle,\\" Condit said. \\"I know I have the tools to beat him. If I do the things I've trained how to do, I know I'm going to beat Demian Maia.\\" With five rounds and 25 minutes to work, Condit knows he'll eventually find a home for the perfect punch or a flying knee or any of the other combination of strikes he'll use to finally earn the knockout on Saturday night. Whether it's in the first minute or the last, Condit plans on finishing Maia and sending a strong message to the rest of the welterweight division that \\"The Natural Born Killer\\" is back and he's gunning for gold. \\"Without a doubt.

Now comes President Obama in his State of the Union Address, hoping to do more than just talk about it. The President tackles this perennial conundrum by proposing that the tax code be changed in two very distinct directions: 1) Provide extra money to low- and middle-income families in the form of tax credits for children and working couples. 2) raise taxes on upper-income taxpayers, especially the fabled \\"one percent\\" through various cutbacks and increased restrictions on savings. It is certainly easy to dismiss his suggestions given the makeup of the new Congress, which is controlled by Republicans, but stranger concoctions have been enacted when major tax overhauls are undertaken. So what does the President suggest? In any case, the \\"step-up in basis\\" rule was effectively repealed in 1976, but OPTIONS: - CNN then responded to the ensuing backlash by reversing this repeal retroactively. - Congress then responded to the ensuing backlash by reversing this repeal retroactively. - Obama then responded to the ensuing backlash by reversing this repeal retroactively. - Republicans then responded to the ensuing backlash by reversing this repeal retroactively. - Richard Kaplan then responded to the ensuing backlash by reversing this repeal retroactively. - State of the Union Address then responded to the ensuing backlash by reversing this repeal retroactively.","completion":"The \\"step-up in basis\\" rule fundamentally adjusts the baseline value, or 'basis', of an inherited property or asset for tax purposes. Prior to 1976, the rule underwent an effective repeal. However, this situation was short-lived as Congress then responded to the ensuing backlash by reversing this repeal retroactively. The step-up in basis rule is pivotal because it directly impacts the capital gains tax incurred when an inherited asset or property is sold. Specifically, it 'steps up' the asset's basis value to its market value at the time of the prior owner's death. From a tax perspective, this means that heirs only pay capital gains tax on the asset's appreciation after they've inherited it, not from the time the original owner acquired it. Without the step-up in basis rule, the cost basis of an asset stays locked at its original purchase price. Consequently, without this rule, heirs would be liable to pay taxes on the full increase in value from the original purchase price to its sale price, potentially resulting in substantial capital gains tax liabilities. Therefore, the retroactive reversal of its repeal by Congress in 1976 was a momentous decision. In the situation given, President Obama's intention was to address income inequality through a reevaluation of the tax code. His proposal had two main thrusts: to provide lower and middle-income families with additional funds via tax credits, and to increase taxes on high-income taxpayers, specifically the renowned one percent, via cutbacks and enhanced limitations on savings. This strategy aimed to re-distribute wealth and thus reduce income disparity. Raising taxes on the upper echelons of society, however, is typically met with resistance, particularly in a Republican-controlled Congress, making it challenging to pass such legislation. Despite this, precedent suggests that major tax reforms have been accomplished under unlikely conditions. Thus, Obama's proposal may not have been an impossibility. Considering these complexities, the president's proposition, and Congress's past responses to taxation policies such as the step-up in basis rule, show the intricate interplay between attempts to address income inequality and the political context within they are proposed and potentially enacted. In the future, it will be crucial to continuously evaluate the tax system and make adjustments as necessary to ensure it supports broader fiscal policy goals, including those related to income inequality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: A shifting South Bend forecast Tommy Rees turned 18 on May 22, which means he should be focused on the nuances of shaving. Instead, late Saturday afternoon, he will be carrying the hopes of millions of people, many whose last names begin with a capital O and an apostrophe. He will be in hostile territory, in a marvelous old stadium whose name conjures up images of lions chasing Christians. He will have thousands there in person yelling for him, and many thousands more yelling against him. A national telecast makes that millions. Rees is Notre Dame's quarterback. If this is how youth is served, let us pray for youth. Rees was nine years from being born when Notre Dame began its 11-game winning streak in its cherished rivalry with USC in 1983. He was 9 years old the last time the Fighting Irish actually won a fight on the football field with the Trojans. That was 2001, nine seasons and four coaches ago. Where have you gone, Bob Davie? A nation of desperate Irish fans turns its lonely eyes to you. The enormity of the situation might be too much to comprehend for somebody Rees' age. Notre Dame-USC is not a football game, it's a head-on collision. It thrives in the tradition of Knute Rockne's Gipper speeches and John McKay's one-liners. Its imagery pits the hard winters of the Midwest against the eternal summers of Hollywood. It matches guys who drive tractors against guys who drive convertibles. Opposites are supposed to attract. These opposites attack. Sports love rivalries, and this has been a passion for 84 years. Of course, in recent years, Pete Carroll made the game more like somebody giving a timeout to a 5-year-old. The biology students in blue and gold would take the field and get their horn-rimmed glasses broken. Carroll's teams were always too big, fast and good for the offerings of Tyrone Willingham and Charlie Weis, who left Notre Dame with, for Irish fans, the worst asterisk imaginable next to their records: *Never Beat USC. Now Carroll is gone, USC is without its usual NFL ranking, and some are even giving the Fighting Irish a fighting chance. Into this convergence of alumni hopes and dreams, clashing story lines and university aspirations steps Rees. He is three games into his stewardship of his team, having taken over for an injured Dayne Crist three weeks ago early in the game against Tulsa and solidifying his spot in victories over Utah and Army. Summary:","completion":"Tommy Rees, an 18-year-old Notre Dame quarterback, will be carrying the hopes of millions of fans in a game against USC, marking the latest face-off in a longstanding rivalry between the two football teams.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Democrats now critical of Rice's Benghazi explanation, amid more damaging evidence Congressional Democrats on Sunday distanced themselves from the Obama administration’s explanation of the Benghazi, Libya, attacks in the immediate aftermath of the fatal strikes, amid mounting evidence that suggests the information was revised to intentionally mislead Americans. The original explanation of the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks on the U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya, was written by CIA officials, then revised by State Department and White House officials, according to news reports and witness testimony made available to Fox News. Removed from the CIA's so-called talking points were references to “Islamic extremists” and Al Qaeda in Libya. And five days later, Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, made the Sunday talk show rounds to say the attacks were “demonstrations” sparked by protests in Egypt over an anti-Islamic video on YouTube. However, the video is never mentioned in the numerous talking-points drafts, according to a Weekly Standard story last week, based in part on a 43-page House report and records of official emails. “Well, it was scrubbed,” Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Steve Lynch told “Fox News Sunday.” “It was totally inaccurate. There's no excuse for that. It was false information. And what they try to do is harmonize what happened in Benghazi with what happened everywhere else across the Middle East.” Lynch also acknowledged the talking points were likely revised to reflect President Obama’s decry – with his re-election bid in the balance -- that “Al Qaeda is on the run.” Maryland Democratic Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, also acknowledged Sunday the facts as told by Rice were wrong. “At the time, as it turns out” the information was incorrect, he said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” Ruppersberger, who was briefed by the CIA about the attacks in immediate aftermath, asked agency officials what congressional leaders could tell the public, according to The Weekly Standard story. On Sunday, he also said he welcomes a House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee hearing this week in which Greg Hicks, the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Libya at the time of attacks, is expected to say Rice said the attacks didn’t appear to be “pre-meditated or pre-planned,” despite having information suggesting they were. “That's what an investigation is about,” Ruppersberger told CBS. “Let's get the facts.”","completion":"Congressional Democrats have become critical of the Obama administration's explanation of the Benghazi, Libya attacks in 2012, amid evidence suggesting the information was revised to mislead Americans.

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Eating too much fatty food, exercising too little and smoking can raise your future risk of heart disease. But there is another factor that can cause your heart problems more immediately: the air you breathe. Previous studies have linked high exposure to environmental pollution to an increased risk of heart problem, but two analyses now show that poor air quality can lead to heart attack or stroke within as little as a few hours after exposure. In one review of the research, scientists found that people exposed to high levels of pollutants were up to 5% more likely to suffer a heart attack within days of exposure than those with lower exposure. A separate study of stroke patients showed that even air that the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers to be of \\"moderate\\" quality and relatively safe for our health can raise the risk of stroke as much as 34% within 12 to 14 hours of exposure. The authors of both studies stress that these risks are relatively small for healthy people and certainly modest compared with other risk factors such as smoking and high blood pressure. However, it is important to be aware of these dangers because everyone is exposed to air pollution regardless of lifestyle choices. So stricter regulation by the EPA of pollutants may not only improve environmental air quality but could also become necessary to protect public health. What can we learn from the text? A) Eating fatty food has immediate effects on your heart. B) The EPA conducted many studies on air quality. C) Moderate air quality is more harmful than smoking, D) Stricter regulations on pollutants should be made.

In 1861, it was announced that a Provisional Theatre would be built in Prague, as a home for Czech opera. Smetana saw this as an opportunity to write and stage opera that would reflect Czech national character, similar to the portrayals of Russian life in Mikhail Glinka's operas. He hoped that he might be considered for the theatre's conductorship, but the post went to Jan Nepomuk Maýr, apparently because the conservative faction in charge of the project considered Smetana a \\"dangerous modernist\\", in thrall to avant garde composers such as Liszt and Wagner. Smetana then turned his attention to an opera competition, organised by Count Jan von Harrach, which offered prizes of 600 gulden each for the best comic and historical operas based on Czech culture. With no useful model on which to base his work—Czech opera as a genre scarcely existed—Smetana had to create his own style. He engaged Karel Sabina, his comrade from the 1848 barricades, as his librettist, and received Sabina's text in February 1862, a story of the 13th century invasion of Bohemia by Otto of Brandenburg. In April 1863 he submitted the score, under the title of The Brandenburgers in Bohemia. At this stage in his career, Smetana's command of the Czech language was poor. His generation of Czechs was educated in German, and he had difficulty expressing himself in what was supposedly his native tongue. To overcome these linguistic deficiencies he studied Czech grammar, and made a point of writing and speaking in Czech every day. He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in the Czech language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; The Three Riders and The Renegade were performed at concerts in early 1863. In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Umělecká Beseda, a society for Czech artists. By 1864 he was proficient enough in the Czech language to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech language newspaper...

Article:","completion":"Title: A Fun Guide to Understanding Regulations Hi there, little friend! Today, we are going to learn about regulations. Regulations are like rules that help us know what to do and how to do things the right way. We can find these regulations in big books called the Code of Federal Regulations (or CFR for short). The CFR can help us learn about the rules that are important for many things, like the environment, health, and safety. Now, let's say you found a really cool regulation while exploring the pages of a CFR book and you want to share it with your friends. But how do you tell your friends where to find this regulation? Well, that's where we come in to help. First, start by telling them the name of the regulation. This is like the title of your favorite storybook. This is important because it will help them find the right regulation easily. Next, tell them the CFR title number and the year when the regulation was published. The CFR title number is like the number on the spine of your storybook. The year of publication is like when you first got your favorite storybook. Together, they help your friends know which book to look for and when it was made. Now, you also need to tell them the page numbers where the regulation appears. Just like you tell your friends which page to find your favorite picture in your storybook, this will help your friends know where to find the regulation when they open the book. But, what if your friends don't have the big CFR book? No worries! You can give them a direct URL (like a magic address that takes them to the right place on the internet). This way, they can look at the regulation online! One last thing, remember when you're writing down this information, use commas (,) instead of periods (.) in footnotes. Footnotes are little notes at the bottom of a page that give extra information.

Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","completion":"A detailed analysis of the effects of bread being exposed to the elements can be observed through various steps. Let's first discuss each of the mentioned factors and their impacts before discussing the overall effect on bread being exposed to the air. 1. Bread is exposed to the elements: When bread is left out in the open, it becomes exposed to various environmental factors such as air, water vapor, temperature changes, and dust particles. These elements can directly influence the quality and shelf life of the bread. 2. Bread absorbs water from the air: As the bread is exposed to the elements, it starts absorbing water from the air. The water is absorbed by the bread crumbs, making it softer over time. This process is known as hygroscopicity. If the bread gets too moist, it could become a breeding ground for bacteria and fungi, leading to spoilage and mold growth. 3. Bread absorbs warmth from the air: Bread absorbs warmth from its surroundings, which can accelerate the various chemical reactions happening within the bread, resulting in the degradation of its quality. The warmth also plays a significant role in providing a conducive environment for mold growth as most molds thrive in warm conditions. 4. Dust particles with mold spores fall on bread: Dust particles containing mold spores can fall on the bread exposed to the elements. These mold spores can be carried through the air or come from nearby surfaces. 5. Mold spores start to consume the bread for energy: As the mold spores come in contact with the bread, they begin to consume the nutrients present in the bread and use them as a source of energy for their growth. This process further contributes to the quick spoilage of the bread. 6. Mold colonies grow until they are visible: Over time, the mold colonies will grow in size and multiply, resulting in visible mold spots on the surfaces of the bread. Now, let's address the effect of the supposed perturbation (bread being left out in the elements) on the second factor mentioned (bread absorbing water from the air). When bread is left out in the elements and exposed to the air, the effect on bread absorbing water from the air is increased. This is because the bread gets subjected to varying levels of humidity present in the surroundings. As the humidity levels change, the bread absorbs more or less water, depending on the amount of moisture in the air. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation (bread being left out in the elements) has a direct and significant effect on the second effect, which is bread absorbing water from the air. The increased exposure to the elements leads to an increase in the rate at which the bread absorbs moisture from the air, which accelerates the spoilage process and the growth of mold."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question 1: How good is China's communism? Question 2: How bad is China's communism? Select from the following. a. no b. yes Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"China's communism is an interesting and complex system, with both positive and negative aspects. This answer will fully explore both the advantages and the drawbacks. Question 1: How good is China's communism? China's communist system has been in place since 1949, when the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) led by Mao Zedong came to power. Throughout this period, China's communist system has evolved and gone through numerous transformations, which has had both positive and negative impacts on the country. Pros of China's communism: 1. Economic Growth: Under communist rule, China has experienced tremendous economic growth. It is now the world's second-largest economy and has lifted millions of people out of poverty in the past few decades. Centralized economic planning and state-owned enterprises have driven this growth. 2. Infrastructure Development: The Chinese government has overseen the rapid development of infrastructure projects, such as building roads, highways, bridges, high-speed railways, and airports, which has greatly improved accessibility within the country and helped expand its economic potential. 3. Healthcare and Education: China's communist system has allowed for the establishment of state-funded healthcare and education systems. This has improved access to these services for the majority of the population, raising literacy rates and contributing to the country's better overall health. Question 2: How bad is China's communism? Despite some achievements, China's communist system also has several shortcomings and negative aspects: Cons of China's communism: 1. Human Rights Violations: China's communist regime has been criticized for its strict control over various aspects of citizens' lives, leading to several human rights violations. Censorship and persecution of religious and ethnic minorities, as well as the detention of political dissidents, are evidence of this. 2. Lack of Political Freedom: Under its communist system, China has a single-party rule, which means that there is no room for opposition. Citizens don't have the right to elect their leaders or influence government policies, which can make the government less accountable and transparent. 3. Income Inequality: Despite the economic advances, income inequality in China has substantially increased, which has created a wide gap between the wealthy and the poor. While the communist ideology focuses on equality and wealth redistribution, the reality in China contradicts these principles. 4. Environmental Degradation: China's rapid industrialization and urbanization have led to severe environmental problems. Air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination, and deforestation caused by the communist government's focus on rapid economic growth have had detrimental effects on the country's environment and public health. As for the \\"Select from the following. a. no b. yes\\", the answer to these two questions wouldn't be the same since the first question focuses on the achievements and strong points of China's communism, while the second question addresses the system's drawbacks and negative aspects."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Kentucky... (Associated Press) Anthony Davis and top-seeded Kentucky will play for the national title Monday night after finally putting away pesky Louisville 69-61 in the Final Four on Saturday night. It will be Kentucky's first appearance in the title game since winning a seventh NCAA crown back in 1998 and gives coach John Calipari another shot at the title that has eluded him. The Wildcats (37-2) will face the winner of Kansas-Ohio State. As the final seconds ticked down, Davis pointed to the court and screamed twice \\"This is my stage!\\" Yes, yes, it is. With Davis, everybody's player of the year, leading a star-studded roster, Kentucky was the top seed in the tournament and the heavy favorite to cut down the nets when the whole tournament was done. And Calipari wouldn't let his young players consider anything else, saying repeatedly this was \\"just another game.\\" But playing in-state rival Louisville (30-10) is never just that, and the Cardinals made Kentucky work deep into the second half to grind this victory out. Louisville outrebounded Kentucky 40-33, including a whopping 19-6 advantage on the offensive glass _ the sole reason the Cardinals were able to make a game of this. \\"I just said John, \`I'll be pulling for you, bring the trophy back home to Kentucky,'\\" Louisville coach Rick Pitino said. \\"Sometimes there's a lot of talk about these guys fighting, dialysis, there's also really a lot of people that get along. ... For those that have brains, they root for each other. \\"We like their basketball team; we hope they bring it home for the state.\\" Bigger, bulkier and with the 19-year-old freshman Davis having a wider wingspan than some small airplanes, the Wildcats looked like playground bullies as they pushed Louisville around on their way to a 13-point lead early in the second half. But the Cardinals know a thing about rallies after coming from 11 points down to beat Florida in last weekend's West Regional final, and they sure made Kentucky sweat. Russ Smith made back-to-back buckets to start a 15-3 run, and Peyton Siva capped it with a 3-pointer from NBA range that tied the game at 49 with 9:11 to play. But Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, who played just 23 minutes because of foul trouble, made back-to-back buckets to give the Wildcats some breathing room. After Siva made a pair of free throws, Terrence Jones scored on a jumper and Darius Miller drilled a 3 _ only Kentucky's second of the game _ to give the Wildcats control for good. \\"I'm proud of this team. They're coming together,\\" Calipari said. \\"They've taken on shots and runs like Louisville did today, and they've held their own, so I'm proud of them.\\" Just to make sure Louisville didn't get any wild notions about another late comeback, Kidd-Gilchrist threw down a monstrous dunk with 1:05 to play that had Kentucky fans on their feet and assistant coaches from Kansas and Ohio State scrambling to try and find a way to stop this juggernaut. Kentucky shot a dazzling 57 percent _ yes, that's right _ with Davis leading the way. He missed just one of his eight shots and finished with 18 points and 14 rebounds. Miller added 13 points, and Doron Lamb had 10. Kidd-Gilchrist had nine, all in the second half. \\"We're one game closer to our dream and our goals,\\" Davis said. Siva led the Cardinals with 11 points, and Gorgui Dieng had 12 rebounds. The Kentucky-Louisville rivalry caused tempers to flare even in December when, in the grand scheme of things, games really don't mean much. Heck, it took government intervention just to get the two schools to play on a regular basis back in the 1980s. With the NCAA title game on the line, the latest skirmish in basketball's version of the civil war so divided the small hoop-crazed state that senior citizens actually came to fisticuffs and made for must-see TV. The game was such a big deal that No. 1 Kentucky fan Ashley Judd wasn't even the biggest celeb in the house, with Jay-Z taking a prime seat behind the Kentucky bench. \\"It's our fans; our fans are great to us,\\" Davis said. \\"Our fans travel a long way. We want to go out here and give them a show and give them what they want, which is a national championship.\\" Bragging rights in the state is sure a nice way to start. Kentucky is 19-11 since the teams resumed playing in 1983-84, with the Wildcats winning four straight, including a 69-62 victory at Rupp Arena on Dec. 31 _ almost the exact score as Saturday night's win. \\"They made runs, and we made our runs. That's what coach always says,\\" Jones said. \\"We never get rattled.\\" The Wildcats know they're talented _ there are three, maybe as many as five NBA lottery picks on the Kentucky roster _ but they play without ego or cockiness, choosing instead to let their superior play overwhelm their opponents. That was certainly the case with Louisville. The Cardinals had skidded into the Big East tournament with four losses in their last six games, including back-to-back defeats to end the regular season. Pitino told his players they could either go home after the first week of the tournament or they could do something special, their choice. The Cardinals chose the latter, ripping off four wins in four days to win the Big East tournament and ousting No. 1 seed Michigan State in the West Regional semifinals. Then came that comeback against rough-and-tumble Florida. Those games hardened the Cardinals, and they promised they weren't simply happy to reach the Final Four. But they sure looked it early on, getting off to a slow, sloppy start. It didn't help that Dieng looked petrified of Davis and Siva was playing at hyperspeed, a pace Pitino has been trying to get him to tone down all year. When they tried to go inside, Davis was less forgiving than a bouncer at a Hollywood club. When the Cardinals went outside, the Wildcats swarmed and forced them to take off-balance shots. Meanwhile, on the other end, Kentucky scored at will, repeatedly picking on Siva and Dieng. But there's a reason Pitino has taken three teams to the Final Four. He pulled out every trick he had, switching strategies, begging the refs for calls and finding a way _ finally _ to calm his team down. \`'Any time you don't know whether a team is better offensively or defensively, you know you've got a great basketball team,\\" Pitino said. \\"And Anthony Davis is incredible.\\" ||||| Same story, new night for Kansas. The team that's been teetering on the edge of the tournament since before it even began is now one of the last two left.

(Associated Press) Tyshawn Taylor made two big free throws late, and Thomas Robinson finished with 19 points and eight rebounds Saturday night to lift the Jayhawks to a come-from-behind 64-62 win over Ohio State in the Final Four _ a game Kansas led for a grand total of 3 minutes, 48 seconds. After scoring the first bucket, Kansas didn't lead again until Travis Releford made two free throws with 2:48 left. That lasted for 11 seconds, but the Jayhawks (32-6), who trailed by as many as 13, overcame another deficit and finally held on against the Buckeyes (31-8). The game played out sort of the way the whole season has in Lawrence. Early in the year, coach Bill Self wondered if this team was even tournament material. The Jayhawks trailed most of the night against Purdue in the regional semifinals and were no better than North Carolina for most of the next game. One win. Then another. This latest one came on the biggest stage _ in the Superdome. Next, a meeting Monday with Kentucky and a chance to bring the second title in five years back to Allen Fieldhouse. ||||| Summary:","completion":"In the NCAA Final Four semi-final college basketball tournament game, Kentucky faced their in-state rival Louisville and emerged victorious with a 69-61 win.

Each element of the phrase sheds light on different aspects of the sentiment being communicated. Let's break down each part to better understand the overall sentiment: 1. Heavy-handed: This term implies that an action or behavior has been carried out in a forceful, clumsy, or overly assertive manner. It can also indicate a lack of sensitivity and subtlety in dealing with a delicate or significant subject. In the context of a sentiment, \\"heavy-handed\\" would suggest that the expressed emotion or opinion is overly forceful, possibly to the point that it comes across as too intense, pushy, or lacking in tact. 2. Phoney-feeling: The term \\"phoney\\" is derived from the word \\"phony,\\" which suggests something false, counterfeit, or inauthentic. By describing a sentiment as \\"phoney-feeling,\\" the speaker implies that the expressed emotion or opinion comes across as insincere or fake. Essentially, this portion of the phrase suggests that the sentiment is not genuine and may be seen as an attempt to manipulate or deceive others. 3. Sentiment: In general, sentiment refers to a personal feeling, emotion, or opinion, often influenced by an individual's personality, experiences, or values. In the context of the given phrase, \\"heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment\\" indicates that the sentiment being expressed or discussed is somehow flawed in its intensity, sincerity, or authenticity, which would create a negative perception of the sentiment as a whole. Taken together, a \\"heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment\\" would be perceived as an insincere display or expression of emotions or opinions, which may be forceful and lacking in sensitivity or subtlety.

The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of general climate change has a direct and indirect effect on the process. Climate change can exacerbate the intensity and frequency of forest fires, which leads to a greater loss of habitat for animals. The loss of habitat forces animals to search for shelter and resources in an increasingly limited area, potentially leading to greater competition for resources, higher predation rates, and higher stress levels. Warmer waters due to climate change can also negatively impact fish populations, as they may struggle to adapt to changing temperatures and face challenges with finding food and shelter.

If \\"The trailer is white\\", can we conclude \\"The trailer is not all black.\\"?","completion":"Yes, if \\"The trailer is white,\\" we can logically conclude that \\"The trailer is not all black.\\" This conclusion is derived from the understanding and definition of colors, specifically how white and black are opposites on the color spectrum. Colors are the result of the wavelengths of light that are reflected, absorbed, or transmitted by objects. When an object appears to be a specific color, it is because the object reflects that particular color's wavelengths and absorbs the others. In the case of white, all visible wavelengths of light are being reflected, while in the case of black, all visible wavelengths of light are being absorbed. Given that white and black represent opposite ends of the color spectrum, it is impossible for an object, in this case, a trailer, to be both entirely white and entirely black simultaneously. When the statement \\"The trailer is white\\" is presented, it means that the trailer primarily reflects all visible wavelengths of light, which directly contradicts the characteristics required for an object to be considered black. Therefore, deducing that \\"The trailer is not all black\\" when given the information that \\"The trailer is white\\" is a valid and logical conclusion. It's important to note that this conclusion is based on our current understanding of color perception and the basic principles of how colors work. In abstract or hypothetical scenarios, these principles may not hold true. However, based on the information provided and under normal circumstances, we can confidently assert that a white trailer cannot be all black."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While Donald enjoyed the experience, Nick couldn't stand how the sun burned his skin, the sweat made his clothes stick to his body, and the dust made him sneeze. The only thing Nick liked about yard work was the satisfaction of completing the chore. Step 1: Identify the main characters and their preferences. - Nick dislikes yard work - Donald enjoys yard work Step 2: Describe the setting. - Friends working on their respective lawns side by side - Weekend activity Step 3: Describe how Nick feels while performing yard work. - Sunburned - Sweaty clothes - Dusty sneezing - Satisfaction upon completion Nick would often look over at Donald and wonder how he could enjoy such a laborious and tedious task. Donald would smile, taking in the smell of freshly cut grass and the sound of the lawnmower humming steadily. In Donald's mind, yard work was not just a chore, but a form of meditation that allowed him to be present in the moment and take a break from the stresses of everyday life. He believed there was something inherently rewarding in transforming his lawn into a neatly trimmed masterpiece. Step 4: Describe Donald's perspective on yard work. - Meditative - Present in the moment - A break from normal stress - Rewarding accomplishment However, Nick's disdain for yard work wasn't entirely misguided. He had a demanding full-time job, a mortgage, and a family of four to support. This left him with limited time and energy to enjoy recreational activities on the weekend. To him, spending hours in the heat, pushing a noisy lawnmower, felt like a massive waste of time that could be better spent with his family or relaxing indoors. Step 5: Explain Nick's reasons for disliking yard work. - Demanding full-time job - Mortgage - Family of four - Limited time for recreation One day, while taking a well-deserved break from the relentless mowing, Nick shared his thoughts with Donald. Donald empathized with Nick's situation and suggested that they split the chores. He proposed that Nick could take care of the smaller tasks like trimming bushes or raking leaves, while he tackled the more time-consuming mowing. Step 6: Develop a resolution to the conflict. - Friends discuss the issue - Donald offers to help with the mowing By splitting the tasks, the friends were able to finish their yard work faster, allowing Nick to spend more quality time with his family and truly enjoy his weekends. Moreover, Donald's enthusiasm for yard work rubbed off on Nick, as he began to find solace in the smaller gardening tasks, gaining a newfound appreciation for the beauty and therapeutic benefits of working outdoors. In the end, their mutual respect and understanding brought them even closer as friends. Step 7: Describe the outcome. - Yard work finished faster - More quality time with family - Mutual appreciation for each other's perspective - Stronger friendship bond"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this statement, the person in question was indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in October 2003. The accusations brought against him included crimes against humanity and breaching the laws and principles that govern warfare. The specific actions attributed to the accused were the killing, deportation, and committing other inhumane acts against the ethnic Albanian population during the conflict that took place in Kosovo between 1998 and 1999. The conflict in Kosovo was a highly controversial and complex event, with various ethnic, political, and religious factors contributing to the violence that engulfed the region. The primary antagonists were the government forces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which was primarily composed of Serbian forces, and the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), an ethnic Albanian paramilitary organization. The conflict resulted in a significant number of casualties, extensive property damage, and the displacement of a large number of people, predominantly from the ethnic Albanian community. The atrocities committed during the conflict have been classified as ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity by various international organizations, including the United Nations and the ICTY. The indictment by the ICTY serves as an important mechanism to hold those responsible for the violations of international law during the conflict accountable for their actions. The Tribunal was established to prosecute individuals for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991. As part of its mandate, the ICTY focuses on genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. By indicting and prosecuting individuals responsible for these crimes, the ICTY aims to bring justice to the victims, promote peace and reconciliation in the affected regions, and deter future instances of such violations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I read this background article the other day: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem. I am facing a new situation today: Uncle Tom and uncle Sam both have high cholesterol. Uncle Tom is on statin drugs and uncle Sam is not. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which uncle doesn't take an inhibitor of the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis? Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, we should first identify which uncle is taking the statin drug and which is not. From the provided information, Uncle Tom is on statin drugs and Uncle Sam is not. Recall from the background article that statin drugs are inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), which is the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. Since Uncle Tom is the one taking statin drugs, he is the one taking an inhibitor of the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. Thus, Uncle Sam is the uncle who does not take an inhibitor of the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. Answer: Uncle Sam."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At the center of this environment was love: the love that Christ showed for humanity in becoming human. Christ's love reveals the mercy of God and His care for His creation. English Dominican mystics sought through this love to become images of God. Love led to spiritual growth that, in turn, reflected an increase in love for God and humanity.

(CNN) -- Abu Yahya al-Libi, al Qaeda's No. 2 man, was killed in Pakistan on Monday, according to U.S. officials. Al-Libi's death was \\"another serious blow to core al Qaeda,\\" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. Al-Libi, 49, was a well-regarded figure in jihadist circles and had emerged as one of the terrorist network's most important clerics and propagandists, appearing in countless videos in recent years. He was killed by a CIA drone strike, according to U.S. officials. Drone strikes remain a highly contentious issue between the United States and Pakistan. Who is Abu Yahya al-Libi? By most accounts, al-Libi was effectively al Qaeda's deputy leader. A Libyan citizen and an Islamic scholar, al-Libi bolstered his credibility within jihad groups after escaping from U.S. custody in Afghanistan in 2005. He became the public face of al Qaeda and used his religious training to justify the organization's actions. As one of the group's chief ideologues and propagandists, al-Libi appeared in numerous recruitment videos in which he cast himself as a sheikh with the legitimacy to issue fatwas. Other than his appearances in propaganda videos, it's unclear which plots against the West al-Libi was involved in. A wanted ad from the U.S. State Department described him as a \\"key motivator in the global jihadi movement,\\" and said that \\"his messages convey a clear threat to U.S. persons or property worldwide.\\" What does his death mean for al Qaeda? This is a \\"very serious blow\\" to al Qaeda, according to Noman Benotman, a former senior member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group who spent significant time with al-Libi in the 1990s. No one else within the group rivals his legitimacy as a religious scholar nor has the credibility in the Arab world to provide Islamic justifications for al Qaeda's global campaign of terrorism, he said. 1.

Question: suppose less rock is broken apart happens, how will it affect LESS vegetables. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"B: Less To fully understand the relationship between the process of breaking apart rocks and the growth of vegetables, let's examine each step in the process of growing plants and understand the role of natural elements like rocks. 1. Get some seeds: Seeds are the starting point of any plant, and in the case of vegetables, you would want to select specific seeds that provide your desired vegetable variety. 2. Pick a spot to plant them: A suitable location is critical, as different plants have distinct requirements for sunlight, moisture, and soil composition. In choosing the spot, one often considers the soil fertility, access to sunlight, and water drainage. 3. Dig a hole in the dirt: Holes must be dug for seeds or seedlings to be planted, which also helps with aeration and water penetration. 4. Put the seed in the hole: Seeding depth and spacing are crucial for the proper germination and growth of plants. 5. Pour some water on the seed and hole: Adequate water supply is essential for germination, as seeds require moisture content to break dormancy and initiate the process. 6. Cover up the hole: Soil helps provide stability, warmth, and holds in moisture to aid in seed germination. 7. Press down on it: Pressing down on the soil around the seed ensures good contact with the soil and prevents air pockets. 8. Spray some plant food on it: Plant food or fertilizers supply essential nutrients needed for the plant's growth and development. Now let's consider the less rock breaking apart scenario. As rocks break down, they provide critical minerals and nutrients required for plants to grow. Fewer rocks breaking apart means that there will be a decrease in the availability of these vital nutrients within the soil. This reduction in nutrient availability will affect the growth of vegetables adversely. Consequently, there will be less overall vegetable production. Plants may struggle to grow and develop as expected due to insufficient access to essential nutrients. So, the correct answer is B: Less. If less rock is broken apart, it would generally lead to a decrease in vegetable production as plants may struggle to access the essential nutrients required for their healthy growth and development."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Effigy of 'Lost Prince' Henry Stuart to go on show at National Portrait Gallery Funeral effigy of Henry, Prince of Wales. Photograph: Westminster Abbey A bundle of old sticks, which frankly will look very odd exhibited among treasures of paintings, miniatures, manuscripts and armour by artists including Rubens, Holbein and Inigo Jones, is all that remains of a funeral effigy that 400 years ago reduced crowds lining the streets of London to \\"an ocean of tears\\". The National Portrait Gallery is preparing to stage the first exhibition anywhere on one of British history's great what ifs – what if Henry, the now almost forgotten handsome, sporty, clever – and devoutly Protestant – son of James I, big brother of the feeble and sickly Charles, had not died of typhoid in 1612 aged just 18. Would he have reigned in peace and prosperity and had a brood of healthy children, or would he too have plunged his country into civil war and lost his head on a scaffold in Whitehall? For curator Catharine MacLeod, the ugliest and most battered object in the autumn exhibition will also be one of the most striking. The headless, armless, wooden torso once completed with a wax portrait head modelled from life, and dressed in the prince's own magnificent robes, is being loaned by Westminster Abbey, where it has not been exhibited for at least 200 years. \\"I find it very poignant, a tremendously moving symbol of the decline into which his memory has fallen,\\" she said. In 1612, the effigy laid on top of his coffin was so lifelike it had a devastating impact on viewers. A witness described \\"an innumerable multitude of all sorts of ages and degrees of men, women and children … some weeping, crying, howling, wringing of their hands, others halfe dead … passionately betraying so great a losse with rivers, nay with an ocean of teares.\\" The wonderful clothes were stolen within a few years, the head was gone by the early 19th century, and the arms, probably originally sacking stuffed with straw, have long since rotted away. It will be shown among more conventionally splendid objects, including loans from the royal collection and museum and private collections, including a spectacular suit of armour, and designs for a court masque by Inigo Jones in which the handsome youth appeared as the fairy king Oberon. Trinity College Cambridge is sending his copy book, showing one page of beautifully transcribed Latin poetry and one of touchingly teenage doodles, squiggles, and trial signatures. At the age of 16 he was already building up a spectacular art collection, including the superb Holbein drawings now among the most precious works in the Windsor Castle library. He was also so interested in shipbuilding that Sir Walter Raleigh, imprisoned in the tower, wrote him a treatise on the subject. His death also sealed the fate of his younger brother Charles, so feeble and sickly he was left behind in Scotland for years when his father became king on the death of Elizabeth I and moved south with his family. The Royal Collection is loaning a small bronze horse, a sculpture dating from 1600 by Pietro Tacco, which both princes obviously regarded as a particular treasure. When Henry lay on his deathbed, the 12-year-old Charles sent for the horse and gave it to his brother hoping it would cheer him up - but it was too late.

It is winter and Johnathan's car won't start, so he needs to walk to work. Even though it's sunny outside he's going to have to bundle up due to the cold temperature. In his closet there is a large black coat and a large white coat. He can't decide which coat to wear. Hint: Light may transfer its energy to matter rather than being reflected or transmitted by matter. This is called absorption . When light is absorbed, the added energy increases the temperature of matter. If you get into a car that has been sitting in the sun all day, the seats and other parts of the car’s interior may be almost too hot to touch, especially if they are black or very dark in color. That’s because dark colors absorb most of the sunlight that strikes them. The answer is:","completion":"The large black coat will absorb more sunlight."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Passage: Some theories developed in the 1970s established possible avenues through which inequality may have a positive effect on economic development. According to a 1955 review, savings by the wealthy, if these increase with inequality, were thought to offset reduced consumer demand. A 2013 report on Nigeria suggests that growth has risen with increased income inequality. Some theories popular from the 1950s to 2011 incorrectly stated that inequality had a positive effect on economic development. Analyses based on comparing yearly equality figures to yearly growth rates were misleading because it takes several years for effects to manifest as changes to economic growth. IMF economists found a strong association between lower levels of inequality in developing countries and sustained periods of economic growth. Developing countries with high inequality have \\"succeeded in initiating growth at high rates for a few years\\" but \\"longer growth spells are robustly associated with more equality in the income distribution.\\" Question: When were theories developed suggesting inequality may have some negative effect on economic development?","completion":"False"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: Passage: Although the publicity generated by Five Leaves Left was minor, Boyd was keen to build on what momentum there was. Drake's second album, 1971's Bryter Layter, again produced by Boyd and engineered by John Wood, introduced a more upbeat, jazzier sound.Disappointed by his debut's poor commercial performance, Drake sought to move away from his pastoral sound, and agreed to Boyd's suggestions to include bass and drum tracks. \\"It was more of a pop sound, I suppose,\\" Boyd later said. \\"I imagined it as more commercial.\\" Like its predecessor, the album featured musicians from Fairport Convention, as well as contributions from John Cale on two songs: \\"Northern Sky\\" and \\"Fly\\". Trevor Dann noted that while sections of \\"Northern Sky\\" sound more characteristic of Cale, the song was the closest Drake came to a release with chart potential. Cale used heroin during this period, and his older friend Brian Wells suspected that Drake was also using.Boyd and Wood were confident that Bryter Layter would be a success, but it sold fewer than 3,000 copies. Reviews were again mixed: while Record Mirror praised Drake as a \\"beautiful guitarist—clean and with perfect timing, [and] accompanied by soft, beautiful arrangements\\", Melody Maker described the album as \\"an awkward mix of folk and cocktail jazz\\".Soon after its release, Boyd sold Witchseason to Island Records, and moved to Los Angeles to work with Warner Brothers to develop film soundtracks. The loss of his mentor, coupled with the album's poor sales, led Drake into further depression. His attitude to London had changed: he was unhappy living alone, and visibly nervous and uncomfortable performing at a series of concerts in early 1970. In June, Drake gave one of his final live appearances at Ewell Technical College, Surrey. Ralph McTell, who also performed that night, remembered: \\"Nick was monosyllabic. At that particular gig he was very shy. He did the first set and something awful must have happened. He was doing his song 'Fruit Tree' and walked off halfway through it.\\"In 1971, Drake's family persuaded him to visit a psychiatrist at St Thomas's Hospital, London. He was prescribed antidepressants, but felt uncomfortable and embarrassed about taking them, and tried to hide the fact from his friends. He worried about their side effects and was concerned about how they would react with his regular cannabis use.Island Records urged Drake to promote Bryter Layter through interviews, radio sessions and live appearances. Drake, who by this time was smoking what Kirby described as \\"unbelievable amounts\\" of cannabis and exhibiting \\"the first signs of psychosis\\", refused. Disappointed by the reaction to Bryter Layter, he turned his thoughts inwards, and withdrew from family and friends. He rarely left his flat, and then only to play an occasional concert or to buy drugs. His sister recalled: \\"This was a very bad time. He once said to me that everything started to go wrong from [this] time on, and I think that was when things started to go wrong.\\".

Understand the Basic Tone: I start by reading the tweet to myself, taking into account the words used and their standard meanings. In this tweet, the user is thanking another user. The word \\"thank you\\" is traditionally associated with positive emotions such as gratitude or appreciation. 2. Analyze the Context: Here, the context is a simple expression of thanks to a user with the handle @mommyisrocknrol. However, the tweet doesn't provide specific details about what they are being thanked for. 3. Check for Emotional Indicators: Now, I look for any emotional indicators like emojis, punctuation or capitalization which can intensify the sentiment. There are no such indicators in this tweet. However, the word 'awe' is being used, which generally connotes a mild surprise and pleasant emotion-- adding a touch of positivity to the message. 4. Overall Sentiment: After assessing the tone, context and emotional indicators, I'd define the overall sentiment of this tweet as positive. The user shows gratitude and amiability, which are both positive emotions. Without any negative words or indications, the most reasonable conclusion is to classify this sentiment as positive. This step-by-step analysis helps to ensure an accurate understanding of sentiment, considering multiple elements of the tweet instead of simply assuming based on individual words. Social media and informal language can be tricky to interpret due to use of irony, sarcasm, or cultural idioms, so it's important to take a holistic approach to sentiment analysis.

Q:Where might a small dog run in packs? - trailer park - own home - grandmother's house - apartment complex - basket The best answer is A:","completion":"A small dog might run in packs in several of these locations, but each place offers unique challenges and benefits for the dog. 1. Trailer park: A trailer park may be the best answer for where a small dog might run in packs. This is because these residential areas typically have a higher concentration of homes in close proximity, which can result in more opportunities for dogs to socialize and form packs. Additionally, trailer parks often have communal outdoor spaces where dogs can roam, interact, and play with one another. In such a setting, it becomes more natural for small dogs to form social groups and run together as packs. 2. Own home: A small dog could possibly form a pack within their own home if there are multiple dogs living together. However, this arrangement might not have the same level of interactions and social dynamics as the outdoor packs. In this scenario, the dog may socialize predominantly with the other dogs in the household, and their opportunities to interact with other dogs from different homes might be limited. 3. Grandmother's house: A small dog might form a pack at a grandmother's house if there are other dogs living with the grandmother or if the house is regularly visited by dogs from neighboring homes. Similar to living in their own home, the dog's social interactions may be limited to the specific family members and other dogs present at the grandmother's house, rather than forming a larger, community-based pack. 4. Apartment complex: An apartment complex can create opportunities for small dogs to form packs, especially if the complex has designated pet-friendly areas, outdoor spaces, or even an onsite dog park. These communal spaces can provide an environment for the small dogs to socialize and run together. However, the level of interaction and pack formation may not be as extensive as what could be observed at a trailer park. 5. Basket: It is unlikely for a small dog to run in packs inside a basket since it is an inanimate object and does not have the space and environment necessary for socialization and pack formation. A basket may be used for transporting a small dog or as a cozy resting space, but it does not provide the surroundings required for dogs to run and interact in groups. In conclusion, the best answer for where a small dog might run in packs is likely a trailer park, as these locations offer a unique combination of close-knit homes and communal spaces that foster socialization and make it easier for dogs to interact and form packs. However, depending on the specific circumstances and available amenities, apartment complexes and grandmother's houses might also offer opportunities for small dogs to socialize and run together."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While home alone, Dead uses his personal knife to cut his arms and throat, and then uses Euronymous' shotgun to shoot himself in the forehead, leaving behind a suicide note. Euronymous returns home and finds the body but instead of calling the police, he takes photos of the body and moves the knife and shotgun around. After Dead's body is taken away, Euronymous gives necklaces to the other band members which he claims are pieces of Dead's skull; this disgusts Necrobutcher, prompting him to leave the band.

Next, to isolate the variable s on the left side of the equation, divide both sides by -10: (-10*s) / -10 = 20 / -10 This simplification results in: s = -2 So the solution to the given equation -10*s = 5 + 15 is s = -2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Question: I read this background article the other day: In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops. I am facing a new situation today: Dan studied genetic engineering. He was applying his knowledge of genetic engineering to develop better crops. Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which crop would need more number of chemicals, crop A or crop B? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background article and the new situation, crop B, which is not tolerant of herbicides, would need a greater number of chemicals for weed management.

Translate this to English?","completion":"It is worth noting that the objectives set for the 1990s were achieved long before the anticipated date. Here is a detailed and long answer in English providing context and expansion of the idea: The statement highlights a notable accomplishment, wherein the goals that were originally established for the 1990s were not only achieved but were also completed well ahead of the initially planned timeline. This suggests that whatever strategies, resources, and commitments were employed to reach these objectives were highly effective and perhaps even exceeded expectations. This early achievement can be attributed to various factors. First, there might have been effective planning and execution, which allowed for the timely completion of tasks and projects. An excellent team effort, strong leadership, and collaboration among involved stakeholders could have also played a crucial role in attaining the goals ahead of schedule. Secondly, technological advancements might have had a significant impact on the accomplishment of the objectives. Breakthroughs during that period, such as the growth of the internet and rapid advancements in computing, telecommunications, and other related fields, could have expedited processes and helped accomplish these goals much faster than was initially anticipated. Another possible consideration is that external factors, such as economic growth, political stability, and other global events, might have positively impacted the progress towards achieving these objectives. For instance, the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s led to a more stable geopolitical climate, creating a more conducive environment for international cooperation and enabling faster progress. However, it is also essential to acknowledge that the early accomplishment of goals may have its downsides. For instance, the initial objectives might have been underestimated, or the plans may not have been ambitious enough, leading to the premature completion of the goals and leaving room for potential underutilization of resources and capacities. Nevertheless, reaching objectives ahead of schedule is generally considered a remarkable accomplishment and indicates effective planning, execution, and adaptation to changing circumstances. Reflecting on the factors that contributed to this success can provide valuable insights for future endeavors and guide the establishment of new objectives in the years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Senior 2 from Beijing No.35 High School dreamt of meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin. After more than a year of hard work and with a little good luck, Li fulfilled her dream. On October 11, 2004, the 16-year-old girl joined a team of Chinese journalists who went to the Kremlin, in Moscow, to interview Putin. Li felt nervous before talking with Putin. \\"But his greeting and warm smile put me at ease,\\" she said. Li admires Putin very much, because of his strong will and style of leadership. \\"He looks very cool,\\" Li said. During her interview, Li asked Putin whether he plans to educate his two teenage daughters to be officials in the future. Putin smiled and answered he hopes they can do whatever job suits their interests and personalities. Although Li would only have several minutes, she started working on her interview questions last August after applying for the opportunity. \\"Journalists work is by no means easy. You need to do lots of homework on your _ ,\\" she said. She read many books about Putin and Russia in her spare time.

Context: When she's in the mood to push my buttons, my significant other, the delightful and charming Ms. D, frequently alludes to the questionable timeline concerning my birth date. She derives much mirth from the fact that I was born something less than nine or ten months after my parents wed and hints that this indicates a certain amount of premarital hanky-panky. Standing on my dignity ('cause it's higher than the coffee table), my reply is that I have it on good authority that I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill. Said hill was once considered to be an abomination of the first water. The Tabusintac, like all hills, had an up and a down. In this case, the up and down were distinguished from each other by a sharp curve at the bottom. The main North/South New Brunswick highway slavishly followed the hill's contours. If you were heading north, the road led you into a ravine and you were faced with a steep uphill incline that, in winter presented a challenge to at least half the vehicles trying to climb it. In true snow country fashion, steep, icy hills were conquered by getting a running start, building up a lot of speed and praying that Mr. Newton's rules concerning inertia would work in your favour. Headed south, the problem became keeping your car under control so that you didn't go shooting into the trees when the road curved to the left. My parents were taking a trip to the Miramachi in December of '56 and were driving a Pontiac borrowed from one of my father's friends. My mother was pregnant with a bundle of bad attitude and misery that would turn out to be me. I assume that my father was driving with that mix of panache and insouciance that my mother tended to describe as reckless behaviour. In any case, as he rounded the corner at the top of the hill, the road was apparently free of snow and ice and there was no reason to slowdown. Until the moose stepped out onto the road just ahead of them.

It's hard for older adults in your family to let go of the thought of you being \\"little girl\\" or \\"little boy,\\" even if you're well into adulthood. Therefore, you need to broach the topic with them and help them understand what you're feeling. Start with your feelings. That is, use an \\"I\\" statement to describe how you're feeling instead of a \\"you\\" statement that puts the blame on them. Blaming someone will put them on the defense. For instance, don't say, \\" You always treat me like a little kid.\\" Instead, say \\"I feel upset when you still treat me like a child. I've grown up.\\" Be specific by talking about particular statements or behaviors that bother you. For example, you could say, \\"I love that you help with the kids, but I don't like when you contradict the rules that I've made.\\" You could also say, \\"I respect your rules when I'm in your house, but I don't like being asked where I am every second of every day.\\" Tell them what you expect. For instance, you could say, \\"I would really appreciate if you would respect the rules I've set for my kids.\\" or \\"I would appreciate it if you would treat me like any other adult who stays in your home.\\" If you're telling your mom a story, tell her what you expect from her upfront. For instance, if you're just telling her the story to give her information and you don't really want advice, let her know that. You could say, \\"Mom, I need to tell you something, but I want you to promise me that you won't offer your judgment at the end. I feel like you need to know this information, but I don't want advice on my choices.\\" That is, often in communication, people are trying to maintain control. It's a power struggle. Often, this type of communication pops up between a parent and an adult child, or even another type of relationship, such as an aunt and niece or nephew. The \\"adult\\" still wants to control the adult child, even if that person doesn't realize it. If you're the adult child, you may want to struggle to \\"win\\" in this situation. However, often letting go of the power struggle can lead to a healthier relationship. This type of power struggle can make people defensive. You probably feel defensive when another adult in your family, whether it be a parent, aunt, guardian, or grandparent, does it to you. However, by truly listening and letting go of the power struggle, you can cut through some of that defensiveness and both parties can feel more heard and valued. Sometimes, parents and other family members have trouble respecting boundaries because they still see you as a little kid they have a right to rule over. In that case, you need to politely but firmly set boundaries with them because you have your own life now. For instance, say your parents tend to just show up at your house unannounced. You could say, \\"We love having you here, but we'd appreciate it if you gave us some advanced notice. Sometimes, we have our family time planned, and we need that time to strengthen and grow together.\\" Another way you could address an issue is to say, \\"I understand that you are concerned about when we're having children.

When he takes his family to Far Far Away to celebrate his children's first birthday, a series of mishaps further injure his ego, causing him to lose his temper and walk out in anger. Shrek encounters Rumpelstiltskin, who seizes his chance, having observed Shrek's angry outburst. He follows Shrek and arranges for Shrek to appear to save his life. He gives Shrek a day to live like a real ogre, in exchange for a day from his childhood that he would not remember being erased to \\"thank\\" him. Shrek signs the contract and appears in a reality where he is feared by villagers. He takes the opportunity to cause some lighthearted mischief until he finds \\"WANTED\\" posters for Fiona and his home deserted and desolate. He is kidnapped by witches and taken to Stiltskin, now the King of Far Far Away, which has become derelict and run down. Upon inquiry, Stiltskin reveals that the day he erased was the day Shrek was born. Therefore, Shrek never saved Fiona or never met Donkey, and consequently Stiltskin was able to get King Harold and Queen Lillian to sign their kingdom away, making them both disappear.

That's a bit like what happened between two football players named Osi Umenyiora and LeSean McCoy. Osi Umenyiora is a very good football player who used to be on a team called the New York Giants. He played a position called \\"defensive end\\" (DE), which means he was in charge of stopping the other team's players from running or throwing the ball. His job was to protect his team's side of the football field. LeSean McCoy is another good football player who used to be on a team called the Philadelphia Eagles. He played as a \\"running back,\\" which means his job was to run with the football and try to get past the other team's players, like Osi Umenyiora. Now, sometimes people have disagreements, and that's okay. But a while ago, Osi Umenyiora had a problem with his team. They were talking about how much money he should get paid, and they were not agreeing on the amount. This is called a \\"contract dispute.\\" During this time, LeSean McCoy said some mean things about Osi Umenyiora. He said things like Osi wasn't as good of a football player as people thought, and that he was not as smart as he thought he was. Osi Umenyiora was very upset about what LeSean McCoy said. Recently, he talked about it and said that what LeSean McCoy did was \\"unforgivable.\\" That means Osi thinks that it was so mean and hurtful that he can't forget about it and be friends with LeSean McCoy again. Sometimes, people say things that they don't mean, especially when they are having a disagreement.

We see the two numbers, 239 and -91. Let's see what happens when we subtract 91 from 239: 239 - 91 = 148 Now, our equation looks like this: -13 * l + 148 = -229 Next, we have to get the \\"-13 * l\\" all by itself on the left side. To do that, let's subtract 148 from both sides of the equation: (-13 * l + 148) - 148 = -229 - 148 Now, we get: -13 * l = -377 Almost there! Now, we just have to find out what number \\"l\\" is. To do this, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -13: -13 * l / -13 = -377 / -13 When we divide -377 by -13, we get: l = 29 So, the answer to the problem is l = 29.

The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song.

Prince Grigory Aleksandrovich Potemkin-Tavricheski (Russian: Grigorii Aleksandrovich Potiomkin-Tavricheskii; 'Potyomkin', r Grigoriy Aleksandrovich Potyomkin-Tavricheskiy; October 11 [O.S. September 30] 1739 - October 16 [O.S. October 5] 1791) was a Russian military leader, statesman, nobleman and favourite of Catherine the Great. He died during negotiations over the Treaty of Jassy, which ended a war with the Ottoman Empire that he had overseen. Potemkin was born into a family of middle-income noble landowners. Potemkin \\"exuded both menace and welcome\\"; he was arrogant, demanding of his courtiers and very changeable in his moods but also fascinating, warm and kind. It was generally agreed among his female companions that he was \\"amply endowed with 'sex appeal'\\". Louis Philippe, comte de Segur described him as \\"colossal like Russia\\", \\"an inconceivable mixture of grandeur and pettiness, laziness and activity, bravery and timidity, ambition and insouciance\\". The internal contrast was evident throughout his life: he frequented both church and numerous orgies, for example. In Segur's view, onlookers had a tendency to unjustly attribute to Catherine alone the successes of the period and to Potemkin the failures. An eccentric workaholic, Potemkin was vain and a great lover of jewelry (a taste he did not always remember to pay for), but he disliked sycophancy and was sensitive about his appearance, particularly his lost eye. He only agreed to having portraits made of him twice, in 1784 and again in 1791, both times by Johann Baptist von Lampi and from an angle which disguised his injury. Potemkin was also an intellectual. The Prince of Ligne noted that Potemkin had \\"natural abilities [and] an excellent memory\\". He was interested in history and generally knowledgeable. Potemkin loved the classical music of the period, as well as opera. He liked all food, both peasant and fine; particular favorites included roast beef and potatoes, and his anglophilia meant that English gardens were prepared wherever he went. A practical politician, his political ideas were \\"quintessentially Russian\\", and he believed in the superiority of the Tsarist autocracy (he once described the French revolutionaries as \\"a pack of madmen\\"). Potemkin's habits included biting his nails, to the point where he developed hangnail. One evening, at the height of his power, Potemkin declared to his dinner guests: Everything I have ever wanted, I have... I wanted high rank, I have it; I wanted medals, I have them; I loved gambling, I have lost vast sums; I liked giving parties, I've given magnificent ones; I enjoy building houses, I've raised palaces; I liked buying estates, I have many; I adore diamonds and beautiful things - no individual in Europe owns rarer or more exquisite stones. In a word, all my passions have been sated. I am entirely happy! Ultimately Potemkin proved a controversial figure. Criticisms include \\"laziness, corruption, debauchery, indecision, extravagance, falsification, military incompetence and disinformation on a vast scale\\" but supporters hold that only \\"the sybaritism [devotion to luxury] and extravagance... are truly justified\\", stressing Potemkin's \\"intelligence, force of personality, spectacular vision, courage, generosity and great achievements\\". Though not a military genius, he was \\"seriously able\\" in military matters. Potemkin's contemporary Segur was quick to criticise, writing that \\"nobody thought out a plan more swiftly [than Potemkin], carried it out more slowly and abandoned it more easily\\". Another contemporary, the Scotsman Sir John Sinclair, added that Potemkin had \\"great abilities\\" but was ultimately a \\"worthless and dangerous character\\".

News article: Bee Anantatho was very proud when her restaurant, Thailicious in Edgewater, received a 1,088 tip from a customer this weekend. She and her husband, Surachai Surabotsopon, emigrated from Bangkok to Colorado about five years ago, and opened their Thai restaurant — which specializes in Bangkok-style Thai cuisine — a few years ago. They’ve been steadily building a loyal fan base, and the eye-popping tip seemed to validate their venture. “I think this is a big thing,” she said shortly after one of her waiters received the surprising tip. She heard about it when the server who cleared the table picked up the checkbook, where customers usually put extra money for tips when they pay in cash. The server brought it straight to her, and she consulted with her staff to clarify the situation. Even though they put tips in a jar to share among the servers, Anantatho remembers the reaction of the waiter who’d served the man. “He said he’d read a lot of stories like this, but usually the tip is a couple hundred dollars, not 1,000,” she said. “He was so happy.” Relying on her instincts as a business owner, Anantatho told her crew they should hold on to the money, just in case he came back. And he did, the very next day, the moment the restaurant opened. “He said, ‘I’m sorry, I was drunk,’ ” she said. “He didn’t know he put all the money he had in the checkbook.” Some of the bills were 100 bills, and she suspected he might have thought they were 1 bills. She gave the money back to him, and he gave her 100 to cover the dinner, about 60, and the rest for a tip. Although disappointed for her staff, which thought it had earned a major tip, she’s content with the way she handled an embarrassing situation, making it easy for the customer. “I think he will come back,” she said. ||||| People can be extra generous when they're drunk, and extra regretful when they're sober. Bee Anantatho owns a popular Thai restaurant, Thailicious, in Edgewater, Colorado. Thailicious has been in the neighborhood for several years, and the restaurant's customers have reportedly always been loyal. This weekend, one of the restaurant's customers decided to show off his gratitude — by leaving 1,088 as a tip. \\"I think this is a big thing,\\" Anantatho said after hearing of the tip. The server who received the tip brought it to Anantatho and wanted to put it in the tip jar, where all the waitstaff shares their tips. \\"He said he’d read a lot of stories like this, but usually the tip is a couple hundred dollars, not 1,000,” Anantatho said of the waiter to The Denver Post. \\"He was so happy.\\" Happy — but only for so long.

Article:Rents were up by 1.1% last month compared with July, leaving the average rent at Â£761 a month, said the survey by LSL Property Services. The figures, based on LSL's own data, suggested seven out of 10 regions had seen rent rises over the year. This was led by a 3.5% increase in the south-west of England. The south-east of England saw rents rise by 3.4% compared with a year ago, and there was a 3.3% rise in the north-west of England, LSL said. Campbell Robb, chief executive of charity Shelter, said: \\"Successive governments' failure to build enough affordable homes and soaring house prices are leaving more and more families with no choice but to live their lives in expensive and unstable rented homes, never certain of what the future holds.\\" Rents were lower in August compared with a year ago in the North East (down 1.6%), the West Midlands (down 0.4%), and Wales (down 0.1%), LSL said.

Answer: it will become slower Student:","completion":"If John decreases the concentration of reactants in his solution, the rate of reaction will become slower. This occurs because the rate of a chemical reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of the reactants involved. In a solution with a higher concentration of reactants, there are more reactant particles available to collide and interact with each other. This increases the probability of successful collisions (i.e., those that result in the formation of product molecules) and therefore speeds up the reaction rate. Conversely, when the concentration of reactants is decreased, there are fewer reactant particles available to collide, resulting in a lower probability of successful collisions and a slower reaction rate. This relationship between reactant concentration and reaction rate is described by the rate equation, which varies depending on the specific reaction. However, in general terms, the rate equation can be written as: Rate = k[A]^m[B]^n In this equation, 'Rate' represents the rate of reaction, 'k' is the rate constant, '[A]' and '[B]' are the concentrations of the reactants, and 'm' and 'n' are the reaction orders with respect to the reactants A and B, respectively. As the concentration of reactants decreases (i.e., [A] or [B] decreases), the rate of reaction will also decrease due to the direct relationship between them."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Information: - A car is a wheeled, self-powered motor vehicle used for transportation and a product of the automotive industry. Most definitions of the term specify that cars are designed to run primarily on roads, to have seating for one to eight people, to typically have four wheels with tyres, and to be constructed principally for the transport of people rather than goods. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car. In that year, German inventor Karl Benz built the Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars did not become widely available until the early 20th century. One of the first cars that was accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the United States of America, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world. - Ireland (Ulster-Scots: ) is an island in the North Atlantic. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest on Earth. - Chambers Motors was the first automobile manufacturer in Ireland . The company built vehicles by hand featuring high - quality components designed and fabricated in - house . Passenger cars were made to suit doctors and wealthy businessmen , and commercial vehicles were produced for duty as delivery vans , ambulances , and hearses . A key feature of the vehicles was a unique design of epicyclic gearbox in the rear axle . Chambers Motors employed around 75 people and built approximately 500 vehicles in 25 years of operation . - A van is a type of road vehicle used for transporting goods or people. Depending on the type of van it can be bigger or smaller than a truck and SUV, and bigger than a common car. There is some varying in the scope of the word across the different English-speaking countries. The smallest vans, minivans, are commonly used for transporting people from a family. Larger vans with passenger seats are used for institutional purposes, such as transporting students. Larger vans with only front seats are often used for business purposes, to carry goods and equipment. Specially-equipped vans are used by television stations as mobile studios. Postal services and courier companies use large step vans to deliver packages. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.

It is released through the fetal urine and then exits through the umbilical cord.; d. It is carried through shared blood vessels and then to the mother's lungs.; Answer:","completion":"The correct statement that describes what happens to the carbon dioxide waste produced by a developing baby during pregnancy is: a. It is carried by the umbilical cord to the placenta and then to the mother's blood. To understand this process, it is important to know the role of the umbilical cord, placenta, and the maternal blood system during pregnancy. The umbilical cord is a vital structure, connecting the developing baby (fetus) to the mother's placenta. It contains two arteries and one vein, which are protected and cushioned by a jelly-like substance known as Wharton's Jelly. The umbilical cord functions as a lifeline for the fetus, providing it with essential nutrients, oxygen, and removing waste products such as carbon dioxide. The placenta is a temporary organ that forms during pregnancy and attaches to the uterine wall, where it plays a crucial role in fetal development and support. It essentially acts as an interface between the mother and the developing baby, facilitating the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between the maternal and fetal blood systems. Interestingly, the mother's blood and the baby's blood never mix directly; they are separated by a thin membrane barrier within the placenta that allows for the selective transfer of nutrients and waste. Carbon dioxide is a waste product of cellular respiration and metabolism that must be removed from the fetus to maintain optimal health and growth. The process of carbon dioxide removal begins as the waste diffuses from the fetus's cells into its blood circulation. The carbon dioxide-rich blood is then transported by the umbilical vein to the placenta. Once in the placenta, the carbon dioxide diffuses across the placental membrane into the mother's blood, maintaining a concentration gradient that ensures efficient transfer of waste. The maternal blood system transports the waste to the mother's lungs, where the carbon dioxide is expelled during exhalation. Simultaneously, oxygen-rich blood from the mother is transported to the fetus through the umbilical arteries, providing essential oxygen necessary for fetal development. This process effectively illustrates how the umbilical cord transports carbon dioxide waste from the fetus to the placenta and then to the mother's blood, highlighting the essential role of these structures in managing waste for the developing baby during pregnancy."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The answer is:","completion":"Given the context, Quinn would most likely want to offer to listen to Carson's problems. It is clear that Quinn cares about Carson and is trying to make them feel better after a hard day at work, which is evident by placing their arm around Carson for comfort during dinner. In this scenario, being there for Carson and providing emotional support would be the main priority for Quinn. Asking Carson to pay for dinner would not be appropriate in this situation, as it would not help alleviate the stress or negative emotions that Carson is experiencing. Additionally, asking Carson to leave so that Quinn can be alone might make Carson feel rejected or undervalued, which is not the desired outcome when trying to provide comfort. Offering to listen to Carson's problems is the best course of action, as it shows empathy and a genuine desire to help. By providing a space for them to openly discuss their issues, Quinn can better understand what Carson is going through and offer support, advice, or simply a listening ear. This sense of validation and understanding can be incredibly valuable for someone who has had a tough day and will likely contribute to Carson feeling better and more supported.

If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. John and Keith were playing football - the game was rough to say the least. They both got hurt. After the game they went to see the sports physician for a check up.

[+] negative [+] positive).","completion":"Title: The Disappointment That was \\"Fading Dreams\\" As a film enthusiast and a long-time fan of filmmaker James Winston, I had high expectations for his latest venture, \\"Fading Dreams.\\" Unfortunately, my anticipation quickly turned into utter disappointment. This review will aim to explain the numerous, negative aspects of this movie that contribute to its lackluster appeal. To start, the plot of \\"Fading Dreams\\" is convoluted beyond measure, which made it nearly impossible to follow. Many of the crucial storylines and events are poorly connected, leaving viewers feeling like they're continuously missing a piece of the puzzle. This confusing narrative might have been forgivable if the film's pacing had not also been dreadfully slow, making it a challenge to stay engaged throughout the two and a half hours run time. Not only are the pacing and interwoven storylines hard to digest, but the characters in the film lack any depth or complexity. As a result, the audience finds it difficult to empathize with the protagonists, hindering any emotional investment in the narrative. The script is no better, filled with cliched dialogue and cringeworthy one-liners that seem forced and out of place. Winston, who's known for his sharp and punchy writing, missed the mark entirely this time around. Further exacerbating the issues with \\"Fading Dreams\\" is the poor camera work and visual effects. With scenes that are either dimly lit or excessively shaky, viewers are left in confusion, straining their eyes to decipher the plot. Despite the film's impressive budget, the visual effects are unpolished and unrealistic, diminishing the immersive experience that was likely intended. Even the musical score, which could have potentially salvaged some aspect of the film, feels poorly matched and ill-placed, adding to the overall low-quality experience. Much like the script, it lacks the emotional punch needed to complement the on-screen action and fails to elevate the movie to a higher plane. In conclusion, \\"Fading Dreams\\" is an unmitigated disaster that does not live up to James Winston's previous works. With its perplexing plot, flat characters, and lackluster production quality, viewers are left with an uninspiring and forgettable experience. Venturing into the world of \\"Fading Dreams\\" costs both time and money that would be better spent elsewhere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Summarize this article: The Petitions Committee said the debate would be on 5 September as a \\"huge number\\" had signed it. But the committee said the debate did not mean it was supporting the call for a second referendum and it was \\"too late\\" to change the referendum rules. The UK voted to leave the EU by 52% to 48% in the referendum on 23 June. The petition, set up on 25 May before the referendum, states: \\"We the undersigned call upon HM Government to implement a rule that if the Remain or Leave vote is less than 60%, based [on] a turnout of less than 75%, there should be another referendum.\\" Those who signed it have already received an email that said the prime minister and government had \\"been clear that this was a once-in-a-generation vote\\" and the decision \\"must be respected\\". The referendum saw 17.4 million (51.9%) votes cast to leave the EU, compared with 16.1 million (48.1%) for Remain, with a turnout of 72.2%, according to the Electoral Commission. In a statement, the House of Commons Petitions Committee said a debate on the petition would allow MPs to \\"put forward a range of views on behalf of their constituents\\" and a government minister would respond to the points raised. But it said: \\"A debate in Westminster Hall does not have the power to change the law, and won't end with the House of Commons deciding whether or not to have a second referendum... \\"It will be up to the government to decide whether it wants to start the process of agreeing a new law for a second referendum.\\" The online petition, set up by William Oliver Healey, gained more signatures than any other on the parliamentary website in the wake of the EU referendum result. Before the result was declared just 22 people had signed it. The petition was investigated for fraud last month and 77,000 signatures that were found to be false were removed. It was considered for a parliamentary debate by the Petitions Committee because it had received more than 100,000 signatures.","completion":"The UK's Petitions Committee announced plans for a debate on a second EU referendum on September 5th.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - In physics, gravitational acceleration is the acceleration on an object caused by the force of gravitation. Neglecting friction such as air resistance, all small bodies accelerate in a gravitational field at the same rate relative to the center of mass. This equality is true regardless of the masses or compositions of the bodies. - The kilogram or kilogramme (SI unit symbol: kg) is the base unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI) (the Metric system) and is defined as being equal to the mass of the \\"International Prototype of the Kilogram\\" (IPK, also known as \\"Le Grand K\\" or \\"Big K\\"). - An airplane or aeroplane (informally plane) is a powered, fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine or propeller. Airplanes come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations. The broad spectrum of uses for airplanes includes recreation, transportation of goods and people, military, and research. Commercial aviation is a massive industry involving the flying of tens of thousands of passengers daily on airliners. Most airplanes are flown by a pilot on board the aircraft, but some are designed to be remotely or computer-controlled. - The International System of Units (; abbreviated as SI) is the modern form of the metric system, and is the most widely used system of measurement. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units. The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. - In physics, a force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. In other words, a force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate. Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull. A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. It is measured in the SI unit of newtons and represented by the symbol F. - Miniature dachshunds have a typical weight of 8 to 11 pounds in the United States . They also are normally a height of 5 to 7 inches at the withers . They are nicknamed \`\` wiener dogs '' , \`\` hot dogs '' or \`\` sausage dogs '' . - In physics, mass is a property of a physical body. It is the measure of an object's resistance to acceleration (a change in its state of motion) when a net force is applied. It also determines the strength of its mutual gravitational attraction to other bodies. The basic SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg). - Altitude or height (sometimes known as depth) is defined based on the context in which it is used (aviation, geometry, geographical survey, sport, and many more). As a general definition, altitude is a distance measurement, usually in the vertical or \\"up\\" direction, between a reference datum and a point or object. The reference datum also often varies according to the context. Although the term altitude is commonly used to mean the height above sea level of a location, in geography the term elevation is often preferred for this usage. - Height is the measure of vertical distance, either how \\"tall\\" something is, or how \\"high up\\" it is. For example \\"The height of the building is 50 m\\" or \\"The height of the airplane is 10,000 m\\". When used to describe how high something like an airplane or mountain peak is from sea level, height is more often called altitude. Height is measured along the vertical (y) axis between a specified point and another. - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. - Engineering is the application of mathematics and scientific, economic, social, and practical knowledge in order to invent, innovate, design, build, maintain, research, and improve structures, machines, tools, systems, components, materials, processes, solutions, and organizations. - The dachshund (or or ) is a short-legged, long-bodied, hound-type dog breed. - Gravity, or gravitation, is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass are brought toward (or \\"gravitate\\" toward) one another, including planets, stars and galaxies. Since energy and mass are equivalent, all forms of energy, including light, also cause gravitation and are under the influence of it. On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects and causes the ocean tides. The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing, forming stars and the stars to group together into galaxies so gravity is responsible for many of the large scale structures in the Universe. Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become increasingly weaker on farther objects. - Mean sea level (MSL) (abbreviated simply sea level) is an average level of the surface of one or more of Earth's oceans from which heights such as elevations may be measured. MSL is a type of vertical datuma standardised geodetic reference pointthat is used, for example, as a chart datum in cartography and marine navigation, or, in aviation, as the standard sea level at which atmospheric pressure is measured in order to calibrate altitude and, consequently, aircraft flight levels. A common and relatively straightforward mean sea-level standard is the midpoint between a mean low and mean high tide at a particular location. - The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known. - In science and engineering, the weight of an object is usually taken to be the force on the object due to gravity. Weight is a vector whose magnitude (a scalar quantity), often denoted by an italic letter \\"W\\", is the product of the mass \\"m\\" of the object and the magnitude of the local gravitational acceleration \\"g\\"; thus: . The unit of measurement for weight is that of force, which in the International System of Units (SI) is the newton. For example, an object with a mass of one kilogram has a weight of about 9.8 newtons on the surface of the Earth, and about one-sixth as much on the Moon. In this sense of weight, a body can be weightless only if it is far away (in principle infinitely far away) from any other mass. Although weight and mass are scientifically distinct quantities, the terms are often confused with each other in everyday use (i.e. comparing and converting force weight in pounds to mass in kilograms and vice versa).

Answer the following question: Two women have just undergone different types of mutations without them being aware of it. Kim has just had a mutation in the DNA of her sex cells. Holly has had a mutation in her body cells. Both mutations would be able to be discovered if they happen to go to a doctor, and the doctor knows to look for it, but that is unlikely since the women are unaware these changes happened. Whose mutation is less likely to cause cancer? Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided information, Holly's mutation is more likely to cause cancer. To explain, Kim has had a germline mutation, which occurs in the DNA of her sex cells. While this type of mutation can be passed down to the next generation and may cause hereditary diseases, it is not as directly associated with cancer as somatic mutations. The germline mutation will be present in all of Kim's offspring, but may not necessarily result in any medical problems, depending on the specific mutation and whether it affects a gene that is necessary for proper functioning in her offspring's bodies. On the other hand, Holly has had a somatic mutation, which occurs in her body cells. This type of mutation is not passed down to the next generation; however, it can lead to serious medical conditions such as cancer. Somatic mutations can lead to the uncontrolled growth and division of cells, which is a hallmark of cancer. As the mutated cell replicates, it passes on the mutation to its descendants, potentially accumulating more mutations that can further contribute to cancer development.

In February 2006, Super Junior 05 began performances for \\"Miracle\\", the second promotional single from their debut album. \\"Miracle\\" topped the music charts of Thailand, drawing interest from international markets. As promotions for \\"Miracle\\" ended, SM Entertainment began selecting new members for Super Junior's second generation, Super Junior 06. The company even prepared a list of chosen members that were to graduate from the group. However, the company abandoned the rotational concept after adding a thirteenth member, Kyuhyun, in 2006. The group then became known as just Super Junior, without the suffix \\"05\\". Member Eunhyuk indirectly explains in a variety show that junior group SHINee could have been part of the group, but that was contemplated before Kyuhyun broke the rotational concept. After the addition of Kyuhyun, Super Junior released their single \\"U\\" for free download on May 25, 2006 on their official website. \\"U\\" exceeded 400,000 downloads within five hours of release and ultimately surpassed 1.7 million downloads, crashing the server. The physical single of \\"U\\" with a total of three tracks was released on June 6, eventually selling over 81,000 units in South Korea. The single became one of Korea's most popular songs of the year, taking up number one spots for five consecutive weeks on two of Korea's top music programs. By the end of the year, Super Junior collected over seven awards in five of South Korea's top music award ceremonies, and was one of the three Best Newcomer winners at the 21st Golden Disk Awards. In late 2006, Kyuhyun, Ryeowook, and Yesung formed the subgroup Super Junior-K.R.Y., Super Junior's first sub-unit. They performed their first single \\"The One I Love\\", theme song to the Korean television drama Hyena, on the KBS music program Music Bank on November 5, 2006. In February 2007, Leeteuk, Heechul, Kangin, Sungmin, Shindong and Eunhyuk formed Super Junior-T, a trot-singing group. They released their first single \\"Rokuko\\" on February 23, 2007, and made a debut performance on Popular Songs two days later. Super Junior's second official album was intended for a late 2006 release, but due to several accidental setbacks, Don't Don was not released until September 20, 2007. Don't Don sold over 60,000 units the first day of release and debuted at number one on the monthly chart of September 2007. Although Don't Don received mixed reviews from critics, the album went to sell more than 160,000 copies by the end of the year, becoming the second best-selling record of 2007. Super Junior received seven nominations at the 2007 Mnet/KM Music Festival, winning three of them which included Artist of the Year, termed by many as the highest recognition of the ceremony. Super Junior collected two more recognitions at the 22nd Golden Disk Awards, including a Disk Bonsang award (Record of the Year). Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"Yes, there are several other interesting aspects about this article: 1. The Rotational Concept: Initially, SM Entertainment planned for Super Junior to have a rotational concept, where new members would be added and existing members would graduate from the group. This idea was eventually dropped after the addition of Kyuhyun in 2006. 2. Impact on International Markets: The group's single \\"Miracle\\" topped the music charts in Thailand, hinting at their potential influence in international markets that would later become more prominent. 3. Subgroups: Super Junior has formed various subgroups in their career, such as Super Junior-K.R.Y. and Super Junior-T. These subgroups allow individual members to showcase their unique talents and explore different musical genres. 4. Don't Don: Super Junior's second album, Don't Don, sold over 60,000 units on its first day of release and became the second best-selling record of 2007. This showcases the group's commercial success and their growing popularity in the music industry. 5. Award Recognition: Super Junior has consistently been acknowledged in the music industry, winning numerous awards at different music award ceremonies, including the prestigious Artist of the Year award at the 2007 Mnet/KM Music Festival."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"Farid Shawqi Mohammad Abduh Badawi, known as Farid Shawqi, was an Egyptian actor, screenwriter, and film producer born on July 30, 1920, in Cairo and passed away on July 27, 1998. Throughout his career, he acted in 361 films, 12 plays, and 12 television series, wrote 22 film scripts, and produced 26 films. Shawqi was also known by various nicknames, including Malek el Terso (meaning \\"The King of the Third Class\\"), in reference to his popularity among the poor who bought third-class seats in movie theaters. He was also called \\"Wahsh ash Shashah al Arabiyah,\\" meaning \\"the monster of the Arab silver screen\\" due to his various roles as a beloved hero; \\"Farid Bay,\\" an informal title of respect; and \\"Abu el-Banat,\\" meaning \\"father of all girls,\\" owing to his having five daughters and no sons. In his almost 50-year-long career, Shawqi starred, produced, or wrote the scenario of over 400 films, which is more than the number of films produced collectively by the entire Arab world. His work spanned theatre, television, and video plays. Shawqi's popularity covered the whole Arab world, including Turkey, where he acted in some films. He worked with over 90 film directors and producers, who addressed him as \\"Farid Bay\\" out of respect. During the first ten years of his career, Shawqi was typically cast as a villain, and by the late 1940s, his name alongside that of the late Mahmoud El-Meliegy guaranteed box-office success. In 1950, he changed that image permanently by playing the leading role in \\"Ga'aloony Mujriman\\" (\\"They Made Me a Criminal\\"), a film that focused on the problem of homeless children and exposed the failure of government policy and corruption in state-run orphanages and young offenders' institutions. Although initially disliked by the establishment, the film later received the state prize. Shawqi went on to collect 10 Best Actor awards in numerous festivals and four other awards for his film scripts in the next three decades. Critics referred to him as the \\"tragedy hero\\" of the Arab cinema due to his influential roles and contributions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, high school students and college students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods. It has received criticism towards this change of focus, both by certain segments of its audience and musicians. MTV's influence on its audience, including issues involving censorship and social activism, has also been a subject of debate for several years. - RCA Records is an American major record label owned by Sony Music Entertainment (SME).

Please answer the following question: This is a beauty myth that I have been wanting to bust for a while as I am surprised how many people actually believe it. I am quite vain so hate having visible grey hairs. Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??). Whenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out. I have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it? Or worse, each time you waxed your legs, seven hairs replaced each pulled one - what state would your legs be in now? Who is the hairdresser?

We have an equation: 31*i + 1026 = 93*i + 52*i First, we need to combine the \\"i\\" terms on the right side of the equation. So, we add 93*i and 52*i together: 93*i + 52*i = 145*i Now, our equation looks like this: 31*i + 1026 = 145*i Next, we want to get all the \\"i\\" terms on one side and the numbers (without \\"i\\") on the other side. To do this, we can subtract 31*i from both sides: 145*i - 31*i = 1026 This subtraction gives us: 114*i = 1026 Now, we want to find out what \\"i\\" is by itself. So, we divide both sides of the equation by 114: 114*i / 114 = 1026 / 114 This simplifies to: i = 9 So, the answer to our math problem is that \\"i\\" equals 9.

Context: Gunshots rang out once again on a campus in the United States on Wednesday. Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it. Question: What is likely true about the politics regarding gun rights in the US? Answer: A:","completion":"The politics regarding gun rights in the United States is a deeply contentious and polarizing issue. There is a unique relationship between Americans and their guns, and this relationship is enshrined in the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects the right to bear arms. The roots of this amendment can be traced back to English common law and the concept of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and civic duty. On one side of the political spectrum, there are strong proponents of gun rights who argue that the Second Amendment is an inviolable part of the Constitution and that Americans have the right to own and carry firearms for self-defense and other lawful purposes. This group includes organizations like the National Rifle Association, which is a powerful lobbying force in American politics. They advocate for broad access to firearms, minimal regulations on gun ownership, and a strict interpretation of the Second Amendment. They are also likely to reject campaigns like Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day as \\"pointless\\" and merely a way of \\"scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" On the other side, there are individuals and organizations that advocate for tighter gun control measures, as they believe that the current regulations and background check procedures are flawed, riddled with loopholes, and contribute to the high rates of gun-related violence in the country. This group includes civic organizations, politicians, and celebrities that participate in awareness campaigns like Wear Orange. They argue for more comprehensive background checks, waiting periods, and restrictions on certain types of weapons and accessories. The politics surrounding gun rights in the United States is marked by a deep divide, with both sides steadfastly advocating for their respective positions. This has resulted in an ongoing political debate that traverses all levels of government and society with little consensus on the most effective approach to minimizing gun-related violence while respecting the rights enumerated in the Second Amendment. As exemplified by the Wear Orange campaign and the UCLA shooting incident, the issue continues to provoke strong emotions and fierce disagreements throughout the country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Netflix on Wednesday released a new teaser for House of Cards' sixth season — and it finally reveals the fate of Kevin Spacey's character, Frank Underwood. Spacey was fired from the show last fall due to allegations of sexual abuse made by multiple men. Since then, nobody was sure exactly how the Netflix series would handle Underwood's absence, given he was the show's main character. This new teaser confirms that, as you might expect, Underwood is dead in the new season. The brief video released on Twitter shows Robin Wright's Claire Underwood standing over her husband's grave, saying, \\"I'll tell you this, though, Francis. When they bury me, it won't be in my backyard. And when they pay their respects, they'll have to wait in line.\\" Underwood's tombstone is then revealed; he's buried next to his father, who died of a heart attack at a young age. Fans have speculated that the former president will die of a heart attack like his father. House of Cards' sixth and final season will premiere on Netflix on Nov. 2.

Tests: David Nutt wants to investigate whether magic mushrooms work in treating depression. Campaigners have criticised a decision. to award £550,000 of public funds to a sacked government drugs tsar so. he can investigate whether magic mushrooms work in treating depression. Professor David Nutt was forced out of. his role as the Government’s chief drug adviser in 2009 for saying. ecstasy was less dangerous than horseriding. He now wants to study whether the. hallucinogenic ingredient in magic mushrooms, psilocybin, can be used to. treat severe depression. His team has been given a grant by the Medical. Research Council for a pioneering trial on 60 sufferers who have failed. to respond to two previous treatments. But he said he cannot start because. the Home Office must first grant a licence for companies to supply his. team with the compound. Critics say Professor Nutt’s track record makes him an inappropriate choice to carry out the research. Previously, he opposed the decision to. reclassify cannabis from Class C to Class B in 2009, and has argued. alcohol was ‘considerably more dangerous’ than the drug. Last year, he. led a controversial live trial of pure ecstasy on Channel 4. Mary Brett, of Europe Against Drugs,. said of the latest project: ‘Why are the MRC giving money to a man who. had got it completely wrong over cannabis? Professor Nutt’s patchy. record raises questions. He seems obsessed with recreational drugs.’ Magic mushrooms, with heroin and cocaine, are Class A drugs and are believed to exacerbate mental health problems in some users. Previously Professor Nutt’s team at. Imperial College London found psilocybin reduced activity in a part of. the brain known to be over-active in depression. But that study was on. healthy volunteers subject to less stringent regulations. Only four hospitals in Britain have a. licence to hold psilocybin, and Professor Nutt said the authorities. refused to tell him where. He said: ‘The rules are absurd.’ Risk: Magic mushrooms, with heroin and cocaine, are Class A drugs and are believed to exacerbate mental health problems in some users. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"In this article, it is reported that Profesor David Nutt, a former government drugs tsar who was dismissed in 2009 for claiming that ecstasy was less dangerous than horseriding, has been awarded £550,000 in public funds by the Medical Research Council for a trial to investigate whether psilocybin, the hallucinogenic ingredient in magic mushrooms, can be used to treat severe depression. The trial aims to involve 60 participants who have failed to respond to at least two previous treatments. However, to begin the study, Nutt's team is required to obtain a license from the Home Office to allow companies to supply them with the compound.

Like all dunks, a windmill requires you to jump high. Start a windmill dunk by approaching the basket while dribbling, then jump toward it as high as you can. Choose your answer from: [A]. Make sure your knees are bent, and you are not rolling by arching your back or tilting your head to make contact with the basket. You can also actually do a bounce dunk with your arms straight up. [B]. Your momentum may have carried you over once you jump, but the windmill dunk will remove that. Reach the basket after you've jumped. [C]. For beginners, this will only take a few seconds to get up close to the basket. Make a fast punch with your hands as you jump. [D]. Hold onto the ball with one hand. One of the distinctive features of a windmill dunk is that it is executed with one hand.","completion":"[B]. Your momentum may have carried you over once you jump, but the windmill dunk will remove that. Reach the basket after you've jumped. Once you've reached the peak of your jump, begin to bring the ball up and behind your head in a circular motion. This movement is what gives the windmill dunk its name, as it mimics the motion of a windmill's blades spinning. Make sure you have a firm grip on the ball to prevent it from slipping out of your hand during the dunk. As you bring the ball behind your head, maintain control of it with one hand and keep your eyes on the rim. This is where timing and precision come into play. As your body starts to descend from the jump, extend your arm and forcefully whip the ball forward in a windmill motion, using your wrist and arm strength to propel it towards the basket. It is essential to maintain proper body position throughout the dunk. Keep your chest and shoulders upright and aligned with the basket to ensure the ball travels in a straight line. If you lean too far to one side, the ball may miss the rim entirely, leading to a failed dunk attempt. Additionally, try to keep your legs straight and together, as bending or spreading them apart can cause you to lose power and height. When executing the windmill dunk, be prepared for the impact as your hand makes contact with the rim. The force generated by the dunk can cause you to lose your grip on the rim or, in extreme cases, even injure your hand or fingers. Hold on to the rim firmly and keep your wrist and fingers strong to ensure a successful dunk. Finally, after completing the windmill motion and slamming the ball through the hoop, let go of the rim and land safely, with both feet on the ground. It's essential to bend your knees upon landing to absorb the impact and protect your joints from injury. As with any athletic feat, practice makes perfect. The more you practice your windmill dunk, the more confident and fluid your movements will become, ultimately allowing you to achieve a more impressive and powerful dunk."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible answers: know robin's husband, ask for help, refuse to pay rent","completion":"Based on the information provided, Remy appears to be in a situation where they needed financial assistance - possibly either for a personal situation or an unexpected crisis. It can be assumed that Remy is reaching out to those in their circle, such as friends or acquaintances, from whom they think they can seek help in times of need. Given that Remy decided to approach Robin's husband, it can be inferred that they might have had a pre-existing relationship or familiarity with each other. One possible reason for Remy approaching Robin's husband is that they know each other well and have a certain level of trust established between them. Remy might have felt more comfortable approaching someone who they have known for a long time or with whom they share a close bond. Furthermore, reaching out to Robin's husband rather than other friends could be because they might have easily recognized his financial stability and the ability to provide assistance. Another possible reason for Remy's actions could be their unwillingness to ask for help from multiple people. In some cases, people tend to feel embarrassed or uncomfortable when reaching out for help. As a result, Remy might have opted to only ask Robin's husband, potentially to avoid repeatedly exposing their vulnerability to a broader group of friends or acquaintances. It's also possible that Remy had already asked others for help and had been unsuccessful in getting the support they needed, so they decided to turn to Robin's husband as a last resort. Lastly, regarding the refusal to pay rent example, it is unclear how this particular reason would relate to Remy's request for money from Robin's husband. However, if Remy were in a tough financial situation where they cannot afford to pay their rent and have exhausted all other options, they might be compelled to approach someone like Robin's husband for assistance. In this case, the inability to pay rent would be an effect of the overall financial troubles Remy is facing rather than a direct cause for their request. In conclusion, Remy's request for money from Robin's husband can be attributed to several possible reasons, such as familiarity and trust between the two, Remy's discomfort asking for help from others, or an acute financial crisis such as the inability to pay rent. It is essential to gather more information about Remy and Robin's husband's relationship, Remy's personal and financial background, and prior requests for support to better understand Remy's motives behind their actions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Distant and little-inhabited area like Northern Scotland, are too remote for the development of large seaside resorts. For most children, going to the seaside suggests a week or fortnight of freedom on the beach, ideally a sandy one providing enough opportunities for the construction of sandcastle, fishing in pool, paddling in shallow water or swimming in deep water. Their parents spend sunny days swimming in the sea and sunbathing on the beach. Not that the British sun can be relied on and the depressing sight of families wandering round the town in old -fashioned and under umbrellas is only too common. However, there are always shops with their tourist souvenirs, plenty of cafes and if the worst comes to the worst, the cinema to offer a refuge. The average family is unlikely to seek accommodation in a hotel as they can stay more cheaply in a boarding-house. There are usually three or four-storeyed Victorian buildings, whose owners spend the summer season letting rooms to a number of couples or families and providing three cooked meals a day at what they describe as a reasonable price, with the hope that in this way they will add enough to their savings to see the winter through. Otherwise there are the camping sites for those who prefer self-catering.

Information: - Zalmoxis is a divinity of the Getae and Dacians (a people of the lower Danube), mentioned by Herodotus in his \\"Histories\\" IV, 9396. - The Danube (, known by various names in other languages) is Europe's second-longest river, after the Volga River, and also the longest river in the European Union region. It is located in Central and Eastern Europe. - See Kogaionon ( genus ) for the mammal from the Upper Cretaceous . Kogaionon was the holy mountain of the Geto - Dacians , the place where Zalmoxis stayed in an underground cave for three years . After his disappearance into Kogaionon , he was considered dead by the Getae but after three years he resurrected and showed himself to the people , who became convinced by his holy preaching when he emerged from Kogaionon . Strabo claims that a river with the same name flowed in the vicinity . One modern translation of Kogaionon is \`\` sacred mountain '' , which would be connected to a probable Dacian word kaga meaning \`\` sacred '' , attested in two early 2nd century inscriptions from Tomis . Kogaionon 's location is still under debate , but thought to be either in the area around the Dacian capital Sarmizegetusa Regia ( there is a 2291m summit there called Gugu and there are speculations that it could be the holy mountain ; it may also have been Dealul Grditei where the ruins of the sanctuaries of Sarmizegetusa are located ) or even the Ceahlu mountain , because every year on 6/7 August the shadow of the mountain forms a pyramid which is thought to have been made by the Dacians . - The Getae or or Gets (singular ) are several Thracian tribes that once inhabited the regions to either side of the Lower Danube, in what is today northern Bulgaria and southern Romania. Both the singular form \\"Get\\" and plural \\"Getae\\" may be derived from a Greek exonym: the area was the hinterland of Greek colonies on the Black Sea coast, bringing the Getae into contact with the Ancient Greeks from an early date.

Context: Hoping to rebound from their loss at Pittsburgh, the Patriots returned home for an interconference duel with the New York Giants, the first meeting since Super Bowl XLII where the Giants stopped their chances at going 19-0. After a scoreless first half, The Giants grabbed the lead in the third quarter, with a 22-yard field goal by placekicker Lawrence Tynes, followed by a 10-yard touchdown run by running back Brandon Jacobs. The Patriots got on the board, with a 32-yard field goal by placekicker Stephen Gostkowski. In the fourth quarter, the Patriots tied the game, with a 5-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Tom Brady to tight end Aaron Hernandez, then took the lead with a 45-yard field goal by Gostkowski. The Giants re-claimed the lead, with a 10-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Eli Manning to wide receiver Mario Manningham with three minutes remaining. The Patriots responded, with a 14-yard touchdown pass from Brady to tight end Rob Gronkowski. However, with a minute and a half remaining in a similar repeat of Super Bowl XLII, Manning led the Giants on a game-winning drive, culminating with a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jake Ballard. With the loss, the Patriots dropped to 5-3, and QB Tom Brady's streak of 32 consecutive home wins was snapped. Following the game the Patriots released Albert Haynesworth, who'd reportedly gotten into a sideline confrontation with assistant coach Pepper Johnson. The loss was the third time in nine seasons the Patriots had suffered consecutive losses, and only the second time the team has lost to an NFC team at Gillette Stadium. This was the 1st time the Patriots had a 2-game losing streak since Week 12 and Week 13 in 2009. The Giants and the Patriots would meet again in Super Bowl XLVI with the Giants winning 21-17. Question: How many yards difference was Tom Brady’s first touchdown pass compared to Eli Manning’s first touchdown pass?

Question: Who withdraws from international politics? Movie title: Vexille Movie plot: By the 2060s, robotics technology has advanced to the point that cybernetics have become plausible. World opinion begins to turn against robotics, leading to the U.N. declaring a unilateral ban on further research and development in 2067. Japan, being home to robotics pioneer Daiwa Heavy Industries, the governing body, strongly protests this ban, but is unable to prevent its passage.In protest, Japan withdraws from international politics. All foreigners are deported, and further immigration is prohibited. In addition, the R.A.C.E. network is constructed a series of 270 off-shore installations that cover Japan with an energy field that distorts the entire electromagnetic spectrum, nullifying all communication between Japan and the outside world and making even satellite surveillance impossible. Trade and diplomacy continues, but for all intents and purposes, Japan vanishes from the world scene.Ten years later, the American Navy technology Special Forces unit \\"SWORD\\" is lead on the intel of a Japanese informant of a trap set by Daiwa in Colorado. The instigator, Saito, escapes, cut off his own leg to get rid of Vexille Serra, a soldier of SWORD. Analysis of the leg show that it is made of bio-metal.

This resulted in the export of Greek culture and language to these new realms through Greco-Macedonian colonization, spanning as far as modern-day Pakistan.

Hellenistic culture thus represents a fusion of the Ancient Greek world with that of the Near East, Middle East, and Southwest Asia, and a departure from earlier Greek attitudes towards \\"barbarian\\" cultures. The Hellenistic period was characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization (as distinguished from that occurring in the 8th–6th centuries BC) which established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose You more wisely keep the Cuckoo bird out happens, how will it affect MORE birds. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you propose involves keeping the Cuckoo bird out, which can have both direct and indirect effects on the bird population and the overall process. Cuckoo birds are known for their brood parasitism, meaning that they lay their eggs in the nests of other bird species. When the Cuckoo bird's egg hatches, the hatchling often pushes other eggs or hatchlings out of the nest, causing a decrease in the host bird's offspring survival rate. This behavior ultimately affects the host bird population and could lead to a reduction of other bird species. If the Cuckoo bird is kept out or excluded from the bird population, some direct and indirect effects may include: 1. Direct effect: An increase in the survival rate of the host bird species' offspring. With Cuckoo birds absent, host birds can successfully raise their own offspring without the threat of a Cuckoo hatchling pushing them out of the nest. 2. Direct effect: The host bird species may reproduce more efficiently, as they no longer need to invest as much energy in re-nesting due to brood parasitism by the Cuckoo bird. This can lead to an increase in the overall population of the host bird species. 3. Indirect effect: An increase in the host bird species population may lead to more birds occupying a given area. This could affect the ecosystem by promoting healthier populations of insects, the primary food source for many bird species. 4. Indirect effect: With an increase in the host bird population, predator-prey dynamics could shift. Predators that rely on the host bird species as a food source may have more available prey, potentially leading to an increase in predator populations. 5. Indirect effect: If the Cuckoo bird population decreases significantly due to the inability to parasitize host nests, this could indirectly affect the overall bird diversity in an ecosystem. Cuckoos may play a role in keeping certain host bird populations in check, and their absence could lead to an imbalance. In summary, keeping the Cuckoo bird out of the bird population can have both direct and indirect effects on the overall process. The direct effects involve the survival and reproduction of host bird species, while indirect effects involve changes in the ecosystem, predator-prey dynamics, and overall bird diversity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Under Section 377A, men who engage in \\"gross indecency\\" privately or publicly can be jailed for up to two years. Singapore, which largely remains conservative, has seen intense debate in recent years over gay rights. Human Rights Watch called the decision \\"a major setback for equal rights\\", adding that it \\"tramples upon basic rights to privacy, equality and non-discrimination\\". On Thursday, 14 local rights groups released a statement saying the court had missed an opportunity to show that Singapore was \\"a truly accepting, open and inclusive society\\". The groups said Section 377A \\"gives carte blanche for discrimination and reinforces prejudice\\". \\"To be viewed as equal in the eyes of the law... is a right to which every Singaporean should be entitled, and not denied on the basis of whom they love,\\" they added. Jean Chong, spokesman for lesbian group Sayoni, told the BBC that the ruling effectively made homosexual, bisexual and transgender Singaporeans \\"second-class citizens\\". Government leaders have pledged not to enforce Section 377A, first introduced in 1938 by British colonial rulers. But they have also refused to remove it, saying it reflects the conservative mores of Singapore society. Lawyers involved in the legal challenges, mounted separately by a gay couple and a gay man, argued that the law went against the constitution guaranteeing \\"life and liberty\\" and equal protection. But the court rejected these claims, and said it was up to legislators to decide on the law. Though surveys have shown most Singaporeans do not accept homosexuality, there is widespread tolerance. Since 2009 rights groups have held an annual rally known as Pink Dot, which this year drew its largest-ever crowd of 26,000. But conservatives have pushed back against gay activism and campaigned vigorously for Section 377A to remain.

I rushed into the play room where my oldest was playing alone. I looked him dead in the eyes and said: \\"Well you know Santa isn't real, right?\\" And as I stared at my eight-year-old son for what seemed like a long time of silence, his eyes started to fill with tears.

They decide to escape their woes and hike to a remote village in Norfolk that they find on an old map. As they arrive at a pub in the village, with Jimmy upset about Fletch destroying his phone, they see a number of attractive foreign female history students leaving. Hoping to find more beautiful women inside, they are greeted by a morose crowd of men and approached by a seemingly crazed vicar who believes Jimmy is a long lost descendant of a local vampire slayer. As the barman offers the two men free ale as an apology for the vicar, they learn the students they saw earlier are going to a cottage, where they are to stay the night. Jimmy and Fletch pursue the students' van, catching up to it as the engine has broken down, and are introduced to four girls (Heidi, Lotte, Anke and Trudi). They are invited to join a party on the bus.

Stand in front of the barbell with your feet shoulder- or hip-width apart. While bending slightly at the knees, lean forward at the hips until your torso is at a 45° angle to the floor. Maintain the natural arch in your lower back. It is always better to underestimate rather than overestimate the amount of weight you can lift. Lifting too much weight can lead to injuries. With your arms extended towards the floor, grip the top of the bar. Place your palms slightly more than shoulder width apart. Contract the muscles in your lower back and abdominal area. As you lift the barbell off the ground, extend your knees slightly while maintaining the position of your torso. Pause just before the barbell reaches your knees. This is the starting position. Some lifters prefer to lift the barbell only slightly off the ground. Doing so may cause you to strain your back. Exhale as you pull the barbell towards your lower chest. Keep your elbows tight against your body and your torso stationary. At the top of the lift, pause and contract your back muscles. Inhale as you lower the bar to its initial position (slightly below your knees). Repeat. Instead of executing a traditional bent over row with a barbell, try altering your grip to work a different muscle group or intensify your workout. Use an underhand grip. Instead of grabbing the bar from above, grip the barbell from below. When your palms are facing up, you take the strain off your back by forcing your biceps and lats to do more work. Use a snatch grip. A snatch grip is a double wide grip.

Article: The modern concept of an abstract group developed out of several fields of mathematics. The original motivation for group theory was the quest for solutions of polynomial equations of degree higher than 4. The 19th-century French mathematician Évariste Galois, extending prior work of Paolo Ruffini and Joseph-Louis Lagrange, gave a criterion for the solvability of a particular polynomial equation in terms of the symmetry group of its roots (solutions). The elements of such a Galois group correspond to certain permutations of the roots. At first, Galois' ideas were rejected by his contemporaries, and published only posthumously. More general permutation groups were investigated in particular by Augustin Louis Cauchy. Arthur Cayley's On the theory of groups, as depending on the symbolic equation θn = 1 (1854) gives the first abstract definition of a finite group.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: slow motion dolly shot with pan of a waterfall","completion":"In the given sentence \\"slow motion dolly shot with pan of a waterfall,\\" the most important words are: 1. Slow motion: \\"Slow motion\\" refers to the cinematic technique of slowing down the playback of filmed footage. This is usually achieved by capturing the scene at a higher frame rate than the standard 24 or 30 frames per second. The resulting effect is a smooth, elongated representation of the action, which often highlights details that would otherwise be missed at regular speed. 2. Dolly shot: A \\"dolly shot\\" is a camera movement where the entire camera is mounted on a wheeled platform, known as a dolly, and is moved smoothly along the ground, usually on a set of tracks. This allows for smooth tracking shots and precise control over the camera's position and movement. Dolly shots can be used to create a sense of depth and motion in a scene, adding visual interest and dynamism. 3. Pan: \\"Pan\\" is short for \\"panning,\\" which is a camera movement where the camera is rotated horizontally on its vertical axis, usually while mounted on a tripod or other stable support. This allows the camera to sweep across a scene, capturing a wide field of view and providing a sense of space and scale. Panning shots can be used to reveal new information or follow the movement of a subject in a scene. 4. Waterfall: In this context, \\"waterfall\\" is the subject of the shot and the primary focus of the visual scene. Waterfalls are natural features where water flows over a drop or a series of drops in a river or stream. They are often visually arresting and can evoke feelings of awe, serenity, and the passage of time. Capturing a waterfall in slow motion and with a dolly shot with pan can create a dynamic, engaging, and visually stunning sequence. In summary, the most important words in the given sentence – \\"slow motion,\\" \\"dolly shot,\\" \\"pan,\\" and \\"waterfall\\" – convey crucial information about the technique, camera movement, and subject matter of the shot being described. These words provide a clear mental image of what the viewer can expect in terms of visual pacing, space, and focus."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

By Jill Reilly Ukrainian former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, released from jail last month after her rival Viktor Yanukovich fled from power, announced today that said she would run again for president in an election on May 25. She also pledged to build a strong army and said she hoped to be able to recover Crimea from Russia, which annexed it last week. The announcement by the flamboyant Tymoshenko set up a contest with boxer-turned-politician Vitaly Klitschko, who has also declared his candidacy, and other figures who have emerged to contend for top posts after four months of political turmoil. Yanukovich, her nemesis, subsequently launched a campaign against her and her allies, and she was jailed in 2011 for abuse of office linked to a gas deal she brokered with","completion":"Russia while prime minister. Tymoshenko, who has long been a controversial figure in Ukrainian politics, had her sentence condemned by the West as politically motivated. During her time in prison, she developed chronic back problems and underwent several operations. Her release from jail was one of the key demands of the mass protests that eventually led to Yanukovich's ousting. As the election approaches, Tymoshenko courts various political factions and establishes herself as a key figure in the race. Her charisma and experience make her a formidable candidate against Klitschko and other contenders. Despite the considerable public support for Klitschko, due to his achievements in the world of sports and his status as a political outsider, Tymoshenko's long political history and connections give her an advantage. Throughout the campaign, Tymoshenko promises to strengthen Ukraine's military and pursue a diplomatic solution to recover Crimea. She also vows to fight corruption, improve the economy, and pursue stronger ties with the European Union. Meanwhile, Klitschko focuses his campaign on his image as an outsider, proposing fresh approaches to Ukraine's most pressing issues, combatting corruption, and championing transparency. On May 25, the election takes place in a highly polarized political environment. After a long, hard-fought campaign, Yulia Tymoshenko wins the election by a narrow margin. Her victory is welcomed by her supporters, who believe that her experience and resilience make her the perfect candidate to lead Ukraine through this tumultuous time. However, her opponents raise concerns about her past controversies and question the legitimacy of her victory. Upon assuming office, President Tymoshenko's first priority is to address the issue of Crimea. She launches diplomatic efforts and works with the international community, particularly the European Union and the United States, to find a peaceful and negotiated solution to the crisis. Despite her best efforts, Russia refuses to cede control of the region, citing the results of the 2014 Crimea referendum, in which Crimeans expressed their desire to join Russia. Despite the stalemate over Crimea, Tymoshenko works tirelessly to improve Ukraine's domestic situation. She pushes for radical reforms in governance, cracking down on corruption, and implementing policies to boost the economy. However, her presidency is not without its setbacks. Tymoshenko's government faces numerous challenges, such as ongoing tensions with Russia, internal divisions and resistance to reform, and mounting economic problems. During her time in office, Tymoshenko manages to forge closer ties with the European Union, laying the groundwork for future integration. Despite her initial promise to build a strong army, Tymoshenko eventually transitions to a policy of diplomacy and cooperation with regional powers, focusing on non-military means to ensure Ukraine's security and independence. As Tymoshenko's term comes to an end, despite numerous obstacles, her administration is credited with making important strides in reforming Ukraine's political landscape and fostering stronger ties with the West. However, the issue of Crimea remains unresolved and continues to weigh heavily on her legacy. In conclusion, the story ends with Yulia Tymoshenko as the President of Ukraine, working tirelessly to better her country and navigate through the many political and economic challenges. She manages to make significant progress in some areas, particularly in strengthening Ukraine's ties to the European Union and reforming the domestic political landscape, but the question of Crimea continues to be an unresolved issue that still haunts her legacy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Paul Reynolds crisscrossed his sketchbook with furious strokes, filling the pages with images of the vengeance he would take on his former coworkers at Fear and Loading Games. He'd founded the company three years back and, just a few hours ago, his partners and erstwhile friends had fired him without cause or warning. He concentrated hard as his pen brought to life demonic figures from one of the best-selling comics he'd created, scythe wielding cyber-men called Myrmidons who tore into surprised computer programmers with fangs and claws. Elsewhere on the page, computers assembled themselves into 21st century Golems, rising up against traitorous CEO's and producers to crush them to bloody pulp as they cowered beneath their desks. Sitting at the bar in Señor Goldstein's Mexican Restaurant in San Jose, California, Paul's own artwork engaged him for the first time in months, maybe years. Under other circumstances, that would have made him happy. But today's circumstances allowed only two emotions: despair and a burning desire for revenge. Not wanting to succumb to the former, and not quite wanting to find a gun and go back to the office, he instead drew. He had turned to a fresh page and begun to sketch his most elaborate revenge-scheme yet when a woman walked into his line of vision. There were four or five other women in the restaurant already (most of them employees), but this one stood out. This one would've stood out anywhere. Her hair, cut short and spiky, was dyed a magenta so bright it nearly glowed. She wore a tight black t-shirt, baggy olive drab shorts that hung on shapely hips, and heavy black boots with two inch thick soles. She had a faded black messenger bag slung across her chest, the strap pressing between her breasts. If Paul had to guess, she wasn't wearing a bra. She definitely wasn't your average Silicon Valley techie on an early lunch break, and certainly not a restaurant employee. Question: Who wanted revenge on his partners?

I had previously known his divorce but, up until this point, not the reasoning. He told me, straight out, that he had cheated. Now, cheating in itself is one thing.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"No, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true. The premise and the hypothesis contradict each other, and evaluating the truth of the hypothesis depends on gathering evidence independent of the premise. Let's break down the premise and the hypothesis to better understand this. Premise: \\"You can watch world championship skiing at Cortina d'Ampezzo and Val Gardena.\\" The premise statement suggests that world championship skiing events take place at two locations: Cortina d'Ampezzo and Val Gardena. It is implied that the audience can attend and/or view these events happening at these locations. The truth of the premise would depend on factors such as the existence of world championship skiing events and their occurrence at the mentioned locations. To verify whether this premise is true or false, one needs to check facts, schedules, and locations of world championship skiing events. Hypothesis: \\"You can't watch world championship skiing at Cortina d'Ampezzo or Val Gardena.\\" The hypothesis statement is the opposite of the premise, asserting that you cannot watch world championship skiing at either Cortina d'Ampezzo or Val Gardena. It implies that there are either no world championship skiing events at these locations or that the audience is not allowed to attend/view the events. To verify the truth of this hypothesis, one would follow the same process of checking facts, schedules, and locations of world championship skiing events. The two statements have opposite implications about the possibility of watching world championship skiing events at Cortina d'Ampezzo and Val Gardena. Therefore, one cannot conclude that if the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true. In fact, if the premise is true, it would directly contradict the hypothesis, suggesting that the hypothesis is false. Only by examining independent evidence, such as event schedules and locations, can we determine whether the premise or the hypothesis accurately reflects the reality of watching world championship skiing at Cortina d'Ampezzo and Val Gardena."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After her husband's death in 1898, Isabella knew she had no time to lose in building her museum. She bought land, hired a building designer, and supervised every detail of her museum's construction. Mrs. Gardner opened her museum on January 1,1903. The museum was then called Fenway Court. She invited her friends that night for a special musical performance. The next month, she opened the museum to the public. At first, visits were limited to twenty days out of the year. Visitors paid one dollar to enter. Isabella Stewart Gardner died in 1924 in Boston.

Pat and Yvonne died in 2007 in 1988 . Select your answer from the options. Do these sentences mean the same thing? OPT: --no; --yes;","completion":"The answer is no; the two sentences do not mean the same thing. In the first sentence, \\"Pat died in 1988, and Yvonne died in 2007,\\" the statement is clear that Pat passed away in 1988 and Yvonne passed away in 2007. The sentence indicates that the two individuals died in different years. This sentence is organized and structured in a way that accurately communicates the years of death for both Pat and Yvonne. On the other hand, in the second sentence, \\"Pat and Yvonne died in 2007 in 1988,\\" there is a bit of confusion. The juxtaposition of both years is problematic and makes it difficult for readers to understand when exactly Pat and Yvonne passed away. The structure of this sentence is unclear, which can lead to misinterpretation and confusion. The key difference between these two sentences lies in the clarity and organization of the information presented. The first sentence offers a concise and unambiguous depiction of the years in which Pat and Yvonne died, while the second sentence is disorganized and confusing. To conclude, these two sentences do not share the same meaning due to the disordered presentation of years in the second sentence.

We have: -12 = 15 * q - 12 * q Imagine we have 15 apples multiplied by some number (q) and then we subtract 12 apples multiplied by the same number (q). And this will be equal to -12 apples. So, first, let's see what happens when we subtract the apples: 15 * q apples - 12 * q apples = (15 - 12) * q apples There is a difference of 3 apples between 15 and 12. So, we now have: 3 * q apples = -12 apples Now, let's find out how many times we need to multiply 3 apples by a number (q) to have -12 apples. To do that, we divide the total number of apples (-12) by the number of apples we're trying to multiply (3): q = -12 apples / 3 apples Since -12 divided by 3 is -4, this means: q = -4 So, our answer is q = -4."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Modern electrification systems take AC energy from a power grid which is delivered to a locomotive and converted to a DC voltage to be used by traction motors. These motors may either be DC motors which directly use the DC or they may be 3-phase AC motors which require further conversion of the DC to 3-phase AC (using power electronics). Thus both systems are faced with the same task: converting and transporting high-voltage AC from the power grid to low-voltage DC in the locomotive. Where should this conversion take place and at what voltage and current (AC or DC) should the power flow to the locomotive? And how does all this relate to energy-efficiency? Both the transmission and conversion of electric energy involve losses: ohmic losses in wires and power electronics, magnetic field losses in transformers and smoothing reactors (inductors). Power conversion for a DC system takes place mainly in a railway substation where large, heavy, and more efficient hardware can be used as compared to an AC system where conversion takes place aboard the locomotive where space is limited and losses are significantly higher. Also, the energy used to blow air to cool transformers, power electronics (including rectifiers), and other conversion hardware must be accounted for. What is the main action AC and DC systems have to deal with?","completion":"The main action both AC and DC systems have to deal with is converting and transporting high-voltage AC from the power grid to low-voltage DC in the locomotive, while maintaining energy efficiency and minimizing losses during the conversion and transmission process.

The band was formed in 1992 by percussionist Shawn Crahan, drummer Joey Jordison and bassist Paul Gray. After several lineup changes in its early years, the band settled on nine members for more than a decade: Corey Taylor, Mick Thomson, Jim Root, Paul Gray, Craig Jones, Sid Wilson, Shawn Crahan, Chris Fehn and Joey Jordison. Gray died on May 24, 2010, and was replaced during 2011-2014 by guitarist Donnie Steele. Anticipation for Slipknot's second album was intense. In early 2001, the band began recording the second album at Sound City and Sound Image studios in Los Angeles. Around this time, conflicts arose between band members due to extensive touring and recording schedules. Recording of their second album ended in February 2001 and the band embarked on their Iowa World Tour. Entitled Iowa, Slipknot's second album - released on August 28, 2001 - peaked at number three on the Billboard charts and at number one in the UK. The album produced three singles; \\"The Heretic Anthem\\" (promotional single), \\"Left Behind\\", and \\"My Plague\\", which appeared on the soundtrack for the film Resident Evil. In 2002, Slipknot appeared in Rollerball (2002), performing \\"I Am Hated\\". The release and intense promotion of the album resulted in sold-out shows in large arenas in several countries. In mid-2002, Slipknot went on hiatus because of internal conflicts, and band members focused on side projects. Vocalist Taylor and guitarist Root revived their band Stone Sour, drummer Jordison created Murderdolls with vocalist Wednesday 13, percussionist Crahan founded To My Surprise and DJ Wilson went solo as DJ Starscream. For a while, the future of Slipknot was uncertain and there was much speculation about whether there would be a third album, or if the split would become permanent. \\"I don't have a problem with anyone in Slipknot,\\" Jordison protested. \\"I've seen comments from Corey saying there are things to be resolved, but I have no fucking idea what he's talking about.\\" Nonetheless, on November 22, 2002, Slipknot released their second DVD, Disasterpieces.

Q:Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? The serial killer who shares the same name as a Spokane-Coeur d'Alene-American novelist born in 1966 is known for doing what to his victims? A:","completion":"The serial killer who shares the same name as a Spokane-Coeur d'Alene-American novelist born in 1966 is Robert Lee Yates Jr. The novelist with which he shares the name is Sherman Alexie, who was also born in 1966 and who is a Spokane-Coeur d'Alene-American. Both men are distinctly different individuals who are well-known in different fields, one in literature and the other in criminal justice. The serial killer, Robert Lee Yates Jr., is known for a series of brutal and horrifying murders. From 1975 to 1998, Yates targeted young women who were often engaged in sex work or were suffering from drug addiction, thus, making them vulnerable and less likely to be easily missed. He prowled the streets in and around the Spokane, Washington area, specifically focusing on the east Sprague Avenue, where many potential victims were located. Robert Lee Yates Jr.'s modus operandi was quite specific. He used his calm demeanor and the anonymity of his seemingly innocuous profession (he was a National Guard helicopter pilot) to lure victims into his vehicle. Then he would shoot them in the head, predominantly with a .25 caliber pistol, and later dispose of their bodies in rural and secluded areas. Another turn of his signature modes, he often returned to where he dumped their bodies to commit necrophilia. It was also stated during numerous reports that Yates sometimes covered the bodies of his victims with a plastic sheet and discarded them in somewhat hidden locations such as under bushes or overgrown grass. In some cases, he even cleaned up the bodies, removed their clothes, and then redressed them after he killed them. He'd sometimes leave money, usually coins, on or near the bodies. To date, he has been convicted of 15 murders but he is suspected to have committed more. His gruesome spree was put to an end in 2000 when he was arrested, and he's now serving a 408-year sentence along with two death sentences. Conversely, Sherman Alexie, the Spokane-Coeur d'Alene-American novelist born in 1966, is an award-winning author, poet, and filmmaker. His work primarily focuses on contemporary Native American identity, reservation life, and issues of poverty, alcoholism, and race. Despite sharing the same birth year and geographical region with a serial killer, Alexie's contributions to society have been meaningful and enlightening. A curious coincidence, but it's critical to clarify that these two men, while sharing certain superficial characteristics, are very much different in their actions and their impacts on the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Media playback is not supported on this device The former Scotland midfielder finished off a fine team move with an early side-footed effort into the far corner. Then his deep cross was headed over keeper Owain Fon Williams by Conor Sammon for a healthy half-time lead. Cowie fired in after Sammon returned the compliment and contributed to one of two clinical Sam Nicholson finishes ahead of a Callum Paterson own goal. It could have been worse for Caley Thistle - who are bottom of the Scottish Premiership without a point after three games - with Arnaud Djoum sending a last-minute drive off the inside of a post. For Hearts, it was a welcome first league win that not only elevates them to fifth place but lifts some early pressure on head coach Robbie Neilson. Despite the visitors enjoying an early chance when Josh Meekings headed a Greg Tansey corner kick wide, it was Hearts who enjoyed the better of the first half. Cowie's opening goal, his first for the Tynecastle club, was the result of a fluent passage of play. John Souttar's pass was dummied by Cowie to allow it to reach Sammon and the big striker laid it into the path of his captain, who curled a terrific left-foot curler into the far corner. Cowie's industrious midfield play also caught the eye and he was involved in Hearts' second goal as well - this time as creator. After mazy play from Tony Watt, the striker released Cowie wide on the right and his cross was perfect for Sammon to leap and head past Fon Williams from six yards. It took only two minutes of the second half for Cowie to double his tally. The result of another sweeping move, Watt and Sammon were involved in the build-up and Cowie this time used his right foot to curl the ball beyond the goalkeeper's reach from 18 yards. Nicholson had already had an appeal for a penalty waved aside by referee Steven McLean after he tumbled under the challenge of Gary Warren, before showing his predatory instincts with two goals in the space of two minutes. The winger's first was a powerful 20-yard drive after being sent clear by a neat back-heel from debutant striker Bjorn Johnsen. His second came from a low shot after being played in by Cowie. The thought of a hat-trick was very much in the mind of Cowie, but his manager had other ideas as he took him off to a standing ovation 10 minutes from the end. The Highlanders had their moments in the first period, but they failed to take the opportunities that came their way. Warren had a header saved by goalkeeper Jack Hamilton, while Scott Boden had two chances but fluffed his efforts. Alex Fisher replaced the latter and, within seconds, came close to pulling a goal back for Caley Thistle with an acrobatic overhead kick that Hamilton turned wide before Nicholson's double. Foran's side did pull a goal back three minutes from the end when Paterson could only flick it into his own net when trying to block Ross Draper's shot, but Hearts could have won by a greater margin. Hearts head coach Robbie Neilson: \\"When we brought Don in last January, he wasn't fit - he had a little problem with his calf muscles - but over the summer he rested and you can see the quality he has. \\"He's got a group of players he works with in training and they all buy into what he does and he definitely is leading by example. \\"I thought the performance was really good today. I said that last week, but today the performance was really good and we scored goals, which was really pleasing.\\" Inverness Caledonian Thistle manager Richie Foran: \\"I don't think it was a 5-1. We had more chances on goal today than we had in the previous three games, but you've got to put the ball in the net. \\"We had too many players underperforming as well. I've got to take a big part of the blame for that as well - I picked the team, I picked the tactics, I picked the training through the week. \\"They are top players but I'm not getting the best out of a few of them at the moment, so I'll take the blame for today. \\"I know exactly what we need and we've got two players coming in on Monday. I don't want to put their names out there until they sign on the dotted line.

In Paris, a Dinner Where Food and Jewelry Commingle “Scandinavian bling” is how the Danish jewelry designer Sophie Bille Brahe jokingly describes her new spring/summer 2017 collection, which will be presented in Paris tonight. Though she is best known for designing elegant single earrings —most notably a crescent-shaped style with a row of white diamonds — this season, for the first time, she will offer them in pairs. One such style, the “Kelly Boucle” hoops, are cast in gold and capped at each end with either Japanese Akoya pearls or diamonds. Named for the rapper Chris Kelly, one-half of the ’90s hip-hop duo Kris Kross, they can be worn back to front — just like the drop-crotch reversible pants he made famous. In true Scandi style, Sophie, who trained as a goldsmith and works exclusively with gold, has kept the “bling” tastefully light, employing only a minimal amount. To bring the collection to life, the 36-year-old designer approached her younger brother, Frederik Bille Brahe, chef and owner of the hip restaurants Caf Atelier September and Restaurant Havfruen in Copenhagen. Together, they’ve conceived the idea for an intimate, candlelit dinner for 30 people, where food and jewelry will appear side-by-side. Inspired by Sophie’s opulent new collection, Frederik, who has flown in to Paris for just 48 hours, has sourced ingredients for a decadent yet simple menu. There will be boiled eggs with caviar to start, followed by risotto lavished with gold leaf and shaved black truffle — “I bought half a kilo from Italy,” he says, his eyes lighting up. Like Sophie’s designs, each of Fredrik’s creations centers on one precious ingredient. “The whole essence of what I do is high-quality produce, cooked as it should be cooked,” he says. “There is always one hero product — it might be a beautiful tomato marinated in honey and served with herbs, but the tomato is the centerpiece.” Sophie acknowledges their shared approach: “I like a cleanness in my materials: If I use a diamond, I want it to be the purest diamond; I don’t want it to be decorative,” she says, “My brother works with produce in the same way.” For the presentation of her collection and the food, Sophie has spent weeks scouring antique stores and friends’ basements in Copenhagen for unique tableware. She’s pulled together a pastiche of porcelain, in a palette of deep rose pink and faded green, which will offset the gold jewelry displayed on cake stands in the center of the dining table. For each of the guests, Sophie has also plated antique demitasse spoons in 14-karat gold and set a freshwater pearl in the spoon’s bowl. Wildflowers and fresh fruit, spilling over platters, will complete the picture.

Please answer the following question: Information: - In elementary geometry, a polytope is a geometric object with flat sides, and may exist in any general number of dimensions \\"n\\" as an \\"n\\"-dimensional polytope or \\"n\\"-polytope. For example, a two-dimensional polygon is a 2-polytope and a three-dimensional polyhedron is a 3-polytope. - In computer science, program optimization or software optimization is the process of modifying a software system to make some aspect of it work more efficiently or use fewer resources. In general, a computer program may be optimized so that it executes more rapidly, or is capable of operating with less memory storage or other resources, or draw less power. - In computer science and particularly in compiler design, loop nest optimization (LNO) is an optimization technique that applies a set of loop transformations for the purpose of locality optimization or parallelization or other loop overhead reduction of the loop nests. One classical usage is to reduce memory access latency or the cache bandwidth necessary due to cache reuse for some common linear algebra algorithms. - The polyhedral model ( also called the polytope method ) is a mathematical framework for loop nest optimization in program optimization . The polytope method treats each loop iteration within nested loops as lattice points inside mathematical objects called polytopes , performs affine transformations or more general non-affine transformations such as tiling on the polytopes , and then converts the transformed polytopes into equivalent , but optimized ( depending on targeted optimization goal ) , loop nests through polyhedra scanning . - The Multinational Aircrew Electronic Warfare Tactics Facility Polygone - POLYGON is an Electronic Warfare Tactics Range located on the border between Germany and France. It is a tri-national facility operated by France, Germany and the United States. - In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks. - Geometry (from the ; \\"geo-\\" \\"earth\\", \\"-metron\\" \\"measurement\\") is a branch of mathematics concerned with questions of shape, size, relative position of figures, and the properties of space. A mathematician who works in the field of geometry is called a geometer. - Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems. - In elementary geometry, a polyhedron (plural polyhedra or polyhedrons) is a solid in three dimensions with flat polygonal faces, straight edges and sharp corners or vertices. The word polyhedron comes from the Classical Greek , as \\"poly-\\" (stem of , \\"many\\") + \\"-hedron\\" (form of , \\"base\\" or \\"seat\\"). - A computer program is a collection of instructions that performs a specific task when executed by a computer. A computer requires programs to function, and typically executes the program's instructions in a central processing unit. - A compiler is a computer program (or a set of programs) that transforms source code written in a programming language (the source language) into another computer language (the target language), with the latter often having a binary form known as object code. The most common reason for converting source code is to create an executable program.

Write a title: AP - Emboldened by their Election Day successes, some Christian conservatives around the country are trying to put more Christ into Christmas this season.","completion":"Title: \\"Election Day Triumphs: The Rising Influence of Christian Conservatives in Celebrating a Christ-Centric Christmas Season\\" In recent years, political dynamics have undergone a significant shift across the United States. This change has become increasingly evident as the voices and influences of various groups continue to mold the social and political landscape. One such group is Christian conservatives, who have found new inspiration and determination following their Election Day successes. As these individuals navigate the societal sphere, they are taking tangible steps to reinforce the presence of Christ in the holiday season - a time when commercialization has seemingly diluted the essence of Christmas. Election Day served as a crucial turning point for Christian conservatives as they found renewed hope and influence in their political endeavors. With the victories of several key candidates aligned with their beliefs and values, these conservatives saw their power ascend to uncharted heights. This rise in influence has led to a resurgence of interest in bringing the true meaning of Christmas – a celebration of Jesus Christ's birth – back to the forefront of the holiday season. It appears that Christian conservatives, emboldened by their Election Day accomplishments, are striving to counterbalance the oftentimes overwhelming commercialized focus of the holidays with a deeper, more spiritual emphasis on Christ. To achieve this, Christian conservatives are advocating for a variety of measures to honor and highlight the significance of Jesus in the season's festivities. These efforts include promoting and supporting nativity scenes on public property, emphasizing prayer and worship throughout the season, and encouraging people to opt for traditional religious greetings, such as \\"Merry Christmas,\\" instead of generic alternatives such as \\"Happy Holidays.\\" As part of this expanding movement, Christian conservatives are forming connections and partnerships with like-minded individuals and organizations. Their collective goal is to use their newfound political influence to advocate for policy changes and initiatives that give prominence to Christian values during this joyful and holy time of the year. They recognize the importance of Christ in Christmas and seek to ensure that his presence remains central to the season's celebrations. While these developments represent an optimistic and empowering time for Christian conservatives, their actions have also met resistance from those who favor a more secular and inclusive approach to the holidays. Advocates for the separation of church and state argue that religious expression in public spaces and government-sanctioned events can marginalize citizens who hold different beliefs, and thus runs the risk of violating the United States Constitution. As the holiday season and debate over the role of Christ in Christmas continue to unfold, it remains to be seen how the growing efforts of Christian conservatives will reshape sociopolitical discourse and impact cultural practices. Regardless of the outcome, their Election Day success has undoubtedly revived a passionate pursuit for more Christ-centered celebrations in years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Cask Marque, as mentioned in the sentence, is an organization based in the UK and is specifically focused on the beer industry. It was established in 1998, and its primary goal is to promote and improve the quality of cask ale, which is a traditional form of beer in the country. Cask ale, also known as real ale, is beer that is brewed from pure ingredients, matured through secondary fermentation in the container from which it is served, and naturally carbonated. This form of beer is often regarded as the epitome of British brewing techniques and traditions. One of the ways in which Cask Marque achieves its objectives is by setting and enforcing strict quality standards for pubs and breweries across the UK. Such standards are set to ensure that the cask ales produced and served by these establishments meet certain criteria, including taste, appearance, and temperature. The temperature standard range mentioned in the original sentence, 12°–14 °C (53°–57 °F), is an essential factor in maintaining the quality and taste of cask ale, as it can greatly impact the beer's flavor profile, aroma, and mouthfeel, as well as the overall drinking experience. Cask Marque also conducts regular audits, inspections, and certification schemes, where trained and accredited assessors visit pubs to verify if they are serving cask ales according to the set standards. Those establishments that pass the assessment process are awarded the Cask Marque accreditation, which is a recognized mark of quality assurance in the UK beer and hospitality industries. In conclusion, the sentence provided does answer the question regarding the country where Cask Marque is located, as it clearly states that the non-profit organization is based in the United Kingdom. Furthermore, it briefly mentions its role in setting a temperature standard range for cask ales, showcasing its commitment to promoting and maintaining high-quality cask ale across the country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Hotel Rwanda Movie plot: Tensions between the Hutu and Tutsi peoples lead to a civil war in Rwanda, where corruption and bribes between politicians are routine. Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle), the manager of the Sabena owned HÃ´tel des Mille Collines, is Hutu, but his wife Tatiana (Okonedo), is Tutsi. His marriage is a source of friction with Hutu extremists, most prominently Georges Rutaganda (Kae-Kazim), a friendly goods supplier to the hotel who is also the local leader of Interahamwe, a brutal Hutu militia. As the political situation in the country worsens following the assassination of the president, Paul and his family observe neighbors being killed in ethnic violence, initiating the early stages of a genocide. Paul curries favor with people of influence, bribing them with money and alcohol, seeking to maintain sufficient influence to keep his family safe. When civil war erupts and a Rwandan Army officer threatens Paul and his neighbors, Paul barely negotiates their safety, and brings them to the hotel. More evacuees arrive at the hotel from the overburdened UN refugee camp, the Red Cross, and various orphanages. Paul must divert the Hutu soldiers, care for the refugees, be a source of strength to his family, and maintain the appearance of a functioning hotel as the situation becomes more violent. The UN Peacekeeping forces, led by Canadian Colonel Oliver (Nolte), are unable to take assertive action against the Interahamwe since they are forbidden to intervene in the genocide. The foreign nationals are evacuated, but the Rwandans are left behind. When the UN forces attempt to evacuate a group of refugees, including Paul's family, they are ambushed and must turn back. In a last-ditch effort to save the refugees, Paul pleads with the Rwandan Army General, Augustin Bizimungu (Mokoena) for assistance. However, when Paul's bribes no longer work, he blackmails the General with threats of being tried as a war criminal. Soon after, the family and the hotel refugees are finally able to leave the besieged hotel in a UN convoy. They travel... My question: Tatiana belongs to which group of people? A:","completion":"Tatiana, in the movie \\"Hotel Rwanda,\\" belongs to the Tutsi group of people. This is relayed through the storyline in the film where her husband, Paul Rusesabagina, is of Hutu ethnicity, and their interethnic marriage becomes a source of tension in the escalating conflict between the Hutu and Tutsi groups. The ethnic distinction between Tatiana and her husband highlights the deeply ingrained social divisions in Rwanda during the time of the civil war and genocide, creating an important dimension in the narrative and character dynamics of the film. The film portrays Tatiana’s Tutsi ethnicity as one of the reasons that intensifies the danger facing her and her family, given that the Tutsis were primarily targeted in the genocide. This also plays a significant part in Paul's desperate efforts to protect his family and other Tutsis taking refuge in the hotel, putting a human face to a horrific historical event."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Norwegian vocalist Roy Khan joined for the album \\"Siége Perilous\\", and shared songwriting credit with Youngblood until his departure in April 2011. On June 22, 2012, Youngblood announced on their website that their new vocalist is the Swedish singer Tommy Karevik, who was first featured on Kamelot's album \\"Silverthorn\\" as main vocalist, co-songwriter and lyricist. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - West Germany is the common English name for the Federal Republic of Germany or FRG (or \\"RFA\\") in the period between its creation on 23 May 1949 to German reunification on 3 October 1990. During this Cold War era, NATO-aligned West Germany and Warsaw Pact-aligned East Germany were divided by the Inner German border. After 1961 West Berlin was physically separated from East Berlin as well as from East Germany by the Berlin Wall. This situation ended when East Germany was dissolved and its five states joined the ten states of the Federal Republic of Germany along with the reunified city-state of Berlin. With the reunification of West and East Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany, enlarged now to sixteen states, became known simply as \\"Germany\\". This period is also referred to as the Bonn Republic (\\"Bonner Republik\\") by historians, alluding to the interwar Weimar Republic and the post-reunification Berlin Republic. - The Emerald Sword Saga is a high fantasy story spread over 5 albums by the Italian symphonic power metal band Rhapsody of Fire, written by Luca Turilli. It includes many of the common themes of the genre, including a clearly defined good-versus-evil plot and the inclusion of various fantasy monsters. The hero of the story is the Ice Warrior, who sets out on a quest to find the legendary Emerald Sword, with which he can defeat the Dark Lord Akron. Each new chapter of the story is described in the booklet accompanying that CD. The narrator is the ancient wizard Aresius, who \\"has seen it all\\". - Rhapsody of Fire (formerly known as Rhapsody) is an Italian symphonic power metal band created by Luca Turilli and Alex Staropoli, widely seen as a pioneer of the symphonic power metal subgenre. - Edguy is a heavy metal band from Fulda, Germany that was formed in 1992. - After Forever was a Dutch symphonic metal band with strong progressive metal influences. The band relied on the use of both soprano vocals and death grunts. - Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, instead of the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \\"powerful\\" sound. The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards. - Alex Holzwarth was born on 4 October 1968 in Landshut, Germany and is a professional drummer, former member of Italian symphonic power metal band Rhapsody of Fire. He is the brother of bass guitarist Oliver Holzwarth. - A drummer is a musician who plays drums, which includes a drum kit (\\"drum set\\" or \\"trap set\\", including cymbals) and accessory-based hardware which includes an assortment of pedals and standing support mechanisms, marching percussion or any musical instrument that is struck within the context of a wide assortment of musical genres. The term percussionist applies to a musician who performs struck musical instruments of numerous diverse shapes, sizes and applications. Most contemporary western ensembles bands for rock, pop, jazz, R&B etc. include a drummer for purposes including timekeeping and embellishing the musical timbre. Most drummers of this particular designation work within the context of a larger contingent (a.k.a. rhythm section) that may also include, keyboard (a percussion instrument) or guitar, auxiliary percussion (often of non western origin) and bass (bass viol or electric). Said ensembles may also include melodic based mallet percussion including: vibraphone, marimba or xylophone. The rhythm section, being the core metronomic foundation with which other melodic instruments, including voices, may present the harmonic/melodic portion of the material. - Dawn of Victory is the third album studio released by Rhapsody in 2000 . Like the previous albums , it centers on the story of Algalord and The Emerald Sword Saga . It has been produced and engineered by Sascha Paeth and Miro . It is also the first album to feature current drummer Alex Holzwarth .

Article: According to a recent survey, Canadian parents realize their role as protectors and providers to raise their children both emotionally and physically. That's not very different from the way our parents saw themselves. But with more two-career families and busy schedules, one thing parents today recognize more than ever is the need to set aside special time for their children. These 'nurturing moments' are changed into memories that they will treasure all their lives. Nurturing moments might be the time between our work and life,bringing your child to work with you to see what you do during the day,visiting your child's make-believe world,discussing his other school day and exploring the natural world outside your door. These times are not merely a luxury , they're a necessity. It's during these moments that parents pass values and attitudes to their children. Over time, children pick up good habits and positive self-image. Here are a few tips for making the most of your family time together: Regularly sit down as a family to share a meal. Allow each person to describe something interesting about his or her day. Make one night a week family night. Family members take turns choosing a special activity for the evening everyone partakes in the fun. Show your children you care about their interests by having them teach you about their activity or hobby. Nurturing healthy children involves body, mind and spirit. The little things you do to your care are the building blocks for confidence, self-esteem and a healthy outlook. By giving your children these tools, you prepare them for life. Question: Present-day parents are different from those in the past mainly because _ . Options: A: they need more time to spend on their children B: they pay more attention to their children's health C: they are much busier with their work D: the role they play in bringing up children is different Answer:","completion":"C: they are much busier with their work The article discusses how Canadian parents recognize their roles as protectors and providers for their children, which is not very different from how parents in the past saw themselves. However, the main difference between present-day parents and those in the past is that modern parents are dealing with busier schedules and more two-career families. As a result, present-day parents have to make more of an effort to set aside special time for their children, known as \\"nurturing moments.\\" These moments not only help create cherished memories for both parents and children but also allow parents to pass on values, attitudes, and habits that contribute to the overall well-being of their child. The other options provided do not align with the main focus of the article: Option A - It is not that they need more time to spend on their children, but rather that they recognize the importance of setting aside special time or 'nurturing moments' due to their busier lives. Option B - The article does not specifically state that present-day parents pay more attention to their children's health compared to parents in the past. Option D - As mentioned before, the roles of present-day parents as protectors and providers are not very different from those in the past; the main difference is in the way they manage their time with their children due to busier work schedules."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the full name of the person that had to change their plans when money was withheld? The Shackleton–Rowett Expedition (1921–22) was Sir Ernest Shackleton's last Antarctic project, and the final episode in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. The venture, financed by John Quiller Rowett, is sometimes referred to as the Quest Expedition after its ship Quest, a converted Norwegian sealer. Shackleton had originally intended to go to the Arctic and explore the Beaufort Sea, but this plan was abandoned when the Canadian government withheld financial support; Shackleton thereupon switched his attention to the Antarctic. Quest, smaller than any recent Antarctic exploration vessel, soon proved inadequate for its task, and progress south was delayed by its poor sailing performance and by frequent engine problems. Before the expedition's work could properly begin, Shackleton died on board the ship, just after its arrival at the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. The major part of the subsequent attenuated expedition was a three-month cruise to the eastern Antarctic, under the leadership of the party's second-in-command, Frank Wild. The shortcomings of Quest were soon in evidence: slow speed, heavy fuel consumption, a tendency to roll in heavy seas, and a steady leak. The ship was unable to proceed further than longitude 20°E, well short of its easterly target, and its engine's low power coupled with its unsuitable bows was insufficient for it to penetrate southward through the pack ice. Following several fruitless attempts, Wild returned the ship to South Georgia, on the way visiting Elephant Island where he and 21 others had been stranded after the sinking of the ship Endurance, during Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition six years earlier.

Movie title: Untraceable Movie plot: Special Agent Jennifer Marsh (Diane Lane) is a widowed single parent living in a suburban Portland home with her daughter, Annie Haskins (Perla Haney-Jardine), and her mother, Stella Marsh (Mary Beth Hurt). At night, she works in the FBI's cybercrime division with Griffin Dowd (Colin Hanks), fighting identity theft and similar crimes. One night, an anonymous tip leads them to a website called KillWithMe.com. The site features a streaming video of a cat being tortured and killed. The website cannot be shut down, as the creator knew that someone would try and built into it a fail-safe; every time the server is closed, a mirror server immediately replaces it. After the cat's death, KillWithMe.com's webmaster graduates to human victims and makes their deaths correlate directly with the number of hits the site receives. At a press conference, the public is urged to avoid the website, but as Jennifer feared this only increases the site's popularity. The videos are recorded in the killer's basement and his victims include a helicopter pilot (bled to death by injections of anticoagulant), a newscaster (burnt to death by heat lamps while cemented into the floor), and Griffin Dowd (killed by slowly increasing the concentration of sulfuric acid solution in which he is submerged up to his neck). At first it seems the victims were randomly chosen, but this is revealed to be untrue: the first two victims were chosen because they were part of filming or presenting the suicide of a junior college teacher. The teacher's unstable techno prodigy son, Owen Reilly (Joseph Cross), broke down and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. When released, he decided to take revenge and prove a point; that the public's interest in the suffering of others is insatiable, as well as to wreak vengeance on those he felt had exploited his father's death. Griffin was killed because he came close to discovering the murderer's identity, and Jennifer is soon targeted after figuring this out as well. Captured by Owen, Jennifer escapes her death by...

The latest evidence to support this hypothesis comes from a large international epidemiological study of childhood asthma that was recently published in the medical journal The Lancet . Translate to German German:","completion":"Die neuesten Belege für diese Hypothese stammen aus einer großen internationalen epidemiologischen Studie über Asthma im Kindesalter, die kürzlich in der medizinischen Fachzeitschrift The Lancet veröffentlicht wurde. In dieser Studie wurden die Daten von mehr als einer Million Kindern aus verschiedenen Ländern und Kulturkreisen analysiert, um mögliche Zusammenhänge zwischen Umweltfaktoren, Ernährung und genetischen Faktoren und dem Auftreten von Asthma im Kindesalter zu untersuchen. Die Haupterkenntnisse der Studie sind, dass bestimmte Umweltfaktoren, wie Luftverschmutzung und Tabakrauch, das Risiko für Asthma bei Kindern signifikant erhöhen. Darüber hinaus tragen auch genetische Faktoren und eine ungesunde Ernährung, insbesondere ein Mangel an Vitaminen und Nährstoffen, zu einem erhöhten Asthmarisiko bei. Ein weiterer wichtiger Aspekt der Studie ist die Beobachtung, dass das Asthmarisiko bei Kindern in Ländern mit einem hohen Lebensstandard und hygienischen Bedingungen signifikant höher ist als in Ländern mit niedrigeren Lebensstandards. Dies deutet darauf hin, dass auch eine übermäßige Hygiene und der Mangel an Exposition gegenüber bestimmten Mikroorganismen in der Umwelt eine Rolle bei der Entstehung von Asthma spielen könnten. Diese Ergebnisse unterstützen die sogenannte Hygiene-Hypothese, die besagt, dass ein Mangel an Exposition gegenüber bestimmten Infektionen, Mikroorganismen und Parasiten in frühen Lebensjahren das Immunsystem in einer Weise beeinflusst, die das Risiko für allergische Erkrankungen wie Asthma erhöht. Die Hygiene-Hypothese wurde erstmals in den 1980er Jahren von dem britischen Epidemiologen David P. Strachan vorgeschlagen. Seitdem wurde sie weiter erforscht und durch zahlreiche Studien gestärkt. Um diesen Zusammenhang zwischen übermäßiger Hygiene und Asthma besser zu verstehen, haben Forscher auch experimentelle Studien mit Tieren durchgeführt. Beispielsweise haben einige Studien an Mäusen gezeigt, dass eine Exposition gegenüber bestimmten Bakterien oder Parasiten das Risiko für allergische Reaktionen und Asthma verringern kann. Dies könnte darauf hindeuten, dass eine gezielte Exposition gegenüber bestimmten Mikroorganismen in der frühen Kindheit das Immunsystem in einer Weise stärken könnte, die allergische Erkrankungen wie Asthma verhindert. Zukünftige Forschungen könnten sich auf die Identifizierung der genauen Mikroorganismen konzentrieren, die für eine solche \\"Immuntraining\\" am effektivsten sind, sowie auf die Entwicklung von sicheren und wirksamen Strategien, um Kinder diesen Mikroorganismen auszusetzen. Dies wäre ein wichtiger Schritt in Richtung einer effektiveren Prävention von Asthma und anderen allergischen Erkrankungen bei Kindern. Es ist zu beachten, dass diese Ergebnisse natürlich nicht bedeuten, dass Hygiene unwichtig ist. Es ist weiterhin wichtig, dass Kinder in einer sauberen Umgebung leben und grundlegende Hygienepraktiken wie Händewaschen befolgen, um das Risiko für Infektionen und Krankheiten zu reduzieren. Die Herausforderung besteht darin, das richtige Gleichgewicht zwischen Hygiene und Exposition gegenüber Umweltmikroorganismen zu finden, um ein gesundes Immunsystem und ein geringeres Risiko für allergische Erkrankungen zu gewährleisten."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: suppose the summers are very dry happens, how will it affect a SMALLER negative effect on animals. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"When summers are very dry, it will have a smaller negative effect on animals in several ways. This means that the animals are likely to suffer less as compared to a situation with severe forest fires. First, let's consider the aspect of animals having fewer places to hide. In the case of very dry summers, the vegetation would be relatively less abundant but would still provide some level of protection and hiding spots for animals compared to the situation where a forest fire has occurred. This would provide an environment where animals can still find shelter and hiding spots, albeit in smaller numbers. Therefore, the effect on animals having fewer places to hide would be lesser in dry summers. Now let's move on to the second effect that you've mentioned: predators being able to find their prey more easily. In the case of very dry summers, the overall environment may still not be as drastically affected as it would be with a forest fire. The level of disturbance caused to the natural habitats of the animals and the ability of the predators to locate their prey would be relatively less severe compared to forest fires. In the absence of fires, the situation does not change as dramatically as it would when forests are burnt and destroyed. Hence, while it may still be somewhat easy for predators to find their prey due to the drier conditions, the effect would be less compared to the case of a forest fire. Overall, the supposed perturbation of very dry summers has a lesser impact on this specific aspect of predator-prey relationships. The effect would not be as extreme as it would be in a situation where forest fires are the causing factor. Therefore, the impact on animals in terms of finding shelter, hiding spots, and predators locating their prey will be smaller during very dry summers."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Who watches Holly's video? from the following article ?

A: A:","completion":"A polarized filter, also known as a polarizer or a polarizing filter, is an optical filter that only allows light waves with a specific polarization to pass through while blocking other orientations. When unpolarized light passes through a polarized filter, it becomes partially polarized with a specific orientation, and this process generally causes a reduction in the overall intensity of the light. This reduction in intensity depends on the filter's transmission axis and the polarization composition of the incoming light waves. In order to understand how much unpolarized light a polarized filter blocks, let's first break down some essential concepts: 1. Unpolarized light: Unpolarized light consists of light waves that have oscillating electric fields randomly oriented in all planes perpendicular to the direction of travel. Common examples of unpolarized light include sunlight, light from incandescent lamps, and the ambient light in a room. 2. Polarized light: Polarized light consists of light waves that oscillate in a single plane perpendicular to the direction of travel. The process of transforming unpolarized light into polarized light is known as polarization. 3. Polarizing filter: A polarizing filter works by selectively absorbing light waves that have a specific orientation and transmitting only the light waves with the desired polarization. The filter's transmission axis determines the orientation of the light waves that are allowed to pass through. Now, let's examine how much unpolarized light is blocked by a polarized filter: For an ideal polarizing filter, the percentage of unpolarized light that is transmitted through the filter can be found using Malus's Law, which states: I = I₀ * cos²(θ) Here, I is the transmitted light intensity, I₀ is the initial light intensity, and θ is the angle between the transmission axis of the polarizing filter and the polarization orientation of the incoming light. Since we're dealing with unpolarized light, which consists of light waves with varying orientations, over a range of angles from 0° to 180°, the average value of cos²(θ) is 0.5. In practical terms, this means that when unpolarized light passes through an ideal polarizing filter, it loses approximately 50% of its initial intensity on average. However, it is essential to note that most real-world polarizing filters are not completely ideal. In practical applications, the actual amount of unpolarized light that is blocked can vary due to manufacturing imperfections and other factors, such as the properties of the filter materials and the thickness of the filter. Consequently, typical polarizers may transmit slightly more or less than 50% of the incoming unpolarized light. In conclusion, an ideal polarized filter blocks around 50% of unpolarized light on average. In real-world applications, this percentage may vary slightly depending on various factors such as the quality and design of the polarizer. Nevertheless, the primary function of a polarizing filter is to allow only light waves with a specific polarization orientation to pass through, effectively reducing the overall intensity of unpolarized light."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But because she looks exactly the same as she did inMiss Congeniality, a movie filmed back in the 20thcentury, everyone calls her \\"ageless.\\" Bullock is just one of a number of stars in their 40s and 50s who've had birthdays recently but have not gotten older, unlike the rest of us in their age group. Take Halle Berry. One website put a photo of her 20 years ago next to one of the newly 49-year-old Berry and dared us to choose which was which. \\"This Is What 49 Looks Like,\\" it said. Seriously, if that's what 49 looks like, I must be 71. However, even a generation ago, famous faces evolved. Look at a picture of Grace Kelly at age 52 in the early 1980s. She looks like a beautiful middle-aged woman. Today she'd look old for her age. The goal now is to prevent aging while you are still young, using all the magical nonsurgical options medicine has to offer. Eventually these techniques will become less expensive, and ordinary people my daughter's age will have them. Already anti-aging is starting to be considered maintenance, like coloring your hair. My friends and I find ourselves openly debating techniques that we used to make fun of. Does fat-freezing work? How much time do you have to spend in the gym to keep the body of a 35-year-old after 50? It's all so exhausting. But members of the next generation have it tougher. They'll have to ask themselves whether they want to spend their youth trying not to get old. I've already seen \\"Sexy at 70\\" headlines. Will everyone be expected to go to their graves looking hot? I also have to wonder what else we are slowing along with age. How do you move on if you're working so hard to stay the same?
