You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If you build a campfire, you start with a large stack of sticks and logs. As the fire burns, the stack slowly shrinks. By the end of the evening, all that is left is a small pile of ashes. What happened to the matter that you started with? Was it destroyed by the flames? It may seem that way. What do you think happened? The truth is that the same amount of matter still exists. The wood changed not only to ashes, but also to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. The gases floated off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Although matter was changed, it was not created or destroyed. Because the same amount of matter still exists, we can say that matter is conserved. You may wonder how it can be conserved if something is now missing? Assume you had measured the mass of the wood before you burned it. Assume you had also trapped the gases released by the burning wood and measured their mass and the mass of the ashes. What would you find? The ashes and gases combined have the same mass as the wood you started with. This example illustrates the law of conservation of mass. Do you have any questions?","completion":"The Law of Conservation of Mass, also known as the principle of mass or matter conservation, states that the mass of an isolated system must remain constant over time. This principle is applicable in a wide range of physical and chemical processes, including chemical reactions, phase transformations, and radioactive decay, among others. Understanding the concept of conservation of mass may raise several questions, such as: 1. How does the law of conservation of mass apply to chemical reactions? In a chemical reaction, the mass of the reactants (substances that participate in the reaction) must be equal to the mass of the products (substances produced in the reaction). The total number of atoms for each element in the reactants must be the same as in the products, ensuring the conservation of mass. 2. Can conservation of mass be violated in any scenario? In classical mechanics and non-relativistic physics, the conservation of mass is generally respected in all interactions. However, in nuclear reactions and cases involving high-energy physics, mass can be converted into energy according to Einstein's famous equation, E=mc². In these cases, mass is still conserved from the standpoint of the total mass-energy, but the amount of mass may change as it's converted to energy. 3. How is the law of conservation of mass linked to the concept of \\"closed\\" and \\"open\\" systems? A closed system is a system that doesn't exchange matter with its surroundings, while an open system can exchange both energy and matter. The law of conservation of mass is strictly applicable to closed systems, where the mass remains constant since no external matter influences the system. In open systems, the mass can change due to the exchange of matter with the surroundings. 4. How do scientists apply the law of conservation of mass in their research? The law of conservation of mass is an essential principle in chemistry, physics, and engineering. It allows scientists to balance chemical equations accurately and predict the products of chemical reactions. Furthermore, it influences research in areas such as thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and even planetary science, where the study of mass transport and elemental cycles is crucial. 5. How does the law of conservation of mass help in understanding environmental processes? Understanding and applying the law of conservation of mass is essential in various environmental processes, such as the carbon cycle, water cycle, and nutrient cycles. The conservation of mass helps in the analysis of pollutant transport, waste management, and the biogeochemical transformations of elements in the environment, providing a solid foundation for environmental science studies. The law of conservation of mass plays an indispensable role in several scientific fields. Being aware of this principle allows us to comprehend the underlying mechanisms and processes that govern our natural world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Jane Alexander Answer:","completion":"Title: The Art of Revival Genre: Drama, Mystery, Art Plot: Jane Alexander stars as Addy, a once-prolific and revered artist who has been in self-imposed exile for the past decade. The death of her husband and muse left Addy struggling with her creativity and mental health, ultimately forcing her to retreat from the public eye to her quiet lakeside retreat. Addy has become a recluse, shutting out everyone, including her adult daughter, Lily (played by Emma Thompson), who is a curator at a prestigious art museum. As the tenth anniversary of her husband's death approaches, a series of mysterious letters start arriving in Addy's remote haven. Each letter contains an enigmatic message and an art piece that seems to have been painted by Addy herself. She becomes increasingly paranoid, unable to recall creating these works of art, and questions whether it's her own mind playing tricks on her or if someone is manipulating her from the shadows. The growing series of letters draws attention from Michael (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt), an ambitious art critic with a nosy investigative streak. He becomes obsessed with solving the mystery of the letters and reigniting Addy's lost career. Intrigued by Michael's persistence, she reluctantly lets him into her life and agrees to help him discover the source of the seemingly haunted artworks. As Addy involves herself in the case, she becomes inspired once more, beings to create new pieces, and slowly opens up to the world. While Lily takes notice of her mother's renewed vigor, she remains skeptical of Michael's intentions. The trio forms an uneasy alliance, working together to unravel the enigma. As threads of the truth start unraveling, the real motives behind the mysterious letters are revealed. It turns out that they were orchestrated by Addy's estranged sister, Evelyn (played by Meryl Streep), who was always jealous of Addy's artistic success. As a cathartic release, Evelyn started imitating her sister's works, but with twisted and haunted undertones. Ultimately, Evelyn was also an artistic genius who had given up her dreams for Addy and never achieved the same level of acclaim. In the climax of the film, Addy confronts Evelyn in a tense family reunion. The sisters have a heated exchange of suppressed emotions, resulting in the airing of long-held bitterness, envy, and regrets. Through this painful confrontation, Addy finds closure and the courage to face her past, resume her creative journey, and reconcile with Lily. After accepting her sister's involvement in the mysterious incidents, Addy returns to the art world and organizes a joint exhibition with Evelyn to celebrate their mutual talents. Although their relationship remains complicated, the siblings start the path towards healing and forgiveness. The final scene shows the opening night of the exhibition, where the sisters standing side-by-side, signifying their newfound appreciation for each other. The Art of Revival is a captivating tale of artistry, family, and redemption that showcases the exceptional acting talent of Jane Alexander as Addy, alongside a star-studded cast."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to German","completion":"Wenn Sie gesetzlich den 9. Ball einlochen, erhalten Sie einen neuen Rahmen mit weiteren Bällen, die Sie einlochen müssen. The translation has detailed explanation: - 'ganz legal' represents the term 'legally'. It refers to actions which are allowed based on the laws of a game, the rules, or more generally, a legislature. - 'den 9. Ball': This is a direct translation of 'the 9 ball'. In this case, '9. Ball' is preceded by the definite article 'den' because in German grammar, ball (or 'Ball' in German) is masculine and in this case it's in the accusative case. - 'Sie erhalten einen neuen Rahmen' this translates to 'you'll receive a new rack'. 'Erhalten' is German for 'receive' and 'Rahmen' for 'rack'. 'Rahmen' in this context is a set of balls arranged in a particular formation (generally in triangular shape) at the beginning of the game. - The term 'mit weiteren Bällen, die Sie einlochen müssen' translates to 'with more balls to pocket'. 'Weiteren Bällen' means 'more balls' while 'die Sie einlochen müssen' literally means 'which you have to pocket'.

Image copyright AFP/Getty Images A video apparently released by the Islamic State group shows 25 men being shot dead in the ancient city of Palmyra, in Syria. IS said the men were soldiers captured in the city of Homs. They were shot dead inside Palmyra's amphitheatre. Stills from the video showed the killers to be young males, possibly even as young as 13 or 14. IS captured Palmyra and the neighbouring modern city, locally known as Tadmur, in late May. The video was distributed by accounts known to be linked with Islamic State militants. It is not clear when it was filmed. The killings took place on a stage in the amphitheatre in front of a large black IS flag. Several hundred men in civilian clothes are filmed sitting on steps watching the shootings. Among them was a young boy. In close-up shots of the men waiting to be killed, they appear to have been beaten on the face. Days after IS claimed Palmyra, it executed 20 men in the same amphitheatre. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says shootings took place in the amphitheatre on 27 May, but it is not clear if those killings are the ones in the video. The video goes on to show the destruction of Tadmur prison, which occurred in late May. In May, Mamoun Abdelkarim, Syria's head of antiquities, said: \\"Using the Roman theatre to execute people proves that these people are against humanity.\\" Mr Abdulkarim said most of the museum's antiquities had been transferred to Damascus before IS approached the city. Since then, there have been reports that mines have been planted among some of Palmyra's ruins, and there were claims this week that militants destroyed an ancient sculpture outside Palmyra's museum. Since capturing the city, IS has also taken control of a military airbase and a notorious prison nearby. The ancient ruins are situated in a strategically important area on the road between the capital, Damascus, and the contested eastern city of Deir al-Zour. Fighters with IS started claiming vast swathes of Syria and Iraq in 2014, aided in part by the insecurity generated by Syria's civil war. More than 230,000 Syrians have died in the war, which began after President Bashar al-Assad's forces tried to put down anti-government protests in March 2011. ||||| The Islamic State militant group released a video on Saturday claiming to show the mass execution of Syrian government soldiers in the historic amphitheater of Syria's Palmyra. The video shows 25 men lined up on the stage of the ancient theater in front of the extremist group's flag.

The 10-minute video was released by the group's local branch in the Syrian province of Homs, according to the SITE intelligence group. Screenshot of the militant video. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights first reported that the Islamic State group had publicly executed a group of men in Palmyra's amphitheater in late May, shortly after the militants captured the area from government forces.

The video released Saturday also purports to show militants blowing up a notoriously hellish prison compound in the city. The Observatory first reported in late May that the group had blown up the prison as part of its propaganda campaign. The group has also used its control over ancient treasures in Syria and Iraq to push its propaganda messages to an international audience.

Following the Mamluk victory over the Mongols in 1260 at the Battle of Ain Jalut by Qutuz and his general Baibars, Qutuz was assassinated, leaving Baibars to claim the sultanate for himself. As Sultan, Baibars proceeded to attack the Christian crusaders at Arsuf, Athlith, Haifa, Safad, Jaffa, Ascalon, and Caesarea. As the Crusader fortress cities fell one by one, the Christians sought help from Europe, but assistance was slow in coming. In 1268 Baibars captured Antioch, thereby destroying the last remnant of the Principality of Antioch, securing the Mamluk northern front and threatening the small Crusader County of Tripoli.

Answer:","completion":"Assuming the context given, the next steps Robin might want to take are likely driven by her desire to spend time with her dying parents. After arriving home, she would probably want to visit her parents as soon as possible. Depending on their health condition, she may want to stay with them, supporting them and providing comfort in any way she can. The psychological impact of such a situation can be severe, so she might also consider seeking emotional support from family members, friends, or professional counsellors. She will also possibly want to discuss relevant matters with her parents, potentially including end-of-life care, their wishes for funeral arrangements, or any legal affairs such as wills or estates. She might also want to take some time for herself to process her emotions, and to relax and reflect, perhaps practicing self-care and mental wellness techniques, as dealing with the impending loss of a parent can be deeply distressing. Remember, everybody copes with impending grief in their own ways, and this would just be a general extrapolation based on the given context. What Robin chooses to do next would depend largely on her personality, relationship with her parents, and her emotional resilience and coping mechanisms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The film opens with young Radha sitting in a mustard field with her parents. Her mother tells her a story of a person who wanted to see the ocean; then she explains that sometimes one must learn to see some things (through her mind's eye) without looking. The film flashes forward to Sita, a newly married young woman, trying to perceive some emotion from her husband Jatin. Jatin appears distant and shows little interest in Sita or in being married. Sita is given a perfunctory welcome by Jatin's family. Jatin is in a typical joint family arrangement. He lives with his older brother Ashok, his sister-in-law Radha, his invalid mother (Biji) and the family servant Mundu. Their apartment is on the second floor of a two story dwelling in a crowded marketplace in New Delhi. Ashok and Jatin run a small store (on the first floor) that sells food (for takeout) and rents videotapes. Sita is gradually exposed to various difficulties. She is also in a typical arranged marriage, but she learns that Jatin married her only to put an end to Ashok's incessant nagging. Jatin continues to date his Chinese girlfriend. Sita does not rebuke him for fear that it may bring dishonour to her parents. The rest of Jatin's home is not rosy either. Biji is paralysed and without speech after a stroke, and Sita and Radha must constantly attend to Biji (even her hygiene). Sita spends her days slaving in the hot and greasy kitchen, and she finds herself lonely and frustrated at night because Jatin is out dallying with his girlfriend. On the financial front, the store provides a modest income but their expenses are very high and they are unable to expand their business or buy a bigger home. Sita resignedly accepts these difficulties, but yearns to break out of this stifling and hopeless situation. It is later revealed that Radha faces a somewhat similar problem. Many years ago, Ashok had come under the influence of Swamiji, a local preacher, who teaches that desires are the cause of suffering and must be suppressed. Ashok is completely taken by...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: taylor was annoying so she got her friends in trouble. Given the question \\"What will Others want to do next?\\", is \\"blame taylor\\" a valid answer? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, \\"blame Taylor\\" is a valid answer considering the situation described. When someone intentionally gets others into trouble, it is natural for the affected parties to seek accountability for the person responsible for causing the negative situation. In this case, Taylor has caused her friends to get into trouble by being annoying. Consequently, her friends may feel betrayed, frustrated, or even angered by her actions and would understandably want to place the blame on Taylor for the issues they are now facing. However, it is also important to consider the various factors that may influence the response of Taylor's friends. Not everyone may react the same way and some may be more forgiving than others. Friendships often involve understanding and compromise, so while some friends may immediately want to blame Taylor, others might seek a more calm and constructive approach to address the issue. Moreover, it's crucial to remember that always blaming someone can worsen relationships and impede healthy communication. In the long run, an open conversation and understanding, where everyone gets a chance to express their feelings and come to a resolution, can help foster more positive results than simply putting the blame on someone. In summary, while \\"blame Taylor\\" is certainly a valid answer in this situation, it may not necessarily be the most constructive or comprehensive response. To fully understand what Taylor's friends might want to do next, one should consider individual reactions, differences in levels of forgiveness, and the overall impact of blame on relationships, as well as the importance of communication and understanding in resolving conflicts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The move comes two days before world powers are due to discuss the prospect of a political transition in the conflict-torn country. International... ||||| BEIRUT/ISKENDERUN, Turkey Rebel forces attacked Syria's main court in central Damascus on Thursday, state television said, while Turkey deployed troops and anti-aircraft rocket launchers to the Syrian border, building pressure on President Bashar al-Assad. A loud explosion echoed through the streets and a column of black smoke rose over Damascus, an Assad stronghold that until the last few days had seemed largely beyond the reach of rebels. State television described it as a \\"terrorist\\" blast. Dozens of wrecked and burning cars were strewn over a car park used by lawyers and judges. The state news agency SANA said three people had been wounded by a bomb hidden in one of the cars. The fighting coincided with a Turkish military buildup on its border with Syria and a growing sense of urgency in Western- and Arab-backed diplomatic efforts to promote the idea of a unity government to end 16 months of bloodshed. But Assad himself dismissed the idea of any outside solution to Syria's crisis. \\"We will not accept any non-Syrian, non-national model, whether it comes from big countries or friendly countries. No one knows how to solve Syria's problems as well as we do,\\" Assad told the state television channel of Syria's ally Iran. He said Turkey's official stance belied the Turkish people's \\"positive view\\" of Syria. A first substantial convoy of about 30 Turkish military vehicles, including trucks loaded with anti-aircraft missile batteries dispatched from the coastal town of Iskenderun, headed towards the Syrian border 50 km (30 miles) away. A Turkish official who declined to be named said he did not know how many troops or vehicles were being moved but they were being stationed in the Yayladagi, Altinozu and Reyhanli border areas. A general in the rebel Free Syria Army said on Friday that Syrian government forces had amassed around 170 tanks north of the city Aleppo, near the Turkish border, but there was no independent confirmation of the report. General Mustafa al-Sheikh, head of the Higher Military Council, an association of senior officers who defected from Assad's forces, said the tanks had assembled at the Infantry School near the village of Musalmieh northeast of the city of Aleppo, 30 kms (19 miles) from the Turkish border. \\"The tanks are now at the Infantry School. They're either preparing to move to the border to counter the Turkish deployment or attack the rebellious (Syrian) towns and villages in and around the border zone north of Aleppo,\\" Sheikh told Reuters by telephone from the border. Last Friday Syria shot down a Turkish warplane over the Mediterranean. Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan responded by ordering his troops to treat any Syrian military element approaching the border as a military target. This could cover Syrian forces pursuing rebels towards the border, or patrolling helicopters or warplanes. Syria said at the weekend that it had killed several \\"terrorists\\" infiltrating from Turkey. TURKISH CONVOYS A Reuters reporter near the town of Antakya saw the Turkish convoy moving out of the hills and through small towns on a narrow highway escorted by police. Another convoy left a base at Gaziantep and headed for Kilis province, the site of a large camp for Syrian refugees. Video from the DHA agency showed the group of about 12 trucks and transporters filing through the gates of the base. David Hartwell, Middle East analyst at IHS Jane's, called the Turkish action a pragmatic response to the downing of the Turkish aircraft, which Syria says was flying low and fast in Syrian airspace. \\"Damascus has been warned once. I doubt there will be a second warning.\\" Turkey, in the front line of Western efforts to press Assad to step down, hosts 33,000 Syrian refugees near its southern border as well as units of the rebel Free Syrian Army (FSA). Members of the FSA, talking close to the border, told Reuters they did not believe the Turkish deployments were on a large scale or aimed at any crossborder intervention. \\"The Turks know that any large-scale military action would need international support,\\" said a senior FSA commander who spoke on condition of anonymity. Turkey has in the past spoken of opening a humanitarian corridor on Syrian soil if the refugee flow grew unmanageable or if the violence and killing became intolerable. Wary of igniting a regional sectarian war, it insists this would be possible only with U.N. backing. Western- and Arab-backed efforts to forge a joint diplomatic approach with Russia have so far failed. Thursday's attack in Damascus follows weeks of growing FSA pressure. Rebels stormed a pro-Assad television channel on Wednesday, and have also targeted police and security barracks. Syria denies there has been a mass popular uprising against Assad and says that the rebels who have now largely taken over from months of unarmed anti-government protests are foreign-backed Islamist terrorists, including members of al Qaeda. Assad told Iranian television that his government had a duty to eliminate these to protect its people, and that Washington was content for al Qaeda to attack countries it did not like. \\"When you eliminate a terrorist, it's possible that you are saving the lives of tens, hundreds, or even thousands,\\" he said. NEW ANNAN PLAN Diplomats at the United Nations say international mediator Kofi Annan will seek backing from the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and key Middle East players on Saturday for a plan for a political transition in Syria. They say the proposal does not stipulate that Assad must step down but does call for a unity government that would exclude figures who jeopardize stability - a condition that many not be enough to convince opposition groups to participate. \\"The proposal is still murky to us but I can tell you that if it does not clearly state that Assad must step down, it will be unacceptable to us,\\" said Samir Nashar, an executive member of the international Syrian National Council. Rebel fighters said there was no part of the plan they could accept, and that they had lost patience with Annan's efforts. \\"This is just a new labyrinth. It is new silliness for us to get lost in, and haggle over who can participate and who can't,\\" said Ahmed, an FSA fighter in Homs, epicenter of the revolt against four decades of Assad family rule in which more than 10,000 people have been killed, by a U.N. count. An FSA member in Damascus added: \\"The FSA is doing its work, and it is not looking to the outside world. We don't want a transitional government unless it is the one formed by rebel military councils. The world is conspiring against the Syrian revolution.\\" (Additional reporting by Jonathon Burch and Jon Hemming in Ankara, Marcus George, Yeganeh Torbati and Zahra Hosseinian in Dubai; Writing by Ralph Boulton; Editing by Janet McBride, Kevin Liffey and Michael Roddy) ||||| Joint Special Envoy of the United Nations and the Arab League for Syria Kofi Annan (R) gestures next to Major-General Robert Mood, head of the UN Supervision Mission in Syria during a news conference at the United Nations European headquarters in Geneva June 22, 2012. UNITED NATIONS Russia and other big powers have told mediator Kofi Annan that they support his idea of a Syrian national unity cabinet that could include government and opposition members but would exclude those whose participation would undermine it, envoys said on Wednesday. Annan's proposal for a political transition aimed at ending the 16-month conflict in Syria is one of the main topics that Russia, the other four permanent Security Council members and key players in the Middle East will discuss at a meeting in Geneva on Saturday, diplomats told Reuters on condition of anonymity. One diplomat summarized Annan's proposal, saying the Syria conflict can only end when all sides see a peaceful way to a shared future.\\" Annan made clear it was \\"vital that (any) settlement (be) irreversible, (with) clear transition steps in fixed timeline,\\" he said. \\"These include establishing a transitional national unity government to create a neutral backdrop for transition,\\" the diplomat said in his summary of Annan's plan. \\"It could comprise present government members, opposition and others, but would need to exclude those whose continued participation or presence would jeopardize the transition's credibility, or harm prospects for reconciliation and stability.\\" The diplomat added that the idea of excluding certain people was clearly referring to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, though Annan's proposal does not explicitly say Assad could not serve in a national unity government. That gives Russia the option of insisting that Assad be allowed to stay in power. \\"The Russians signaled to Annan that they accept his transition plan,\\" he said. Several Western diplomats confirmed his remarks, adding that all five permanent veto-wielding U.N. Security Council members backed it. Another diplomat said Russia's acceptance of Annan's proposal, which he circulated to the five permanent Security Council members this week, did not mean it has abandoned Assad. \\"I'm very skeptical,\\" he said. \\"I don't see the Russians giving up on Assad.\\" The Russian mission at the United Nations was not available for comment. SHIFT IN RUSSIA'S STANCE? Annan made acceptance of his guidelines for a political transition for Syria a condition for organizing Saturday's meeting, which will include the United States, Britain, France, Russia, China, Turkey, Iraq, Kuwait and Qatar. It will not include Iran or Saudi Arabia. Russia has repeatedly said its supports Annan's idea of creating a \\"contact group\\" of powerful nations and regional players with influence on the Syrian government or the opposition to push for an end to the violence in Syria. Several diplomats said Russia's acceptance of Annan's proposal appeared to signal a shift in its stance on Syria. But it was not immediately clear if Moscow's support for the idea of a national unity government in principle meant that it was now abandoning Assad, a staunch ally and key Russian arms purchaser. The United States, Britain and France have said that Assad is responsible for the violence, which the United Nations estimates has killed at least 10,000 people, is no longer fit to govern. Russia and China, however, reject what they describe as Western calls for \\"regime change.\\" Russia has repeatedly said it is not insisting that Assad must remain in power at all costs, but that any decision on whether or not he should step down should come from the Syrian people, not from outside pressure or military intervention, as happened last year in Libya. Saturday's meeting, which Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will attend, will have to agree on the details of the political transition and the mechanisms for implementing it, diplomats said. Annan, a former U.N. secretary-general, also wants Saturday's meeting to revive his moribund six-point peace plan that has failed to end the fighting between Assad's forces and an increasingly militarized opposition. The conflict has escalated in recent weeks. Annan said the aim of the one-day talks was to identify measures to secure full implementation of his stalled peace plan and Security Council resolutions, including an immediate halt to all violence.

(Associated Press) Russia on Thursday said it would not endorse a call for Syrian President Bashar Assad to give up power and criticized as inappropriate claims that it had agreed to plans by international envoy Kofi Annan for a new national unity government in Syria that could include the opposition. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov insisted that major powers meeting Saturday in Geneva for talks on Syria must concentrate on convincing opposition groups to soften their demands. He also denied a claim by a senior U.S. official that international envoy Kofi Annan said Russia was among the backers of a plan for a new government to oversee the drafting of a new constitution and eventual elections. \\"We are not supporting and will not support any external meddling,\\" he said. \\"External players must not dictate ... to Syrians, but, first of all, must commit to influencing all the sides in Syria to stop the violence.\\" Diplomatic hopes have rested on Russia _ Syria's most important ally, protector and supplier of arms _ to agree to a plan that would end the Assad family dynasty, which has ruled Syria for more than four decades. But the country_ one of the five permanent U.N. Security Council members along with Britain, China, France and the U.S. _ has warned it would firmly oppose any document urging Assad to step down. Moscow also has rejected efforts by outside forces to end the country's bloody conflict or any plan to force regime change in Damascus, insisting that any plans for the future rest entirely with Syria. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, speaking at a press conference in Riga, Latvia, during a European tour that will take her to Russia, said Thursday that \\"it was very clear from the invitations that were extended ... that people were coming on the basis of the transition plan that (Annan) had presented.\\" \\"I will discuss these issues with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in St. Petersburg tomorrow and then I look forward to participating in a meeting organized by Joint Special Envoy Annan in Geneva on Saturday,\\" she said. \\"We want this meeting in Geneva... to provide an opportunity to make real progress in supporting and implementing (Annan's) six-point plan and the roadmap for transition that he has laid down,\\" she said. It was not clear if Moscow has rejected Annan's plan altogether or has simply not agreed to its final form yet. \\"First of all, no agreed-upon projects exist, the work on the possible final document is going on, including a meeting of experts in Geneva,\\" Lavrov told reporters. \\"I think that the fact that certain formulas, certain ideas proposed for the possible final document by certain countries are leaked to the media manifests an improper approach to diplomacy.\\" Lavrov said that diplomatic efforts should focus on urging the opposition groups to \\"refuse from their uncompromising approaches and, in accordance with the Kofi Annan plan, sit down for negotiations with the government.\\" Lavrov also criticized the exclusion of major regional player Iran from Saturday's high-level meeting. \\"Iran is undoubtedly a powerful player in the whole situation,\\" Lavrov said. \\"Leaving it out of the loop of the Geneva meeting is a mistake.\\" A senior U.S. diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss diplomatic negotiations, had said Annan assured the United States that world powers gathering in Geneva had endorsed the plan and that Russia was among its backers. Also Thursday, a Russian defense official reportedly said that three Syrian attack helicopters that have been refurbished in Russia will be sent to Syria. Last week, a cargo ship carrying the helicopters to Syria was forced to turn back after its British insurer removed the coverage for the vessel. Alexander Fomin, the Russian defense official, was quoted by the Ria Novosti news agency as saying that Russia plans to deliver the helicopters, without specifying how or when. \\"Syria is our friend,\\" he was quoted as saying. \\"And we fulfill all obligations we make to our friends.\\" Russia has said that the helicopters had been supplied to Syria during Soviet times and refurbished under a 2008 contract. Russia has been a key source of weapons for Syria in the past four decades, and Damascus has acquired billions of dollars' worth of combat jets, helicopters, missiles, armored vehicles and other military gear from Moscow. Moscow has continued to provide Damascus with arms, despite Western calls for a halt in supplies. In recent weeks, Syria started using its helicopter gunships to besiege opposition areas _ something it had appeared reluctant to do before. ____ Associated Press writer Matthew Lee contributed to this report. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Russia has refused to endorse a call for Syrian President Bashar Assad to step down, claiming it would not support any external interference.

Title: Great pans at a bargin price Review: We just renovated the kitchen so I purchased some new pans. I saw these Cuisiant Pans and was amazed by the price. I figured I could try them and if I did not like them then I was not out a huge sume of money. This set includes the basics. They are a good weight and have the nice rivets in the handles which by the way really do stay cool to the touch. These pans are also very easy to clean. Just add some warm soapy water and you are ready to clean after the meal is over. I love this set so much that I bought all of the matching pans so I could have all the sizes that I needed. I also bought the nonstick pan for the eggs and it is great too. This is a steal for the price. I look forward to more products like this. Thanks AMAZON!

Be aware that popping a whitehead with a sewing needle is not recommended by dermatologists or members of the medical community, so this is something to try at your own risk. If you want to do this, then use a regular needle from a typical sewing kit. It'll be sharp enough to get the job done and minimize the risk of scarring. Soak the tip of the needle in rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide for one minute. You can also hold the tip of the needle over the flame from a match or lighter before dipping it into the rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide. Insert the needle at an angle. If you poke the needle in a vertical downward motion, you could hit live skin under the pus. Remove the needle as soon as you see pus oozing from the whitehead. If you see clear liquid or blood instead of pus, stop. Squeezing a whitehead that isn't ready to be popped can cause it to swell and stick around even longer. Place each of your index fingers at the base of the white area. Squeeze in a down-and-in motion. Be gentle to avoid damaging healthy skin. Gently wipe away the pus with the tissue on your finger.

Background: George Michael Cohan (July 3, 1878 - November 5, 1942), known professionally as George M. Cohan, was an American entertainer, playwright, composer, lyricist, actor, singer, dancer and producer. Cohan began his career as a child, performing with his parents and sister in a vaudeville act known as \\"The Four Cohans.\\" Beginning with Little Johnny Jones in 1904, he wrote, composed, produced, and appeared in more than three dozen Broadway musicals. Cohan published more than 300 songs during his lifetime, including the standards \\"Over There\\", \\"Give My Regards to Broadway\\", \\"The Yankee Doodle Boy\\" and \\"You're a Grand Old Flag\\". Context: From 1899 to 1907, Cohan was married to Ethel Levey (1881-1955; born Grace Ethelia Fowler), a musical comedy actress and dancer. Levey and Cohan had a daughter, actress Georgette Cohan Souther Rowse (1900-1988). Levey joined the Four Cohans when Josie married, and she starred in Little Johnny Jones and other Cohan works. In 1907, Levey divorced Cohan on grounds of adultery. In 1908, Cohan married Agnes Mary Nolan (1883-1972), who had been a dancer in his early shows; they remained married until his death. They had two daughters and a son. The eldest was Mary Cohan Ronkin, a cabaret singer in the 1930s, who composed incidental music for her father's play The Tavern. In 1968, Mary supervised musical and lyric revisions for the musical George M!. Their second daughter was Helen Cohan Carola, a film actress, who performed on Broadway with her father in Friendship in 1931. Their youngest child was George Michael Cohan, Jr. (1914-2000), who graduated from Georgetown University and served in the entertainment corps during World War II. In the 1950s, George Jr. reinterpreted his father's songs on recordings, in a nightclub act, and in television appearances on the Ed Sullivan and Milton Berle shows. George Jr.'s only child, Michaela Marie Cohan (1943-1999), was the last descendant named Cohan. She graduated with a theater degree from Marywood College, Scranton, Pennsylvania, in 1965. From 1966 to 1968, she served in a civilian Special Services unit in Vietnam and Korea. In 1996, she stood in for her ailing father at the ceremony marking her grandfather's induction into the Musical Theatre Hall of Fame at New York University. Cohan was a devoted baseball fan, regularly attending games of the former New York Giants. He died of cancer at the age of 64 on November 5, 1942, at his Manhattan apartment on Fifth Avenue, surrounded by family and friends. He received his last rites from Mgr. John J. Casey, representing Archbishop Francis Spellman, and Rev. Francis X. Shea, vicar of the Archdiocese of New York. His funeral was held at St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York and was attended by thousands of people, including five governors of New York, two mayors of New York City and the Postmaster General. The honorary pallbearers included Irving Berlin, Eddie Cantor, Frank Crowninshield, Sol Bloom, Brooks Atkinson, Rube Goldberg, Walter Huston, George Jessel, Connie Mack, Joseph McCarthy, Eugene O'Neill, Sigmund Romberg, Lee Shubert and Fred Waring. Cohan was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City, in a private family mausoleum he had erected a quarter century earlier for his sister and parents. Question: Was that his only marriage? Answer:","completion":"No, George M. Cohan was married twice. His first marriage was to Ethel Levey from 1899 to 1907. They divorced on grounds of adultery. In 1908, Cohan married Agnes Mary Nolan, and they remained married until his death in 1942."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Karageorge, 22, was found dead Sunday, four days after he was last seen, in a dumpster a block from his home just south of Ohio State's campus. Police said he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, though a final analysis was pending. \\"We knew he had a lot of concussions. But you never knew he was depressed or anything like that,\\" Bennett said on a conference call with reporters to preview Saturday's Big Ten Championship against Wisconsin. \\"I think he was one of the most positive out of everybody, which goes to show you can't tell when something sneaks up. There's just no way to notice it. \\"Kosta was always positive, always thankful, so appreciative of everything football gave him and that everybody in his life gave him. \\"We knew he had a lot of concussions and we were worried about that. But we didn't see any side effects of it.\\" Asked if Karageorge's concussions were previously from his three years as an Ohio State wrestler or from his first year as a walkon football player on the scout team, helping the starters prepare for games each week, Bennett said, \\"Both.\\" \\"He never reported them,\\" Bennett said. \\"Kosta, I've said it before, I think he was the toughest guy I ever met. He must have been dealing with a lot of stuff internally. He was so appreciative of everything and so hard working, when he got one during practice, or something like that, he wouldn't tell anybody. \\"We would tell him to take it easy, if you want to sit out nobody is going to judge you, anything like that, because those are serious. But his mentality was always never quit, never back down from a challenge. \\"Concussions are one of those things, it's not a challenge, it's bigger than that.\\" Ohio State announced before coach Urban Meyer's news conference on Monday that issues regarding Karageorge's medical history would not be addressed. \\"I can say this, this is the best group of medical people I've ever been around, the way they handle their business and the attention to detail,\\" Meyer said, when asked. Karageorge's family said he wrote a text message to them just before he was last seen early Wednesday that he apologized if he embarrassed them but his concussions had been affecting him. His sister, Sophia, told the New York Times that her brother had at least four or five concussions in his life. Ohio State football released a statement from team doctor Jim Borchers on Friday while Kostageorge was still missing. \\"While we are not able to discuss or comment about the medical care regarding our student-athletes,\\" Borchers said, \\"we are confident in our medical procedures and policies to return athletes to participation following injury or illness.\\" ||||| Play Facebook Twitter Embed OSU Coach on Player's Death: 'It's Difficult' 1:14 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog An Ohio coroner on Monday ordered a special examination to look for signs of traumatic brain injury in the Ohio State football player who apparently shot himself to death. The body of the player, Kosta Karageorge, was found in a trash bin on Sunday. His mother, Susan, told police that her son had suffered several concussions and had bouts of extreme confusion. She said he sent her a text message four days before his body was found, saying that concussions had messed up his head. “I am sorry if I am an embarrassment,” the text said. The coroner, Dr. Anahi Ortiz of Franklin County, told NBC News that the special examination, in which a pathologist will examine slides from the player’s brain, was not routine but has been conducted in other cases. In this case, she said, it was because of Karageorge’s reported history of concussions and because he played football and wrestled. Earlier on Monday, Ohio State football coach Urban Meyer said he had been told not to talk about Karageorge’s medical history. A team doctor has also said he cannot comment on the medical care of athletes. The Ohio State wrestling coach told The Columbus Dispatch that Karageorge, who wrestled for the Buckeyes for three years, had no documented concussions. Meyer called the apparent suicide an \\"incredible tragedy.\\" \\"We’ll never get over it,\\" he said. Karageorge was a walk-on and was recognized Saturday on Senior Day as the Buckeyes beat archrival Michigan. Ohio State plays for the Big Ten championship this weekend. “To overcome the incredible tragedy that happened last night this is a real challenge,” Meyer said. A growing body of research shows that repeated concussions can cause permanent brain damage, and organized football has come under criticism for ignoring the danger for too long. A federal judge has given preliminary approval to a settlement under which the NFL would pay thousands of former players for concussion claims. She did so only after the NFL agreed to remove a 675 million cap on damages. In college sports, the NCAA has proposed spending 70 million on a program that would monitor athletes for brain trauma. And The Associated Press reported over the weekend that a former high school quarterback in Illinois is suing a state governing body for not doing enough to protect him from concussions. The organization says reducing concussion risk is a priority. Ohio State students said Monday they were saddened by the death. “It’s really disheartening to see that someone at, you know, one of the happiest and best universities in the country felt like that, and then didn’t realize or didn’t want to take advantage of the resources that we have possible here,” said Josh Ahart, who is studying public affairs. “So we need to do better as a university and as a family.” OSU Student Body President Celia Wright, a senior studying public health, called the entire episode \\"disturbing.\\" \\"Partly because it was such a high-profile thing,\\" said Wright, \\"and partly because he seemed to define what we as a society envision as healthy.\\" Play Facebook Twitter Embed Ohio State Students Shocked by Karageorge Death 2:07 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog IN-DEPTH SOCIAL .@OSUCoachMeyer: It's been a tough week.

The statement echoes the severity of the issue and the dire need for enquiry and justice considering the grievous outcome of the mishap. The M9 crash, a serious event that shocked the nation, claimed two lives and raised significant questions about road safety and emergency response protocols in Scotland. Emphasizing its gravity, the Lord Advocate fostered the necessity of a comprehensive FAI that dives deep into the circumstances leading to the accident, its management, and the subsequent impact. As the chief legal officer of Scotland, the Lord Advocate's statements carry substantial weight and rightfully so, given the harrowing nature of the loss. By calling it inconceivable not to undergo an FAI, he stresses on the state's responsibility to thoroughly investigate accidents of such magnitude to ensure accountability, establish preventive measures, and most importantly, bring justice to the victims. Fatal Accident Inquiries in Scotland are significant public investigations, not dissimilar to coroner's inquests in other jurisdictions. They are managed by the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service and overseen by a Sheriff in a public hearing. The purpose of these inquiries is usually to ascertain the circumstances of a significant incident and make recommendations to prevent such unfortunate occurrences in the future. Referring to the accident as a critical and sad incident, the Lord Advocate’s assertiveness towards conducting an FAI is likely to be instrumental in the decision-making process, which is due to the substantial authority his position holds in Scottish legislation. Moreover, the family members and friends of the victims have eagerly been awaiting a detailed investigation into the incident. From their perspective, an FAI will not only shed light on what went wrong but also ensure that measures are put in place to prevent future occurrences of such untoward incidents. The impact of the M9 crash extends to all of Scotland and beyond, invigorating a nationwide conversation about road safety, emergency services, and their efficacy. A successful Fatal Accident Inquiry would provide the blueprint for handling similar incidents in the future more effectively, highlighting areas of improvement in road safety regulations and emergency response. In conclusion, the Lord Advocate's assertive stance underscores the integral role of Fatal Accident Inquiries in ensuring a transparent, comprehensive exploration into such serious incidents. It also hints at the relentless pursuit of justice for the victims of the M9 accident and a dedicated endeavor to bolster road safety and emergency responses in Scotland. His unwavering stance reinstates both the Scottish government’s seriousness in reviewing and improving its accident response mechanism as well as its commitment towards the safety and wellbeing of its citizens. Upcoming developments around the FAI regarding the M9 crash are thus worthy of close attention, as Scotland aims to build a safer, more secure environment for all its denizens."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the producer who provided the studio where the band that rehearsed in a deconsecrated church recorded their first single? In January 1980, Michael Stipe met Peter Buck in Wuxtry Records, the Athens record store where Buck worked. The pair discovered that they shared similar tastes in music, particularly in punk rock and protopunk artists like Patti Smith, Television, and the Velvet Underground. Stipe said, \\"It turns out that I was buying all the records that [Buck] was saving for himself.\\" Through mutual friend Kathleen O'Brien, Stipe and Buck then met fellow University of Georgia students Mike Mills and Bill Berry, who had played music together since high school and lived together in Georgia. The quartet agreed to collaborate on several songs; Stipe later commented that \\"there was never any grand plan behind any of it\\". Their still-unnamed band spent a few months rehearsing in a deconsecrated Episcopal church in Athens, and played its first show on April 5, 1980, supporting The Side Effects at O'Brien's birthday party held in the same church, performing a mix of originals and 1960s and 1970s covers. After considering Twisted Kites, Cans of Piss, and Negro Eyes, the band settled on \\"R.E.M.\\" (which is an acronym for rapid eye movement, the dream stage of sleep), which Stipe selected at random from a dictionary.The band members eventually dropped out of school to focus on their developing group. They found a manager in Jefferson Holt, a record store clerk who was so impressed by an R.E.M. performance in his hometown of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, that he moved to Athens. R.E.M.'s success was almost immediate in Athens and surrounding areas; the band drew progressively larger crowds for shows, which caused some resentment in the Athens music scene. Over the next year and a half, R.E.M. toured throughout the Southern United States. Touring was arduous because a touring circuit for alternative rock bands did not then exist. The group toured in an old blue van driven by Holt, and lived on a food allowance of 2 each per day.During April 1981, R.E.M. recorded its first single, \\"Radio Free Europe\\", at producer Mitch Easter's Drive-In...

While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - Nikki Clan was a Mexican Pop rock band from Nogales, Sonora and Mexicali, Baja California, The band is formed by Yadira Gianola (lead vocals), Alberto Espinosa (bass guitar), José Antonio Dabdoub (guitar), Ángel Yáñez (guitar), and José Carlos Fausto Monroy (drums).

Gene is also responsible for completing a major project started by Dodge—the construction of an irrigation system that would bring valuable water to the faithful Rancho Grande employees in the southern part of the valley. Dodge mortgaged his ranch in order to finance the project. When Dodge's grandchildren, Tom, Kay, and Patsy, arrive from the east, they are unimpressed with life on the ranch.

He invites them to stay at Rancho Grande, where they get in everyone's way. Gene and his sidekick Frog Millhouse finally succeed in scaring the dudes off the ranch.

Options: - ask - question - ignore - answer - mute Explain why a human would choose \\"ignore\\" to answer the question above: The answer is:","completion":"\\"Ignore\\" A human would choose \\"ignore\\" as the answer to this question because when someone does not reply to a question, they are essentially ignoring it. Ignoring means to disregard, pay no attention to, or fail to consider something. In this case, the person is choosing not to address or respond to the question being asked. To understand why \\"ignore\\" is the proper choice among the given options, let's examine each of the other alternatives: 1. Ask: This option doesn't make sense, as the person in question is already being asked a question, and the focus is on their reaction to it, not on them asking another question. 2. Question: Similar to \\"ask,\\" choosing \\"question\\" would imply that the person is posing their own question in response, rather than addressing the initial question asked. 3. Answer: This option is contrary to the scenario, as it is explicitly stated that the person is not replying to the question. Therefore, they cannot be considered to be answering it. 4. Mute: \\"Mute\\" could suggest that the person cannot or will not speak, either due to a physical condition or a conscious choice to remain silent. However, this option doesn't necessarily imply a deliberate disregard for the question or an act of ignoring it, as \\"ignore\\" does. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"ignore\\" to answer the question because it best represents the act of not responding to a question that has been posed. None of the other options accurately capture the situation where someone does not reply to a question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Buccaneers, the Titans flew to Reliant Stadium for a Week 7 AFC South showdown with the Houston Texans. With Vince Young recovering from a quad injury, back-up QB Kerry Collins was given the start. In the first quarter, Tennessee drew first blood with kicker Rob Bironas getting a 52-yard field goal. The Texans would respond with LB DeMeco Ryans returning a fumble 26 yards for a touchdown. Afterwards, the Titans answered with Bironas kicking a 25-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Tennessee began to pound away as Bironas got a 21-yard field goal, while RB LenDale White got a 1-yard TD run. Afterwards, Bironas would end the half with a 30-yard and a 28-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Titans continued its domination with Bironas kicking a 43-yard field goal, while rookie RB Chris Henry got a 4-yard TD run. However, in the fourth quarter, Houston began to rally as QB Sage Rosenfels completed a 7-yard TD pass to WR David Anderson and a 6-yard TD pass to WR Kevin Walter. Afterwards, Tennessee managed to reply. With Bironas' 29-yard field goal, he became the 5th kicker in NFL history to get 7 field goals in one game. However, the Texans managed to retake the lead with Rosenfels completing a 7-yard TD pass to TE Jeb Putzier and a 53-yard TD pass to WR Andr&#233; Davis.

Context: Countess Nicolette de Gobignon pressed a wet cloth tothe King's brow. Though he lay there helpless, still she found him an awesome figure, like a fallen cathedral tower. Only two other men are as tall, she thought. Amalric and Orlando. She felt a pang of guilt. How could she be thinking about the troubadour here where her royal master lay slowly dying? She fixed her eyes on Louis, and on the ivory and wood crucifix that rose and fell on his chest with his labored breathing. Nicolette felt as if she, too, could hardly breathe. Across the crowded room a fire roared in a huge stone-lined fireplace. The air was stifling. She resented all that made it so, down to the woolen draperies and wall hangings and the thick carpets that sealed in the heat. But she knew that this northern chateau, Pontoise-les-Noyons, a day's ride from Paris, had had to be built to withstand cold, its walls thick and its windows tiny ? so totally unlike the bright, airy Languedoc manor she had grown up in. Sweat trickled down her brow and stung her eyes. Her breath was coming in little gasps. She felt as if she would faint if she couldn't go outside soon. Dozens of people, the King's family and courtiers, had packed themselves uselessly into the room, making it even more suffocating. Their whispers, like the buzzing of mosquitoes, irritated Nicolette. Almost all of them, she was sure, worried more about their own welfare than about the King's. And even Louis's wife and mother, though they grieved for him, were too distracted to do much to alleviate his suffering. She saw the King's lips quiver, and quickly she bent close to him. Any last words could be terribly important. \\"Jerusalem,\\" he mumbled. \\"Towers - golden. Gates of pearl.

Its animals, plants and landscapes have evolved over one thousand years, and there are about a million different natural species in Australia. More than 80 per cent of the country's plants and animals are unique to prefix = st1 /Australia, along with most of the fish and almost half the birds. Australia has more than 140 species of marsupials ,including koalas, wombats and the Tasmanian devil, now found only in the Australian wilderness. More than 750 species of birds have been recorded in Australia, 350 of which are found nowhere else in the world. Among them are the kookaburra, the rainbow lorikeet and fairy penguins. There are also 55 differernt species of macropods--the kangaroo family--native toAustralia. They vary greatly in size and weight, ranging from half a kilogram to 90 kilograms. The country has been making every effort to protect its natural heritage. Despite the large size of the continent, the majority of Australians live on the coast and in major cities--around 75 per cent of Australia's population lives in city areas. Australia is the driest continent on earth. Its center has one of the lowest rainfalls in the world and about three-quarters of the land is dry. These dry areas extend from the large central deserts to the western coast. Soils in these areas are very poor compared to other deserts.

Jot down a few reasons why you feel nervous about your speech. Try to dig into specific reasons. For example, if you write down that you’re worried that you’ll look stupid in front of a crowd, think about why you think you’ll look stupid. Is it because you worry that your information is wrong? Once you know this, you can spend more time researching and learning your topic. When you think negative thoughts about yourself and your performance, your anxiety will grow. If you don’t have confidence in yourself, you may think, how will your audience have confidence in you? When you catch yourself thinking negatively, stop yourself. Replace it with a positive thought. For example, you might think, “I’ll forget my entire speech. I don’t know what I’m doing.” Stop this thought and replace it with, “I know my topic. I’ve done lots of research. Plus, I will have my speech written down and I can look at it when I need to. And if I stumble over a few places, that’s okay.” The fear of public speaking is known as glossophobia. About 80% of the population gets anxious about speaking in public. This group feels nervous, has clammy hands, has a racing heartbeat, and feels jittery.

Let's unpack it further to gain more insight. \\"The message of the book was that there would be a change in the world\\", this initial part of the sentence implies that the book projects a significant transformation or shift in the world. This transformation could be of any form - physical, ideological, societal, or environmental depending on the context of the book itself. This could indicate an upcoming era of change or a revolutionary time, stirring the customary affairs of the world. The next part of the original sentence, \\"and that one should be brave\\" advocates for courage in the face of these changes. The book emphasizes the necessity of being fearless and resilient to face the unforeseeable challenges. This underlines the importance of individual strength and the courage to face adversities, which often characterizes many narratives across a range of genres, from adventure and science fiction to historical and dystopian novels. Finally, \\"to ensure that the justice cannot be skipped\\" viably appears to be a call for individuals to stand against injustice. The book empowers readers to not only anticipate and display courage in times of change but also to uphold justice.

Article: Is it time to kick Russia out of the BRICs ?If so, it may end up sounding like a famous ball-point pen maker--BIC. An argument is being made that Goldman Sach's famous marketing device , the BRICs, should really be the BICs. \\"Is Russia really worth the name BRICs?\\" asks Anders Aslund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreign Policy. Aslund, who is also co-author with Andrew Kuchins of \\"The Russian Balance Sheet\\", thinks the Russia of Putin and Medvedev is just not worthy of inclusion alongside Brazil, India and China in the list of future economic powerhouses. He writes: \\"The country's economic performance has fallen to such a weak level that one must ask whether it has any say at all on the global economy, compared with the other members of its group. I have just returned from Moscow, which is always dull around this season. For the last seven years, Russia has taken very few measures to improve its economy. Instead, the state has been living on oil and gas.\\" Economically, Aslund has the numbers on his side. The International Monetary Fund figures that the Russian economy will fall by 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow 8.5 percent and India 5.4 percent. There is less of a case for Brazil, with a fall of 0.7 percent, but it is still doing far better than Russia. But the BRICs are not just about economy. As is mentioned above, it is a marketing device to encourage investors to focus on the big promising players. From an investment standpoint, it could be argued that Russia is leading the BRICs. Its stock market is up 128 percent this year while around 80 percent is for the other three. At very least, despite Russia's economic underperformance, its stock market outperformance does suggest it is indeed one of the group. Question: According to Aslund, Russia shouldn't be a BRIC partly because _ . Options: A: its economic performance is worse than that of the others B: its leaders are not good at managing economy C: it has taken effective measures to improve its economy D: it will no longer attract investors from other countries","completion":"According to Aslund, Russia shouldn't be a BRIC partly because A: its economic performance is worse than that of the others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what can separate salt from water?\\" is \\"shaking\\", given that evaporation can remove salt from water? Answer:","completion":"When considering the process of separating salt from water, I must compare the effectiveness of shaking versus evaporation. Step 1: Understand the two methods. - Shaking: This method involves agitating a saltwater solution in order to try to separate the salt from the water. - Evaporation: This method involves allowing the water in a saltwater solution to evaporate, leaving the salt behind as a solid residue. Step 2: Compare the efficiency of the two methods. - Shaking: While shaking may cause some salt particles to separate from the water temporarily, the salt will still remain dissolved in the water once the motion stops. Therefore, shaking does not effectively separate salt from water in a permanent manner. - Evaporation: As water evaporates, the salt is left behind, creating a clear separation between salt and water. This method is effective and commonly used in desalination processes. Step 3: Analyze the given answer.

The Rova of Antananarivo was converted into a museum the following year, and the Fitomiandalana tombs were excavated and moved to a new location behind the tombs of Radama I and Rasoherina. The bodies of sovereigns previously interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga were exhumed and transferred to the tombs in the Rova grounds, a sacrilegious move that degraded the status of Ambohimanga as a site of sacred pilgrimage. According to Frémigacci (1999), French colonial administrator General Joseph Gallieni undertook this desacralisation of the Rova in an attempt to break popular belief in the power of the royal ancestors. By the same token, his actions relegated Malagasy sovereignty under the Merina rulers to a relic of an unenlightened past. The desecration of the two most sacred sites of Merina royalty represented a calculated political move intended to establish the political and cultural superiority of the colonial power.Following independence the Rova compound remained largely closed to the public throughout the First (1960–1972) and Second (1975–1992) Republics except on special occasions. In 1995, three years into the Third Republic (1992–2010), the Rova compound was destroyed by fire.

Although Victoria was much tidier than Elena was,","completion":"Although Victoria was much tidier than Elena was, the two friends found a way to coexist harmoniously in their small shared apartment, a testament to the strength of their friendship and their ability to acknowledge and accommodate each other's quirks and habits. While Victoria thrived in a well-organized environment, Elena's artistic temperament and more laid-back approach to life meant her belongings frequently ended up scattered about the living space, much to Victoria's chagrin. However, they soon realized that the differences in their personalities complemented one another, and that their friendship could only flourish if they struck a delicate balance between organization and creative chaos. To achieve this equilibrium, they decided to establish designated spaces within the apartment where Victoria's need for order and Elena's penchant for disarray could coexist. Victoria's immaculate bedroom became her sanctuary, while Elena's studio served as a haven for her artistic pursuits and her ever-evolving mess of canvases, paint, and brushes. The common areas, such as the living room and kitchen, were governed by a set of mutually agreed-upon rules that catered to both their preferences. They split their chores evenly, with each friend taking responsibility for the areas that aligned with their skills and sensibilities. Victoria managed the organizational tasks like arranging the pantry and sorting through the mail, while Elena happily tended to their little garden and cooked creative, flavorful meals that never failed to bring a smile to their faces. Over time, both Victoria and Elena began to appreciate each other's strengths and even adopted some of their positive attributes. Victoria learned to let loose a little and occasionally indulge in a bit of creative chaos, while Elena developed a greater sense of organization and discipline, applying these new principles to her artistic endeavours, which only enriched her work.

As they navigated the journey of life together, facing challenges and sharing several memorable moments, they came to understand that true friendship extends beyond superficial traits and habits.

The following article contains an answer for the question: In what year did the Chicago Symphony Orchestra travel to Europe? , can you please find it? In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America.

Answer the following question: which body structure provides actual diffusion of respiratory gases in lungs?","completion":"The body structure that provides actual diffusion of respiratory gases in lungs is the alveoli. Alveoli are tiny, grape-like air sacs present in the lungs, and they function as the primary gas exchange units between the inhaled air and the blood. There are approximately 300 million alveoli in the human lungs, which provide a vast surface area, around 70 to 100 square meters, for efficient gas exchange. The walls of the alveoli are composed of a single layer of thin, flat cells called alveolar type I pneumocytes. These cells are surrounded by a dense network of narrow blood vessels called pulmonary capillaries. Oxygen and carbon dioxide diffuse passively across these thin membranes through a process known as simple diffusion. During inhalation, air enters the lungs and travels through the bronchial tree, which is a system of branching tubes. The air is transported into the smaller bronchioles and then into the alveoli. As oxygen-rich air enters the alveoli, it causes oxygen molecules to diffuse across the moist and thin alveolar-capillary membrane. The oxygen then binds to hemoglobin molecules in the red blood cells of capillary blood, forming oxyhemoglobin. At the same time, carbon dioxide, which is a waste product of cellular respiration, diffuses from the blood into the alveoli and is eliminated during exhalation. The process of gas exchange is facilitated by several factors, including: 1. Large surface area: The large number of alveoli increases the surface area for gas diffusion, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the process. 2. Thin barrier: The alveolar-capillary membrane is extremely thin, which allows for faster and more efficient diffusion of gases. 3. Partial pressure gradient: The gas exchange in the alveoli is driven by differences in partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the alveolar air and capillary blood. 4. Ventilation-perfusion matching: In the lungs, the blood flow (perfusion) and airflow (ventilation) are carefully regulated to ensure that both oxygen and carbon dioxide are adequately exchanged. 5. Moist environment: The moist lining of the alveolar walls helps dissolve the respiratory gases, which is essential for efficient gas diffusion. In summary, the alveoli are the critical structures within the lungs that provide the actual diffusion of respiratory gases. Their unique characteristics, such as an extensive surface area, thin membranes, and moist lining, collectively ensure efficient gas exchange between the inhaled air and the bloodstream."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Information: - A parody (also called a spoof, send-up, take-off, or lampoon) is a work created to imitate, make fun of, or comment on an original workits subject, author, style, or some other targetby means of satiric or ironic imitation. As the literary theorist Linda Hutcheon puts it, \\"parody is imitation, not always at the expense of the parodied text.\\" Another critic, Simon Dentith, defines parody as \\"any cultural practice which provides a relatively polemical allusive imitation of another cultural production or practice.\\" Parody may be found in art or culture, including literature, music (although \\"parody\\" in music has an earlier, somewhat different meaning than for other art forms), animation, gaming, and film. - Count (male) or countess (female) is a title in European countries for a noble of varying status, but historically deemed to convey an approximate rank intermediate between the highest and lowest titles of nobility. The word \\"count\\" came into English from the French \\"comte\\", itself from Latin \\"comes\\"in its accusative \\"comitem\\"meaning companion, and later companion of the emperor, delegate of the emperor. The adjective form of the word is \\"\\". The British and Irish equivalent is an earl (whose wife is a \\"countess\\", for lack of an English term). Alternative names for the \\"count\\" rank in the nobility structure are used in other countries, such as \\"Graf\\" in Germany and \\"Hakushaku\\" during the Japanese Imperial era. - Igor , or sometimes Ygor , is a stock character assistant to many types of Gothic villains , such as Count Dracula or Dr. Victor Frankenstein , familiar from many horror movies and horror movie parodies . Although Dr. Frankenstein had a hunchback assistant in the 1931 film Frankenstein , his name was Fritz ; in the original Mary Shelley novel , Dr. Frankenstein has no lab assistant nor does a character named Igor appear . - Wallachia or Walachia (; archaic: ', Romanian Cyrillic alphabet: ) is a historical and geographical region of Romania. It is situated north of the Lower Danube and south of the Southern Carpathians. Wallachia is traditionally divided into two sections, Muntenia (Greater Wallachia) and Oltenia (Lesser Wallachia). Wallachia as a whole is sometimes referred to as Muntenia through identification with the larger of the two traditional sections. - Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\") - Dracula is an 1897 Gothic horror novel by Irish author Bram Stoker, famous for introducing the character of the vampire Count Dracula. - Victor Frankenstein is the title character of Mary Shelley's 1818 novel \\"Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus\\". He is a scientist who, after studying chemical processes and the decay of living beings, gains an insight into the creation of life and gives life to his own creature, often referred to as Frankenstein's monster, or often colloquially referred to as simply \\"Frankenstein\\". - A tradition is a belief or behavior passed down within a group or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past. Common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes (like lawyers' wigs or military officers' spurs), but the idea has also been applied to social norms such as greetings. Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of yearsthe word \\"tradition\\" itself derives from the Latin \\"tradere\\" or \\"traderer\\" literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. While it is commonly assumed that traditions have ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether that be political or cultural, over short periods of time. Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways. - Popular culture or pop culture is the entirety of ideas, perspectives, attitudes, images, and other phenomena that are within the mainstream of a given culture, especially Western culture of the early to mid 20th century and the emerging global mainstream of the late 20th and early 21st century. Heavily influenced by mass media, this collection of ideas permeates the everyday lives of the society. The most common pop culture categories are: entertainment (movies, music, television, games), sports, news (as in people/places in news), politics, fashion/clothes, technology, and slang. Popular culture has a way of influencing an individual's attitudes towards certain topics. - Frankenstein's monster, sometimes known as Frankenstein, is a fictional character whose fictional creator was Victor Frankenstein. The monster first appeared, without any name, in Mary Shelley's 1818 novel \\"Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus\\". Shelley's title thus compares Victor Frankenstein to the mythological character Prometheus who fashioned humans out of clay and gave them fire. Although nameless in Shelley's novel, the creature took on the name \\"Frankenstein\\" in later years. - A cliché or cliche (or ) is an expression, idea, or element of an artistic work which has become overused to the point of losing its original meaning or effect, even to the point of being trite or irritating, especially when at some earlier time it was considered meaningful or novel. - A werewolf (from , \\"man\\"), man-wolf, or lycanthrope (\\"lykánthropos\\": , \\"lykos\\", \\"wolf\\", and , \\"anthrpos\\", \\"human\\") is a mythological or folkloric human with the ability to shapeshift into a wolf or a therianthropic hybrid wolf-like creature, either purposely or after being placed under a curse or affliction (e.g. via a bite or scratch from another werewolf). Early sources for belief in lycanthropy are Petronius (2766) and Gervase of Tilbury (11501228). - A vampire is a being from folklore who subsists by feeding on the life essence (generally in the form of blood) of the living. In European folklore, vampires were undead beings that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century. Although vampiric entities have been recorded in most cultures, the term \\"vampire\\" was not popularized in the West until the early 18th century, after an influx of vampire superstition into Western Europe from areas where vampire legends were frequent, such as the Balkans and Eastern Europe, although local variants were also known by different names, such as \\"shtriga\\" in Albania, \\"vrykolakas\\" in Greece and \\"strigoi\\" in Romania. This increased level of vampire superstition in Europe led to mass hysteria and in some cases resulted in corpses actually being staked and people being accused of vampirism. - A stock character is a stereotypical person whom audiences readily recognize from frequent recurrences in a particular literary tradition. Stock characters are archetypal characters distinguished by their flatness. As a result, they tend to be easy targets for parody and to be criticized as clichés. The presence of a particular array of stock characters is a key component of many genres. The point of the stock character is to move the story along. - Abraham \\"Bram\\" Stoker (8 November 1847 20 April 1912) was an Irish author, best known today for his 1897 Gothic novel \\"Dracula\\". During his lifetime, he was better known as the personal assistant of actor Henry Irving and business manager of the Lyceum Theatre in London, which Irving owned. - Count Dracula is the title character and main antagonist of Bram Stoker's 1897 gothic horror novel \\"Dracula\\". He is considered to be both the prototypical and the archetypal vampire in subsequent works of fiction. He is also depicted in the novel to be the origin of werewolf legends. Some aspects of the character are believed to have been inspired by the 15th-century Wallachian Prince Vlad III the Impaler, who was also known as Dracula. Other character aspects have been added or altered in subsequent popular fictional works. The character has subsequently appeared frequently in popular culture, from films to animated media to breakfast cereals.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: David Lee Marks (born August 22, 1948) is an American guitarist, singer and songwriter. He is best known as a member of the American rock band The Beach Boys, with whom he recorded four studio albums, and of whom he was a member from 1962 until 1963, again from 1997 until 1999, and lastly in 2012. Following his initial departure from the band, Marks fronted the Marksmen and performed and recorded as a session musician. A neighbor of the Wilson family - Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson - and a frequent participant at the Wilson family's Sunday night singalongs, Marks officially joined the Beach Boys in February 1962 as its rhythm guitarist. In February 1963, Dennis Wilson was injured in a car accident and his replacement was Mark Groseclose, who went to high school with Carl Wilson. Marks and Groseclose became friends and Marks eventually took over Groseclose's garage band, the Jaguars, which he renamed the Marksmen. The band was initially a side project for the aspiring songwriter, who was growing tired of his songs being passed over for Beach Boys records by Murry Wilson. After Marks left the Beach Boys, the Marksmen became his full-time focus, becoming one of the first acts to be signed to Herb Alpert's A&M Records in 1964. Murry Wilson reportedly threatened radio deejays in order to keep them from playing the Marksmen's records. Later, the group signed with (and released a single on) Warner Bros. Records, but in spite of packed concert venues up and down the state of California, lack of air play precluded any further releases. The 2009 release of Marks & the Marksmen Ultimate Collector's Edition 1963-1965 marks the first-time the entire Marksmen catalog was made available to the public. In 1966, Marks played with Casey Kasem's Band Without a Name. He then worked with the late 1960s psychedelic pop band, The Moon, along with Matt Moore, Larry Brown, and David Jackson. The band signed a production deal with producer Mike Curb and released two under-promoted albums on the Imperial label. He also performed with Delaney and Bonnie, Colours (recording lead guitar on their second album), and Warren Zevon. By the time Marks was 21 years old, he had been signed to five label deals and had grown disillusioned with the Los Angeles music scene. In 1969, he relocated to Boston, where he studied jazz and classical guitar as a private student at the Berklee College of Music and the New England Conservatory of Music in 1970-71.

Answer the following question: Given the below context: According to the Dictionary of American Hymnology \\"Amazing Grace\\" is John Newton's spiritual autobiography in verse.In 1725, Newton was born in Wapping, a district in London near the Thames. His father was a shipping merchant who was brought up as a Catholic but had Protestant sympathies, and his mother was a devout Independent unaffiliated with the Anglican Church. She had intended Newton to become a clergyman, but she died of tuberculosis when he was six years old. For the next few years, Newton was raised by his emotionally distant stepmother while his father was at sea, and spent some time at a boarding school where he was mistreated. At the age of eleven, he joined his father on a ship as an apprentice; his seagoing career would be marked by headstrong disobedience. As a youth, Newton began a pattern of coming very close to death, examining his relationship with God, then relapsing into bad habits. As a sailor, he denounced his faith after being influenced by a shipmate who discussed Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times, a book by the Third Earl of Shaftesbury, with him. In a series of letters he later wrote, \\"Like an unwary sailor who quits his port just before a rising storm, I renounced the hopes and comforts of the Gospel at the very time when every other comfort was about to fail me.\\" His disobedience caused him to be pressed into the Royal Navy, and he took advantage of opportunities to overstay his leave and finally deserted to visit Mary \\"Polly\\" Catlett, a family friend with whom he had fallen in love.

What is the density and viscosity of biodiesel extracted from dairy scum? How is the viscosity of a fluid calculated? Is there a way that is not affected by density considerations? Please tell me if those questions are the same. OPT: - no. - yes.","completion":"To determine the density and viscosity of biodiesel extracted from dairy scum, we'll need experimental data from a specific study or source, as these values may vary depending on the composition and other factors. A literature search or inquiry to researchers in the field would be helpful in obtaining these values. Viscosity is a measure of a fluid's resistance to flow. In general, viscosity can be calculated using several methods, and many do not directly depend on the fluid's density. One common method for calculating viscosity involves measuring the time it takes for a small disk or ball to sink through the fluid in a calibrated tube (falling ball viscometer). In this case, the viscosity is obtained from the measured terminal velocity, which is affected by the drag force and buoyancy force acting on the ball. Although these forces are influenced by the fluid density, they also depend on other factors such as the fluid velocity, the shape and size of the object, and the fluid properties. Therefore, the viscosity calculation is not entirely dependent on density. To answer your last question: - No, the questions are not the same.

Another Afghan driver was critically wounded in the attack in Logar province, south of Kabul, IRC said. \\"They were traveling to Kabul in a clearly marked International Rescue Committee vehicle when they came under fire,\\" according to the statement. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. The aid workers were in a two-car convoy when gunmen opened fire on them in Pul-i-Alam, the capital of Logar, according to provincial governor Abdullah Wardak.

However, Brooks lives a secret life as a serial killer, known as the \\"Thumbprint Killer\\". Brooks has abstained from murder for the past two years by attending twelve-step meetings for addicts, to try and cope with his \\"killing addiction\\". He feels the compulsion to kill rising again, however, as his id, Marshall (William Hurt), becomes more insistent. Brooks gives in to his addiction and kills a young couple while they are having sex in their house and, as part of his psychopathology, leaves each of the victims' bloody thumbprints on a lampshade. Brooks follows his meticulous modus operandi, including fastidious preparation, cleaning up the crime scene, even locking the doors before departing, and burning the clothes he was wearing during the killings. Marshall then realizes that the couple's curtains were open, facing an apartment building. Brooks' daughter Jane (Danielle Panabaker) unexpectedly arrives home, having dropped out of college in Palo Alto, California. She visits Brooks at work and mentions that she would like to get a job with his company.

Two engineersÂ â Aaron and AbeÂ â supplement their day-jobs with entrepreneurial tech projects, working out of Aaron's garage. During one such research effort, involving electromagnetic reduction of objects' weight, the two men accidentally discover an 'A-to-B' time loop side-effect; objects left in the weight-reducing field exhibit temporal anomalies, proceeding normally (from time 'A,' when the field was activated, to time 'B,' when the field is powered off), then backwards (from 'B' back to 'A'), in continuous A-then-B-then-A-then-B sequence, such that objects can leave the field in the present, or at some previous point. Abe refines this proof-of-concept and builds a stable time-apparatus (\\"the box\\"), sized to accommodate a human subject. Abe uses this \\"box\\" to travel six hours into his own pastâas part of this process, Original-Abe sits incommunicado in a hotel room, so as not to interact or interfere with the outside world, after which Original-Abe enters the \\"box,\\" waits inside the \\"box\\" for six hours (thus going back in time six hours), and becomes Future-Overlap-Double-Abe, who travels across town, explains the proceedings to Aaron, and brings Aaron back to the secure self-storage facility housing the \\"box.\\" At the end of the overlap-timespan, Original-Abe no longer exists, having entered the \\"box,\\" rewound six hours, and become Future-Overlap-Double-Abe for the remainder of time.

Options: - beach - surface of earth - future - waterfalls - underwater Explain why a human would choose \\"underwater\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"The correct answer is \\"underwater\\" and here's why: Scuba gear refers to the equipment used by divers when they submerge themselves in bodies of water, usually for prolonged periods. The word 'Scuba' itself is an acronym for Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus, highlighting its use is primarily underwater. When the question refers to using scuba gear in the ocean, it implies that the person is in the water and not just at the beach or on the surface of the earth. As scuba gear is designed for underwater exploration, it wouldn't be practical or necessary to use it at a beach without intending to go under the water surface or on dry land. The options \\"future\\" and \\"waterfalls\\" can be eliminated because they don't accurately depict the location of a person using scuba gear in the ocean. The future is a time period, not a physical location. And while waterfalls are a type of water feature, they are not typically associated with scuba diving due to their flowing and crashing water making it dangerous and impractical for such activity. Therefore, given the context and wording of the question, a human would choose \\"underwater\\" to answer the question because it best matches the activity of scuba diving in the ocean."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

These satellite-based systems provide turn-by-turn directions to help people get to where they want to go. But, they can also cause a lot of problems, send you to the wrong place or leave you completely lost. Many times, the driver is to blame. Sometimes a GPS error is responsible. Most often, says Barry Brown, it is a combination of the two. We spoke to Mr. Brown by Skype. He told us about an incident involving a friend who had flown to an airport in the eastern United States. There he borrowed a GPS-equipped car to use during his stay. Barry Brown: \\"And they just plugged in an address and then set off to their destination. And, then it wasn't until they were driving for thirty minutes that they realized they actually put in a destination back on the West Coast where they lived. They actually put their home address in. So again, the GPS is kind of 'garbage in garbage out'.\\" Mister Brown says this is a common human error. But, he says, what makes the problem worse has to do with some of the shortcomings, or failures, of GPS equipment. Barry Brown: \\"One problem with a lot of the GPS units is they have a very small screen and they just tell you the next turn.

Answer the following question: is bank of america a commercial bank or credit union?","completion":"Bank of America is a commercial bank and not a credit union. It is essential to understand the fundamental differences between the two types of financial institutions to provide a clear context on the designation of Bank of America. A commercial bank is a financial institution that provides a variety of financial services to individuals, businesses, and governments. These services typically include checking and savings accounts, loans, credit cards, mortgages, and various other financial products. Commercial banks are for-profit institutions, meaning they aim to generate profits for their shareholders. They make money by charging interest on loans and through various fees for their services. Some of the largest commercial banks in the world include Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Citibank. Bank of America, in particular, is one of the largest banks globally, with headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. It operates throughout the United States and provides a comprehensive range of financial products and services, such as savings accounts, checking accounts, loans, and investment services. Furthermore, Bank of America is a publicly traded corporation, which means that its shares are listed on a stock exchange, and its primary goal is to generate profit for its shareholders. Credit unions, on the other hand, are nonprofit financial institutions that provide many of the same services as commercial banks. However, the major difference lies in their ownership structure and overall purpose. Credit unions are owned by their members, who are also their customers. This means that profits generated by a credit union are often returned to the members in the form of lower interest rates on loans, higher dividends on savings accounts, and generally lower fees for services. Moreover, credit unions often have a more localized focus as they primarily serve the financial needs of their members within a specific community, employer group, or organization. As a result, credit unions may have a more personalized approach to customer service due to their smaller size and closer relationship with their members. In conclusion, Bank of America is a commercial bank, seeking to generate profits for its shareholders by providing a wide range of financial services and products to individuals, businesses, and governments. In contrast, a credit union is a nonprofit financial institution with the primary goal of serving its member-owners by offering financial services at more competitive rates and personalized customer service."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(AP) — The U.S. Forest Service will postpone a tree-thinning project intended to decrease the wildfire risk at Lake Tahoe after a lawsuit raised concern about its effect on an endangered frog species. The agency had been removing and burning trees and brush on land near Upper Echo Lake, about 8 miles southwest of South Lake Tahoe, that is considered for designation as critical habitat for the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog. Dennis Murphy, a renowned conservation biologist at the University of Nevada, Reno, filed the lawsuit last year. He said the logging threatens the survival of the frog, listed as an endangered species in April. The Forest Service agreed in a stipulation signed by a federal judge Wednesday to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service about potential effects to the frog, the Tahoe Daily Tribune reported (http://bit.ly/1pJWztO ). It also said it would halt the project through this year and wait to resume thinning trees until finishing its consultation with wildlife officials. Forest Service spokeswoman Cheva Gabor declined to comment. \\"Once the matter is in the courts, we let the legal process unwind,\\" she said. Murphy's attorney, Paul Weiland, said he was pleased with the outcome. \\"Certainly, it is welcome news that they were able to stop the project and address the issue with the project impacts with the Fish and Wildlife Service,\\" he told the newspaper. The suit says the Forest Service violated the National Environmental Policy Act by failing to prepare an environmental impact statement or environmental assessment. \\"At a minimum, the Forest Service should have conducted surveys of the project area to determine whether its activities would harm the species and its habitat,\\" Murphy, a research professor in biology at UNR, said in a statement. \\"But instead the agency put on blinders to the impacts of the project hoping no one would notice.\\" ___ Information from: Tahoe Daily Tribune, http://www.tahoedailytribune.com/ ||||| The U.S. Forest Service has agreed to hold off on a fuels reduction project near Upper Echo Lake this year, as part of ongoing litigation that, until recently, accused the agency’s tree thinning operations of threatening a protected animal species. Land under the Upper Echo Lakes Hazardous Fuels Reduction Project is being considered as a designated critical habitat for the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog, an animal that was recently placed on the endangered species list in April. If the agency was to continue removing or burning trees and brush at the lake — a region the plaintiff says doesn’t need it — the work could further “result in harmful effects on ecological and historical resources,” according to the lawsuit. “At a minimum, the Forest Service should have conducted surveys of the project area to determine whether its activities would harm the species and its habitat,” said plaintiff Dr. Dennis Murphy, a Pew Scholar in conservation and the environment and research professor in biology at the University of Nevada, Reno, “but instead the agency put on blinders to the impacts of the project hoping no one would notice.” In a stipulation signed by Senior U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell, Jr., on Wednesday, the Forest Service agreed to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regarding potential impacts to the frogs. It has also committed to take no further on-the-ground action on the project through 2014 or resume activities before the consultation with the wildlife service is complete. The Forest Service was reached by phone Friday, but declined to comment on the case. “Once the matter is in the courts, we let the legal process unwind,” spokeswoman Cheva Gabor said. Following the Forest Service’s cooperation, Murphy, in a separate stipulation filed Friday, dismissed the claims that the agency violated the Endangered Species Act. His attorney, Paul Weiland, said he was pleased with the outcome. “Certainly it is welcome news that they were able to stop the project and address the issues with the project impacts with the Fish and Wildlife Service,” Weiland said. However, Murphy’s claim that the Forest Service violated the National Environmental Policy Act still stands in the lawsuit. Murphy says the Echo Lake fuel reduction project, which is intended to decrease fire risk on forest land near the lake, violated NEPA by moving ahead without preparing a proper environmental impact statement or environmental assessment. The Forest Service worked on the project for several weeks in fall 2013. Work was about 40 percent done when the government shutdown halted progress. Murphy, whose family has owned a seasonal residence on Upper Echo Lake for more than 80 years, filed the lawsuit in November. “The Project area is littered with dozens of slash piles, many that are in or adjacent to wetland, including ephemeral streams, meadows and seasonal ponds,” Murphy said in a statement. “The Forest Service has abrogated its duty (to) analyze the deleterious environmental impacts of the Project under the National Environmental Policy Act.” Weiland believes attorneys with the Forest Service will file a motion to dismiss the NEPA claims on Monday. But the federal agency said it could “neither confirm nor deny” those assumptions. If that is the case, however, Murphy said he and Weiland are prepared to file a response. “In plain English, the Forest Service has a lot of fuel reduction work they could be doing in the basin, but it doesn’t need to be done here,” he said. ||||| The Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog evolved in the fishless waters of Yosemite: \\"... advent of fish in a lake sooner or later nearly or quite eliminates the frogs. It seems probable that the fish prey upon the tadpoles, so that few or none of the latter are able to reach the stage at which they transform.

Visitors hiking along lakeshores could encounter frogs by the hundreds. Populations have since declined approximately 95% in the Sierra Nevada, including in Yosemite. Recent surveys in 2005-2007 determined that the species is still in rapid decline and on a trajectory toward extinction. Because of the precipitous declines, the frog is proposed as an Endangered species for protection under the Federal Endangered Species Act. The ecological effects of the loss of the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog from most of its range have been significant, as their former abundance made them a keystone predator and prey and a crucial agent of nutrient and energy cycling in Sierra Nevada aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Multiple factors have contributed to the decline of the frog, including the introduction of fish into naturally fishless waters throughout most of the park. As early as the turn of the 20th century, scientists in Yosemite noticed that frogs and fish rarely occurred in the same lake or stream. Non-native trout feed on eggs, tadpoles, and young adults and compete for natural food sources. Although fish stocking in Yosemite ceased in 1991, many non-native trout populations continue to exist. Studies suggest that the recently discovered amphibian chytrid fungus is a major contributor to observed declines in the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog. Chytridiomycosis, an often fatal disease, was first discovered in the Sierra Nevada in 2001. Subsequent studies have found that the chytrid fungus has been present in the Sierra Nevada at least since the mid-'70s. The chytrid fungus appears to live on keratin—the same substance fingernails are made of—found on the external mouthparts of tadpoles, and in the outer skin layer of adults. The growth of the fungus on adult’s skin apparently disrupts the frog’s ability to breathe through its skin and osmoregulate—sustain an internal water balance; both effects resulting in nearly certain death. Much still needs to be learned about the chytrid fungus, what its origins are and how it is spread. Research suggests that the fungus is a \\"novel pathogen,\\" meaning that it has recently spread from outside the geographic area to highly susceptible local species that did not evolve with the pathogen. Chytrid fungus has occurred in African clawed frog populations at least since the 1930s and is rarely fatal in this species. The African clawed frog has been transported around the world first for human pregnancy tests in the 1940s-1950s and later for laboratory testing and as pets. Release of animals into the wild could have infected new geographic areas. Also unknown is how the fungus moves between water bodies. While the fungal disease is highly fatal to Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frogs, there is some hope. A small number of frog populations have been able to persist and some populations have even increased in size despite the presence of the chytrid fungus. Ongoing research supported by the National Science Foundation is investigating why these few populations have been able to hang on. Such research will contribute to development of strategies to reestablish populations of frogs in the future. Additional causes of decline may include deposition of airborne contaminants, such as pesticides and other chemicals, from sources outside the park, other pathogens, and possibly a combination of these and other stressors. Two ongoing experimental projects are being conducted in Yosemite to determine the feasibility of expanding the distribution of the frog in the park. The park began a Yosemite Conservancy supported project in 2006 to re-introduce the frogs into several fishless lakes and started a project in 2007, supported by entrance fee funds, to restore habitat by removing non-native fish from a handful of remote sites. Fish removal has focused on 11 lakes in six areas. Six of these lakes are now considered fishless (Virginia Lake, Cold Mountain Area Lakes, and Bartlett Creek Lakes) and five more are currently being restored to their natural fishless state (Tiny McCabe, Ardeth, Miwok, Roosevelt, and Hutchings Creek Lakes). These lakes constitute 5% of the lakes that contain fish in the park. Research has shown that once fishless, the lakes are re-populated by native species, including frogs and invertebrates.

The primary reason fish are being removed from a small number of lakes is to provide more available breeding and overwintering habitat for the recovery and conservation of the federally endangered Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog. In addition, the restoration of mountain lakes to a fishless condition benefits ecosystem function as a whole, increasing insect diversity and abundance, which in turn benefits terrestrial wildlife species. Is Yosemite trying to remove fish from all waters within the park, and if not, how many lakes and streams will be affected? Yosemite has almost 2,700 lakes, of which about 250 currently contain fish. The National Park Service anticipates removing fish only from approximately 25 lakes (about 10% of lakes containing fish) total over the next 15 to 20 years. In addition, there are approximately 1,200 miles of streams in Yosemite of which 800 miles support fish. There are no plans to remove trout from stream locations other than short segments associated with lake inlets and outlets at restoration sites. Where is the best place to receive the latest information regarding the removal of fish in order to plan a visit to the park?

The project involved removing and burning trees and brush in an area that is being considered for designation as critical habitat for the frog. Renowned conservation biologist Dennis Murphy filed the lawsuit last year, stating that the logging threatens the survival of the endangered frog. In response, the Forest Service agreed to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regarding the potential effects on the frog and halt the project until the consultation is completed.

More precisely, the emergency room phoned to ask if Ray had a bed. Ray pretended to consult his admission log, just as he always did. The nightly hospital call meant one of three things: the chemical dependency floor was full (highly unlikely), the individual in question had fallen under the hospital's \\"one treatment episode every three months\\" sanction (also known as the Black List, and only moderately unlikely), or the prospective client had no insurance (in Ray's experience, very likely). The folks at the hospital knew, as did Ray, that federal law prohibited him from turning away individuals requesting detoxification services if he had an open bed. The hospital was generous enough to spring for a cab voucher for the intoxicate. In Ray's experience as well, overnight admissions were less interested in detox than in free food, a free bed and complimentary meds. For his two hour paperwork investment and aggravation, he would receive the benefit of knowing the client slept until noon then slipped out the side door and into another binge. Any bills for service generated for the brief stay would return in a week or so stamped \\"No Such Address\\" or simply \\"Return to Sender\\". On average, the clients of addictions services managed to muster a raging 25% of them who would ever pay a dime toward their bill. The night shift admission payment percentages were a quarter of that quarter in good years. Thus, the frequent calls from the hospital. They had little better luck in getting good addresses (or even with those, a client who stayed sober long enough to give a shit). No one relished treating the uninsured and uninsurable. It was fiscal suicide. The hospital was perfectly willing to let the local experts in deadbeats handle the workload. Tonight, Ray could tell them no.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: The Sentinel infrared telescope would be put in space to find and track potentially hazardous rocks near Earth. The B612 Foundation project will cost several hundred million dollars, and big donations are being sought from around the world to fund the exercise. Mission team members include former astronauts and senior Nasa officials. Renowned manufacturer Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corporation has already sketched an early design for the telescope. The foundation has been working for almost 10 years to try to raise awareness of the dangers that lurk in space, and has conducted technical studies on how one might deflect an asteroid on a collision path with Earth. But it says there is an urgent need to identify where all the dangerous rocks are, and the time has now come for the private, philanthropic sector to take on the task. \\"All of us have come to realise in the last several years that the human environment is not only land, water and air, but is also space,\\" said Rusty Schweickart, the Apollo 9 astronaut and chairman emeritus at B612. \\"All of us know today the value of communications satellites, weather satellites, resources satellites, etc. And among them, with our Sentinel mission, will be a satellite that provides public safety in the sense of enabling the prevention of asteroid impacts and devastation in the future.\\" On average, an object about the size of car will enter Earth's atmosphere once a year, producing a spectacular fireball in the sky. About every 2,000 years or so, an object the size of a football field will impact Earth, causing significant local damage. And then, every few million years, a rock turns up that has a girth measured in kilometres. An impact from one of these will produce global effects. Current surveys suggest we have probably found a little over 90% of the true monsters out there, and none look like they will hit us. It is the second category that the foundation's mission will seek to investigate. The vast majority of these rocks await discovery. \\"We've found a bit less than 1% of the objects out that that can do harm,\\" explained Schweickart. Ed Lu, former shuttle astronaut and CEO of the foundation, added: \\"Eventually we will have to deflect an asteroid; we know that. Because essentially, we're playing cosmic roulette. We're flying around the Solar System with these other objects and the laws of probability eventually catch up with you.\\" The Sentinel telescope will lean heavily on hardware that has already been proven on previous Ball designs, such as Nasa's Kepler planet-hunter and its Spitzer infrared space observatory. From its position close to Venus's orbit, it will be able to look out and build maps of the space environment in Earth's neighbourhood. Its infrared detectors will be sensitive to wavelengths of light in the range from five to 10.4 microns. It is in this range that the asteroids will glow brightly. During the 5.5-year mission, the telescope would expect to catalogue 500,000 new asteroids, including more than 90% of those large enough to cause a 100 megaton impact should they strike Earth (in other words, objects that are 140m wide or larger). But the Sentinel would also expect to find about 50% of the rocks down to a diameter of 30m - the sort of object that in 1908 laid waste to a vast swathe of forest at Tunguska in Siberia. The hope would be that the data returned by the telescope would allow the orbits of all these asteroids to be determined for about the next 100 years. We would then have sufficient time to develop a mitigation strategy if any of the objects are considered to have a high probability of hitting our planet. A launch for the Sentinel telescope is being targeted for 2017 or 2018. The group hopes to use the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, which recently made history by sending the first privately developed cargo ship to the International Space Station. Nasa has a direct involvement by allowing its antenna network to be used to receive all of the Sentinel's data, but the US space agency will not be funding any part of the venture. That will require donations. The foundation says the project would cost no more than setting up a museum, an opera theatre, or academic building - all of which succeed in attracting the support of private benefactors. \\"There's a long tradition of funding large telescopes philanthropically,\\" Lu told BBC News. \\"If you look at the major telescopes put up over the past 100 years, they are dominated by privately funded endeavours - the Keck telescope, the Lick Observatory, Mount Palomar. \\"The difference is that our telescope is not going to be sitting on a mountaintop but will be orbiting the Sun.\\" B612 takes its name from the asteroid home of the Little Prince in the children's short novel Le Petit Prince written by Antoine de Saint-Exupery. The foundation has no formal connection with Planetary Resources, the American company which in April announced its intention to spearhead a robotic asteroid mining industry.","completion":"A group called the B612 Foundation wants to put a special telescope called Sentinel in space to find and watch big rocks near Earth that could be dangerous. They are asking people from all over the world for a lot of money to make this project happen. Some people in the group have been astronauts, and important people from NASA. They have been trying to help people know about the dangers in space for almost 10 years. They have also been thinking of ways to move a huge rock in space if it comes too close to Earth, but first they need to know where the dangerous rocks are. A telescope like Sentinel can help us see space better and find these big rocks. The rocks we are worried about are the ones that are the size of a football field, because they can cause a lot of damage. Right now, we only know of less than 1% of these rocks in space. If Sentinel is put in space, it will help us find 50% of the dangerous rocks that could come close to Earth. This telescope will work kind of like other telescopes that were made by Ball Aerospace and NASA. The goal is to put Sentinel in space in a few years, maybe in 2017 or 2018. For this project, they want to use a rocket made by SpaceX. NASA will help with some things, but they will not give any money for the project. Instead, the extra money will come from people that want to help.

Becoming a rock singer requires more vocal control than singing karaoke in a bar. You need to learn how to control the pitch and tone of your voice. Sing from the stomach instead of the throat. Singing from the throat is like a speaker without a box. You don´t get the fullness of the sound. It will sound squeaky when you try to hit some good notes, especially the high ones. So, mainly use the throat as a conduit. Work on hitting high notes. Diaphragm pressure is the key to creating the heavier vocals used by rock singers. Your diaphragm controls the air that goes through your vocal chords. Some pressure in your diaphragm can push just enough air through your vocal chords to get that heavy grit out. Practice changing the pitch. Experiment with opening and closing your throat, lips, and teeth to see how much control you have over the sound. Closing your throat can add harshness or grit, while opening it can increase volume and improve timbre. Lips and teeth affect not only the character (what phonics you make) but also how the vibration of your vocal chords is translated into the air around you. As you become more controlled and proficient in using your voice, try to expand your musical vocabulary by learning about the basics of music and singing. Vocal warm-ups, scales, intervals, and timbre are all helpful things to familiarize yourself with but remember the first rule of rock: do it your way. Choose your style of rock. Abandon musical lyricism, tone, and articulation. Rock singing should be rather ambiguous in rhythm, lyrics, and pitch. That is the essence of hard rock. Don't try to learn from a cd or machine. Get a great teacher. Many professional rock singers have done so. A voice coach will help you develop your voice and can give you tips in how to protect your voice. Rock has a vast array of voice styles and methods. An experienced coach can appropriately assess your improvement. A coach will help you improve your vocal range. There are no shortcuts. It takes a long time to learn to sing well. You might have natural talent, but that will take you only so far. You have to have a solid technique to have a stable career. That is why there are so many \\"flash in the pan\\" performers. They have no technique, and their voices crash and burn quickly. You do have to be able to hold enough breath to push a note loud enough for a microphone or audience to hear it. Focusing on core exercises such as abdominal, chest, and back muscles will help you tighten your core in order to focus on your breath. Cardio exercise such as biking, jogging, jump rope, and even brisk walking can improve the amount of breath you have for holding notes and can also help a lot if you're an active singer who does a lot of jumping around or headbanging while singing. Take care of your voice. While some singers can smoke and drink and sound like rock stars, that approach might not work for you. It's important to know the limitations of your own voice because nothing is worse than running your voice ragged before your band finishes its first set. Everybody has a different vocal range, but most male singers fall into the categories of either bass, baritone or tenor, while most females have either a contralto, mezzo soprano or soprano vocal range. Some people have ranges that extend further than these categories. Learning your vocal range is very important because you need to know your limits. Learn how to scream. Develop a screaming-yelling style to your singing voice. Most rock singers do not utilize the same technique as pop stars do: instead of smooth transitions and mild sounds, they go for the more scream-like voice, making it sound more passionate. Try yelling parts of any rock lyrics without utilizing vocal notes and then replicating that feeling while singing.","completion":"Becoming a rock singer involves mastering vocal control, utilizing diaphragm pressure, expanding musical knowledge, selecting a style, working with a voice coach, improving vocal range, maintaining vocal health, and developing a passionate, screaming-yelling technique."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Where does the young model begin a relationship with a literary interviewer?, using the article: Diana Scott is a beautiful, bored young model married to Tony Bridges. One day, Diana meets Robert Gold, a literary interviewer/director for television arts programmes, by chance when she is spotted on the street by his roving film crew and interviewed by him about young people's views on convention. Diana is invited to watch the final edit in the TV studio and there their relationship starts. After liaisons in bleak hotel rooms they leave their spouses (and, in Robert's case, children) and move into an apartment. As a couple, they become part of the fashionable London media/arts set. Initially, Diana is jealous when Robert sees his wife while visiting his children, but she quickly loses this attachment when she mixes with the predatory males of the media, arts and advertising scene, particularly Miles Brand, a powerful advertising executive for the \\"Glass Corporation\\" who gets her a part in a trashy thriller after she has sex with him. The bookish Robert prefers the quiet life; it is he who now becomes jealous, but increasingly detached, depressed and lonely. Diana attends a high-class charity draw for world hunger for which she is the face. The event, adorned by giant images of African famine victims, is at the height of cynical hypocrisy and bad taste, showing Diana's rich white set, which now includes the establishment, playing at concern, gorging themselves, gambling and generally behaving decadently. Already showing signs of stress from constantly maintaining the carefree look demanded by the false, empty lifestyle to which she has become a prisoner, Diana becomes pregnant, and has an abortion., what would be the answer ?

Nicholette R Lawrence, 32, from Waukegan, Illinois, told police she had struck her daughter in the stomach. The young girl was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead. Lake County Coroner's office said that an autopsy determined the cause of death to be a torn stomach as a result of blunt force trauma, Fox 32 News reports. According to police, Lawrence has two other children, who also lived in the home, but there have been no allegations of abuse towards them. These children have been placed with relatives. Lawrence was charged with first-degree murder and is held at the Lake County Jail on 5 million bond. She is next due to appear in court on September 30. According to ABC News, neighbors said Raasania rarely came outside the home.

As long as i have been in school i never got the chance to use the computer during class to help me learn the material that is being taught . It was always a lecture and taking notes the comuter was not an option for me as a student . What may happen to the teacher after this integration ?","completion":"After integrating technology into their classroom, the teacher may experience several positive changes and face a few challenges as well. Here are some possible outcomes: 1. Enhanced teaching methods: Integrating technology into the classroom can significantly improve the way a teacher delivers their lesson. They might use multimedia presentations, interactive tools, or curated online resources, among other things, to engage students and make learning more dynamic. This, in turn, can lead to more student participation, better understanding, and improved retention. 2. More efficient assessment and tracking: With the use of digital tools, teachers can assess students' progress more easily and quickly, facilitating timely interventions. Online assessment tools, learning management systems (LMS), and data analysis software can help teachers analyze their students' performance, identify strengths and weaknesses, and adapt their teaching strategies accordingly. 3. Access to innovative teaching resources: After integrating technology into their classroom, the teacher will have access to a wider variety of teaching resources and materials. This could include instructional videos, interactive simulations, online reference materials, and more. These resources can help the teacher introduce new concepts, provide context, or supplement their lessons, resulting in a more engaging educational experience for the students. 4. Personalized learning: Using technology, the teacher can create individualized learning experiences for their students, allowing them to work at their own pace and focus on areas where they need the most improvement. Tools like adaptive learning platforms and digital resources can help teachers facilitate personalized learning by adjusting content, assessments, and remediation based on each student's unique needs and learning progress. 5. Improved communication and collaboration: Technology can help teachers improve communication and collaboration with their students, parents, and fellow educators. For example, cloud-based platforms and communication apps can facilitate real-time feedback, encourage teamwork, and keep parents informed about their child's progress in school. However, integrating technology into the classroom may also present some challenges and potential issues for the teacher: 1. Technical difficulties and the learning curve: The teacher may encounter initial challenges related to setting up, maintaining, and troubleshooting the technological infrastructure. They may also need to invest time and effort in learning how to utilize new tools and platforms effectively. This may require working closely with the technology department at their school or seeking professional development opportunities to enhance their digital skills. 2. Adjusting teaching style: The teacher may need to modify their teaching style to accommodate technology in the classroom. This could mean moving from a traditional lecture-based approach to a more interactive, hands-on learning environment where students actively engage with digital content and tools. This transition can be challenging for some teachers who may have been trained in or have been using a more conventional approach to teaching. 3. Ensuring digital equity: One potential issue that the teacher might face is the digital divide or ensuring that all students have equal access to the technology they need to fully participate in the classroom. The teacher may need to address disparities in students' access to devices, internet connectivity, and digital literacy to promote a fair and inclusive learning experience. 4. Online safety and ethical concerns: The teacher must also ensure the responsible use of technology by reinforcing digital citizenship concepts and protecting students from potential online risks such as cyberbullying, privacy breaches, and inappropriate content. This may involve establishing clear guidelines and monitoring students' online activities during class. In conclusion, after integrating technology into their classroom, the teacher may experience enhancements in their teaching methods, more efficient assessment and tracking practices, access to innovative teaching resources, and improvements in communication and collaboration. However, they must also address the challenges associated with technology integration, such as potential technical difficulties, the need to adjust their teaching style, ensuring digital equity, and promoting online safety and responsible use."},{"prompt":"Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Ribosomes are cellular substructures where proteins are synthesized. They contain about 65% rRNA and 35% protein, held together by numerous noncovalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, in an overall structure consisting of two globular particles of unequal size. Molecules of tRNA, which bring amino acids (one at a time) to the ribosomes for the construction of proteins, differ from one another in the kinds of amino acid each is specifically designed to carry. A set of three nucleotides, known as a codon, on the mRNA determines which kind of tRNA will add its amino acid to the growing chain. (For more information on sequences, see Section 19.4 \\"Protein Synthesis and the Genetic Code\\". ) Each of the 20 amino acids found in proteins has at least one corresponding kind of tRNA, and most amino acids have more than one. The two-dimensional structure of a tRNA molecule has three distinctive loops, reminiscent of a cloverleaf (Figure 19.11 \\"Transfer RNA\\"). On one loop is a sequence of three nucleotides that varies for each kind of tRNA. This triplet, called the anticodon, is complementary to and pairs with the codon on the mRNA. At the opposite end of the molecule is the acceptor stem, where the amino acid is attached. Figure 19.11 Transfer RNA Saylor URL: http://www. saylor. org/books.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Moya Greene said that competitors were \\"cherry-picking\\" Royal Mail's most profitable business. She says that makes the universal service uneconomic. Business secretary Vince Cable said there was no threat. The universal service means Royal Mail has to deliver across the UK, six days a week, and all for the same price. Competitors such as Whistl and UK Mail are under no such obligation. \\"If you allow cherry-picking in the urban areas, it syphons off a lot of revenue,\\" Moya Greene told MPs on the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee. \\"It makes the universal service unfinanceable and uneconomic,\\" she claimed. But Vince Cable, the business secretary, said that Royal Mail was guilty of \\"scaremongering\\". He said both houses of parliament would have to vote to change the law to get rid of the universal service. \\"There's absolutely no question of that change,\\" he told the BBC. Some of the Royal Mail's competitors denied that they were stealing the profitable part of the business. Guy Buswell, the chief executive of rival UK Mail, said all 15m items they handle a day are delivered by Royal Mail. \\"It all ends up in the postman's sack, so effectively there is no cherry-picking whatsoever,\\" he told MPs. UK Mail collects its own mail, but uses Royal Mail to deliver to individual addresses, paying an access fee for the privilege. But competitors given a licence can also carry out their own deliveries as well, a process known as end-to-end competition. Whistl, formerly known as TNT Post, has been making deliveries in urban areas like London and Manchester since 2012, but relies on Royal Mail to deliver in rural areas, where costs are higher. \\"We pay Royal Mail a fair and reflective price to cover the rural areas, which takes out any opportunity for cherry-picking,\\" said Nick Wells, the chief executive of Whistl. Ms Green told MPs that the universal service cost Â£7.2bn a year to finance, so needed cross-subsidy from profitable urban deliveries. She said Royal Mail had already seen a \\"structural\\" decline of between 4% and 6% in the volume of letters it handles every year. Mr Wells said it was that structural decline - rather than unfair competition - which was hurting Royal Mail. Ms Greene called for the regulator, Ofcom, to bring forward a review of the universal service, which it is planning for next year. \\"We need to accelerate that review,\\" she said. \\"Don't wait.\\" The government has guaranteed that the universal service will continue at least until 2021. Delivering a letter to the further flung parts of the Britannic realm costs the Royal Mail a lot more if it has to go by air or ferry, and then up long farm tracks. So it's clear who would lose out if Royal Mail is allowed to drop its Universal Service Obligation. Small businesses, in particular, depend on equalised postage costs if they are to compete for custom, and they are vital to the survival of many rural communities. While Royal Mail has opened up a campaign to remove its own competitive disadvantage, it will meet political obstacles. One of the arguments made against Scottish independence earlier this year was that postal costs would go up if there was no cross-subsidy from England's big cities. And if Scotland stayed in the union, it was argued the obligation for a UK-wide delivery service, at the same prices, would remain. Westminster ministers will want to stick to that assurance, or face accusations of betrayal from the Scottish government. Meanwhile, the price of delivering parcels to online shoppers in the sparsely-populated parts of Britain is already a bone of contention. Ministers at Holyrood have urged a set of principles on retailers to ensure that rural customers don't face discrimination, unfair charges or nasty surprises as they're about to pay.","completion":"The head of Royal Mail says that competitors are taking the best business and making it hard for her company to deliver mail to everyone in the UK. But some important people don't think that's a big problem. Royal Mail has a special rule that makes them deliver mail all over the UK, even to far away places, and they have to do it for the same price. Other mail companies don't have that rule, so they can choose where they want to deliver mail. The boss of Royal Mail is worried that because they have to follow this rule and other companies don't, it might make it hard for them to keep going. But the other companies say they're not being unfair and that Royal Mail still gets to deliver a lot of mail. Everyone agrees that if Royal Mail stops delivering mail all over the UK, people in far away places might have a harder time getting their mail, especially if they’re running small businesses."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Trivia question: \\"\\"\\"The Grand Old Duke Of York\\"\\" was whose son?\\" And the answer is?","completion":"\\"The Grand Old Duke of York\\" is an English nursery rhyme that originates from British history. The \\"Grand Old Duke of York\\" tends to refer to Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany. Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, was the second eldest child and second son of King George III. He was born on 16th August 1763 in St. James’s Palace, London and passed away on 5th January 1827. Frederick lived in a turbulent period in British history, witnessing the American War of Independence, the French Revolution, and the Napoleonic Wars. Beyond his military career, Frederick had a political life. He served as the army’s commander-in-chief, and under his leadership, the British army underwent significant reforms that greatly enhanced its strength in subsequent wars. Frederick was a controversial figure of his time. His public life was often marred by allegations of extravagance, incompetence, and scandals. One of the biggest scandals that shook his career was the \\"Mary Anne Clarke affair,\\" where his former mistress accused him of knowingly profiteering from army promotions and postings. Nevertheless, despite the turmoil and controversy surrounding his figure, Prince Frederick is remembered in history and folklore as \\"The Grand Old Duke of York\\". The popular nursery rhyme tells of a duke who marched his troops to the top of a hill and then marched them down again. Although the rhyme itself does not specify which Duke of York it references, it is commonly accepted that it refers to Frederick. His indecisive military pursuits, notably in the Flanders campaigns during the French Revolutionary Wars, were popularized and have since then been immortalized in this nursery rhyme. Therefore, to answer your question, \\"The Grand Old Duke of York,\\" often associated with the nursery rhyme, was the son of King George III of England."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A dark-haired woman (Harring) escapes her own murder, surviving a car accident on Mulholland Drive. Injured and in shock, she descends into Los Angeles and sneaks into an apartment that an older, red-headed woman has just vacated. An aspiring actress named Betty Elms (Watts) arrives at the same apartment and finds the dark-haired woman confused, not knowing her own name. The dark-haired woman assumes the name \\"Rita\\" after seeing a poster for the film Gilda (1946), starring Rita Hayworth. To help Rita remember her identity, Betty looks in Rita's purse, where she finds a large amount of money and an unusual blue key. In what seems to be a scene from a different narrative, set at a diner called Winkies, a man (Patrick Fischler) tells his companion (Michael Cooke) about a nightmare in which he dreamt there was a horrible figure behind the diner. When they investigate, the figure appears, causing the man with the nightmare to collapse in fright. As the principal narrative resumes, Hollywood director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) has his film commandeered by apparent mobsters, who insist he cast an unknown actress named Camilla Rhodes (Melissa George) as the lead in his film. After he resists, he returns home to find his wife having an affair and is thrown out of his house. He later learns that his bank has closed his line of credit and he is broke.

The clock stopped ticking. effect:","completion":"The clock stopping ticking can have numerous and varied effects, depending on the context and the significance of the clock in question. The main consequences of a non-functioning clock can be broadly classified into three categories - functional consequences, emotional consequences, and symbolic consequences. 1. Functional Consequences The most immediate and obvious effect of a stopped clock is its inability to accurately keep and display the time. a) Inaccurate Time: Without a working clock, individuals who rely on it for telling time will be provided with incorrect information, which could lead to missed appointments, disorganization, and overall confusion. b) Misinformed Daily Routines: A stopped clock can cause disruption to people's daily routines and schedules. For example, it can lead to missed meals, delayed work, or difficulties in managing other daily activities where time management is crucial. c) Dependency on Alternate Time-telling Devices: If the stopped clock served as the primary way of telling time, its users would need to switch to alternative devices, such as mobile phones, watches, or other clocks, to maintain their regular schedule and routines. 2. Emotional Consequences A stopped clock can evoke various emotional responses, depending on its importance to the individuals involved. a) Nostalgia: If the clock has been in a family for generations or holds sentimental value, its sudden stoppage may evoke feelings of nostalgia, sadness, or even regret as people are reminded of the stories and memories attached to the clock. b) Frustration: A clock that stops suddenly can lead to feelings of frustration and annoyance, particularly if fixing it may be a daunting task, or its stoppage results in inconvenience or disrupted routines. c) Relief: In some cases, a stopped clock could evoke feelings of relief, especially if it was previously associated with negative experiences, such as strict deadlines or high-pressure environments. 3. Symbolic Consequences Throughout history and across various cultures, clocks have often been utilized as symbols or metaphors to represent deeper meanings. a) Timelessness or Suspension of Time: A stopped clock can represent the concept of time standing still or suspended, signifying a break from the constant passage of time and allowing individuals to reflect upon their lives and the choices they have made. b) Change or Transition: The end of a clock's functionality can symbolize a shift in one's life, heralding significant changes or new beginnings. It could symbolize letting go of the past and embracing a new phase in life. c) Mortality and Life's Impermanence: A stopped clock can also serve as a metaphor for the impermanence of life, reminding individuals of their own mortality and the finite nature of time. This can encourage one to live life more fully, cherishing each moment and making the most of the time they have. In summary, the effect of a clock that has stopped ticking can manifest in many different ways, impacting individuals functionally, emotionally, and symbolically. The diverse consequences of the stopped clock are influenced by the importance placed upon it and its context within the lives of the individuals who depend on it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On the eve of his rematch with Cro Cop, Gonzaga looks back at their shocking first meeting Updated APR 08, 2015 10:14p ET Those of us watching that fight from April 2007 are not likely to ever forget it. Pride star and tournament winner Mirko \\"Cro Cop\\" Filipovic had come to the UFC and was just one fight away from getting a heavyweight title shot against then-champion Randy Couture. All that stood in the way of a big-money world championship fight for the fearsome kickboxer was a main event fight at UFC 70 in Manchester against Brazilian Jiu Jitsu specialist Gabriel Gonzaga. Gonzaga took the fight to his world early and dragged Cro Cop to the ground and battered him there until the referee unfairly stood them up with little time left in the first round. Now, we all thought, the striker would have another crack at Gonzaga. Instead, the Brazilian grappler went high with a head kick, knocked Cro Cop out, cold, and earned the title shot for himself. Obviously, earning a world title shot with a surprise knockout would be huge for anyone. Speaking with us days before he's set to rematch Filipovic this Saturday in Krakow, Gonzaga tells FOX Sports that the win helped him in even more profound ways. \\"That was a really important moment in my life,\\" Gonzaga said. \\"I was trying to make my career as a pro fighter. I had just moved to the United States and was building my life to be a pro fighter. We opened a school and were trying to make a living. That win was real important in getting my name out there and helping us make a life for ourselves in the US.\\" Remembering the moments of the dramatic fight eight years ago, Gonzaga says that he wasn't surprised by the stand-up, which conventional wisdom held would favor his opponent greatly. \\"I expected that would happen, especially because back then people didn't understand the ground game that much,\\" he said. \\"They stood us up with 30 seconds left in the round. I knew it was to make the TV show. They thought they needed to put some action back and they didn't know too much about the ground game back then.\\" Though \\"Napao,\\" as Gonzaga is known, tells us that he'd been training his head kicks for some time by then, he admits that he was as shocked as anyone that the one he threw landed and stopped Cro Cop. \\"Yes, I thought I was going to hit his arm. I thought I could hurt his arm for the next round when he tried to block it,\\" he recalled. \\"Back then, I had thrown high kicks before, but they didn't connect. They were a part of my game, already, but not with big power.\\" After losing his last two fights, the 35-year-old says he is taking his career fight-by-fight. He also doesn't mind facing someone he's already beaten before in the returning Croatian. \\"No, fighting is what I do, so I need to be ready for any fight,\\" he said. \\"It's a normal fight for my career. \\"I'm taking things fight-by-fight now. I've been doing it for over ten years.\\" That said, Gonzaga is still shooting for the top as long as he's still in the game. \\"I will try to stay at the top of the heavyweight division, where I've been for the past 10 years,\\" he said. Staying at the top begins anew with the Cro Cop rematch this weekend in the main event of the UFC Fight Pass card. Gonzaga is confident that he can repeat that huge moment in his career, from so many years ago, for the same reasons he always believes in himself. \\"I try to be a complete fighter,\\" he said. \\"I try to be comfortable wherever we fight, so I think this will make the difference for me.\\" What was this article about?","completion":"This article reflects on the memories of the MMA fighter Gabriel Gonzaga, who recalls his previous match against Mirko \\"Cro Cop\\" Filipovic before their rematch in April 2015. The article revisits the memorable fight from 2007, where Gonzaga, a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu specialist, faced off against the feared kickboxer, Cro Cop. Cro Cop, previously a star of the Pride Fighting Championships, had recently joined the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and was just one victory away from a heavyweight title fight against then-champion Randy Couture. He only needed to defeat Gonzaga in the main event fight at UFC 70 in Manchester to secure his spot. However, Gonzaga managed to shock everyone by using his grappling skills to control the fight on the ground, despite the referee standing them up near the end of the first round, which was supposed to favor Cro Cop's striking abilities. To everyone's surprise, Gonzaga pulled off a head kick knockout move which led to a victory over Cro Cop, securing the title shot for himself. This victory had a profound significance for Gonzaga's career, helping to establish his reputation and further his fighting career in the United States. Over the years, Gonzaga recalls his shock that the head kick he had thrown landed and stopped Cro Cop. He admits that he had been training his head kicks and expected it to hit his arm, not knock him out. Gonzaga, who'd lost his last two fights, mentioned that he'd been taking his career fight by fight. However, he still aspired to be at the top of the heavyweight division. On the eve of their rematch, Gonzaga showed confidence in his ability to defeat Cro Cop again, emphasizing his pursuit to be a well-rounded fighter capable to adapt to any fight situation. He believed that his versatility could be a crucial factor in their upcoming fight."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

After being held without a first down in the third quarter, the Patriots went ahead with a field goal in the fourth quarter, and capped the scoring with Tom Brady connecting with Julian Edelman for a 69-yard TD. San Diego was shut out in the second half. The win gave New England their 12th straight 10-win season, the second-longest such streak in NFL history. The Chargers led 14-3 after scoring twice within 2 minutes, 33 seconds in the second quarter. Floyd made a diving catch for a 15-yard TD, and safety Darrell Stuckey returned a fumble for a 53-yard score. After Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski's second field goal, Brandon Bolden blocked a punt by Scifres, and New England recovered the ball at the San Diego 28. Scifres was carted off the field after injuring his left shoulder on the play. Four plays later, Brady hit Rob Gronkowski on a 14-yard TD pass to trail 14-13. Before halftime, Te'o leaped for his first career interception on a pass intended for Gronkowski, preserving the Chargers' lead. In the third quarter, Devin McCourty returned a Rivers interception for a touchdown, but the play was wiped out by a personal foul on Brandon Browner for San Diego's Ladarius Green in the head. The Chargers' offense crossed midfield just once in the second half, getting as far as the Patriots 42. Their defense held New England to just 35 yards in the third quarter, forcing a three-and-out on four consecutive drives, before Brady engineered the 32nd fourth-quarter comeback of his career. Rivers completed 20 of his 33 passes for 189 yards. He fell to 0-6 against Brady, who was 28-of-44 for 317 yards and two touchdowns with one interception.

Please answer the following question: Information: - The FIS Nordic Combined World Cup is a Nordic combined competition organized yearly by FIS, representing the highest level in international competition for this sport. It was first arranged for the 1983/84 season. Team event was first time held in 1999/00 season. The FIS race director is a Norwegian ex ski jumper and ex world record holder Lasse Ottesen. - The Nordic combined events have been contested at the Winter Olympic Games since 1924. The first competition involved 18 km cross-country skiing, followed by ski jumping. Whoever earned the most points from both competitions won the event. At the 1952 Winter Olympics, the ski jumping was held first, followed by 18 km cross-country skiing. The cross-country skiing portion was reduced to 15 km at the 1956 Winter Olympics. The ski jumping styles would change over the years as well, from the Kongsberger technique after World War I to the Daescher technique in the 1950s to the current V-style from 1985 onwards. The cross-country skiing technique would switch from classical to freestyle for all competitions beginning in 1985, but the biggest change would occur at the 1988 Winter Olympics in the scoring with the Gundersen method, meaning the 15 km cross country portion would go from an interval start race to a pursuit race, so that whoever crossed the finish line first won the event. The team event with a 3 x 10 km cross country relay started at the 1988 Winter Olympics, changing to the current 4 x 5 km cross-country relay at the 1998 Winter Olympics. The 7.5 km sprint event was added at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Nordic combined remains a men's only event as of the 2010 Winter Olympics. For the 2010 Winter Games, the 15 km Individual Gundersen which consisted of 2 jumps from the normal hill followed by 15 km cross country will be replaced by a 10 km individual normal hill event which will consist of one jump from the individual normal hill following by 10 km of cross country using the Gundersen system while the 7.5 km sprint will be replaced by the 10 km individual large hill event. - Nordic combined is a winter sport in which athletes compete in cross-country skiing and ski jumping. Nordic combined at the Winter Olympics and the FIS Nordic Combined World Cup are ongoing. - Ski jumping is a form of Nordic skiing in which athletes descend a specially constructed takeoff ramp (known as the \\"inrun\\"), jump from the end of it (the \\"table\\") with as much power as they can generate, and \\"fly\\" as far as possible down a steeply sloped hill. Points are awarded for distance and style by five judges, with competition sanctioned by the International Ski Federation (FIS). To enable the athletes (who are known as \\"ski jumpers\\") to effectively glide such long distances and land safely, the skis they use are considerably wider and longer than their cross-country and alpine skiing counterparts. Ski jumping is predominantly a winter sport and has been part of the Winter Olympic Games since its inception in 1924 for men and since 2014 for women. Since 1954 it is possible to ski jump in summer on artificial surfaces made from plastic. Along with cross-country skiing, ski jumping is one of two sports which form the Nordic combined discipline. Holmenkollbakken in Oslo is the holy place of this sport, which is most popular in Austria, Germany, Finland, Japan, Norway, Poland and Slovenia. - Tsugiharu Ogiwara ( Ogiwara Tsugiharu ) ( born 20 December 1969 ) is a Japanese nordic combined skier who competed from 1994 to 1998 . He won the 4 x 5 km team event at the 1995 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in Thunder Bay , Ontario . Ogiwara 's best individual finish at the Winter Olympics was 6th at Nagano in 1998 . He had two individual career victories ( 1993 : 15 km individual , 1998 : 7.5 km sprint ) . He is the twin brother of Kenji Ogiwara , a fellow Japanese Nordic combined athlete . - A winter sport or winter activity is a recreational activity or sport which is played during cold weather months. Most such sports are variations of skiing, ice skating and sledding. Traditionally such sports were only played in cold areas during winter, but artificial snow and artificial ice allow more flexibility. Artificial ice can be used to provide ice rinks for ice skating, ice hockey and bandy in a milder climate.

On that day, fathers usually receive greeting gifts and cards. On the cards, children will write, \\"Thanks, father.\\" \\"Best wishes for Father's Day\\" and so on. Father's Day is also a day families get together at home as well as in the restaurants. Where does the idea for the holiday come from? We should thank an American. In 1909 she wrote letters to some important persons. In her letter she advised to make Father's Day on the third Sunday in June. In June in 1910, people celebrated the first Father's Day in Washington. People whose parents are dead often decorated their parents' graves with flowers on these days. These are days of family fun and creating good feelings and memories. Where does the idea for the holiday come from? A) China. B) England. C) America. D) Italy. A:","completion":"The idea for Father's Day comes from C) America. It was initiated by an American woman named Sonora Dodd in 1909. Sonora was inspired by her own father, who raised six children as a single parent after her mother passed away. Touched by her father's strong dedication to his family, she wanted to create a special day to honor and celebrate fathers. In 1909, Sonora started a campaign to establish Father's Day as an official holiday. She wrote letters to numerous influential figures, including politicians, religious leaders, and entrepreneurs, suggesting that the third Sunday in June should be designated as Father's Day. In her letter, she emphasized the importance of recognizing and appreciating the hard work and sacrifices fathers make for their families. Sonora's efforts paid off, and the first Father's Day was celebrated in Washington state on June 19, 1910. The idea quickly gained popularity and support, and by 1924, President Calvin Coolidge recommended the observance of Father's Day nationwide. However, it wasn't until 1966 that President Lyndon B. Johnson officially proclaimed the third Sunday in June to be Father's Day by signing an executive order. In 1972, President Richard Nixon established Father's Day as a permanent national holiday in the United States. Today, Father's Day is celebrated not only in the United States but also in various countries around the world, each with their unique customs and traditions. It remains a day to express gratitude to fathers for their love, care, and commitment to their families. Children show their appreciation by giving gifts, cards, and spending quality time with their fathers, while families often gather for meals, outdoor activities, and other celebrations. Even those who have lost their parents cherish the memories by paying tribute to their fathers with flowers and other gestures of remembrance. To sum up, Father's Day originated in America with the efforts of Sonora Dodd, a woman who wanted to acknowledge the significant role that fathers play in their families' lives. Her determination and persistence led to the establishment of a holiday that now brings families together and creates lasting memories around the world.

City: Cities often allocate budgets and resources to promote local infrastructure projects, park improvements, and other public facilities via grants. These grants can be applied for by community organizations or local authorities to improve the urban landscape and enhance the well-being of the citizens. Furthermore, fountains, as public installations, commonly fall under the jurisdiction of municipal authorities or local community boards. Therefore, it is highly reasonable to assume that the city provided a grant for the construction and renovation of the big fountain centerpiece as part of a revitalization effort. 2. State: While it is possible that the state might supply grants for public projects, funding for smaller-scale infrastructure such as fountains is typically managed at the city or municipal level. State funding is more likely to be allocated for larger projects, such as highways, bridges, and public transportation systems, which have a broader impact on the state's overall development. Consequently, it is less probable that the state would directly fund a project like a fountain renovation in comparison to city funding. 3. Front of Casino: Funding for a public infrastructure project like a fountain is less likely to come directly from private establishments like a casino. While a casino might contribute to taxes and local revenues that could indirectly support public projects, it is unlikely that a private corporation would be the primary source of a grant solely focused on a public fountain renovation. Instead, it would be the city's responsibility to manage the grant and allocate funds to such projects. 4. Rome: As a city in a different country, Rome is an unlikely source of funding for a project like a fountain renovation outside its local jurisdiction. Grants or funding provided by a foreign city would typically be reserved for larger-scale initiatives or international partnerships aimed at strengthening diplomatic or collaborative ties between countries. Therefore, Rome is an improbable source of financial support for a local or city-based fountain project. 5. Public Place: Although fountains are often situated in public places, this option does not directly point to the source of funding or the grant provider. Instead, it describes a location or a type of space where the fountain will be installed. Therefore, this option does not appropriately answer the question of who financed the fountain renovation project. In conclusion, the most suitable answer for the source of a grant funding the renovation and installation of a big fountain centerpiece would be the \\"city.\\" A city's primary interest in enhancing the lives of its citizens through the improvement of public spaces and infrastructure makes it the most likely party to fund such a project. The other options provided are either too large-scale or irrelevant as grant providers, solidifying the \\"city\\" as the most probable correct choice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Florida Congressman Defies Critics on Rail Project Todd Anderson for The New York Times A rail line through Orlando, Fla., would be used for the SunRail commuter train championed by Representative John L. Mica. ORLANDO, Fla. — Here in sun-parched Central Florida, workers are ready to break ground this summer for a 61-mile commuter rail project that the federal government ranks as one of the least cost-effective mass transit efforts in the nation. With a price tag of 1.2 billion at completion, the rail line is expected to serve just 2,150 commuters a day when it starts operating in three years. It will not link to the Orlando airport or Disney World, among the region’s biggest traffic generators. Florida’s governor is even considering killing the project, worried that local government officials will rebel if they have to cover any shortfalls at the fare box. But the so-called SunRail project has survived, at least so far, a testament to the ability of one congressman to help push through hundreds of millions of dollars in federal spending, even at a time of deep concern over ballooning federal deficits. Representative John L. Mica, a Florida Republican and chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, has spent years badgering federal agencies, bullying state officials, blocking Amtrak naysayers and trying to bypass federal restrictions to build support and squash opposition to the commuter line. While Congress is often stalled or bitterly divided in dealing with some of the biggest issues facing the nation, its members are often remarkably successful in promoting industries or more parochial concerns. Mr. Mica’s championing of the SunRail project has won praise among many officials and business leaders here, who say it is vital to the future of the traffic-clogged region. But skeptics question whether Mr. Mica’s real goal is to give a taxpayer-financed gift to CSX, the freight rail giant and a generous Mica campaign donor, which would get 432 million for its tracks and for upgrades to tracks it owns elsewhere in the state. Other Florida businesses close to Mr. Mica also stand to benefit if the project is built. “His dedication to SunRail is not for mass transit — it is for helping CSX to get government funds for its private freight lines,” said State Senator Paula Dockery, a Republican and a chief critic of the project. The congressman is unapologetic about SunRail. “Everybody has different vested interests,” Mr. Mica said in an interview. “But you look at what is being proposed on paper, and it just make sense.” Mr. Mica first proposed the commuter system in 1992 after he won his first race for the House after a career that included stints as a real estate developer, a lobbyist and chief of staff to Senator Paula Hawkins, Republican of Florida. The CSX track, which for decades has also been used by Amtrak, already connects a string of communities north and south of Orlando. Commuter rail, Mr. Mica argued, could carry many more passengers and be far less costly than adding a single lane to an Interstate highway. “For as long as I have been in Congress, Central Florida has been sending its mass transit money to New York, Philadelphia, Chicago and now to other cities — that is where our gas tax dollars have gone,” he said. But getting even a small fraction of the 2.3 million people living along the rail corridor to ride trains may be difficult, state officials acknowledge. Separating drivers from their cars would be like forcing Mickey and Minnie Mouse to divorce. The federal government, wary of financing boondoggle projects, has strict rules on how ridership projections are calculated. Florida’s Department of Transportation, mindful of Mr. Mica’s keen interest, looked for ways to push up the number of projected riders, efforts that federal regulators found dubious. Florida officials, for example, assumed that large numbers of commuters heading from one point in the suburbs to another would be willing to undertake a bus-to-rail-to-bus trip, a travel pattern that federal officials told them “cannot be found on any existing commuter rail service in the United States.” Mr. Mica describes himself as a fiscal conservative, arguing that “all taxpayer-funded infrastructure projects must be wise investments.” But he has pulled strings in Washington to get special consideration for the project. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"1.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How to wash clothes","completion":"To wash clothes, a better solution is to use a washing machine. Let me explain in a way a five-year-old can understand: A washing machine is like a big, round tub. You put your dirty clothes inside it. Then you add some soap, that's called \\"detergent.\\" The detergent helps to clean the clothes. You will also need to choose some buttons or dials to tell the washing machine how to wash your clothes. Once everything is set, you close the lid or door and press the \\"start\\" button. The washing machine then fills with water, and the inside starts to spin and mix the clothes, soap, and water all together. This spinning and mixing helps to scrub the dirt off of your clothes. After a little while, the washing machine drains the dirty water and then fills with clean water to rinse the clothes. It spins again to get the soap out. Finally, the washing machine drains the water one last time and then spins very fast to help dry the clothes. After the washing machine stops spinning, you can take out your nice, clean clothes and hang them up to dry completely or put them in a dryer to get them dry even faster. Using a washing machine is a better solution because it does most of the work for you, it cleans the clothes well, and it's easier than washing clothes by hand."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

How to calculate business liability insurance needs Identify potential risks. You should spend some time thinking about the risks your business is exposed to. For example, damage by fire, flooding, or theft are obvious risks. Pick from: 1). If they are, then your business might suffer damage. Before the business is sued, you should consider the following: well-rounded partners (money to help cover the costs of taxes, managed accounts and tax returns).; 2). However, they may still be top risk but not a complete risk. For example, if you've owned property that caters to many businesses and sells professional grooming products, your business could incur increases.; 3). However, your business might also face other risks : You might harm consumers. For example, your business might harm people physically (if you create products) or it may harm their reputations (if you publish information).; 4). However, when a business is exposed to undue stress and thus receives more expensive business insurance, they may or may not assume that the risk is dangerous. You should investigate your business's reputation before you decide to attempt to file a lawsuit in small claims court.;","completion":"Calculating Business Liability Insurance Needs 1. Identifying potential risks The first step to calculating your business liability insurance needs is to identify the potential risks your business faces. These can vary widely depending on your industry and specific operations. Some common risks include: - Property damage, such as fire, flooding, or theft. - Professional liability, which covers claims related to errors or omissions in your services. - Product liability, which protects against injuries or damages resulting from the use of your products. - Workers' compensation, which covers employee injuries and illnesses that occur while on the job. - Cyber liability, which addresses data breaches and other technology-related risks. - General liability, which covers third-party injuries and property damage that occur on your business premises or as a result of your operations. 2. Analyzing the extent of the risks Once you have determined the risks your business faces, you must analyze to what extent these risks can affect your operations. This will involve looking at the potential financial impact of each risk, such as the cost to replace damaged property, settle legal claims, or recover from a data breach. When looking at professional and product liability risks, it's important to consider both the severity and frequency of potential claims. For example, a medical device manufacturer may face a higher risk of large, costly lawsuits than a graphic design firm. 3. Evaluating your business's risk tolerance As a business owner, you will need to make decisions on how much risk your business can tolerate. This will depend on your financial resources, business reputation, and industry expectations. The key is to strike a balance between ensuring sufficient protection and avoiding excessive insurance premiums that could unnecessarily strain your budget. 4. Calculating your insurance needs Based on your risk assessment and tolerance levels, you can then determine the amount of liability insurance coverage your business requires. Start by reviewing industry standards and benchmarks to get an idea of the typical insurance coverage amounts for businesses in your sector. Next, consider any legal or regulatory requirements that may mandate specific insurance coverage, such as workers' compensation laws or professional licensing requirements. Make sure to account for these in your calculation. 5. Consulting with an insurance professional To ensure you have adequately assessed your insurance needs, it is advisable to consult with an experienced insurance professional who can guide you through the process and offer tailored advice for your unique business situation. They can also help you identify any additional insurance products, such as employment practices liability or commercial auto insurance, that may be necessary for your business. 6. Regularly reviewing and updating your coverage It is essential to periodically reevaluate your insurance needs as your business grows and evolves. Changes in your business, such as adding new services, expanding to new locations, or increasing your staff, may affect your liability exposures and require updates to your insurance coverage. By conducting regular reviews and working with your insurance professional, you can ensure that your business remains adequately protected over time. In conclusion, by identifying potential risks, analyzing their impact, evaluating your risk tolerance, calculating your insurance needs, consulting with an insurance professional, and regularly reviewing your coverage, you can effectively calculate your business liability insurance needs and protect your business from unforeseen events."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

De asemenea, sunt convins că relațiile Uniunii Europene cu Insulele Solomon, regiune în care marea este plină de ton, reprezintă un interes economic considerabil. Translate to English English:","completion":"Additionally, I am convinced that the relations between the European Union and the Solomon Islands, a region where the sea is full of tuna, represent a significant economic interest. The European Union (EU) has always been keen on establishing strong and mutually beneficial relationships with countries in various parts of the world, emphasizing on economic cooperation, trade opportunities, and development support. The Solomon Islands, located in the South Pacific and known for its vast marine wealth and abundant tuna resources, has inevitably become an area of economic interest for the EU. In recent years, the EU and the Solomon Islands have worked diligently to strengthen their ties with a focus on enhancing economic, political, and social cooperation. This partnership, grounded in shared values regarding human rights, democracy, and sustainable development, aims to yield significant benefits for both parties involved. One of the most notable aspects of the EU-Solomon Islands relationship lies in the fishing industry. The vast sea surrounding the Solomon Islands is teeming with tuna, which is a valuable commodity in the global market. As a result, a vital component of this partnership is the fisheries agreements, focusing on sustainable management of these resources. Through the agreements, the EU provides financial and technical assistance to the Solomon Islands to support their fisheries sector. This aid helps in improving the quality of the fisheries, promoting the sustainable use of marine resources, and contributing to the local economy's growth. In return, the EU receives access to the Solomon Islands' Exclusive Economic Zone, where European vessels can fish within specific quotas and rules. Such arrangements ensure that the tuna resources are managed sustainably, allowing both parties to benefit in the long term. Apart from the fisheries sector, the EU and the Solomon Islands also collaborate in several other areas, including climate change, education, and rural development. The EU offers support in addressing these challenges through various programs and initiatives, leveraging its experience and expertise to assist the Solomon Islands in achieving its developmental goals. For instance, the EU has supported the Solomon Islands in implementing climate change adaptation and mitigation measures, given the country's vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. They are also invested in improving the quality and access to education, particularly for children in remote communities. Additionally, the EU supports rural development projects that can contribute to reducing poverty and improving the living conditions of the island's population. In conclusion, the relations between the European Union and the Solomon Islands hold a significant economic interest for both parties. The collaboration, particularly in the fishing industry, with its focus on sustainable development, offers numerous benefits in terms of trade, growth, and prosperity. By working together on various issues, including climate change, education, and rural development, the EU and Solomon Islands partnership grows stronger and proves an essential factor in the development of both regions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Thor Heyerdahl (Norwegian pronunciation: [tu:r 'haei@da:l]; October 6, 1914 - April 18, 2002) was a Norwegian adventurer and ethnographer with a background in zoology, botany, and geography. He became notable for his Kon-Tiki expedition in 1947, in which he sailed 8,000 km (5,000 mi) across the Pacific Ocean in a hand-built raft from South America to the Tuamotu Islands. The expedition was designed to demonstrate that ancient people could have made long sea voyages, creating contacts between separate cultures. This was linked to a diffusionist model of cultural development. In 1947, Heyerdahl and five fellow adventurers sailed from Peru to the Tuamotu Islands, French Polynesia in a pae-pae raft that they had constructed from balsa wood and other native materials, christened the Kon-Tiki. The Kon-Tiki expedition was inspired by old reports and drawings made by the Spanish Conquistadors of Inca rafts, and by native legends and archaeological evidence suggesting contact between South America and Polynesia. The Kon-Tiki smashed into the reef at Raroia in the Tuamotus on August 7, 1947, after a 101-day, 4,300-nautical-mile (5,000-mile or 8,000 km) journey across the Pacific Ocean. Heyerdahl had nearly drowned at least twice in childhood and did not take easily to water; he said later that there were times in each of his raft voyages when he feared for his life. Kon-Tiki demonstrated that it was possible for a primitive raft to sail the Pacific with relative ease and safety, especially to the west (with the trade winds). The raft proved to be highly manoeuvrable, and fish congregated between the nine balsa logs in such numbers that ancient sailors could have possibly relied on fish for hydration in the absence of other sources of fresh water. Other rafts have repeated the voyage, inspired by Kon-Tiki. Heyerdahl's book about The Kon-Tiki Expedition: By Raft Across the South Seas has been translated into 70 languages. The documentary film of the expedition entitled Kon-Tiki won an Academy Award in 1951. A dramatised version was released in 2012, also called Kon-Tiki, and was nominated for both the Best Foreign Language Oscar at the 85th Academy Awards and a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 70th Golden Globe Awards. It was the first time that a Norwegian film was nominated for both an Oscar and a Golden Globe. Anthropologists continue to believe that Polynesia was settled from west to east, based on linguistic, physical, and genetic evidence, migration having begun from the Asian mainland. There are controversial indications, though, of some sort of South American/Polynesian contact, most notably in the fact that the South American sweet potato is served as a dietary staple throughout much of Polynesia. Blood samples taken in 1971 and 2008 from Easter Islanders without any European or other external descent were analysed in a 2011 study, which concluded that the evidence supported some aspects of Heyerdahl's hypothesis. This result has been questioned because of the possibility of contamination by South Americans after European contact with the islands. However, more recent DNA work (after Heyerdahl's death) contradicts the post-European-contact contamination hypothesis, finding the South American DNA sequences to be far older than that. Heyerdahl had attempted to counter the linguistic argument with the analogy that he would prefer to believe that African-Americans came from Africa, judging from their skin colour, and not from England, judging from their speech.","completion":"This text is about Thor Heyerdahl, a Norwegian adventurer and ethnographer who had a background in zoology, botany, and geography.

Please answer the following question: What archipelago has the highest sea cliffs in the United Kingdom. Answer the above question based on the context below: St Kilda (Scottish Gaelic: Hiort) is an isolated archipelago situated 64 kilometres (40 mi) west-northwest of North Uist, in the North Atlantic Ocean. It contains the westernmost islands of the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. The largest island is Hirta, whose sea cliffs are the highest in the United Kingdom. Three other islands (Dùn, Soay and Boreray) were also used for grazing and seabird hunting. The islands are administratively a part of the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar local authority area.The origin of the name St Kilda is a matter of conjecture. The islands' human heritage includes numerous unique architectural features from the historic and prehistoric periods, although the earliest written records of island life date from the Late Middle Ages. The medieval village on Hirta was rebuilt in the 19th century, but illnesses brought by increased external contacts through tourism, and the upheaval of the First World War contributed to the island's evacuation in 1930. The story of St Kilda has attracted artistic interpretations, including Michael Powell's film The Edge of the World and an opera.Permanent habitation on the islands possibly extends back at least two millennia, the population probably never exceeding 180 (and certainly no more than 100 after 1851). The entire remaining population was evacuated from Hirta (the only inhabited island) in 1930. The islands house a unique form of stone structure known as cleitean. A cleit is a stone storage hut or bothy; whilst many are still to be found, they are slowly falling into disrepair. There are known to be 1,260 cleitean on Hirta and a further 170 on the other group islands. Currently, the only year-round residents are military personnel; a variety of conservation workers, volunteers and scientists spend time there in the summer months.The entire archipelago is owned by the National Trust for Scotland. It became one of Scotland's six World Heritage Sites in 1986, and is one of the few in the world to hold mixed status for both its natural and cultural qualities....

The tree had been there for many years, and it was a tough decision to make, but the safety of his family and home came first. Before proceeding with the task, Mark took several steps to ensure a smooth and safe process. Step 1: Research and Planning First, Mark researched the proper techniques to cut down a tree, especially one as large as the oak in his yard. He also considered the direction in which the tree would fall, taking into account nearby structures, power lines, and obstacles that could be affected. Step 2: Gather Materials and Equipment Mark gathered the necessary tools and equipment, which included a chainsaw, safety goggles, ear protection, gloves, a ladder, and rope. He also checked their condition to ensure they were in good working order and safe to use. Step 3: Obtain Permits and Inform Neighbors Mark contacted his local government to check if any permits were required for tree removal. Additionally, he informed his neighbors of his plan to cut down the tree to ensure they were aware and would be prepared for any disruptions during the process. Step 4: Assess the Weather Before beginning, Mark checked the weather forecast for the day. It was crucial that there be no rain, strong winds, or other severe weather conditions that could make the task more dangerous or complicated. Step 5: Clear the Area Mark cleared the area surrounding the tree, removing any objects or obstacles that could potentially impede the tree's fall or pose a risk during the cutting process. This provided a safer environment for the task at hand. Step 6: Make the Initial Cut Following the proper techniques he had researched, Mark made an initial cut at the base of the oak tree, angling the chainsaw to control the direction of the fall. This angled cut on the side of the tree would help ensure it fell in the desired direction. Step 7: Make the Felling Cut On the opposite side of the initial cut, Mark made another cut, called the felling cut, leaving a hinge of wood to help guide the tree during its fall. As he cut the felling cut, he made sure to continue observing the location and possible hazards. Step 8: Secure the Tree with Ropes Mark attached ropes to the top part of the tree, securing them to nearby supports. This way, as the tree fell, the ropes could help control its descent and avoid causing damage to the surrounding area. Step 9: Cut the Hinge and Fell the Tree Once everything was in place and secure, Mark finally cut through the hinge, causing the massive oak tree to fall slowly in the direction he had planned. Step 10: Dispose of the Tree and Clean Up Lastly, Mark cut the fallen tree into smaller, manageable pieces and disposed of them properly in accordance with local regulations. He also cleaned up the workspace, leaving his yard neat and free of debris. Mark's meticulous planning, preparation, and execution ensured the safe and successful removal of the oak tree, protecting his home from potential damage and preserving the well-being of his family."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They called it camp A. Then they rose to the height of three miles. They called it camp B. Eventually, they reached six miles above ground. They called it camp C. and a hint : As shown here, pressure decreases to less than 25% of ground-level atmospheric pressure when we get to an altitude of about six miles. Since this is a common cruising altitude for commercial airplanes, pressurized cabins are needed for the comfort and survival of the passengers. This is because the density of the air decreases along with the decreasing air pressure, so there is less oxygen in a breath of air. You've probably noticed this effect in high-mountain areas, as it often feels harder to breath. Please answer this question : Where the air would be denser, camp A or camp B?

Undergo relaxation therapy.\\"","completion":"Title: Finding Relief from Breast Pain: A Comprehensive Approach Introduction: Experiencing physical discomfort in any regard can be stressful. People may find breast pain particularly worrying due to the intimacy of the organ and its potential association with diseases such as breast cancer. While it is always crucial to get expert advice whenever a new pain appears, plenty of options exist to manage breast pain, specifically Mastalgia, that does not relate to any severe condition. Such options range from seeing your doctor to adjusting medications, and even relaxation therapy. This article will delve into these steps and provide more information about each one. Step 1: Seeing Your Doctor: Nothing is more reassuring than professional advice when it comes to health issues. If you are suffering from breast pain, the first step should be to schedule an appointment with your doctor. They will conduct all necessary assessments and recommend an appropriate course of action, based on factors like age, health status, and the severity and duration of the pain. This can also help rule out the risk of any serious underlying conditions such as breast cancer. Step 2: Using Topical Anti-Inflammatory cream: Topical anti-inflammatory creams can be a valuable tool in alleviating localised pain and swelling. These can be purchased over-the-counter, or your doctor might suggest a specific one. The rationale behind using topical creams is they tend to have fewer systemic side effects than oral medications. They work by reducing inflammation in the affected area, leading to a decrease in pain. Step 3: Adjust your Birth Control Pills: Hormonal contraception, like birth control pills, can sometimes contribute to breast pain. This is due to the hormonal fluctuations they cause. If you notice a pattern between your contraceptive use and your breast pain, discussing these observations with your doctor may lead to a change in your birth control method or its dosage. There is a wide selection of contraceptive methods available, and your doctor can help you find one that fits your needs and minimizes discomfort. Step 4: Reducing Hormone Therapy Medications: For women undergoing hormone therapy, especially postmenopausal women, adjusting the regimen can sometimes mitigate breast pain. Hormones like estrogen can make the breasts feel tender and lumpy. For example, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), that artificially increases estrogen levels, can lead to breast pain. If you're undergoing such therapy and experiencing discomfort, your doctor may consider reducing the dosage or switching to a different type of hormone therapy. Step 5: Considering Prescription Medication: In some cases, certain drugs like Tamoxifen and Danazol can be considered. These medications are generally used to treat severe breast pain or pain that doesn't respond to other treatments. Tamoxifen is an estrogen blocker, and Danazol is a synthetic androgen; both work by altering the hormonal balance that can cause breast pain. However, they are not suitable for everyone and carry specific risks and side effects, so their use should be discussed thoroughly with your healthcare provider. Step 6: Relaxation Therapy: Finally, non-pharmacological options like relaxation therapy should not be overlooked. Techniques like deep breathing, guided imagery, progressive muscle relaxation, and biofeedback can help manage breast pain associated with stress or anxiety. These non-invasive techniques have no side effects, making them a suitable complement to other treatment approaches. Conclusion: While breast pain can be distressing, it is often manageable once its cause has been identified. Through a combination of professional medical advice, medication management, and relaxation techniques, many women can find significant relief from their discomfort. Remember, the sooner you respond to your body's signals by seeking professional advice, the better you'll be able to manage and potentially eliminate the pain. Always consult with your healthcare provider to identify the best course of action for your individual case."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He says that \\"preventing the transfer of heat from an organims 's body causes that organism to keep warm\\" and \\"fur or feathers help hold heat in, but some body heat always escapes\\". So, what's the best answer to the question?","completion":"Based on the hints provided by your teacher, the best answer to the question \\"What does fur do?\\" is that fur serves as an insulating layer for an organism that helps to retain body heat and keep the organism warm. Fur, a natural covering consisting of hair, plays a crucial role in maintaining the thermal balance of an organism by preventing excessive heat loss. It serves as an insulator by trapping a layer of air close to the skin, which acts as a barrier to heat transfer, allowing the organism to maintain a constant body temperature even in colder environments. In addition to providing warmth, fur can also help to keep the organism dry, as many fur types have water-repellent properties that protect the skin from wetness and external elements. This further helps in insulation and maintaining body temperature. However, it's important to note that, as your teacher pointed out, some body heat always escapes, and the efficiency of fur as insulation may depend on several factors, including the thickness, length, and structure of the fur, as well as the environmental conditions and specific survival needs of the organism. For instance, Arctic animals like polar bears have thick, dense fur to protect them from extreme cold, while desert animals may have thinner fur that allows for some heat to escape to prevent overheating. In summary, while fur does not provide perfect insulation, it plays a critical role in helping an organism maintain and regulate its body temperature by retaining heat and providing protection against various environmental factors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He is the youngest of four children, with two brothers, Domingo and Dean, and a sister, Maisha. His mother, Elsie Harriet (Banks), is a middle-school choir teacher at Roxboro Middle School in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. His father, Lindberg Styles Mescudi, was a house painter, substitute teacher and World War II Air Force veteran. In a January 2013 interview, Cudi revealed that he had stopped smoking marijuana two years earlier, both for the sake of his child and due to frustration with constantly being associated with the drug and stoner culture. In that same interview, Cudi said that while he believes in God, he considers himself spiritual but not religious. In a March 2013 interview, Kid Cudi talked about how his initial sudden and unexpected fame drove him to alcohol and drugs: \\"For me, I just got to this point, and especially up until recently, I gave up liquor, I don't drink anymore, it's been five and a half months I've been sober. The booze was a new thing for me, I didn't realize I was an alcoholic all these years. I had a problem, I think with any addiction you have to be ready to make the choice, whether it's cigarettes or anything. You have to just commit and you just have to stick with it. I stopped everything cold turkey. When I had my cocaine problem I stopped cold turkey, I didn't go to rehab. I don't believe in these things. Some people need the extra help, not me. I wasn't a drug addict before this crap, I wasn't doing cocaine, I wasn't getting wasted every night because I didn't want to be alone. I wasn't this dark person before the madness, I was a whole other dude. I don't even think I smoked weed as much 'cause we couldn't afford it... You just have to make the choice and decide the person you wanna be and stick with it. You get to a certain age where the people around you are not gonna be on that rollercoaster all day long ready for you to go up, ready for you to go down, and stick with you through all the madness. People want you to be one person and stick with it and I chose to be clean and be sober and get my life together. For myself, for my health, for my daughter, for my family.\\" In a 2013 interview, Cudi revealed he had suffered an addiction to anti-depressant medication, which had been prescribed to help him deal with an \\"emotional breakdown\\" following a failed relationship. In a 2014 interview, Cudi spoke on his struggles with depression and suicide throughout the years: \\"I've dealt with suicide for the past five years.

Context: Marigold Lexton (Ali Larter), a self-centered and temperamental young American actress, arrives in India expecting to be treated like a star, despite the fact that she has been making nothing but B movie sequels for some time. She is stranded in Goa after the film she was to star in is canceled, and a sympathetic crew member offers her a ride, which brings her to the set of another movie, a Bollywood musical. She actually tells her boyfriend Barry that she was hoping she wouldn't have to marry him if this trip was successful, and soon finds herself the center of attraction on the set, where she quickly lands a minor role and a date with the spoiled young lead actor. But after she rebuffs his crude proposal that night she winds up talking with Prem (Salman Khan), the film's choreographer. He knows she lied about being able to dance, and takes her in hand, while showing her the nearby towns and countryside in their spare time. As they grow closer Prem talks to her about the importance of family, and she not only learns that he is estranged from his father, but that he is also a prince. He had not seen his family in three years, but the day before he received a call from his sister, asking him to come home for her wedding. He asks Marigold to go home with him to Jodhpur, Rajasthan, for the wedding, since shooting on the movie had been shut down for a week. She is entranced by the generosity and opulence of his family leading up to the wedding, but afterwards is shocked to discover that he has been betrothed to another since childhood. He has fallen totally in love with Marigold, but has neglected to mention the long arranged marriage, and his father has not encouraged him to follow his heart. She feels betrayed and storms out, followed by Prem's fiance, who offers to buy her a drink. She confesses to Marigold that although she loves Prem she doesn't believe he has ever really loved her. Meanwhile, Prem, a teetotaler, heads to a bar to drown his sorrows, where he finds a drunken American who commiserates with his romantic problems. He explains he has come looking for his estranged girlfiend, called Marigold, and Prem invites him to stay the night at his parents' house. Barry accepts and then passes out. In the morning, Marigold decides to return with Barry to the United States, since Prem, the only son of Jaipur's Ruler, feels duty bound to marry the woman his father has chosen. The ceremony takes place that day, and as he follows his bride, whose face is totally hidden behind a long veil, seven times around the Holy fire, Prem believes he is marrying the woman he has been engaged to since childhood. With the marriage complete, Prem lifts his wife's veil, and he and most of the guests are astonished to find Marigold standing before himand it appears that Barry has married Prem's former fiance as well.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What group of people did Harris accuse of being bad losers?, using the article: The NSWCA appealed to Lord Harris, and in reply he said he did not blame them or the cricketers of Sydney in any way, but said that \\"it [the riot] was an occurrence it was impossible he could forget\\". On 11 February, one day after the conclusion of the match and three days after the riot, Harris wrote a letter to one of his friends about the disturbance. It was clear that he intended the letter to be printed in the press, and it appeared in full in The Daily Telegraph on 1 April, among other London newspapers, reigniting the furore. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack considered the incident of such significance that it reprinted the whole correspondence. The letter gives a detailed contemporary account of what Lord Harris thought about the riot.Lord Harris referred to the crowd as a \\"howling mob\\" and said \\"I have seen no reason as yet to change my opinion of Coulthard's qualities, or to regret his engagement, in which opinion I am joined by the whole team\\". He further added that \\"Beyond slyly kicking me once or twice the mob behaved very well, their one cry being, 'Change your umpire'. And now for the cause of this disturbance, not unexpected, I may say, by us, for we have heard accounts of former matches played by English teams.\\" Harris further accused a New South Wales parliamentarian of assisting the gamblers in the inciting the unrest, although he did not name the accusee. He said I blame the NSW Eleven for not objecting to Coulthard before the match began, if they had reason to suppose him incompetent to fulfil his duties. I blame the members of the association (many, of course, must be excepted) for their discourtesy and uncricket like behaviour to their guests; and I blame the committee and others of the association for ever permitting betting, but this last does not, of course, apply to our match only. I am bound to say they did all in their power to quell the disturbance. I don't think anything would have happened if A.

In order to analyze this further, let us break down both the premise and hypothesis to better understand their components and assess their relationship. Premise components: 1. Subject: An old man 2. Location: Outside an open doorway 3. Object: A low stool Hypothesis components: 1. Subject: A young kid 2. Location: Outside an open doorway 3. Object: A rocking chair To establish a connection between the two, let's compare each component: 1. Subject: The premise describes an old man, while the hypothesis introduces a young kid. These two subjects are different as they represent individuals from distinct age groups, which implies that on its own, the information about the old man cannot be utilized to deduce the presence of the young kid. 2. Location: Both the premise and hypothesis share a common location, which is outside an open doorway. This shared aspect, however, does not necessarily provide evidence for the hypothesis to be true, as it merely indicates the presence of both parties together in the same space if the hypothesis were true. 3. Object: In the premise, the old man is seated on a low stool, while the hypothesis states that the young kid is seated on a rocking chair. These two objects are distinct from each other, and the presence of one does not automatically mean the presence of the other. Based on the comparison of the premise and hypothesis components, we can see that there is insufficient information to conclude the hypothesis from the premise. While both share the same location, the subjects and objects involved are different, and no direct relationship or link is evident between the two. In order to ascertain the hypothesis's validity, additional information would be required, such as evidence that the young kid and the old man interact with each other or evidence that suggests both the low stool and the rocking chair belong to the same house or location.

An aircraft carrier is a kind of ship that planes can fly from and land on--like an airport on the sea. It stands for a country's military strength . It plays an important role in modern wars. In August last year, the air craft carrier began its trial run at Dalian Port in Liaoning. The carrier was at first called the Varyag. It was built in the former Soviet Union. However, the Soviets failed to finish the ship. China bought the Varyag in 1998. Now after 10 trial runs, the aircraft carrier, renamed Liaoning, is in active service. Liaoning is about 300 meters long and 70 meters wide. It can take 30 planes and hold 2,000 soldiers. According to Xinhua News, Liaoning will be used for scientific research and military training.

When was China's aircraft carrier born? A) September 25th. B) September 30th. C) October lst. D) October 6th. Answer:","completion":"China's first aircraft carrier, Liaoning, was officially born and put into active service on September 25, 2012, just six days before the 63rd anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. This significant milestone made China the 10th country in the world to have an aircraft carrier, a symbol of military strength and prowess. Thus, the correct answer to the question is A) September 25th. The journey to acquiring the aircraft carrier started when China purchased the unfinished Varyag from the former Soviet Union in 1998. Since then, the ship has undergone major refurbishments and testing. In August of 2011, the aircraft carrier began its trial run at Dalian Port in Liaoning province, going through a total of 10 trial runs before its official commission. The vessel was eventually renamed Liaoning, after the Chinese province where it was refurbished and tested. Measuring approximately 300 meters in length and 70 meters in width, Liaoning is capable of accommodating 30 aircraft and housing 2,000 soldiers at a time. According to Xinhua News, the main purpose of the aircraft carrier is to conduct scientific research and military training, although it will also play a vital role in protecting China's sovereignty and promoting world peace. The BBC acknowledged Liaoning's commissioning as an indicator of China's increasing power and global influence. The aircraft carrier significantly bolstered China's naval capabilities and demonstrated the country's commitment to asserting its presence in regional and international maritime affairs."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Theodore Honey, an eccentric \\"boffin\\" with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, is working on solving a difficult aviation crash problem. A widower with a 12-year-old daughter, Elspeth, Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada. He theorizes the accident happened because of the tailplane's structural failure, caused by sudden metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. To test the theory in his laboratory, a rear airframe is being vibrated at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles. It is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure. Despite the fact that his theory is not yet proven, he decides to warn the aircrew and Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale, a fellow passenger. After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly and seriously damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory and save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press. Teasdale and an airline stewardess Marjorie Corder both take a liking to Mr. Honey and Elspeth, who they discover is lonely and isolated from her schoolmates. Teasdale speaks to Honey's superiors on his behalf, claiming she believes in him. Corder, meanwhile, has stayed on with Honey and his daughter as a nurse. Having now observed Honey's many qualities beyond his minor eccentricities, and after becoming very close to Elspeth, she decides to make the arrangement permanent by marrying the engineer.

It includes the cerebral cortex, limbic system, basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, brainstem, and retinas. The outermost part of the brain is a thick piece of nervous system tissue called the cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex, limbic system, and basal ganglia make up the two cerebral hemispheres. A thick fiber bundle called the corpus callosum (corpus = “body”; callosum = “tough”) connects the two hemispheres. Although there are some brain functions that are localized more to one hemisphere than the other, the functions of the two hemispheres are largely redundant. In fact, sometimes (very rarely) an entire hemisphere is removed to treat severe epilepsy. While patients do suffer some deficits following the surgery, they can have surprisingly few problems, especially when the surgery is performed on children who have very immature nervous systems. In other surgeries to treat severe epilepsy, the corpus callosum is cut instead of removing an entire hemisphere. This causes a condition called split-brain, which gives insights into unique functions of the two hemispheres. For example, when an. Q: What connects the two hemispheres of the brain?

A:","completion":"DST, or Daylight Saving Time, is a practice of adjusting the clocks, usually by moving them forward by an hour during the warmer months, in order to extend evening daylight. The main objective of DST is to make better use of daylight and reduce energy consumption. It affects health in various ways: 1. Provides more afternoon sunlight: In societies with fixed work schedules, DST offers more sunlight in the afternoon for outdoor activities and exercise, which can be beneficial for overall health and well-being. 2. Alters sunlight exposure: DST changes the amount of sunlight individuals are exposed to throughout the day. Sunlight helps the body produce vitamin D, which is essential for maintaining strong bones and overall health. However, overexposure to sunlight can increase the risk of skin cancer. 3. Potential benefits for depression: DST may have a positive impact on mental health by encouraging individuals to wake up earlier, thus increasing exposure to morning sunlight. This could help alleviate symptoms of depression, although some argue the opposite effect might be true.

Benny found out he could get cancer because of his lifestyle so he decided to make healthy lifestyle choices from then on. Jerry continued smoking, spending lots of time in the sun, and eating junk-food. Which brother lowered the risk of getting lung cancer by quitting smoking? Answer:","completion":"Benny, one of the two Irish twins, made the prudent decision to adopt healthy lifestyle choices after discovering that his previous habits could potentially cause cancer. Among the various changes he implemented in his daily routine, quitting smoking was a particularly significant measure. By doing so, Benny effectively lowered his risk of developing lung cancer. Lung cancer is primarily linked to tobacco use, with cigarette smoking being the foremost cause. In fact, approximately 85% of lung cancer cases can be traced back to smoking. Smokers are substantially more susceptible to the disease compared to non-smokers, with the risk increasing as the number of cigarettes smoked per day rises. It is crucial to note that even passive exposure to second-hand smoke can cause lung cancer in non-smokers. By quitting smoking, Benny not only lowered his personal risk but also indirectly protected those around him, such as family, friends, and colleagues, from the harmful effects of tobacco smoke. On the other hand, Jerry continued engaging in unhealthy behaviors, including smoking, excessive sun exposure, and consuming junk food, all of which are known to contribute to an increased risk of various diseases, including cancer. Consequently, Jerry's risk of developing lung cancer remained high, in stark contrast to Benny's efforts to safeguard his health by quitting smoking. In conclusion, among the two Irish twins, Benny was the brother who successfully lowered his risk of getting lung cancer by choosing to quit smoking. By doing so, he took an essential step toward preventing a severe and life-threatening disease while also bettering his overall health and well-being."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Walking through the deserted streets, she stops to admire some gruesome paintings in a gallery window painted by artist Antonio Sordi (Campbell), who coincidentally also comes by to look in on his \\"lost children.\\" After a friendly conversation, Sordi convinces the young woman to pose nude for him that night. At his bell-tower studio, Sordi is possessed by the spirit of a long-dead ancestor and suddenly transforms into a vampiric monster who hacks the screaming Daisy to death with a cleaver. Afterwards, he lowers her mutilated corpse into a vat of boiling wax. Sordi, in his vampire form, stalks Venice in search of victims; he is able to do so freely at all hours. In the middle of the day, he chases a young woman into the surf at a beach and drowns her. At night, he kills a prostitute in a car while pedestrians stroll by, all of them assuming the pair are lovers sharing an intimate moment. Another victim is approached at a party, chased into a swimming pool, and drowned there after the other guests have moved into the house.

You couldn't ask for more. Cast is superb. Carrie Ann Moss is absolute perfection as a debutante social climbing housewife. She's both wanton, and criminally conspiratorial. Every fellow's dream. K'sun is really great as the son just trying to be as normal as possible in this nightmare existence, and somehow succeeding. He's a genuine screen presence. Very photogenic, and natural. Without naming them all, the rest of the cast is wonderful. Henry Czerny plays a suspicious policeman with honed instincts and little squeamishness as if it's his everyday persona. Billy Connolly is delightful as Fido. A fine actor: I wish that he had played the title role in \\"Braveheart,\\" with Gibson directing. My sense is that his William Wallace would have been closer to the actual character. His Fido is contained, yet accessible. A nice touch. In short, a great and marvelous satiric poke at morals, values, social pinnings, feelings, growth, coping in uncertain times, and compensatory adjustments to impossible conditions.

Which holy book is the oldest, the Bible, the Gita, or the Quran? Who wrote them? What are the best books in Tamil to read and understand the Bible and the Quran? Do those questions have the same meaning? Pick your answer from: - no - yes","completion":"To answer the first part of your question, let's analyze the time frames of the three holy books: 1. The Bible: The Bible is a compilation of religious texts and sacred scriptures from Judaism and Christianity, divided into the Old Testament and the New Testament. The Old Testament was written starting around 1200 BCE, while the New Testament was written between 45-100 CE. 2. The Bhagavad Gita: The Gita is a 700-verse scripture that is part of the Indian epic Mahabharata. It is estimated to have been written between 400 BCE and 200 BCE. 3. The Quran: The Quran is the sacred book of Islam, believed to be a revelation from God (Allah) to the Prophet Muhammad. It was compiled and written down around 610-632 CE. Given these time frames, the Bible (specifically the Old Testament) is the oldest among the three holy books. As for the authors: 1. The Bible: The Bible has multiple authors, also known as scribes, who were inspired by God to write the sacred texts. 2. The Bhagavad Gita: Though the author is generally considered to be the Vedic sage Vyasa, it is a part of the larger Indian epic Mahabharata, and as such, it may have multiple authors who chronicled its story. 3. The Quran: The Quran is believed to be the word of God, as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. It was compiled by his followers and written down by scribes after his death. Now, let's move on to the best books in Tamil to read and understand the Bible and the Quran. 1. Bible: The Tamil Bible can be read online or downloaded from several websites, like the Bible Society of India. Additionally, you can find commentaries and books written by experts to help better understand the Bible in Tamil. Some such books are \\"Bible Amaippukal\\" by Rev. Dr. Dhanaraj Jebasingh and \\"Bible Arimugam\\" by R. Sundaram. 2. Quran: The Tamil translation of the Quran is available online and in print. You can download or read it on websites like Quranwbw.com. To better understand the Quran, you can refer to books like \\"Quran Tamil Tafseer\\" by Shaik Muhammed Karakunnu and \\"Practical Lessons from the Quran\\" by A. Hassan. Regarding the question about these questions having the same meaning, I understand that you are asking if the questions about the oldest holy book and the Tamil books to understand the Bible and Quran have the same meaning. Based on the given options: - no The questions do not have the same meaning, as one is asking for the oldest holy book and who wrote them, while the other is asking for recommendations to read and understand the Bible and the Quran in Tamil."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

With low frequencies, the stylus must swing a long way from side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record. At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased. The playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble so as to restore the tonal balance in the original signal; this also reduces the high frequency noise.

Possible A: broke, headaches, grief, worries, empty Why is \\"broke\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"\\"Broke\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in this context because it directly addresses the financial implications of having nothing left after paying bills. Human common sense, which refers to an intuitive understanding of the world and everyday life, allows one to quickly grasp the relationship between paying bills and having no money left as a consequence. The term \\"broke\\" is commonly used to denote a state of being without any money or financial resources. When someone has no funds available to them after clearing their financial obligations, it indicates that they have exhausted their monetary supply. This situation is understandably stressful and can lead to potential hardships in meeting basic necessities and fulfilling other essential needs. Comparing the other possible answers with \\"broke,\\" it becomes clear that they are not as closely related to the concept: 1. \\"Headaches\\": While being \\"broke\\" can cause emotional and physical stress, manifesting as headaches, the term itself is not a direct description of one's financial state. It is an effect, not the actual state. 2. \\"Grief\\": Though financial troubles can bring about grief, the term does not directly address the condition of having nothing left after paying bills. Grief usually refers to an emotional response to a significant loss, such as the death of a loved one. 3. \\"Worries\\": Worries can arise from a multitude of life situations, including being \\"broke.\\" However, this term does not specifically denote the state of having no money left after paying bills. It is an emotion and not an actual financial state. 4. \\"Empty\\": Although the term \\"empty\\" can be metaphorically used to describe a feeling of depletion or lack, it is not the most accurate or straightforward description of one's financial situation in this context. It could imply both an emotional or material emptiness and can be open to various interpretations. In contrast, the term \\"broke\\" directly and succinctly describes the financial status of having no money left after paying bills. It is an answer grounded in human common sense as it effectively conveys the result of this financial scenario. This term is easily understood and relatable for many people globally, making it the most appropriate answer among the provided options."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (September 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The movie begins with Eugene (Zach Cregger) and his best friend Tucker (Trevor Moore) as kids. They sneak into the bedroom closet of Eugene's brother, as he recently acquired a valuable Michael Jordan rookie card. Upon opening the box the card was in, Tucker notices that Eugene's brother has an issue of Playboy. Tucker opens the magazine, instantly becoming obsessed with it. Three weeks later, Tucker's demeanor has changed to that of a hormone driven teenager, despite that he is only 8 years old. Fast forward ten years later, Eugene and Tucker are seniors in high school. Tucker is still a huge fan of the Playboy franchise, while Eugene and his girlfriend of two years, Cindi Whitehall (Raquel Alessi) are public speakers on the subject of abstinence for younger teens. Despite this, in reality, Cindi has other plans, stating that since they have been together for two years, if she is not Eugene's first then they have big problems. They decide to go through with it at the after prom party that Tucker had invited them to. On the day of prom, Tucker tells Eugene that he has the limo booked, which when pulls up, has already picked up Tucker's high school drop-out friend, Phil, who now goes by the MC name of Horsedick.MPEG (Craig Robinson). At the After Prom party, Cindi goes upstairs to prepare, while Tucker takes Eugene into the kitchen and gives him several shots of hard alcohol. As Eugene leaves to go upstairs to meet Cindi, he walks through the wrong door, and falls down the steps into the basement. He is hurt so bad, that he falls into a coma for four years. After Tucker wakes Eugene with a baseball bat, he tells him that Cindi stuck around for a little while, but disappeared shortly thereafter because Eugene was \\"a vegetable.\\" Tucker left Eugene to continue his recovery as Tucker went to... My question: How old is Tucker? Answer:","completion":"Tucker's age is not explicitly mentioned in the provided plot summary. However, we can make an estimate using the provided information. At the beginning of the plot, when Tucker first discovers the Playboy magazine, he is 8 years old. We then fast forward ten years, making him 18 years old as a senior in high school. After this point, the plot does not provide any further information on the passage of time, except that Eugene falls into a coma for four years. Since no additional information is provided about Tucker's age after high school, a reasonable estimation based on the available information would be that he is approximately 18 years old during the main events of the story and around 22 years old after Eugene wakes up from the coma."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

From this information, we can infer that the environment was diverse, and the students were exposed to a variety of cultures and people from different backgrounds. The hypothesis suggests that the narrator made many friends from different parts of the world in college. While the premise does not explicitly state that the narrator made friends with people from various backgrounds, it is reasonable to assume that due to the large number of international students and diverse environment described in the premise, the narrator likely had numerous opportunities to interact with and befriend individuals from various parts of the world. Therefore, although not directly stated by the premise, it is plausible that the hypothesis follows from the given information.

Q: Question: What year did the reform movement begin? Passage 1:CNN claims that Shubert was one of the first CNN correspondents to report on the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and resulting tsunami, reporting from Aceh, Indonesia, where she was vacationing at the time. Also in Indonesia, Shubert covered a number of major new events that included the 2002 Bali bombings, the fall of Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid and the inauguration of President Megawati Sukarnoputri, East Timor's transition to independence, the resurgence of the Free Aceh separatist movement, the religious conflict in Ambon City and the fall of former Indonesian President Suharto and resulting reform movement. Shubert also briefly covered the Schapelle Corby verdict in Bali; however, due to the time consuming and overall expensive nature of this landmark court case, CNN eventually opted to run stock footage obtained from its Australian network affiliates instead of direct reporting. Shubert has also contributed reports from the Philippines and Singapore. Passage 2:He was born in Iju, a town close to Akure and Idanre in Ondo State to the family of Joshua Adamolekun, a farmer and Madam Juliana Bama. Educated at Oyemekun Grammar School and Christ's School Ado Ekiti. He earned a first class degree in French at the University of Ibadan, a master's degree in Public Administration at Ife and a doctoral degree in politics at Oxford University. He joined the faculty of Administration at the Obafemi Awolowo University of Ife, in 1968, and from 1979–1982, he was dean of the faculty. During his tenure at Ife, he focused on the institutions of administration in Africa especially the transplanted French traditional norms of Administration in francophone countries and civil and political management in NIgeria. Passage 3:Heftye served one term in Kristiania city council, from 1907 to 1910. On 19 March 1908, when the Knudsen's First Cabinet assumed office, he was appointed for his second term as Minister of Defence. He resigned already on 10 April the same year, because Prime Minister Gunnar Knudsen refused to seek a vote of confidence in Parliament, a form of investiture. This was a problematic question at that time, as Norway had made important steps towards parliamentarism, but not formalized the process with change of government. Former Prime Minister Christian Michelsen had asked for a vote of confidence following the 1906 general election, and survived. When he retired from politics in 1907 due to illness, Jørgen Løvland took over, but he was felled in 1908. In early 1908, the Liberal Party had evicted 24 legislators who supported Christian Michelsen and the endeavors of the Coalition Party (later leading to the creation of the Liberal Left Party), and hence, when Knudsen took over, he had no way of achieving a parliamentary majority. In that situation he could not expect to survive a vote of confidence. It has been said that parliamentarism works best in a two-party system, which Norway did not have at that time, and has never had since, although the Coalition Party tried to implement it. On the other hand, Knudsen and his cabinet resigned following the 1909 general election, which the Liberal Party lost. Such an action is not required by law, but if not carried through, the cabinet would most likely face a vote of no confidence.

The question is, \\"However, under Senate rules -- which only allow budgetary changes to be accepted under the reconciliation process -- it's not clear that _ could pass that same language.\\" Considering the information given in the passage about the obstacles the Republicans are facing due to internal division over what to include in the legislation to repeal Obamacare, it's reasonable to deduce that the blank should be filled with a reference to this situation. So, the answer could be \\"the Republican Party\\" or \\"Republicans,\\" as the passage indicates it's unclear whether they could pass the same language as they are divided on the legislation to repeal Obamacare. Therefore, the explained answer will be \\"it's not clear that the Republican Party could pass that same language.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: Cluttered counter space is a major contributor to a messy and unorganized kitchen. Put everything that normally goes in a cupboard or the pantry back in its rightful place. Consider adding backsplash storage above your countertops. Instead of storing your coffee, sugar, cooking oils, and whatever else on the counter, you can install rods or rails to hang baskets or caddies from. This not only adds a nice organized look, but also makes cleaning regularly much simpler. You can also add a floating shelf to store spices and such, keeping your counter space free. Store appliances you don't use every day in a cupboard. If you don’t toast bread every day, you can store your toaster to free up counter space. Clear as you cook. Keeping a clean kitchen is easiest when you don’t let a mess build up. When cooking, make sure to clean and clear your ingredients, pots, pans, and utensils when you’re done with these items. Put your spices and ingredients back where they belong when you finish. If you use a bowl to mix something, clean it or throw it in the dishwasher as soon as you can. Do your dishes right after your meal. Whatever you didn’t get to before you finished cooking should be taken care of right after your meal. It will take you less time and keep you more organized than if you wait until there’s a huge pile of dishes. Go through your cabinets and drawers and throw out anything you don’t use. If you have 6 spatulas and you only ever use 3, get rid of the other 3. Reach into the back of your cupboards and find the coffee mugs you haven’t used and toss those as well. The more mugs, cups, and utensils you have, the easier it is to let dishes pile up. Go through your Tupperware and any older appliances. Check to make sure that every component is there. If something is missing a piece or part, get rid of it. Throw out grimy Tupperware and appliances you never use. Clean out any miscellaneous items you have, like ketchup packets, powders, and plastic silverware. Similar items should go near each other for the best organization. Mugs and glasses should be near each other. Plates and bowls go together. Keep silverware near your cooking utensils. Store items close to where you use these items. It’s a good idea to keep your plates and glasses close to your sink and dishwasher area. Doing this helps you to stay on top of cleaning. Store your lids for your Tupperware in one large container and stack your Tupperware bowls inside one another next to it. Go through your fridge and pantry and take everything out. Throw away any food that is stale or gone bad. Before you put anything back in, give both areas a good wipe down with disinfectant and water. You want to clean off any stains and bacteria. Don’t use bleach or any other harsh cleaning chemicals in the fridge, since these could contaminate your food. Stick to gentle cleansers, like warm water and dish soap or a solution of 1 part water to 1 part white vinegar. Store like food items together strategically. In your pantry, put all the cereals together. Put the snacks in another area. See if you can have a healthy area and a snack area. Or, separate items by meal. Put your breakfast stuff at the top, lunch in the middle, and dinner at the bottom. In your fridge, put your milk and other perishable liquids in the actual fridge, not the door. The opening of the door can cause liquids to splash around, sometimes leaking out. And the warm air can get to your items more easily there. Store food of like colors together, and keep your meats on the bottom shelf. Meats will sometimes leak juices. Place meat on the bottom so nothing leaks on anything else. Now it’s time to clean your cleared-off surfaces, stovetop, and the floor. Dust first and wipe off every surface, then sweep, vacuum, and mop. Don’t forget to clean the tops of your cabinets. Remember that dusting will cause dust and dirt to drift to the floor, so start at the top and work your way down. Sweep next to remove any fallen dust and get the dirt off the floor. Make sure to get every corner and under all your appliances, like your fridge, dishwasher, and oven. Once you’ve swept away the cobwebs, vacuum to pick up anything else, and then mop the area to really clean it. You should also wipe down your sink and cabinets. Your kitchen gets a lot of traffic. Spending 5 minutes each day will keep it clean and organized. Wipe down the stove top after you cook on it to keep grime from building up. Regularly clean up any cabinets above or next to the stove, since these will quickly collect dust, grease, and spattered food. Don’t go to bed with any dishes in the sink. Check your expiration dates every day. Before turning in for the night, do a once over in your fridge to make sure you don’t have any spoiled food. This keeps your fridge uncluttered and clean.","completion":"Cluttered counter space significantly contributes to a disorganized kitchen. To counter this issue, return items to their designated storage spaces, such as cupboards or pantries, and consider incorporating backsplash storage and floating shelves above countertops. Store infrequently used appliances in cupboards to free up counter space and maintain cleanliness during cooking by promptly putting away ingredients and washing used utensils. Doing dishes immediately after meals also prevents messes from building up, making the kitchen more organized and easier to clean. Evaluate the contents of your cabinets and drawers, discarding any unnecessary items or duplicates. Make sure to also assess older appliances and Tupperware for any missing components, discarding any that are damaged or no longer used. Store similar items together to maintain an organized kitchen. Regularly go through your pantry and fridge, disposing of expired or spoiled food items, and clean them thoroughly with gentle cleansers. Arrange your pantry and fridge intentionally by grouping similar items together, such as cereals, snacks, or meals. In the fridge, store perishable liquids in the main compartment, not the door, and place meats on the bottom shelf to avoid cross-contamination. Clean surfaces, stovetop, cabinets, and floors routinely to maintain a tidy kitchen environment. Work from the top down—dusting, sweeping, vacuuming, and mopping to ensure that every corner and surface is spotless. Taking a few minutes every day to maintain kitchen cleanliness and organization can significantly impact the space's appeal and functionality. Regularly wipe down stovetops and cabinets, avoid leaving dirty dishes in the sink, and check expiration dates on food items to keep the kitchen tidy and well-managed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

First question: How do tactile telekinesis and telekinesis differ? Second question: What is tactile telekinesis? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"Step 1: Understand the questions. The first question asks for a comparison and distinction between tactile telekinesis and telekinesis. The second question seeks a definition and explanation of tactile telekinesis. Step 2: Begin answering the first question. To respond to this question, I'll need to define both \\"tactile telekinesis\\" and \\"telekinesis.\\" Step 3: Define telekinesis and tactile telekinesis. Telekinesis is the ability to move or manipulate objects using only one's mind, without any physical contact. Tactile telekinesis is a variation of telekinesis where the user can move or manipulate objects through mental power but requires physical contact with the object. Step 4: Compare and contrast both phenomena. Tactile telekinesis differs from telekinesis in that it requires the user to touch the object they want to manipulate, whereas telekinesis allows the user to manipulate objects from a distance without direct contact. Step 5: Respond to the second question with a clear definition. Tactile telekinesis is a type of psychokinetic ability that involves manipulating or moving objects using mental power while maintaining physical contact with the object. Step 6: Assess whether the two questions are the same. Answering the first question required me to define both tactile telekinesis and telekinesis and explain how they differ from one another. Meanwhile, the second question asked for a definition and explanation of tactile telekinesis alone. So, although the questions have some overlap in content, they are not entirely the same as they serve different purposes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Amy was well-known throughout the neighborhood as the go-to person for all sorts of repair and DIY tasks. She had a knack for fixing things, not just because of her technical knowledge but also due to her sincere love for helping others. Having grown up watching her father, who was a skilled carpenter and mechanic, Amy developed a keen interest in the art of mending and creating things. Upon hearing Katrina's predicament, Amy agreed to help without a moment's hesitation. When they arrived at Katrina's home, Amy immediately inspected the broken drill. It was evident that this well-worn tool had seen better days. However, Amy was not one to give up easily. After all, she believed that anything could be fixed with the right amount of patience and determination. First, Amy started by analyzing the broken drill to identify any glaring problems. Her trained eye spotted that the chuck of the drill was jammed, which was preventing it from functioning properly. She also noticed that the wiring inside the drill was frayed, and deduced that this was, in all likelihood, the primary reason behind its malfunction. Amy knew she had her work cut out for her, but she was confident that she could fix the drill. She grabbed her tools and got to work, starting with the removal of the damaged wiring. She carefully disassembled the drill, making sure to keep all the different parts and screws in a small container so as not to lose any essential components. After replacing the frayed wiring with new electrical components, Amy shifted her focus to the jammed chuck. Applying a few drops of penetrating oil around its base, she let it sit for a few minutes to work its magic in loosening any rust or debris that might be causing the problem. Once the penetrating oil had done its job, Amy was able to gently tap the chuck with a hammer, thus removing it from the drill shaft. Amy continued by thoroughly inspecting and cleaning all the components of the drill. She wanted to ensure that there were no hidden issues that could cause future problems. It was during this stage of her work that she found a worn-out motor brush. She quickly replaced this with a new one, further enhancing the drill's functioning. Once Amy had successfully fixed the broken drill, she moved on to reassembling it. With a great level of attention to detail, she carefully put all the cleaned and repaired pieces back into place, ensuring that everything fit together correctly and securely. She screwed the exterior casing back on and gave the newly repaired drill a test run. Much to Katrina's delight, it worked better than ever before. Katrina marveled at Amy's prowess and determination, watching as she breathed new life into the broken drill. She was incredibly grateful for Amy's help and decided to throw her a small surprise party to say thank you. Amy was touched by this gesture, but in her heart, she didn't need any thanks. The true reward for her efforts was seeing the cherished items of others gain a second chance, as well as the happiness of her friends and neighbors. Thus, with their shared appreciation for each other's kindness and friendship, the bond between Katrina and Amy only grew stronger. Soon, they were spending a great deal of time together, working on various repair and DIY projects in the community, making it an even better place to live. And so, Amy continued to serve as an inspiration to those around her, proving that the smallest acts of kindness can forge the most powerful connections. With Katrina by her side, she mended not only the drill, but also the hearts of those who were fortunate enough to witness her unwavering optimism and kindness in action."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection? ? There was considerable local opposition to the Yellowstone National Park during its early years. Some of the locals feared that the regional economy would be unable to thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed. To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.After the park's official formation, Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872 by Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano, the first overseer and controller of the park. Langford served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection. This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. He addressed the practical problems park administrators faced in the 1872 Report to the Secretary of the Interior and correctly predicted that Yellowstone would become a major international attraction deserving the continuing stewardship of the government. In 1874, both Langford and Delano advocated the creation of a federal agency to protect the vast park, but Congress refused. In 1875, Colonel William Ludlow, who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of George Armstrong Custer, was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone National Park. The report included letters and attachments by other expedition members, including naturalist and mineralogist George Bird Grinnell. Grinnell documented the poaching of...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Few athletes would disagree that more muscle is an advantage in their sport. And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule. Question: Who is the author?

Translate to English","completion":"According to some estimates, during the funeral ceremony, almost one million people poured onto the streets of Belgrade. The phrase \\"Bazı tahminlere göre, cenaze töreni sırasında neredeyse bir milyon kişi Belgrad sokaklarına döküldü\\" in Turkish is a statement that indicates a substantial public presence in the streets of Belgrade during a funeral ceremony. It highlights the sheer number of people that attended the event, with the estimate reaching nearly one million individuals. This massive outpour of people points to the possible significance and emotional impact of the funeral ceremony in question. It could have been the funeral of a prominent figure, a prominent political leader, or perhaps even a beloved celebrity, which might explain the immense turnout and stir of emotions within the community. Funeral ceremonies often unite people in their shared grief and act as a platform for collective mourning and solace. In some cases, they can also serve as an expression of social support or political solidarity. For the funeral of such a prominent person to draw nearly one million people onto the streets of Belgrade demonstrates the significant impact they had on the community. While the translated statement offers insight into the sheer magnitude of the gathering during the funeral, it does not provide the specifics about the deceased or the root cause of the turnout. However, it does illustrate the remarkable connection and emotional response elicited by the individual being mourned. In conclusion, this Turkish sentence, when translated to English, reflects the extraordinary attendance observed during a funeral ceremony, with almost one million people filling the streets of Belgrade. Despite the lack of context surrounding the identity of the deceased, one can infer that the person being mourned must have been of significant importance or influence within the community. The funeral ceremony, therefore, represents the collective grievance, respect, and honor expressed by those who took part in it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q:Process: - Magma moves closer to the Earth&#x27;s crust - The magma starts to cool - The cooling causes atoms in the magma to condense - The condensed magma solidifies - The solidified magma forms minerals. suppose The magma never hardens happens, how will it affect LESS minerals forming. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"In the given process, if the magma never hardens, it will directly impact the formation of minerals. This perturbation can be seen as directly impacting a step of the process. To break it down further, let's go through each step and discuss how the perturbation would affect them: 1. Magma moves closer to the Earth's crust: As magma moves closer to the Earth's crust, it slowly cools down. The perturbation of the magma never hardening will not affect this step directly, as the movement of magma will still occur. 2. The magma starts to cool: The cooling of the magma is essential for the formation of minerals. If the magma never hardens, it would remain in a liquid state, which means it's not cooling down enough for atoms to condense. However, this step is still indirectly affected by the perturbation since the end result of magma cooling is eventually its solidification. 3. The cooling causes atoms in the magma to condense: The condensation of atoms is a critical step in the formation of minerals. In the scenario where the magma never hardens, the atoms won't condense as they should. This step is directly impacted by the perturbation, leading to the formation of fewer minerals. 4. The condensed magma solidifies: Since the magma never hardens, it won't solidify. This step is directly impacted by the perturbation, preventing the formation of minerals. 5. The solidified magma forms minerals: If the magma never hardens, there will be no solidified magma to form minerals. This step is directly impacted by the perturbation, as no minerals will be formed. In summary, the supposed perturbation – the magma never hardening – can be seen as directly impacting a step of the process. Although certain steps might still happen, the overall process of mineral formation will be disrupted since it relies on magma cooling down, solidifying, and causing atoms to condense. Thus, this perturbation will lead to fewer minerals forming due to its direct impact on several steps of the process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In 1951, his health took a sharp decline, which severely impacted his ability to carry out his royal duties. One of the main reasons for the decline of King George VI's health was his chronic lung issues. The King had a history of smoking, which contributed to his worsening health. In September 1951, he underwent a surgery to remove part of his lung, which left him weaker and even more vulnerable. This operation affected his capacity to carry out his duties as the monarch, making it difficult for him to attend public events and engage in other royal activities. As a result of King George VI's declining health and his subsequent inability to fulfill his role as a monarch, his daughter Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II) started to take on more responsibilities. During this time, she frequently stood in for her father at public events and engagements, assuming many of the roles he could no longer carry out due to his poor health. Unfortunately, King George VI's health continued to worsen, and he ultimately passed away on February 6, 1952. Princess Elizabeth then became Queen Elizabeth II and continues to serve as the United Kingdom's reigning monarch to this day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: Before every school year, your school should provide you with a list of the items you need for your grade. If you don’t receive one of these before the school year begins, you can usually find them at supply stores like Office Max or Staples. The most common items for middle school include pens, #2 pencils, notebooks, wide-rule loose leaf paper, a 3 ring binder, and scissors and tape. Other materials you may need include a USB flash drive, a TI calculator, index cards, a weekly planner, and a stapler. You don’t want to overload your backpack, so try to take only the essentials when you can. For example, having one binder separated into multiple subjects will help save you space compared to multiple folders. You should also try to take two pencils and two to three pens, as well as a highlighter, and your weekly planner. This way, the rest of your space can be dedicated to textbooks and notebooks. You’ll have a better idea of exactly what you’ll need day-to-day after the first week of class. If you have money for lunch, try to keep it zipped up in an inside pocket. If you don't have one in your bag, try to keep it in a change purse or wallet instead. This will help keep your money safe and together, so you aren't searching all over for it during lunch time. If you have a block schedule with different classes on different days, try separating your materials into marked piles. For example, you can mark everything for one day with a specific color like red, while the other day is blue. Then you can switch them out of your backpack when necessary. Now is the moment of truth; you want to make sure you can fit everything in your backpack and still be able to carry it. Chances are you’ll have a locker you can store some things in, but you still need to be able to take everything to and from school each day. Put your binder, notebooks, textbooks, and pencil case in the main part of the bag - in that order. You should then put any extra materials into the front pockets. For example, your calculator, tape, stapler, even markers, and highlighters if they won’t fit in your pencil case can go in your front pockets. The front pockets of your backpack are also a great place to keep items like chapstick, tissues, mints, or anything else you want to carry with you.

DeDe Phillips walked out to her front yard in Hart County, Ga., around dinnertime intending to take a picture of a new bumper sticker on her truck, reports the Athens Banner-Herald and the Hartwell Sun. But her plans changed when she spied a bobcat. She took a picture of the cat, and then it “took two steps and was on top of me. ... It came for my face,” she recalls. She was reluctant to call for help because her 5-year-old granddaughter was in the house. “I thought, ‘Not today,’” she says. “There was no way I was going to die.” She grabbed the animal by the throat and throttled it until it went limp. Phillips, 46, then yelled for help, and when her son arrived, she released her grip on the cat. Her son stabbed the cat several times, but it was likely already dead. Phillips suffered a broken finger as well as deep cuts and scratches to her hands, chest, and legs. Phillips knows something about bobcats because her father-in-law was once a bobcat trapper. “They go for your jugular,” she tells the Banner-Herald, “because when they can get the vein you’re dead in a couple of minutes.” Phillips has begun a round of shots for rabies.

She also needed to get some medicine to protect her from a sickness called rabies, which the bobcat had.

The ‘politics of fear’ is hurting human rights around the world, report says Human Rights Watch unveiled its annual World Report, a 659-page project documenting human rights practices and abuses in more than 90 countries. The report is a handy compendium of some of the darker corners of world politics. It spotlights the many shortcomings of even the more-advanced Western democracies, as well as the poor human rights records of the usual suspects — closed or authoritarian regimes that suppress freedoms and squeeze civil society through crackdowns and interference. Kenneth Roth, executive director of the New York-based rights group, penned an introductory essay that stitches together some of the themes of the report. \\"Fear stood behind many of the big human rights developments of the past year,\\" he writes. Then he elaborates: Fear of being killed or tortured in Syria and other zones of conflict and repression drove millions from their homes. Fear of what an influx of asylum seekers could mean for their societies led many governments in Europe and elsewhere to close the gates. Fear of mounting terrorist attacks moved some political leaders to curtail rights and scapegoat refugees or Muslims. And fear of their people holding them to account led various autocrats to pursue an unprecedented global crackdown on the ability of those people to band together and make their voices heard. [New U.N. report says world's refugee crisis is worse than anyone expected] WorldViews has charted the growing xenophobic backlash in the West to an influx of Syrian refugees and other migrants over the past year. Anti-migrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric has seeped into the political conversation in the United States and is shadowing the election cycle. Republican presidential candidates such as Donald Trump have pandered to populist fears and suspicions of outsiders to an extent not seen in a long time. \\"In Europe and the United States, a polarizing us-versus-them rhetoric has moved from the political fringe to the mainstream,\\" Roth writes. \\"Blatant Islamophobia and shameless demonizing of refugees have become the currency of an increasingly assertive politics of intolerance.\\" [After Paris and California attacks, U.S. Muslims feel intense backlash] Although different from the gross violations of justice and human rights carried out in more authoritarian societies, the heated discourse of the present has real and potentially dangerous consequences. \\"Vilifying entire communities for the unacceptable actions of a few is also counterproductive for the effort to prevent terrorism,\\" Roth writes, echoing an argument often made by those pushing back against the tide of xenophobia. \\"It is exactly the divisive and alienating response that terrorist groups seek to generate more recruits. And it undermines the cooperation with law enforcement efforts that is essential for preventing terrorist attacks.\\" Roth also suggests that the hysteria over refugees obscures the real security challenge facing the West. To a large extent, Europe’s preoccupation with the new refugees as a possible terrorist threat is a dangerous distraction from its own home-grown violent extremism, given that the Paris attackers were predominantly Belgian or French citizens. The roots of radicalization are complex but relate in part to the social exclusion of immigrant communities — the persistent discrimination, hopelessness, and despair that pervade neighborhoods on the outskirts of some European cities, and particularly the disjuncture between expectations and prospects among subsequent generations. His essay also outlines the other threats to human rights that his organization is tracking, including the erosion of the rule of law, the curtailing of civil society, increasing homophobia and the perils of mass surveillance. \\"Change can appear threatening, whether to a community grasping nostalgically at memories of greater homogeneity, a nation confronting increased insecurity, or a dictator clinging to power,\\" Roth writes. Ishaan Tharoor writes about foreign affairs for The Washington Post. He previously was a senior editor at TIME, based first in Hong Kong and later in New York. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Human Rights Watch has unveiled its latest World Report, a 659-page analysis documenting human rights practices and abuses in over 90 countries, in which it claims that the \\"politics of fear\\" are damaging human rights across the globe; the report details the increasing global xenophobic backlash as well as the restriction of civil societies."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choose the correct sentiment from candidates: Available choices: 1). negative; 2). positive; TEXT:When a movie of a book seems pointless and incomprehensible, the cause can invariably be found in the book: either it was pointless to start with, or the point is one not easily conveyed to film, or the movie missed the point, which is the most frequent of these results, and the easiest to happen, especially when the point is one not easily defined. The book \\"Morvern Callar\\" has a point; every reader of the book must have felt this, and felt as if he had gotten it; but I suspect most of them could not state it in words. I'm not sure I can, myself, but perhaps it comes to this, or something like it: Things come, things go, such is life, but we carry on; or at any rate some of us--people like Morvern--do. No doubt a more erudite critic could construct a more adequate definition. But the important fact is that there is a point--possibly the sum of the entire story is the point--and that this would have been the main thing to keep in view, and to carry over, in adapting the story to film. The maker of this film evidently missed the point, and doesn't substitute one of her own; and so the film is about nothing. This is not the usual complaint of a book-lover that his favorite text has been violated. The merit of the book is something I conceded grudgingly: in reading it I found it a bloody nuisance, and an occasion for kicking the author in the pants and getting him in to finish the job properly. The narrative is supposed to be the work of the half-educated Morvern, but that illusion is constantly dispelled by a dozen different types of literary effect, as if the author were poking at her with his pen; there are inconsistencies of style and tone, as if different sections had been composed at different times; and any conclusions I could reach about Morvern had to remain tentative because it was uncertain which implications the author intended and which he did not: for instance, despite Morvern's own self-characterization as a raver, am I wrong that in the end she remains essentially a working-class Scots girl, and beneath her wrapping of music downloads not so different from those of generations past? In any case, despite my irritation at the author, I couldn't deny that his book stuck with me; and what I couldn't get out of my head was his character's attitude, her angle on the world, which was almost as vivid as a Goya portrait. Morvern is the kind of person who's always encountering situations at once rather comic and rather horrible; occasionally she invites them but more often they land on her, like flies, so that much of her life consists of a kind of gauche but graceful slogging-through, unconsciously practical and unconsciously philosophical--and that doesn't begin to describe it idiosyncratically enough. The complex of incidents and of Morvern's responses to them are the substance of the book, and its achievement, in exposing a cross-section of existence it would be difficult to illuminate otherwise; for all my dislike of the book, I can see this. The Morvern just described is not the Morvern of the movie; or if it is, most of her is kept offscreen. An actress who might have been a good fit for the character, had she been the right age at the right time, is Angharad Rees, from the old TV series \\"Poldark\\". Samantha Morton, then, would seem like good casting: she's rather the same sort of actress, and in one of her earlier movies, \\"Jesus' Son\\", she played a girl who with a few adjustments could have been turned into this one. Unfortunately, as the film turned out, she doesn't have the character from the book to play. For one thing, the book is one that, if it is to be dramatized, virtually cries out for monologues by the main character to the audience; without her comments, her perspective, her voice, the story loses most of its meaning. It has lost more of it in that the adaptor has expurgated it of its comic and horrible elements: the most memorable incidents from the book are curtailed before they turn grotty, and so Morvern's responses (whether of amusement or distaste, depending on her mood) are missing too, and the incidents no longer have a reason for being in the story. In short, the filmmaker chose for some reason to turn a brisk, edgy serio-comic novel into a genteel art TV film, and chose as her typical image one of Ms. Morton languishing in a artistically shaded melancholy; as if the outing Morvern signs up for were a tour of the Stations of the Cross. This isn't at all what the book, or the Morvern of the book, was about. For another thing, the Morvern of the movie isn't Scottish (the actress said in an interview she hadn't had time to study up the accent), and she ought to be: it's important that she, her family, and her mates are all from a single place. And finally the film is missing the end of the story: Morvern's spending all she has and coming home to icy darkness: it's winter, the dam has frozen, the power has gone out, and the pub is dark. Minus this, and minus all of the rest, what's left is a failed art film, a dead film, about a subject whose strength lay precisely in her refusal, or native inability, ever to give in to being dead.","completion":"The sentiment of the given text can be identified as 1). negative. The text largely focuses on critiquing both the book \\"Morvern Callar\\" and its film adaptation. The critique is quite negative throughout the entire passage. The author of this text shows his dissatisfaction and frustration with the film adaptation of the book because of the perception that the filmmaker did not stay true to what made the book meaningful. The author points out that the film lacks critical elements from the book and argues that the filmmaker failed to convey the essence of the book, making the film feel 'pointless' and 'about nothing'. The statement \\"The maker of this film evidently missed the point, and doesn't substitute one of her own; and so the film is about nothing,\\" shows this sentiment. Moreover, the author also criticizes the book by stating 'The merit of the book is something I conceded grudgingly: in reading it I found it a bloody nuisance, and an occasion for kicking the author in the pants and getting him in to finish the job properly.' This again sets a negative tone. Also, phrases such as 'a dead film,' 'meaningless adaptation,' 'bloody nuisance,' and 'failed art film,' contribute to the overall negative sentiment. It's important to note that while the author does acknowledge some merit in both the book and the potential of its film adaptation, he criticizes them to a significantly greater extent, making the overall sentiment negative. For example, he acknowledges that the book left a lasting impression on him despite its issues and that the actress chosen could have been perfect for the role had the character been portrayed as it was in the book. Therefore, given the emphasis on what the author believes was done wrong or could have been done better, coupled with direct criticisms and negative language, the sentiment is decidedly negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There is nothing more disappointing than a soggy salad when it comes to summertime lunching. But such unsatisfactory snacks could become a thing of the past as scientists have found a way to genetically extending the life of lettuce so leaves will stay fresh for more than a week. By looking at the lettuce’s genetic make-up they are breeding selectively ‘tougher’ plants. No more soggy salad! Scientists have developed a way to genetically extend the life of lettuce so it stays crispy for up to eight days. Researchers from the University of Southampton found that smaller leaves with lots of cells packed closely together remain green, crisp and firm for longer. Having made the observation, Gail Taylor, a professor in plant biology at the university worked out which genes are responsible for these characteristics. She is now working with Vitacress - one of the biggest producers of packaged salads - to selectively breed lettuces with these qualities. It means the leaves, which often wilt and turn brown after just a few days, will last at home for up to eight days. ‘People will know how frustrating it is to buy a bag of prepared salad only for it to wilt and turn into a brown mush after a few days. If you don’t eat it quickly enough you end up being wasteful and throwing it away,’ Professor Taylor said. Small means fresh: Researchers from the University of Southampton found that smaller leaves with lots of cells packed closely together remain green, crisp and firm for longer. ‘Our research means growers will soon be supplying supermarkets with leaves that will last more than a week after you get them home. ‘That will allow families to do their weekly food shop and have a fresh salad on any day of the week. ‘Our findings are also applicable to spinach and rocket leaves, which often come in the mixed leaf bags. However, they already tend to be more hardy.’ Baby salad leaves, which are usually cos or lollo rossa, undergo rigorous processing – which includes harvesting, transportation, washing, sanitisation, removal of excess water, and packaging - before they reach supermarket shelves. Putting the spring back in greens: One professor in plant biology worked out which genes are responsible for these crispy lettuce leaves. Experimental specimens are pictured left and an experiment to test crispness is pictured right. Only the most robust leaves can survive this process without being bruised and damaged, which makes growing salad crops with ‘processable’ leaves extremely important for the packaged salad industry, as it reduces waste and increases shelf life. Professor Taylor found producers could also increase the shelf-life of salad by reducing the water used during growing by 20 per cent, which has the added benefit of being more environmentally friendly. ‘We were able to show if you reduce water use in intensive salad production by about 20 per cent, you actually develop smaller, tougher leaves with stiff cells walls, which is what we’re interested in,’ she said. Cream of the crop? Professor Taylor found producers could increase the shelf-life of salad by reducing the water used during growing by 20 per cent, which has the added benefit of being more environmentally friendly. A filed of selectively bred lettuces are pictured. She said that the researchers have used fundamental biological knowledge and applied it through genetics and crop production techniques to help Vitacress improve the quality of its products. Professor Taylor said there is a trade-off between taste, crispiness, and shelf-life ‘because you want the leaves to be firm but not too hard.’ Dr Steve Rothwell, from Vitacress, said: ‘The results open the door to exciting further studies across a wider range of crops and geographies to drive down the use of water while improving crop quality and shelf life.’ Salad redesigned: The researchers have used fundamental biological knowledge and applied it through genetics and crop production techniques to help Vitacress improve the quality of its product.

The Spike Lee film \\"Do the Right Thing,\\" critics and columnists said, would provoke violence and disrupt race relations. Spike Lee: \\"I wanted to do a film that would try to show what was happening at the time.\\" \\"This movie is dynamite under every seat,\\" wrote Newsweek's Jack Kroll. Other commentators believed the film would harm the candidacy of David Dinkins, an African-American who was running for mayor of New York. It might even spark riots at movie theaters, they thought. Instead, what the film provoked was ... talk. There were no riots. Dinkins was elected. \\"Do the Right Thing\\" had a successful run at the box office -- if not as successful as Lee and his supporters hoped -- and was nominated for two Academy Awards. Twenty years later, the film still maintains a hold on the imagination. In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked it as one of the 100 best American films. Roger Ebert, who has written he cried when he first saw the film at the Cannes Film Festival, still considers the film a wonder: \\"Spike Lee had done an almost impossible thing. He'd made a movie about race in America that empathized with all the participants,\\" he wrote in 2001. So what is the thing about \\"Do the Right Thing?\\" Watch Spike Lee describe things in his own words » Part of its staying power is in its boldness, both in look and action. Lee's first two films, \\"She's Gotta Have It\\" (1986) and \\"School Daze\\" (1988), had marked him as a rising young filmmaker. But it was \\"Do the Right Thing,\\" made when Lee was just 32, that showcased his confidence, from the deliberately striking color scheme (bright reds and oranges that make a hot day seem even hotter) to its heightened -- sometimes stagy -- atmosphere, to its grim, documentary-style riot climax. Answer the following questions: 1. What film maker was controversial? 2. What was the name of the controversial film? 3. What year was it released? 4. How old was Lee? 5. What were his first two films? 6. When was She's Gotta Have It released? 7. What about School Daze? 8. Did Do the Right Thing win any awards? 9. Was it nominated? 10.

In fact, the information mentioned states that Manchester United has managed only one win in their last four games, which indicates a poor or low win-to-lose ratio. Manchester United's recent performance has been underwhelming, as they have only registered a win in the Champions League match against Young Boys. Their Premier League showing has been especially disheartening, as evidenced by their draw against Southampton, which has further pushed them 16 points behind league leaders, Manchester City. Additionally, the team is going into their upcoming clash against Arsenal in a weaker state, as manager Jose Mourinho has revealed that at least three first-team players will be unavailable due to injuries, and possibly another two might be missing as well.

Movie plot title: Donkey Punch Movie plot: While on a holiday in Mallorca, Lisa (Sian Breckin), Kim (Jaime Winstone) and Tammi (Nichola Burley) meet four young men, Bluey (Tom Burke), Josh (Julian Morris), Sean (Robert Boulter) and Marcus (Jay Taylor). After spending the day at the resort together, the girls are invited to the men's yacht where they plan to party out at sea. While aboard the boat, they take drugs and the conversation turns to sex, and in particular, types of sexual acts. Bluey describes a sex act called a \\"donkey punch\\" which involves punching the female in the back of the head while having doggy style sex in order to increase the sexual pleasure for the man. Marcus, Bluey, Kim and Lisa go to the master bedrooms where they begin having drug-fuelled sex, watched by Josh who, in the knowledge of all involved, lingers furtively in the darkness, recording the action with a camera. Bluey, who is copulating with Lisa, asks Josh to film the action and then decides to let Josh take a turn. Josh and Lisa then have anal sex. Immediately prior to ejaculation and with Bluey's encouragement, Josh donkey punches Lisa but uses excessive force, breaking her neck and killing her instantly. To cover up the incident, the men decide to throw the body overboard while the women want to report it to the authorities, and argument ensues about what to do with the tape. Bluey continually insults Tammi and in a fit of rage, she stabs him in the chest with a penknife, and the women escape in the yacht's tender. However, the girls soon realise that the tender's outboard motor is missing (a cut scene shows it still attached to the yacht). In a fit of despair, Tammi fires a flare, attracting the attention of the men. They quickly locate and pick up the women. As the men attempt to get the women aboard, threatening them with a shotgun, Kim shoots a second flare directly at Marcus. The flare explodes into Marcus's torso and slowly burns him to death. Josh locks the recaptured women in one of the rooms below. Sean asks Josh to \\"call in\\" and request medical assistance...

These concerns may stem from various aspects, such as social, economic, environmental, or other factors, that the council could be expected to handle and resolve. The lack of proper attention to these concerns by the council may result in dissatisfaction and frustration among the affected parties. They might perceive the council's actions or inactions as an indication that their voice, opinions, and needs are being disregarded. This could lead to further problems and conflicts if left unaddressed. To rectify this situation, the council should make efforts to listen and understand the nature of the concerns more clearly. This can be achieved through open communication channels, such as public forums, meetings, or surveys, where people can express their thoughts, opinions, and grievances regarding the matter at hand. This will not only ensure that everyone's voice is heard but also help the council make better-informed decisions that take into account the diverse needs and concerns of all stakeholders. Moreover, the council can adopt a transparent and collaborative approach in decision-making processes, including regular updates and sharing of information with the public.

And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule. Question: When should sportspeople consider taking protein supplements? === The answer to the above question is Possible answers: -When they are fasting -When they are traveling -not enough information -When they are eating a high protein meal Answer:","completion":"When they are traveling or during an intense training schedule."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Cowboys working for Abe McQuown often come into town to shoot the place up, kill on just a whim, beating or humiliating any sheriff who tries to stand up to them. The Citizens' Committee decides to hire Clay Blaisedell, a renowned gunfighter, as town marshal in spite of the misgivings of some, such as old Judge Holloway who insists that the situation should be handled within the law (though a loophole prevents it from being done effectively). Blaisedell, famous for his golden-handled revolvers, arrives in Warlock with his devoted friend, Tom Morgan, his club-footed, right-hand man, who is no slouch with a gun himself. Morgan has a reputation as a heavy-drinking gambler, but Blaisedell insists that Morgan is part of the package. They even take over the local saloon and rename it the \\"French Palace\\" (something they appear to have done in previous towns, since they bring the signboard with them). Their first encounter with McQuown's men is without bloodshed. The cowboys are intimidated by Blaisedell and one, Johnny Gannon, stays behind. Gannon has been put off by their propensity for killing, particularly the shooting of victims in the back, for some time now and resolves to be more law-abiding. Morgan learns that his old flame, Lily Dollar, is coming to town on the stagecoach, and she is accompanied by Bob Nicholson, brother of Big Ben Nicholson, who was recently killed by Blaisedell. Lily had left Morgan for Big Ben and knows that Morgan pushed Ben into challenging Blaisedell, who killed him as a result. She wants Blaisedell dead to punish Morgan. Morgan sets out to meet the stagecoach but it is robbed by some of McQuown's cowboys as he watches from a distance. He takes advantage of the situation to kill Bob Nicholson unseen.

Article: Your rabbit needs to be fed the right types of food every day to ensure he has the nutrients needed for his health and digestion. This includes commercial pellets, which should be fresh as possible. Your mature rabbit should be fed at least ¼ to ½ cup of pellets every day depending on his size. If you rabbit is younger than a year old, allow him to eat as much as he wants so he can grow properly. He also needs hay to ensure he gets enough fiber for proper digestion and to prevent serious illnesses. The best hay is grass-type hay, which should be available in his cage and at meal times. Avoid making alfalfa or clover hay his main type of hay. It is too rich for his system all the time. Your Harlequin rabbit also needs leafy green vegetables give him even more fiber. Give these to him three to four times a day. These include greens include dandelion greens, raw broccoli stems, carrot tops, and lettuces of all kinds except iceberg. In order for him to process all the fiber and nutrients in his diet, your Harlequin rabbit needs to be given plenty of access to water at all times. Once common water distribution is automatic dripper bottle, which can be attached to his cage. This is easy for him to drink from and will not spill. You can use a heavy ceramic bowl if your rabbit will not use a bottle. These bowls cannot be chewed like a plastic bowl and are much harder to knock over. The water bowl should be cleaned often and checked daily. There are certain foods that are considered treats for your rabbit. These should only be fed to him in small amounts and only every so often. Treats you can give your rabbit include: Alfalfa or clover hay, which should only be given to him a few times a week in small doses because they have too much protein and calcium. Fruit and starchy vegetables, which are great in small doses but have too much sugar and starch in them for every day. Do not feed your rabbit more than two tablespoons of fruit per day.

It carries a largely positive connotation, being associated with courage, loyalty, honor, success, fortune, fertility, happiness, passion, and summer. In Chinese cultural traditions, red is associated with weddings (where brides traditionally wear red dresses) and red paper is frequently used to wrap gifts of money or other objects. Special red packets (simplified Chinese: 红包; traditional Chinese: 紅包; pinyin: hóng bāo in Mandarin or lai see in Cantonese) are specifically used during Chinese New Year celebrations for giving monetary gifts. On the more negative side, obituaries are traditionally written in red ink, and to write someone's name in red signals either cutting them out of one's life, or that they have died. Red is also associated with either the feminine or the masculine (yin and yang respectively), depending on the source.

People have generally viewed personal growth as a result or product that can easily be identified and measured. The worker who gets a rise, the student whose grades improve, the foreigner who learns a new language--all these are examples of people who have measurable results to show for their efforts. By contrast, the process of personal growth is much more difficult to determine, since it is a journey and not the specific signposts or landmarks along the way. The process is not the road itself, but rather the attitudes and feelings people have, their caution or courage, as they meet with new experiences and unexpected obstacles . In this process, the journey never really ends; there are always new ways to experience the world, new ideas to try, new challenges to accept. In order to grow, to travel new roads, people need to have a willingness to take risks, to face the unknown, and to accept the possibility that they may \\"fail\\" at first. How we see ourselves as we try a new way of being is extremely important to our ability to grow. Do we notice ourselves as quick and curious? If so, then we tend to take more chances and to be more open to unfamiliar experiences. Do we think we're shy and indecisive? Then our sense of fear can cause us to hesitate, to move slowly, and we think we're slow to adapt to change or that we're not smart enough to deal with a new challenge. Then we are likely to take a more passive role or not try at all. These feelings of insecurity and self-doubt are both unavoidable and necessary if we are to change and grow. If we protect ourselves too much, then we stop growing. We become trapped inside a shell of our own making. Question: Which of the following would be the best title for the text?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How do you do this: Make a hair dryer holder.","completion":"Making a hair dryer holder can be a fun and creative project that can help you organize your bathroom space more efficiently. A hair dryer holder keeps your hair dryer within easy reach and prevents potential hazards from loose cords lying around. To make a hair dryer holder, follow these detailed steps: Materials and tools required: 1. Measuring tape or ruler 2. Pencil or marker 3. Wood, PVC pipe, metal pipe, or an appropriate equivalent material 4. Wood or fabric base (optional) 5. Screws or nails, or glue suitable for the chosen material 6. Drill with appropriate bits 7. Saw for cutting the chosen material 8. Sandpaper or sanding block (optional) 9. Paint or varnish (optional) 10. The hair dryer you want to make the holder for Step by step instructions: 1. Measure and Plan: Take measurements of your hair dryer, mainly the nozzle diameter and the length of the hair dryer. Keep in mind that the holder should be wide enough to hold the hair dryer securely, but not too tight; there should be enough room for easy access. Also, consider where you want to place the holder - on the wall, inside a cabinet, or on a countertop. 2. Choose the Material: Based on your preference and available materials, choose a suitable material, such as wood, PVC pipe, or metal pipe, which can be molded or cut into the desired shape to hold the hair dryer. 3. Cutting the Material: For a simple cylindrical holder, cut the chosen material to the appropriate length based on the width of your hair dryer's nozzle. If you're using wood or a flat material, cut a long strip and roll it into a tube-like shape. If using a PVC or metal pipe, cut a section of the pipe to the desired length. 4. Creating the Opening: To create the opening for the hair dryer, cut a curvy U-shaped or a semi-circular opening on the top of the material, along the entire length of the holder. This will allow you to slide the hair dryer in and out easily. 5. Smoothing and Finishing: Smooth out any rough edges or corners of the chosen material using sandpaper or a sanding block to ensure it won't scratch your hair dryer. If you like, you can paint or varnish the holder to match your bathroom decor. 6. Attaching the Holder: For wall or cabinet mounting, drill screw holes in the appropriate areas of the holder (and on an additional base plate, if necessary) and use screws or nails to attach it to the wall or cabinet. For a freestanding countertop holder, attach the holder to a base, such as a piece of wood or fabric, using screws or a strong adhesive. 7. Positioning the Hair Dryer: Once the holder is securely mounted, slide your hair dryer into the holder, ensuring a snug fit. The hair dryer should be easily accessible and the cord should be manageable. 8. Cord Management: To keep the power cord from tangling or cluttering your space, consider adding a hook or loop near the base of the holder, so you can wrap and secure the cable neatly. That's it! You now have a custom-made hair dryer holder that keeps your bathroom organized while also preventing any potential accidents caused by loose cords."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer to this question: What metric indicates \\"warmth\\" or \\"coolness\\"?","completion":"The metric that indicates the \\"warmth\\" or \\"coolness\\" of the light emitted by a source is called Correlated Color Temperature (CCT). It is predominantly used in the lighting industry to define light source color properties. The CCT is measured in Kelvin (K) and provides an indication of the apparent warmth or coolness of a light source. A lower CCT value (ranging from 2000K to 3000K) indicates a warmer, more yellowish light, while a higher CCT value (ranging from 4500K to 6500K and above) indicates a cooler, more bluish light. In general, warm white light is often used for residential and hospitality applications where a cozy and inviting atmosphere is desired. On the other hand, cool white light is typically used in commercial and industrial spaces, such as offices, retail stores, and warehouses, where a more alert and focused environment is important. It is important to note that while CCT provides information about the warmth or coolness of a light source, it doesn't necessarily give a complete understanding of the light's color characteristics. This is where the Color Rendering Index (CRI) comes into play. CRI is a metric that indicates the light source's ability to faithfully reproduce the colors of objects, making them appear natural and vibrant. A high CRI value (close to 100) generally means that the light source is better at rendering colors accurately, while a lower CRI value (below 80) can lead to a less accurate perception of colors."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose belief is shared that Davenport has become too emotionally close to his command? , can you please find it?

CONTEXT: Partida de la intervención estadounidense A lo largo de la década de 1960, los militares estadounidenses se habían visto envueltos en refriegas con algún muerto, en dos ocasiones. Fue la llamada «etapa de los asesores». Al principio los asesores militares estadounidenses estaban en el sureste asiático para formar una fuerza de irregulares en las Tierras Altas Centrales e instruir al Ejército de Vietnam del Sur en tácticas, mantenimiento de aeronaves y otras funciones auxiliares. No tenían permiso para intervenir en los combates, mucho menos para preparar acciones contra los guerrilleros; pero más de una vez se saltaron esta prohibición en la que sería, quizá, la primera de una larga lista de violaciones jurídicas e ilegalidades que harían famosa esta guerra.

It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness. In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in \\"Lust of the White Serpant\\" cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself \\"disturbed and agitated\\" by her \\"ethereal beauty\\". In \\"Eternal Prisoner,\\" Madame White Snake's bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning \\"he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.\\" Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes \\"Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine's characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not\\".

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"The question appears to be combining two unrelated topics - barrier methods of birth control and the spinning of turbine blades in a wind turbine. However, I will address each topic individually and then discuss any potential impact. A. Barrier methods of birth control: Barrier methods of birth control, such as condoms and diaphragms, work by preventing sperm from entering the uterus and fertilizing an egg. These methods are physical barriers that prevent conception by blocking the sperm from uniting with the egg. The use of barrier methods can be an effective way of preventing pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), but they have no impact on energy generation or wind turbines. B. Wind turbine spins: As described in the initial process, the wind turbine system is designed to generate electricity through the following sequence: 1. Wind passes the turbines and moves the blades. 2. The shaft of the turbine spins. 3. The shaft is connected to a generator. 4. The generator uses the spins of the shaft to rotate a rotor. 5. The rotor spins inside the core, which has magnets inside surrounded by wire loops. 6. The spinning of the rotor in the core generates electricity. The spinning of the turbine blades is affected by factors such as wind speed, turbine blade design, angle of the blades, and air density. The efficiency of the turbine can be influenced by these variables, some of which may be controlled or optimized to generate more energy. C. Potential connection and influence of barrier methods on turbine spins: As previously mentioned, there is no observable relationship or connection between the use of barrier methods of birth control and the spinning of wind turbine blades. The two subjects are distinctly different and unrelated. In addressing the supposed perturbation, it is clear that the use of barrier methods for birth control has no effect on the spinning of turbine blades in the context of wind energy generation. The two areas of focus are independent of each other, and any changes or influences in one process will not have any direct impact on the other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a title for this article: NEW YORK -- Federal authorities raided a government-funded health clinic Wednesday run by New York's state Senate majority leader a day after he was accused of siphoning 14 million from the nonprofit operation. Attorney General Andrew Cuomo confirmed that his office is assisting Brooklyn federal prosecutors in a corruption probe of state Sen. Pedro Espada Jr., with potential charges that could include mail fraud, wire fraud, theft of government funds and conspiracy. In a civil lawsuit Tuesday, Cuomo accused Espada and relatives and friends on the clinic's board of looting clinic funds for lavish restaurant meals, trips to Las Vegas and Espada's campaign. Cuomo said Wednesday it was clear Espada had broken the law. But Espada called the federal raids \\"an invasion\\" and denied any wrongdoing. He accused Cuomo of staging a politically motivated vendetta against him. Espada was a leader of a Republican-backed coup last summer that he claims is motivating Cuomo's lawsuit. Espada later rejoined the Democrats and received the majority leader title. About a dozen FBI and IRS agents and investigators from Cuomo's office spent eight hours Wednesday at the Soundview Healthcare Network in the Bronx, where a canopy above the front door lists Espada as its president and CEO. Agents used bolt cutters to open an 8-foot-tall, 25-foot-long storage container behind the building and removed Espada campaign posters and other items. More than 30 boxes of files and materials were carted away in a van. Agents wearing blue or green gloves leafed through the contents, taking notes. One box was marked, \\"Payroll 205.\\" Another said \\"Timesheets 205-206.\\" In a late afternoon news conference, Espada said he would fight the \\"false and unfounded allegations made by the attorney general.\\" He called the raids \\"a media circus, a media show.\\" \\"The attorney general wants to create this impression of wrongdoing when there is no wrongdoing,\\" he said. Espada brushed aside several specific questions about the charges. Cuomo's civil action accuses Espada of diverting the clinic's funding charitable assets to himself, relatives, friends and his political operation. FBI spokesman James Margolin would not comment on what was seized from the clinic. A search warrant affidavit was sealed. The IRS declined to comment Wednesday. In the civil suit, Cuomo also accused Espada of getting Soundview's board, which he controls, to give him a guaranteed 9 million severance package that, if ever paid out, would bankrupt the clinic. In 2004, then-Attorney General Spitzer charged two of Soundview's vice presidents, Espada's executive assistant and a clinic director with grand larceny and scheming to defraud. Two of them were accused of filing false reports, a concern Cuomo raised in his civil lawsuit on Tuesday. Espada was not charged, but he and his campaign were later fined 61,000 by the city for campaign-finance violations involving Soundview employees who had been reimbursed for their contributions. Cuomo's lawsuit broaches the use of clinic money for campaign contributions, but a state Board of Elections spokesman said the allegations appear to center on tax law - with potential federal law enforcement jurisdiction - more than state election law. The clinic remained open to patients throughout Wednesday's raid. Solsire Bobet, who was at the clinic with two toddlers for test results, described the clinic as \\"my second home\\" and said she came to the facility to see the dentist and for care during her four pregnancies. \\"For everything I come here,\\" she said, adding she knew about Espada. \\"I know he is responsible for this place.\\" Outside, a huge sign in the grass bears a picture of Espada surrounded by smiling children and a list of clinic services. Espada was excused from the legislative session for the day but little was done in his absence. Without him, the Senate's Democratic majority lacked the 32 votes needed to pass any legislation without Republican support and adjourned after less than an hour. With a state budget three weeks overdue and major legislation pending, the session had been expected to last several hours. Associated Press writers Tom Hays and David B. Caruso in New York and Michael Gormley in Albany, N.Y., contributed to this report.","completion":"Title: \\"Raid on State Senate Majority Leader's Clinic: Allegations of a 14 Million Scandal and Corruption Probe\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Unfortunately, I had absolutely no idea what I wanted my future occupation to be. The only thing I did know was that I did not want to spend the next 45 years teaching, being a nurse or sitting in an office. But that was before the postman delivered a catalogue of courses that were being offered at the local college. As I looked through it, I was attracted by a page that talked about the difficulties faced by deaf people in their everyday lives and how students could help by learning sign language. It went on to say that graduates of the course usually find work in different organizations, such as law companies, the Stock Exchange, insurance companies and banks. Then I saw something that really caught my eye: \\"Singer\\" are also needed for sporting events, concerts, theatrical performances and, believe it or not, circuses! By the time I got to the bottom of the page, I knew I had found the perfect occupation. I enrolled on the course, which to my parents' great delight was free of charge. The course was brilliant. My favourite part was the final lesson, when our teacher asked us to sign our favourite song.

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","completion":"To evaluate the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"If he has to wait, John gets angry,\\" I will perform a step-by-step analysis looking at important linguistic aspects, such as grammar, syntax, and semantics: 1. Grammar: The sentence is comprised of two clauses, \\"If he has to wait\\" and \\"John gets angry,\\" connected by the conjunction \\"if,\\" which introduces a conditional relationship. In terms of grammar, both clauses are constructed correctly. 2. Syntax: The arrangement of words in the sentence follows English syntax rules. The subject \\"he\\" precedes the verb phrase \\"has to wait,\\" and the subject \\"John\\" precedes the verb \\"gets\\" followed by the adjective \\"angry.\\" 3. Semantics: The meaning of the sentence is clear: if there is a situation where he (John) is forced to wait, it causes him to become angry. 4. Pronoun clarity: Although the sentence uses the pronoun \\"he\\" in the first clause, it is subsequently clarified to refer to \\"John\\" in the second clause. However, it may be more straightforward and concise to use \\"John\\" in both clauses: \\"If John has to wait, he gets angry.\\" 5. Contextual ambiguity: It is worth noting that without additional context, the specific situations, conditions, or reasons why John gets angry when he has to wait are not clear. The sentence leaves some room for interpretation. Overall, the linguistic integrity of the sentence is decent, as it adheres to fundamental grammar, syntax, and semantic rules. Improving the pronoun clarity by using \\"John\\" in both clauses could enhance the sentence structure.

Place the medication into the nebulizer. Attach the mouthpiece. Connect the tubing. Article:","completion":"Title: How to Properly Use a Nebulizer for Medication Administration Introduction: Using a nebulizer for medication administration is a common method for patients with respiratory conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A nebulizer is a device that converts liquid medication into a fine mist, which the patient then inhales through a mouthpiece. It's a convenient and effective way to deliver medication directly to a patient's airways, which can potentially improve the overall effectiveness of the treatment. In this article, we'll walk you through the step-by-step process of using a nebulizer to ensure that you're administering medication correctly and safely. Step 1: Wash Your Hands Before beginning any medical procedure, it's crucial to wash your hands thoroughly. This helps to prevent the transmission of bacteria and viruses that may harm you or the person for whom you're administering medication. With clean hands, you're less likely to contaminate the nebulizer or medication, which can lead to an infection. Step 2: Place the Medication into the Nebulizer Carefully read and follow the instructions provided by your healthcare provider or pharmacist regarding the specific dosage and method of administration for your medication. This will typically involve placing the prescribed amount of liquid medication into the nebulizer's medicine cup. Make sure you measure the dose accurately, as this is vital for ensuring the proper amount of medication reaches your airways. Step 3: Attach the Mouthpiece Once the medication has been added to the nebulizer, attach the mouthpiece securely to the medicine cup. If you're using a mask instead of a mouthpiece, be sure to affix it correctly. The mouthpiece or mask must create a tight seal to ensure that the medication is inhaled directly into your airways and not lost to the environment. Step 4: Connect the Tubing The next step is to connect the nebulizer tubing to the medicine cup and the air compressor. Make sure that all connections are secure and airtight to prevent any loss of medication during the treatment process. Once everything is connected, switch on the air compressor, and the liquid medication will transform into a mist. Step 5: Administering the Medication Hold the nebulizer in an upright position and breathe in slowly and deeply through the mouthpiece or mask. Make sure to take slow, consistent breaths, as rapid inhalations may cause the medicine to deposit in your mouth and throat rather than your airways. Continue the breathing process until the medication is fully consumed, which can typically take between 5 and 20 minutes, depending on the type and amount of medication you're prescribed. Conclusion: When using a nebulizer, it's essential to follow these steps correctly to achieve the best possible results from your medication. Always consult with your healthcare provider if you have any questions or concerns about using a nebulizer or if you experience any side effects during or after treatment. Proper use of a nebulizer can greatly improve the quality of life for patients with respiratory conditions, allowing them to breathe easier and enjoy a greater level of comfort and freedom."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a title for this article: Warren Buffett has gotten a lot of ink for his 5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs, but his other deal - the 4.7 billion takeover of Constellation Energy Group - might have been an even better one. How good a deal? Think about it this way. To build a brand new nuclear plant - assuming you can get the permits and the loans - would cost about 6 billion (at least), take about 10 years, and in the end would produce about 1,000 megawatts. Buffett has bought himself a company with 9,000 megawatts of electric power production, including four nuclear plants, for less than the price of a single new nuclear unit. Oh, and he also got the Baltimore utility, an energy trading operation and a few other odds and ends, too. Of course those Constellation nuclear plants aren't new. But they're also generating relatively cheap electricity now, and for the next few years electricity costs are almost definitely heading up. And if Congress and the next president agree on a cap-and-trade approach to climate change legislation that puts a price on carbon emissions, those nuclear plants will be even more profitable. It's always fun to look back at a company's annual report after it collapses, and Constellation's is no exception. The most recent annual report boasts of having been named to Business Week's list of the 50 best performing companies in the S&P 500. It talks about \\"making responsible choices\\" and having \\"built our company into one of the most influential - and successful - energy companies.\\" But Constellation Energy became, in part, a victim of the credit crunch. In August it disclosed that it had underestimated by about 1 billion the amount of additional collateral it would need if its credit rating were cut. As the stock price slipped and credit tightened, its ratings were in danger and a sale of the company was the only choice. The deal was arranged in about 48 hours. One of the main reasons, if not the main reason, Constellation Energy needed cash was for use by its energy trading operation, which had 6 billion in arrangements with counterparties. Greg Abel, the chief executive of MidAmerican Energy, the Buffett-owned company that is making the acquisition, suggested that the trading operation would be scaled back. But MidAmerican can close down the trading operation and the acquisition will still look very profitable. Utilities don't need to have trading operations to be worried about the credit crisis. Thomas R. Kuhn, president of the Edison Electric Institute, sent a letter to members of the U.S. Senate warning that short-term borrowing costs had increased sharply for utilities, most of which do not have the top credit rating available and most of which have big capital needs for the maintenance and construction of electric power facilities. Kuhn warned that high borrowing costs could add to rate increases and that limited credit availability could delay needed maintenance or project construction. Big oil companies, on the other hand, don't need to worry about the credit crisis, of course. They are sitting on huge piles of cash. \\"We have a strong balance sheet and our investments are multi-decade, so blips in the marketplace don't affect us,\\" said Marvin Odum, president of Shell Oil Co. Here's a fun way to think about the two extremes of fortune in the energy business, as some firms benefit from high oil prices while others struggle with the credit crunch. Exxon Mobil has a 39 billion cash hoard. For less than one percent of that, it could buy one of the nation's two biggest producers of ethanol, VeraSun, whose stock has been beaten down after the company made a bad bet on corn prices over the summer. Exxon wouldn't do that, even though VeraSun is looking for \\"strategic alternatives,\\" the usual code for being on the block. Exxon is cautious and likes to stick to its oily knitting. And the ethanol business is growing, but that doesn't mean it will be very profitable. With Congress and the Bush administration fiddling over the details of the bank bailout bill, the next week or two could bring some other news of energy industry troubles or takeovers. Stay tuned.

Ice ocean had few submarine volcanoes, while Tropical ocean had thousands of active volcanoes on the ocean floor. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which ocean had fewer hydrophones on the ocean floor? Hint: Submarine volcanoes are common features of the ocean floor. In shallow water, active volcanoes disclose their presence by blasting steam and rocky debris high above the ocean's surface. In the ocean's deep, the tremendous weight of the water above prevents the explosive release of steam and gases; however, they can be detected by hydrophones and discoloration of water because of volcanic gases. Pillow lava is a common eruptive product of submarine volcanoes and is characterized by thick sequences of discontinuous pillow-shaped masses which form under water. Even large submarine eruptions may not disturb the ocean surface due to the rapid cooling effect and increased buoyancy of water (as compared to air) which often causes volcanic vents to form steep pillars on the ocean floor. Hydrothermal vents are common near these volcanoes, and some support peculiar ecosystems based on dissolved minerals. Over time, the formations created by submarine volcanoes may become so large that they break the ocean surface as new islands or floating pumice rafts. Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, the Ice Ocean had fewer hydrophones on the ocean floor. This is because the Ice Ocean had only a few submarine volcanoes, while the Tropical Ocean had thousands of active volcanoes. Since hydrophones are used to detect submarine volcanoes through the sounds they produce and the discoloration of water due to volcanic gases, it can be inferred that an ocean with more submarine volcanoes, like the Tropical Ocean, would require more hydrophones for monitoring and detection purposes. In contrast, the Ice Ocean, with fewer submarine volcanoes, would require fewer hydrophones to cover its ocean floor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Our class size is small, so we get to know our classmates well compared to other grad programs. Since we started seven months ago, I've noticed one of our married students (Sally) hanging out a lot with another guy in our class (Jake). Sally's husband (Terry) is back home working, and they've been married for over a year. &amp;#x200B; Sally and Jake always sit next to each other in class, walk between classes together, and even hang out just talking when class is over. When they hang out, they talk for about an hour, sometimes more. Their body language when talking is usually flirtatious. For example, Sally will sometimes punch Jake in the arm when laughing, or they'll get super close when showing each other something on their phone. Other times, their conversations appear more serious. I first noticed them hanging out five months ago, and they do this 4-5 times a week. I also saw them on a walk together late at night, and they often go to the lab together outside of class. &amp;#x200B; A couple of my close classmates have also noticed their behavior. It became super obvious when Sally and Jake recently practiced one of our clinical skills on each other for two hours during class; everyone else was able to get it done and swap partners after half an hour. We started making inside jokes about them and will take pictures of them together as a way to confirm our theory. &amp;#x200B; It's bad enough that I wonder if I should send Terry a message (anonymously) saying that Sally may be emotionally involved with her classmate. It takes a lot of trust to spend months at a time apart from a spouse, and from what I've seen, I believe Sally is violating that trust by spending a lot of time with Jake. If I were Terry, I'd want to know if my spouse may be emotionally involved with someone else. Also, If I were Sally, I wouldn't spend one-on-one time with someone of the opposite sex nearly as much as Sally is. &amp;#x200B; AITA if I send Terry an anonymous message with a couple of pictures telling him Sally may be involved in an emotional affair?

It is not the author's position to intervene in Sally and Terry's relationship unless they have a close friendship with Terry. Instead, the author could try to express their concerns to Sally directly, asking her if everything is alright in her relationship and if she might be crossing boundaries with Jake. - Sally: Is Sally wrong for potentially having an emotional affair with Jake? Answer: If Sally is indeed having an emotional affair, she is wrong for violating her husband's trust and not addressing any issues within her marriage. - Jake: Is Jake wrong for spending so much time with Sally and potentially getting involved in an emotional affair? Answer: If Jake is aware of Sally's marital status and is actively pursuing an emotional affair, he is wrong for not respecting the boundaries of her marriage. - Nobody: Is nobody wrong in this situation?

Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E.

White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center.

Step 1: Choose the perfect cabbage When you go shopping with mom and dad, help them pick a cabbage that looks fresh and crisp. That means it should be bright green and have nice, firm leaves on the outside. If you see any leaves that look brown or yucky, that's not the cabbage we want. Step 2: Time for a cabbage makeover Now that we have our perfect cabbage, it's time to get it ready. First, we need to take off any damaged leaves we might find. Those are yucky leaves, which we don't want to eat. You can ask mom or dad to help you, if needed. Step 3: Cut the cabbage into pieces Once we have a nice, clean cabbage, we need to cut it into pieces that are easier to eat. Ask your mom or dad to help you cut the cabbage into two halves or even four quarters so that you won't hurt your fingers. Step 4: Removing the core The core is the tough, hard part in the center of the cabbage. It's not so tasty, so let's remove it. Ask your mom or dad to help you again. They can cut around the core and take it out for you. Step 5: Shredding the cabbage (if needed) Sometimes, we want to make our cabbage even tinier by shredding it into small pieces. This is great for salads! Ask your mom or dad to help you cut the cabbage into really thin, tiny strips. This way, we can have lots of little pieces of cabbage that are easy to eat. Step 6: Washing the cabbage Last but not least, we need to give our cabbage a bath! Ask your mom or dad to help you wash the cabbage in a big bowl or under the kitchen faucet. This will get rid of any dirt or germs that could be hiding on our yummy cabbage. And that's it, my little friends! You've learned how to choose and prepare cabbage all by yourself.

Go for Stevia leaf extract.","completion":"Title: Navigating the World of Artificial Sweeteners: A Guide to Choosing Healthier Options Introduction: The world of artificial sweeteners is vast and can be quite confusing, especially considering the numerous research studies and often conflicting information about the health concerns surrounding these products. This article aims to help our readers understand the health concerns around artificial sweeteners and provide guidance on which products to avoid or consider using in their everyday lives. Why are Artificial Sweeteners Health Concerns? Artificial sweeteners, often used as a sugar substitute for people trying to cut down on their calorie intake, have been linked to various health concerns. Some studies suggest that they may lead to weight gain, metabolic issues, and even an increased risk of certain diseases. It is essential to keep these concerns in mind when choosing an artificial sweetener to ensure that the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks. Not All Artificial Sweeteners are Created Equal: While there are numerous artificial sweeteners available on the market, not all of them are the same when it comes to how they impact our health. Here, we will explore three artificial sweeteners commonly found in everyday products and understand why they should be avoided. 1. Aspartame Aspartame, a widely used artificial sweetener, has been a topic of controversy for many years regarding its safety. Some research suggests that aspartame may be linked to headaches, migraines, and even a higher risk of certain neurological conditions. Due to these concerns and the ongoing debate surrounding its safety, it is best to avoid aspartame wherever possible. 2. Saccharin Saccharin is another well-known artificial sweetener that has been on the market for over a century. Saccharin has faced scrutiny in the past due to concerns about it potentially being a carcinogen; however, the FDA still considers it safe for human consumption. Despite this, recent studies still suggest a link between saccharin and metabolic dysfunction. In light of this, it is better to avoid saccharin as a precautionary measure. 3. Sucralose Sucralose is an artificial sweetener that is used in a wide range of products, from sugar-free beverages to baked goods. It is structurally similar to sugar, which can have some implications on gut health and metabolism. Some studies have suggested that sucralose may negatively impact the beneficial bacteria in our gut, which play a vital role in maintaining a healthy digestive system. Therefore, it is wise to avoid sucralose to protect and maintain a healthy gut. The Safer, Healthier Option: Stevia Leaf Extract So, with so many potential health concerns surrounding the use of artificial sweeteners, what can we turn to instead? Fortunately, there is a natural alternative that is considered a healthier option: Stevia leaf extract. Stevia is a plant-based sweetener that comes from the Stevia rebaudiana plant and is up to 300 times sweeter than regular sugar. Unlike other artificial sweeteners, stevia leaf extract has been shown to have minimal side effects and has even been associated with health benefits such as weight loss and improved blood sugar control in some studies. Conclusion: When considering artificial sweeteners, it is crucial to recognize the potential health concerns associated with them. By being mindful of the potential risks and opting for healthier alternatives such as stevia leaf extract, we can make more informed decisions about our diets and overall health. Always consult your healthcare provider or registered dietitian for personalized guidance and recommendations before making any significant changes to your diet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: For the second time in three weeks, the Patriots went on the road to square off against an undefeated team; the 10-0 Saints entered the game with the most points scored in the league. After the Patriots deferred the opening coin toss, the Saints returned the opening kickoff to their own 35-yard line before a 33-yard pass from Drew Brees to wide receiver Devery Henderson on the game's first play put the Saints quickly in Patriots territory. However, the Patriots defense stopped the Saints on a 3rd-and-4 from the 15-yard line, setting up a 30-yard John Carney field goal. The Patriots responded by holding the ball for nearly eight minutes, advancing 80 yards on a 14-play drive that ended in a 4-yard touchdown run by Maroney on 4th-and-1, the second such conversion of the drive. The score put the Patriots ahead 7-3. The Saints did not reach midfield on their next drive and punted; however, the Patriots turned the ball back over when on the ensuing play Brady was intercepted by cornerback Mike McKenzie, who returned it eight yards to the Saints' 41-yard line. Seven plays later, early in the second quarter, the Saints took a 10-7 lead when a Brees dump-off pass to running back Pierre Thomas resulted in an 18-yard touchdown. The Patriots could not reach midfield on their next possession and punted. On the ensuing play, Brees connected with Henderson on a 75-yard touchdown pass that extended the Saints' lead to 17-7. The Patriots faced a 3rd-and-12 early on their next drive, but Brady threw a 33-yard pass to Aiken to move the Patriots into Saints territory. The drive stalled at the Saints' 18-yard line, forcing a 36-yard Gostkowski field goal to cut the Saints' lead to 17-10. Four plays later, Brees hit former Patriots tight end David Thomas on a 25-yard pass before wide receiver Robert Meachem caught a 38-yard touchdown pass to give the Saints a 24-10 lead with just under two minutes left in the half. The Patriots' offense was able to reach the Saints' 32-yard line on first down with 35 seconds left, but advanced no further, setting up a 50-yard Gostkowski field goal attempt on fourth down that fell wide left. With possession to begin the second half, the Patriots lost it when a 6-yard pass to Maroney, the first play of the half, resulted in a fumble by Maroney at the Patriots' 26-yard line. Saints defensive tackle Sedrick Ellis recovered the fumble and returned it seven yards before he too fumbled; Welker recovered the ball for the Patriots at that spot. Later in the drive, on 3rd-and-9 from their own 42-yard line, Brady hit Aiken on an 11-yard pass to convert; on the play, Brady passed Drew Bledsoe as the Patriots' all-time passing leader. Two plays later, Brady connected with Moss on a 47-yard pass down to the Saints' 2-yard line, setting up a 2-yard Maroney touchdown run that cut the Saints' lead to 24-17. However, the Saints responded on their next play with a 68-yard pass from Brees to wide receiver Marques Colston, setting up a 2-yard touchdown catch by tight end Darnell Dinkins two plays later, re-establishing a 14-point Saints lead. The Patriots moved down to the Saints' 10-yard on their next drive, but attempted to convert on 4th-and-4 from that spot instead of kicking a field goal; Brady's pass attempt to Moss fell incomplete. The Saints' next drive spanned into the fourth quarter but ended on a punt from the Saints' own 35-yard line. The Patriots fared no better, going three-and-out on their ensuing possession. The Saints continued to build a lead when Brees ended a 9-play, 75-yard drive with a 20-yard touchdown pass to Colston. Down 38-17 with under eight minutes to go, the Patriots tried to mount a drive but two plays in, Brady was intercepted by safety Darren Sharper on a deep pass; Sharper returned it 38 yards to the Patriots' 25-yard line. However, the Saints could not convert a first down and Carney missed a 37-yard field goal wide right. With 5:26 remaining in the game and down 21 points, the Patriots replaced Brady with his backup, Hoyer, on their next possession; the Patriots went three-and-out. After a Saints punt, the Patriots held the ball for the final 1:52 of the game, ending it on an 8-yard sack of Hoyer. With the loss, the Patriots dropped to 7-4 on the season, and 1-4 in road games.

Process: - The air is cold - Water is in the air - The water forms tiny ice crystals - The ice crystals collide with each other - The ice crystals stick to each other - The ice crystals get bigger as more of them stick together - The ice crystals get too heavy to be in the air - The ice crystals become snowflakes - The snow flakes fall to the ground as snow. Question: suppose there may be a drought happens, how will it affect MORE snow. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","completion":"B: Less A drought is a prolonged period of abnormally low rainfall, leading to a shortage of water in a particular region. During a drought, there will be much less moisture in the atmosphere, which in turn affects the formation and abundance of snow. To understand how a drought can lead to less snow, let's revisit the snow formation process and examine how drought conditions can impact each stage of the process. 1. The air is cold - Droughts typically occur when there is a lack of precipitation over an extended period. If a drought is happening during the winter months, the air might still be cold, which is a necessary condition for snow formation. 2. Water is in the air - During a drought, the amount of water vapor in the air is significantly lower than usual. Reduced water vapor in the atmosphere due to drought conditions negatively affects the snow formation process, as there is not enough moisture available to form ice crystals. 3. The water forms tiny ice crystals - The limited water vapor present in the air during a drought reduces the formation of ice crystals. With fewer ice crystals present, there is a decreased likelihood of snow formation. 4. The ice crystals collide with each other - Due to the reduced number of ice crystals in the atmosphere, their chances of colliding with each other and sticking together are diminished. 5. The ice crystals stick to each other - With fewer ice crystals colliding, the ice crystals that do manage to come into contact with each other will struggle to combine and grow, further hindering the snow formation process. 6. The ice crystals get bigger as more of them stick together - Since there are fewer ice crystals sticking together, it becomes increasingly difficult for individual ice crystals to grow and ultimately become snowflakes. 7. The ice crystals get too heavy to be in the air - With limited growth in ice crystals, they may never become heavy enough to fall from the atmosphere as snowflakes, leading to less or no snowfall during a drought. 8. The ice crystals become snowflakes - Due to the disrupted snow formation process, fewer snowflakes are formed during drought conditions. 9. The snowflakes fall to the ground as snow - With the reduced number of snowflakes, there will be less snow falling to the ground during a drought. In conclusion, during a drought, the snow formation process is significantly affected due to the limited water vapor in the air. As a result, there will be less snowfall in the affected region, further exacerbating the dry conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information: - Old French (', ', \\"\\"; Modern French ) was the Gallo-Romance dialect continuum spoken from the 9th century to the 14th century. In the 14th century, these dialects came to be collectively known as the \\"langues d'oïl\\", contrasting with the \\"langue d'oc\\" or Occitan language in the south of France. The mid-14th century is taken as the transitional period to Middle French, the language of the French Renaissance, specifically based on the dialect of the Île-de-France region. - Emperor Seinei ( Seinei - tenn ) was the 22nd emperor of Japan , according to the traditional order of succession . No firm dates can be assigned to this emperor 's life or reign , but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 480 -- 484 . - Empress dowager (also dowager empress or empress mother) is the English language translation of the title given to the mother of a Chinese, Japanese, Korean or Vietnamese emperor. - An empire is defined as \\"an aggregate of nations or people ruled over by an emperor or other powerful sovereign or government, usually a territory of greater extent than a kingdom, as the former British Empire, French Empire, Brazilian Empire, Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, Byzantine Empire or Roman Empire.\\" An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, or of territories far remote from the homeland, such as a colonial empire. - An emperor (through Old French \\"empereor\\" from ) is a monarch, usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm. Empress, the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife (\\"empress consort\\"), mother (\\"empress dowager\\"), or a woman who rules in her own right (\\"empress regnant\\"). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings. In Europe the title of Emperor was, since the Middle Ages, considered equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope, due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of Western Europe. The Emperor of Japan is the only currently reigning monarch whose title is translated into English as \\"Emperor\\". - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Honour (also honor in American English, see spelling differences) is an abstract concept entailing a perceived quality of worthiness and respectability that affects both the social standing and the self-evaluation of an individual or corporate body such as a family, school, regiment or nation. Accordingly, individuals (or corporate bodies) are assigned worth and stature based on the harmony of their actions with a specific code of honour, and the moral code of the society at large.

A:","completion":"Emperor Seinei, the 22nd emperor of Japan, would have the relation 'languages spoken or written' with Old Japanese, which was the language spoken in Japan during his reign. Old Japanese is considered the earliest form of the Japanese language and was spoken from the 8th to the 10th century.

Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: If we find a bird nest , we will have a good place of watching and knowing about birds. Birds sit on eggs and take care of their babies from April to June. Because the baby birds are too young to leave the nest, parents often go to look for food and come back in several minutes. So it is good to watch birds. When we watch birds, we'd better hide ourselves in a close place to the nest, and it's better to use binoculars . But how do we make a bird nest? A good bird nest must be very fine, strong, thick and comfortable. If you want to make one, please follow these: a) Each nest must have six boards for its cover and floor, for its left and right sides, and for its front and back sides. Don't make the boards too slippery . b) Dig a small hole in the front of the nest as a \\"door\\". The \\"door\\" is big enough so birds can fly in or out easily. c) Make sure the rainwater can't go into the nest. d) One piece of the board should be easy to open. e) Don't forget to colour the nest.

Here is a premise: \\"A kid in a white T-shirt doing a stunt on a skateboard while another kid in an orange shirt also on a skateboard looks on.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"Two kids skip class to skateboard.\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","completion":"The premise given is: \\"A kid in a white T-shirt doing a stunt on a skateboard while another kid in an orange shirt also on a skateboard looks on.\\" The hypothesis stated is: \\"Two kids skip class to skateboard.\\" In order to dissect the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, we must first understand each component separately and then assess whether the premise provides enough evidence to justify the hypothesis. Starting with the premise, we have a specific scene being described: two kids are skateboarding. One of them, wearing a white T-shirt, is attempting a stunt as the other, dressed in an orange shirt, observes. This premise provides a clear visual representation of the scene but doesn't offer much background information or context. We know only what the kids are wearing, the fact that one is performing a stunt, and that the other one is watching. Now, let's examine the hypothesis: \\"Two kids skip class to skateboard.\\" Here, the hypothesis presents a possible scenario in which these kids are involved. It suggests that the kids are deliberately missing class to spend time skateboarding instead. In contrast to the premise, the hypothesis provides a reason (skipping class) for the situation that's unfolding, but it doesn't give any descriptive or visual detail beyond tying them to skateboarding. After analyzing both components separately, we can now evaluate the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis and whether the premise tells us if the hypothesis is true. The premise only mentions the kids' actions and clothing, leaving out any contextual information, such as their reason for skateboarding, the time of day, or where this scene takes place. While the hypothesis does propose a reason behind the skateboarding activity, the premise doesn't offer any evidence that the kids are skipping class or that they are even students in the first place. In conclusion, the premise does not provide sufficient information to determine whether the hypothesis is true. The premise only depicts a visual snapshot of the kids' actions, while the hypothesis posits a particular scenario for why the kids are skateboarding. However, the premise does not give any details or background information that would support or refute the hypothesis. To assess the validity of the hypothesis, we would need additional context or evidence beyond what is provided in the premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and... Building a roadmap probably lasts - A few days - A few years - A few decades - not enough information A:","completion":"Building a successful roadmap is an essential task for any community or team working on a project, especially those that involve complex coordination across various individuals, resources, and timeframes. It is important to emphasize that a roadmap is not merely a bureaucratic exercise, but rather a tool that offers multiple benefits such as providing direction, ensuring documented commitments, and fostering a sense of accomplishment. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to build an effective roadmap: 1. Start with the vision and objectives: The first step in building a roadmap is to have a clear vision for the project and identify the objectives to be achieved during the defined cycle (e.g. six-month period). This will set the direction and scope for the tasks that need to be accomplished. 2. Identify key milestones: Based on the project's objectives, establish the key milestones that need to be reached within the cycle. These milestones typically serve as progress indicators and provide a sense of accomplishment once they are achieved. 3. Consult with team members: Involve all relevant team members in the roadmap development process. This ensures that everyone understands and buys into the roadmap's objectives, that their input is valued, and that their expertise is considered when defining tasks and milestones. 4. Break down tasks: With a clear set of milestones, define the tasks and actions necessary to achieve these milestones. These tasks should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). Assign responsibilities to team members for each task, keeping in mind their skills, time availability, and other resources. 5. Establish timeframes: For each task, determine the deadlines or timeframes within which they need to be completed. Make sure these are realistic based on the team's overall capacity and resources. 6. Create a visual representation: Once you've outlined the tasks and timeframes, create a visual representation of the roadmap using suitable tools (e.g., Gantt charts, Trello boards, etc.). This will make it easier to understand and track the progress of the project. 7. Review and adjust: Throughout the cycle, regularly review the roadmap and make necessary adjustments. This may include updating tasks, milestones, and timeframes as needed, based on the evolving needs and progress of the project. 8. Communicate and share the roadmap: Making the roadmap easily accessible and visible to all stakeholders is crucial. Share the roadmap with various team members, higher-ups, and others who may be interested in the project's progress. Regular updates and open communication channels can foster a sense of belonging and coordination among team members. It's important to remember that building a roadmap takes some time and effort. The duration required to create one would typically last a few days, or even weeks, depending on the complexity of the project, the involvement of team members, and thoroughness in defining objectives, milestones, and tasks. While roadmaps are not set in stone and can change over time as the project evolves, they remain an essential coordinating tool for teams aiming to increase their chances of success, maintain productivity, and offer transparency to others. A well-defined roadmap can help a team stay focused, engaged, and accountable, as well as boost morale and confidence through a sense of direction and accomplishment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In question 1, the main subject is Arya, and the object is The Hound (Sandor Clegane). The question is about why Arya didn't finish The Hound off. In question 2, the main subject is still Arya, and the object is Sandor Clegane (The Hound). This question is also about why Arya didn't kill Sandor Clegane. Step 2: Compare the reasons given in both questions. Question 1 suggests two potential reasons: 1) Arya wanted The Hound to suffer before he died, or 2) Arya cared about The Hound. Question 2 doesn't suggest any specific reason but generally asks why Arya didn't kill Sandor Clegane. Step 3: Determine if the questions are asking the same thing. Both questions are about Arya's motives for not killing The Hound (Sandor Clegane).

Answer a question about this article: By 1353, the three original cantons had joined with the cantons of Glarus and Zug and the Lucerne, Zürich and Bern city states to form the \\"Old Confederacy\\" of eight states that existed until the end of the 15th century. The expansion led to increased power and wealth for the federation. By 1460, the confederates controlled most of the territory south and west of the Rhine to the Alps and the Jura mountains, particularly after victories against the Habsburgs (Battle of Sempach, Battle of Näfels), over Charles the Bold of Burgundy during the 1470s, and the success of the Swiss mercenaries. The Swiss victory in the Swabian War against the Swabian League of Emperor Maximilian I in 1499 amounted to de facto independence within the Holy Roman Empire. Which Swiss victory in 1499 amounted to de facto independence within the Holy Roman Empire?","completion":"The Swiss victory in 1499 that amounted to de facto independence within the Holy Roman Empire was the result of the Swabian War. This conflict was fought between the Swabian League, led by Emperor Maximilian I, and the Old Swiss Confederacy, a federation of eight states that included the original cantons of Glarus, Zug, Lucerne, Zurich, and Bern. The Swabian War was a significant turning point for the Swiss Confederacy, as it demonstrated their military strength and ability to defend their territories against external threats. The Swiss forces achieved several notable victories during this conflict, ultimately ensuring their autonomy within the Holy Roman Empire. As a result of this war, the Swiss Confederacy secured its status as a regional power and gained greater independence from the overarching control of the Holy Roman Empire, which allowed them to maintain control over their territories, political structures, and economic resources. In conclusion, the Swiss victory in the Swabian War of 1499 led to de facto independence within the Holy Roman Empire, allowing the Old Swiss Confederacy to continue prospering and expanding its influence in the region. This conflict marked a crucial turning point in Swiss history, helping to lay the foundation for the modern Swiss Confederation that exists today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"The given review would most likely decrease the chances of me buying the product. The information provided by the reviewer indicates that they enjoy a specific type of movie, which involves intellectual content, good thrillers, and mysteries that require thinking. Their experience with the product appears to not match their preferred type of content, since they found it to be incredibly boring to the point of falling asleep. Moreover, their spouse, who may have a similar taste in content, seems to share the same view of it being boring. The reviewer's mention that they might have found the desired attributes in the product if they could have stayed awake suggests that there is a possibility that the product might have some interesting elements. However, the fact that they were unable to remain alert to discover those aspects indicates that the product most likely didn't succeed in maintaining their interest and engagement.

Your task is to determine whether the second sentence is either a stereotype, anti-stereotype, or is unrelated with respect to the first sentence and the target. A stereotype is a widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against the widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. Sentences and targets are unrelated if there is no relevance between them. Input: Target: politician The politician won the race. Six comes after five.

Part #2: Analyzing the two sentences. Usage: First sentence - \\"The politician won the race.\\" Second sentence - \\"Six comes after five.\\" Part #3: Determining if the second sentence is a stereotype. Usage: A stereotype is a widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. For example, \\"Politicians always break their promises.\\" This notion is an oversimplified generalization of all politicians. In this case, the second sentence, \\"Six comes after five,\\" is not a stereotype since it doesn't simplify or generalize politicians. Part #4: Determining if the second sentence is an anti-stereotype. Usage: An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against the widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of politicians. For example, \\"This politician volunteers at the homeless shelter every weekend,\\" as it contradicts the widely-held belief that politicians only care about their image. In this case, the second sentence, \\"Six comes after five,\\" is not an anti-stereotype since it doesn't go against any oversimplified notions about politicians. Part #5: Determining if the second sentence is unrelated. Usage: If the second sentence does not contain any stereotypical or anti-stereotypical ideas about the target profession, it is considered unrelated. In this case, the second sentence, \\"Six comes after five,\\" has no relevance to the given target profession (politician), making it unrelated.

Triumph and Disaster: The 20th century saw a stupendous release of energies that had been pent up for the 250 years of Tokugawa isolation. By 1930 raw-material production had tripled the figure of 1900, manufactured goods had increased twelve-fold, and heavy industry was galloping towards maturity. Britain led the World War I Ailies in large orders for munitions, while Japan expanded sales of manufactured goods to Asian and other markets cut off from their usual European suppliers. Merchant shipping doubled in size and increased its income ten-fold as the European fleets were destroyed. Setbacks in the 1930s caused by the European postwar slump were only a spur to redouble efforts by diversifying heavy industry into the machine-making, metallurgical, and chemical sectors. Even the terrible 1923 Tokyo earthquake, which cost over 100,000 lives and billions of dollars, provided another stimulus due to the construction boom that followed. Riding the crest of this economic upsurge were the zaibatsu conglomerates — a dozen family-run combines, each involved in mining, manufacturing, marketing, shipping, and banking. These tightly controlled commercial pyramids were the true heirs to the old feudal structures. Japan's progress toward parliamentary democracy was halted in the 1930s by the growing nationalism being imposed on government by the generals and admirals. They proclaimed Japan's mission to bring progress to its backward Asian neighbors in language not so very different from that of the Europeans in Africa or the US in Latin America. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Soviet Union was regarded as a major threat to Japan's security, and the army felt it needed Manchuria and whatever other Chinese territory it could control as a buffer against Russian advances. In 1931 the Japanese occupied Manchuria. And then in 1937, with the popular support of ultra-right-wing groups, the army overrode parliamentary resistance in Tokyo and went to war against the Chinese Nationalists. By 1938, they held Nanking, Hankow, and Canton. Japanese expansionist policies were leading to direct confrontation with the West. Japan hoped that war in Europe would divert the Soviet Union from interference in East Asia, giving Japan a free hand both in China and, through its alliance with Germany, in French IndoChina after the defeat of France. The US responded to the Japanese invasion of IndoChina with a trade and fuel embargo, cutting off 90 percent of Japan's supplies. The result was the attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor (7 December 1941) and total war. Question: \\"What resulted in the attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor?\\" Response: \\"The trade and fuel embargo\\" Select from the following. a. no. b. yes.

It includes 4,000 fixed seats and a 95,000-square-foot (8,800 m2) Great Lawn that can accommodate an additional 7,000 people. The pavilion was built above and behind the Harris Theater, which has the benefit that Millennium Park's indoor and outdoor performance venues share a loading dock, rehearsal rooms and other backstage facilities.The bandshell's brushed stainless steel headdress frames the 120-foot (37 m) proscenium theatre; the main stage can accommodate a full orchestra and chorus of 150 members. The bandshell is connected to a trellis of interlocking crisscrossing steel pipes that support the innovative sound system, which mimics indoor concert hall acoustics. The pavilion has restrooms on both its east and west sides. It is one of two features in the park to include accessible restrooms; the other is McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink.

Originally, \\"nebula\\" was a name for any diffuse astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, was once referred to as the \\"Andromeda Nebula\\" (and spiral galaxies in general as \\"spiral nebulae\\") before the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the early 20th century by Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble and others. - In astronomy and physical cosmology, the metallicity or Z is the fraction of mass of a star or other kind of astronomical object that is not in hydrogen (X) or helium (Y). Most of the physical matter in the universe is in the form of hydrogen and helium, so astronomers use the word \\"metals\\" as a convenient short term for \\"all elements except hydrogen and helium\\". This usage is distinct from the usual physical definition of a solid metal. The rationale for the astronomical usage is that in the high-temperature and pressure environment of a star, atoms do not undergo chemical reactions and effectively have no chemical properties, including that of being a metal as usually understood. For example, stars and nebulae with relatively high abundances of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and neon are called \\"metal-rich\\" in astrophysical terms, even though those elements are non-metals in chemistry. - AB Doradus Moving Group is a group of about 30 associated stars that are moving through space together with the star AB Doradus . A moving group is distinguished by its members having about the same age , composition ( or metallicity ) and motion through space . Hence they most likely formed in the same location . This group is located about 20 parsecs from the Earth and is the closest known co-moving group . The average space velocity of this group has components of U = 8 , V = 27 and W = 14 km / s. About 10 of these stars form a nuclear group within a volume roughly 10 parsecs across . The proximity of this moving group makes it useful for studies of shared stellar properties , as well as detection of companions through direct imaging . These can be used for refinement of young stellar models , for example . - AB Doradus is a pre-main-sequence quadruple star system in the constellation Dorado. The primary is a flare star that shows periodic increases in activity. - Dorado (English pronunciation: ) is a constellation in the southern sky.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Clemens was born in Dayton, Ohio, the fifth child of Bill and Bess (Lee) Clemens. He is of German descent, his great-grandfather Joseph Clemens having immigrated in the 1880s. Clemens's parents separated when he was an infant. His mother soon married Woody Booher, whom Clemens considers his father. Clemens unexpectedly appeared in the owner's box at Yankee Stadium on May 6, 2007, during the seventh-inning stretch of a game against the Seattle Mariners, and made a brief statement: \\"Thank y'all. Well they came and got me out of Texas, and uhh, I can tell you it's a privilege to be back. I'll be talkin' to y'all soon.\\" It was simultaneously announced that Clemens had rejoined the Yankees roster, agreeing to a pro-rated one-year deal worth 28,000,022, or about 4.7 million per month. Over the contract life, he would make 18.7 million. This equated to just over 1 million per start that season. Clemens made his 2007 return on June 9, defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates by pitching six innings with seven strikeouts and 3 runs allowed. On June 21, with a single in the 5th inning against the Colorado Rockies, Clemens became the oldest New York Yankee to record a hit (44 years, 321 days). On June 24, Clemens pitched an inning in relief against the San Francisco Giants. It had been 22 years and 341 days since his previous regular-season relief appearance, the longest such gap in major league history. On July 2, Clemens collected his 350th win against the Minnesota Twins at Yankee Stadium, giving up just two hits and one run over eight innings. Clemens is one of only three pitchers to pitch his entire career in the live-ball era and reach 350 wins. The other two are Warren Spahn (whose catcher for his 350th win was Joe Torre, Clemens's manager for his 350th), and Greg Maddux, who earned his 350th win in 2008. His final regular season appearance was a start against the Red Sox at Fenway Park, in which he allowed 2 hits and 1 unearned run in 6 innings, and received a no-decision. Clemens finished the 2007 regular season with a record of 6-6 and a 4.18 ERA. Clemens was forced to leave Game 3 of the 2007 ALDS in the third inning after aggravating a hamstring injury. He struck out Victor Martinez of the Cleveland Indians with his final pitch, and was replaced by right-hander Phil Hughes. Yankees manager Joe Torre removed Clemens from the roster due to his injury, and replaced him with left-hander Ron Villone.

It is hoped that the move, which will be tested in the coming months, might lessen traffic in inner cities and reduce CO2emissions . This should help DHL, a division of the German postal service, reach its target of improving the company's carbon efficiency by 30 percent before 2020. \\"As the world's biggest logistics provider, we recognize a special responsibility to reduce the impact on the environment as much as possible,\\" said Frank Appel, Chief Executive Officer of Deutsche Post DHL, in a statement referring to a variety of measures being considered. The \\"fetch friends\\" find out online about parcels that need delivering to people who live or work along the way that they are planning to travel through the city. They then select the ones that they want to take. Codes sent to their mobile phones tell the volunteers where to pick the packages up. Parcels can be taken part of the way or passed on to another volunteer but all volunteers need to have the right code on their mobile phone so the track and trace system can be updated.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Ford Warns of New Steps if Sales Decline Analysts and industry executives expect the automakers to sell about 16 million vehicles in the United States this year, the fewest since 1998. Mark Fields, Ford’s president for the Americas, said Monday that industry sales could decline further in 2008. “If you look at all the indicators out there, there is more risk than opportunity,” he said. Mr. Fields was the third industry executive in recent days to warn of a drop next year. Both Chrysler’s co-president, Thomas W. LaSorda, and Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive of Nissan and Renault, have said that industry sales could fall below 16 million next year. Ford is taking the possibility of lower sales into account as it proceeds with its corporate revamping, Mr. Fields told reporters. “We are on plan,” he said. “What we’ve always said is that as we see changes in the external environment, we will adjust to make sure we remain on plan.” The Ford contract closely follows the terms of agreements at General Motors and Chrysler. Its major feature is a health care trust, called a voluntary employee benefit association, that will take responsibility for health care benefits for current and future retirees and their families. Ford told the U.A.W. that it would invest 13.2 billion to establish the fund, or about 63 percent of its total liability of 21 billion. The company will spend 2.2 billion more in the next two years to cover retiree health care expenses until the fund, which requires court and regulatory approvals, can be established. In a change from the G.M. and Chrysler contracts, the union agreed to set a starting wage rate of 14.20 for all newly hired employees, about half what assemblers are paid now. No more than 20 percent of the companywide work force would be classified as holding entry-level jobs, and no current worker would receive the lower rate. G.M. and Chrysler can assign their lower wage rate only to workers whose jobs are defined as “noncore.” “We never dreamed we could get an agreement this good in times like this,” said Reggie Osborne, an official with U.A.W. Local 600 in Dearborn. One of Local 600’s plants, which makes pickup-truck parts, will stay open under the contract. Other plants said to be endangered where Ford promised to make new investments are in Chicago; Louisville, Ky.; Avon Lake, Ohio; and Wayne, Mich. Bill Johnson, plant chairman at the Wayne assembly plant, called the deal “better than the Chrysler and G.M. agreements,” yet fair to Ford. Ralph Mayer, president of Local 898 in Ypsilanti, Mich., said the deal resolved problems that had existed in contracts during the entire 40 years he had been in the union. “The U.A.W. finally got changes that were long overdue,” he said. “There were things in there that amazed me.” Mr. Gettelfinger said the contract was “a great agreement,” not only for workers but for Ford, which lost 12.6 billion last year and is regarded as the weakest of the Detroit automakers. “We have no doubts or reservations about Ford’s survival,” Mr. Gettelfinger said. Because of an editing error, a picture caption in Business Day yesterday with an article about the Ford Motor Company’s newly negotiated contract with the United Automobile Workers union referred incorrectly to the person pictured at left. He is an unidentified delegate to the U.A.W. Ford Council; he is not the union president, Ron Gettelfinger. Mary M. Chapman contributed reporting.

Q:Information: - Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock usually occurring in rock strata in layers or veins called coal beds or coal seams. The harder forms, such as anthracite coal, can be regarded as metamorphic rock because of later exposure to elevated temperature and pressure. Coal is composed primarily of carbon, along with variable quantities of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. A fossil fuel, coal forms when dead plant matter is converted into peat, which in turn is converted into lignite, then sub-bituminous coal, after that bituminous coal, and lastly anthracite. This involves biological and geological processes that take place over time. - A pumpkin is a cultivar of a squash plant, most commonly of \\"Cucurbita pepo\\", that is round, with smooth, slightly ribbed skin, and deep yellow to orange coloration. The thick shell contains the seeds and pulp. Some exceptionally large cultivars of squash with similar appearance have also been derived from \\"Cucurbita maxima\\". Specific cultivars of winter squash derived from other species, including \\"C. argyrosperma\\", and \\"C. moschata\\", are also sometimes called \\"pumpkin\\". In New Zealand and Australian English, the term \\"pumpkin\\" generally refers to the broader category called winter squash elsewhere. - Natural resources are resources that exist without actions of humankind.

The total surface is , and the total volume (measured at the low water datum) is . Due to their sea-like characteristics (rolling waves, sustained winds, strong currents, great depths, and distant horizons) the five Great Lakes have also long been referred to as \\"inland seas\\". Lake Superior is the second largest lake in the world by area, and Lake Michigan is the largest lake that is entirely within one country.

While individual products are usually measured by weight, their varying densities make measuring overall agricultural output difficult. Therefore, output is usually measured as the market value of final output, which excludes intermediate products such as corn feed used in the meat industry. This output value may be compared to many different types of inputs such as labour and land (yield). These are called partial measures of productivity. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population.

Article: You should use the vaginal cream for the full number of days prescribed at the correct dose. Don't stop using the vaginal cream if you start menstruating. The vaginal cream will still be effective; it just may be a little messier to insert. Just make sure to use sanitary pads since tampons could absorb the cream. If you miss a dose or run out of the vaginal cream before your treatment is complete, call the doctor or pharmacist for a refill. Most vaginal creams are designed to be stored at room temperature. Check the information on the box or ask your pharmacist to be sure. Storing the cream at a temperature that's too hot or cold could damage it. It's best to store most medications in a cool, dry place. Avoid storing medication in a medicine cabinet since heat and moisture from the bathroom could cause it to be less effective or expire early. The heat of your body will cause most creams to leak out a little after you apply them to your vagina. If you can, try to use the vaginal cream at night. Laying down after you apply the cream can also keep it in your vagina longer and reduce the amount that leaks out. If you need to use vaginal creams during the day, wear a sanitary pad to avoid staining your underwear and lay down for a few minutes immediately after you apply the cream, if you can. The side effects will vary depending on what medication is in the vaginal cream. In general, side effects may include vaginal discomfort, vaginal dryness, burning or itching and potentially messy discharge from the vagina. Be sure to read the information that came with the vaginal cream. This will give you more detailed information about the specific side effects you can expect. If any side effects are causing you discomfort or you feel pain, contact your doctor. If you experience swelling of the vagina and vulva area, itching, hives, or tightness of the chest, you may be having an allergic reaction so it's important to get medication attention. Always ask your doctor if you have any questions about using the vaginal cream. You should also talk with your doctor about whether or not you need to refrain from sexual intercourse while you use the vaginal cream. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"The article discusses the proper use and storage of vaginal creams, emphasizing the importance of following the prescribed duration and dose.

Math Problem Solve 7*k - 509 = -544 for k.","completion":"To solve the equation 7k - 509 = -544 for the variable k, we will follow the basic steps of algebraic manipulation, which include simplifying the equation and isolating the variable k on one side. Here's the step-by-step solution: 1. The given equation is: 7k - 509 = -544 2. The first step is to isolate the term with the variable k, which is 7k in this case. To do that, we will add 509 to both sides of the equation (to remove -509 from the left side). This operation doesn't alter the equation, as what we do on one side, we do on the other as well. 7k - 509 + 509 = -544 + 509 3. After simplifying both sides of the equation, we get: 7k = -35 Now, we have successfully isolated the term with the variable k on the left side of the equation. 4. The next step is to find the value of k. To do this, we need to eliminate the coefficient of k, which is 7. To get rid of the coefficient, we will divide both sides of the equation by 7: 7k / 7 = -35 / 7 5. After simplifying both sides of the equation, we get: k = -5 So, the solution to the given equation 7k - 509 = -544 is k = -5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: Decision-thinking is not unlike poker --it often matters not only what you think, but also what others think you think and what you think they think you think.The mental process is similar.Naturally,this card game has often been of considerable interest to people who are,by any standards,good thinkers. The great mathematician John von Neumann was one of the founders of game theory.In particular,he showed that all games fall into two classes:there are what he called games of 'perfect information', games like chess where the players can't hide anything or play tricks:they don't win by chance,but by means of logic and skills.Then there are games of 'imperfect information', 1ike poker,in which it is impossible to know in advance that one course of action is better than another. One mistaken idea about business is that it can be treated as a game of perfect information.Quite the reverse.Business,politics,life itself are games which we must normally play with very imperfect information.Business decisions are often made with many unknown and unknowable factors which would even puzzle best poker players.But few business people find it comfortable to admit that they are taking a chance,and many still prefer to believe that they are playing chess,not poker.

Question: Given the background: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. and the situation: Bill and Bob were two brothers. they were both into physical exercise, but Bill chose weight lifting, and Bob running. Answer the following question: Which brother had smaller muscles? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given background, it is not possible to definitively determine which brother had smaller muscles, as both of them were involved in physical exercises that increased their muscle strength and size. However, we can infer the differences in their muscular development: 1. Bill, who chose weight lifting, focused on developing his skeletal muscles. Due to lifting weights and working against resistance, his skeletal muscles would increase in size and strength. This means that various muscle groups such as the biceps, triceps, chest, back, and legs would become more prominent and defined. 2. Bob, who chose running, focused on developing his cardiac muscles, with his heart pumping more blood and contracting faster. This results in increased strength and efficiency of the cardiac muscle. However, running also affects skeletal muscles; it primarily helps in toning and developing lean muscles (especially in the lower extremities), but the increase in size and bulk is not as significant as in weight lifting. In summary, while both brothers are developing their muscles through exercise, Bill's weight lifting would likely result in larger and more visibly defined skeletal muscles compared to Bob's running-focused exercise routine, which would lead to a leaner and more toned muscular look."},{"prompt":"Question: What does Paolo witness by Miriam's apartment?

One typical day after work, her boss, Albert, sends his workers home while he tries to please a buyer for his clothing designs. As the four ladies walk down the street, they must march past leering and dirty men who make obscene remarks and come-ons at them. Laurie protests and insults them vehemently, but Thana is silent because she is physically and mentally a mute. When the three friends leave to enter a subway station for their destination home, Thana goes off on her own. After grocery shopping in a local supermarket, Thana, walking home, is grabbed by a mugger who rapes her in a deserted alley before stealing her purse.

How much can you deposit in a bank without being noticed? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"To answer the first question, individual banks have their own regulations and guidelines regarding the deposit of money both with and without a PAN card (Permanent Account Number) in India. However, I can provide a general idea based on the Income Tax Department's guidelines. Step 1: Determine if the deposit requires a PAN card Cash deposits exceeding ₹50,000 in a single transaction require a PAN card. Additionally, cumulative deposits exceeding ₹2,50,000 during a financial year also require a PAN card to be provided. Step 2: For deposits without a PAN card Typically, a person can deposit up to ₹49,999 in cash per transaction into their bank account without needing their PAN card. However, it's still pertinent to check with individual banks for their specific policies. Now, to address the second question - how much you can deposit in a bank without being noticed: This question assumes that the person would like to deposit funds without being subject to scrutiny or additional regulatory reporting. In most countries, banks are required to report large or suspicious transactions to authorities, and in India specifically, this involves transactions falling under the Financial Intelligence Unit - India (FIU-IND). However, it is important to abide by the law and report all necessary information when making a deposit. Attempting to evade regulatory requirements could lead to penalties or other legal repercussions. In conclusion, these questions are not exactly the same, as the first question focuses on deposit limits based on PAN card requirements, while the second question seems to be about avoiding additional scrutiny or reporting mandates. Nonetheless, it is essential to comply with all banking and financial regulations, irrespective of the deposit size."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

WASILLA, Alaska (CNN) -- For more than two decades, vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin was a practicing Pentecostal. She belonged to the Wasilla Assembly of God church in her hometown of Wasilla, Alaska. But though she attended the church from her teenage years to 2002, the Alaska governor hasn't talked much about her religion since joining the Republican ticket. Palin's former pastor, Tim McGraw, says that like many Pentecostal churches, some members speak in tongues, although he says he's never seen Palin do so.

Choices: - indigestion - heartburn - stomach ache - gain energy - overeating The rationale to choose \\"overeating\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"When you eat breakfast without paying attention to the proper portion sizes or the amount of food you're consuming, you are more likely to choose \\"overeating\\" as a consequence. Let's explore the choices and the rationale behind choosing \\"overeating\\" as the answer: 1. Indigestion: Although indigestion can happen when you consume excessive amounts of food or eat too quickly, it can also be caused by other factors such as stress, certain medications, or underlying health conditions. 2. Heartburn: Like indigestion, heartburn can also result from overeating or eating too quickly, but it can often be attributed to other factors such as the type of food consumed, lying down after eating, or even pregnancy. 3. Stomach ache: Overeating or eating too quickly might lead to stomach aches, but stomach aches are not exclusively associated with breakfast and could be related to various other factors such as gas, illness, or food intolerances. 4. Gain energy: The primary purpose of eating breakfast is to gain energy as your body gets fueled after the overnight fasting period. However, this outcome is not directly related to choosing the amount of food correctly. 5. Overeating: The most logical answer is overeating, as this is the direct consequence of not choosing the amount of food correctly during breakfast. Overeating at breakfast can lead to weight gain over time and may also cause discomfort or digestive issues. Thus, the rationale behind choosing \\"overeating\\" as the answer is that it is the most obvious and direct consequence of not choosing the proper amount of food at breakfast, while the other choices could be related to various other causes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He may have ran the rest of the way there .; (2). He may have given up and went back into the building .; (3). None of the above choices .; (4). He may have decided to just hail a cab to get home .;","completion":"Based on the context provided, it seems like the individual was desperately trying to escape a hot and uncomfortable parking structure. The question asks what may have happened for him to get to his car, so let's analyze the given options. 1. He may have ran the rest of the way there: Given his determination in finding a way out of the building, this option appears the most plausible. The fact that he was willing to go up three levels to find an exit suggests he was highly motivated to find a means to escape and reach his car. Despite being a quarter-mile away, it is likely that he would try to make the effort to run the remaining distance to his car. 2. He may have given up and went back into the building: While this is a possibility, it seems less likely compared to the first option. Considering the discomfort, frustration, and effort he experienced while attempting to find a way out, it is doubtful that he would choose to go back inside. It's not a choice that falls in line with his previous actions, so this option is less probable. 3. None of the above choices: This option does not provide any alternate scenarios, and since we have plausible choices in the list, this can be dismissed as an unlikely response. 4. He may have decided to just hail a cab to get home: Although this is a possibility, it seems less likely compared to option one. Since the goal was to reach his car, hailing a cab to get home would leave his vehicle behind, which was likely not the desired outcome. Furthermore, considering the effort he made to find an exit from the building, it is plausible that he would put in the effort to cover the remaining distance to his car by running. In conclusion, option one, \\"He may have run the rest of the way there,\\" seems the most reasonable and likely course of action for the individual to reach his car given the desperation and determination he showed while trying to escape the hot and uncomfortable parking structure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In order to systematically evaluate the compatibility of these two statements, let's break down the key components of each statement and compare them. Statement 1: \\"A woman wearing a purple sport bra and black gloves and face protection boxes with a woman wearing a red shirt, red gloves and a black head protector in a boxing ring.\\" Key components: 1. Two women are involved. 2. One woman is wearing a purple sport bra, black gloves, and face protection. 3. The other woman is wearing a red shirt, red gloves, and a black head protector. 4. They are boxing (as indicated by the term \\"boxes\\"). 5. They are in a boxing ring. Statement 2: \\"Two women are boxing.\\" Key components: 1. Two women are involved. 2. They are boxing. By comparing the key components of both statements, we can make the following observations: 1. Both statements involve two women (Key components 1 in both statements). 2. Both statements indicate that the women are boxing (Key components 4 in Statement 1 and Key component 2 in Statement 2). Based on these observations, we can conclude that there is a consistency between the two statements in terms of the number of women involved and the activity they are engaged in which is boxing. However, the first statement provides more specific details about their clothing and protective gear, while the second statement only mentions that two women are boxing without any particular description of their attire. Therefore, although the second statement does not contradict the first one, it does not fully capture or describe the scenario given in the first statement. In conclusion, the premise \\"A woman wearing a purple sport bra and black gloves and face protection boxes with a woman wearing a red shirt, red gloves and a black head protector in a boxing ring\\" can be considered true under the condition \\"Two women are boxing,\\" but it should be noted that the latter statement does not encompass all the detailed information provided in the former."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

In 1908 Shuman formed the Sun Power Company with the intent of building larger solar power plants. He, along with his technical advisor A.S.E. Ackermann and British physicist Sir Charles Vernon Boys, developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes, increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether.

More on this story about the Exeter Chiefs, and others from Devon and Cornwall In the US, Native American campaigners have been calling on teams like the Washington Redskins to change its name, describing it as racist and offensive. Dr Herrmann said: \\"I think changing [Exeter's] name would be the ultimate step but I don't know whether that is likely to happen. \\"I would at least like to see an engaged discussion between the team and Native American groups that could better explain why the name might be offensive.\\" Dr Hermann criticised rugby fans who waved tomahawks, wore Native American headdress and war paint, and said it evoked a history of settler colonialism. The expert said it also ignores modern Native Americans who no longer dress in that way and the protests of those who have spoken out \\"against such cultural appropriation\\". Exeter Rugby Club rebranded as Exeter Chiefs in 1999 shortly after the team turned professional.","completion":"Dr. Rachel Herrmann, a scholar from the University of Southampton, has criticized the Exeter Chiefs, a rugby team that rebranded itself in 1999, for using Native American imagery in their branding and logo. Dr. Herrmann argues that the use of such imagery is a reminder of Britain's imperialist past in America and calls for a discussion on the offensive nature of the team's name. The Exeter Chiefs have faced scrutiny similar to that of teams in the United States, like the Washington Redskins, who were urged to change their name due to allegations of racism and offensiveness. While Dr. Herrmann acknowledges that changing the Exeter Chiefs' name might not be a likely outcome, she hopes for an open dialogue between the team and Native American groups to address the cultural insensitivity and potential harm of using such imagery. Dr. Herrmann also critiques the fans of the rugby team who engage in practices like waving tomahawks, wearing Native American headdresses, and applying war paint. She argues that such actions are disrespectful to the historical reality of settler colonialism and to the modern Native American communities who no longer dress in this manner. Moreover, it overlooks the protests and arguments against cultural appropriation made by those who find such practices offensive and insensitive. In summary, Dr. Rachel Herrmann calls for an open, engaged discussion around the Exeter Chiefs' use of Native American imagery and name, highlighting the concerns of cultural appropriation and historical insensitivity.

Gramps is surprised and relieved that someone else could see the stranger; he was not merely a dream or apparition. Pud tells Gramps that when he does a good deed, he will be able to make a wish. Because his apples are constantly being stolen, Gramps wishes that anyone who climbs up his apple tree will have to stay there until he permits them to climb down. Pud inadvertently tests the wish when he has trouble coming down from the tree himself, becoming free only when Gramps says he can. Pud's busybody Aunt Demetria has designs on Pud and the money left him by his parents. Gramps spends much time fending off her efforts to adopt the boy. Brink takes Granny Nellie in a peaceful death just after she finishes a bit of knitting. When Mr. Brink returns again for Gramps, the old man finally realizes who his visitor is. Determined not to leave Pud to Demetria, Gramps tricks Mr. Brink into climbing the apple tree. While stuck in the tree, he cannot take Gramps or anyone else. The only way anyone or anything can die is if Gramps touches Mr. Brink or the apple tree. Demetria plots to have Gramps committed to a psychiatric hospital when he claims that Death is trapped in his apple tree. Gramps proves his story first by proving that his doctor, Dr. Evans, can not even kill a fly they have captured. He offers further proof of his power by shooting Mr. Grimes, the orderly who has come to take him to the asylum; Grimes lives when he should have died. Guess a valid title for it! Answer:","completion":"A possible title for the story could be \\"The Enchanted Apple Tree: Gramps' Triumph Over Death\\"."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

And every night, I look at the posters with photos of David Beckham and Yao Ming on my bedroom wall before I go to sleep. Can we imagine life without paper or print? Paper was first created about 2,000 years ago, and has been made from silk, cotton, bamboo, and, since the 19th century, from wood. People learned to write words on paper to make a book. But in those days, books could only be produced one at a time by hand. As a result, they were expensive and _ . And because there weren't many books, few people learned to read. Then printing was invented in China. When printing was developed greatly at the beginning of the 11th century, books could be produced more quickly and cheaply. As a result, more people learned to read. After that, knowledge and ideas spread quickly. Today information can be received online, downloaded from the Internet rather than found in books, and information can be kept on CD-ROMs or machines such as MP5 players. Computers are already used in classrooms, and newspapers and magazines can already be read online. So will books be replaced by computers one day?

Write a summary based on this article: CANNES, France — Harry Shearer is suing Vivendi’s Universal Music Group and Studiocanal for 125 million for allegedly fraudulent accounting of the music revenues from Rob Reiner’s 1984 film “This is Spinal Tap.” Shearer, who co-created and starred in the classic mockumentary, is seeking 125 million in compensatory and punitive damages. “This is Spinal Tap” follows the legendary British heavy metal band Spinal Tap as they organize a comeback tour. The spoof was created by Shearer, Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Rob Reiner. Shearer, who co-wrote the soundtrack to the film, filed suit in the Central District Court of California on Tuesday over the alleged underpayment of music royalties. The lawsuit says that Vivendi reported only 98 in total income from soundtrack music sales between 1989 and 2006. As far as worldwide merchandising income, Vivendi reported only 81 between 1984 and 2006, the lawsuit says. Vivendi has “failed and refused, and continues to fail and refuse, to provide Plaintiff with proper and accurate accountings reflecting the amount of revenues derived from the distribution and exploitation of the Film and associated music and merchandise rights,” the complaint alleges. ||||| The interactive transcript could not be loaded.

Shearer, who co-wrote the film and soundtrack and starred as bassist Derek Smalls, has lodged the legal action at the Central District Court of California. Shearer, who has voiced 23 characters on The Simpsons including Ned Flanders and Mr Burns, is claiming 125m (£102m) in compensatory and punitive damages from the French conglomerate. Vivendi acquired the rights to This is Spinal Tap, through its subsidiary StudioCanal, in 1989. Shearer claims that since then, profits from This is Spinal Tap have not been fairly shared between its four creators, cast or crew. “This is a simple issue of artists’ rights,” said Shearer. “It is stunning that after all this time, two cinema releases, all the various home-video format releases, all the records and CDs, and all the band-themed merchandise still widely available worldwide, the only people who haven’t shared Spinal Tap’s success are those who formed the band and created the film in the first place.” Harry Shearer (@theharryshearer) I’m going up against @vivendi and @studiocanal to ensure #fairplayfairpay for the movie #SpinalTap - #fairnessrocks pic.twitter.com/fTG23OMbsW This is Spinal Tap was created by Shearer, Christopher Guest, who went on to co-write and direct dog competition mockumentary Best in Show, Rob Reiner and Michael McKean. The legal complaint alleges that between 1989 and 2006, Vivendi reported that the total income from soundtrack music sales was just 98. And in addition, it claims Vivendi reported that the four creators’ share of total worldwide merchandising income between 1984 and 2006 was 81. The lawsuit names Ron Halpern, who has been in charge of international productions and acquisitions for StudioCanal since 2007, as a co-defendant in the claim. Vivendi’s agents are named as StudioCanal and Universal Music. “Though I’ve launched this lawsuit on my own, it is in reality a challenge to the company on behalf of all creators of popular films whose talent has not been fairly remunerated,” said Shearer. “I hope this lawsuit will help set a new precedent for … fair artistic compensation industry-wide.” In 1982, the four co-creators signed an agreement with Embassy Pictures for the production, financing and distribution of This is Spinal Tap. Shearer claims the agreement included profit participation payments at 40% of net receipts bases on all sources of revenue, including merchandise and music. The film, which had a shoe-string budget of 2.25m, was released in 1984 and became a global cult classic. Vivendi acquired the rights to Spinal Tap in 1989, and Shearer’s legal action claims it began a “concerted and fraudulent campaign to hide, or grossly underreport, the film’s revenues in order to avoid its profit participation obligations”. A Vivendi spokesman declined to comment on the legal action. ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Shearer accuses Vivendi of using \\"blatantly unfair business practices\\" Harry Shearer is taking legal action against entertainment group Vivendi, claiming it has denied him and others profits from 1984's This is Spinal Tap.

Movie title: Valentine's Day Movie plot: The film follows a group of related characters and their struggles with love on Valentine's Day. Florist Reed Bennett (Ashton Kutcher) wakes up and proposes to his girlfriend Morley Clarkson (Jessica Alba), who accepts. However, Reedâs closest friends, Alfonso Rodriguez (George Lopez) and Julia Fitzpatrick (Jennifer Garner), aren't surprised when Morley suddenly changes her mind and leaves Reed a few hours later. On a flight to Los Angeles, Kate Hazeltine (Julia Roberts), a captain in the U.S. Army on a one-day leave, befriends Holden Wilson (Bradley Cooper). Kate is travelling a long distance to get back home only for a short time, and Holden states that she must really be in love to do so. When the plane lands and Kate has to wait hours for the taxi, Holden offers his limousine to allow her to be there on time. Julia, an elementary school teacher, has fallen in love with Dr. Harrison Copeland (Patrick Dempsey), but does not know that he is married to Pamela (Katherine LaNasa). Harrison tells her that he needs to go to San Francisco for a business trip: on his way, he stops by at Reed's flowershop and orders two flower bouquets - asking for discretion. Wanting to surprise him and despite Reed's warnings, Julia flies to San Francisco, convinced that Reed was wrong. Julia finds out that he is married and finds him at a local restaurant. Dressed as a waitress, Julia makes a scene at the restaurant, making Pamela suspicious. One of Juliaâs students, Edison (Bryce Robinson), orders flowers from Reed, to be sent to his teacher.

The spread of Greek literature, mythology and philosophy offered Roman poets and antiquarians a model for the interpretation of Rome's festivals and rituals, and the embellishment of its mythology. Ennius translated the work of Graeco-Sicilian Euhemerus, who explained the genesis of the gods as apotheosized mortals. In the last century of the Republic, Epicurean and particularly Stoic interpretations were a preoccupation of the literate elite, most of whom held - or had held - high office and traditional Roman priesthoods; notably, Scaevola and the polymath Varro. For Varro - well versed in Euhemerus' theory - popular religious observance was based on a necessary fiction; what the people believed was not itself the truth, but their observance led them to as much higher truth as their limited capacity could deal with. Whereas in popular belief deities held power over mortal lives, the skeptic might say that mortal devotion had made gods of mortals, and these same gods were only sustained by devotion and cult.

They used ideas from Greek writers and thinkers, like Euhemerus, who said that gods were once just people who became gods because of their great actions. Some smart Romans, like Varro, thought that people's beliefs about gods were not exactly true but were still useful because they helped people learn about important ideas in a simple way.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What was the main cause of Douay's failure?\\" Context: \\"The first action of the Franco-Prussian War took place on 4 August 1870. This battle saw the unsupported division of General Douay of I Corps, with some attached cavalry, which was posted to watch the border, attacked in overwhelming but uncoordinated fashion by the German 3rd Army. During the day, elements of a Bavarian and two Prussian corps became engaged and were aided by Prussian artillery, which blasted holes in the defenses of the town. Douay held a very strong position initially, thanks to the accurate long-range fire of the Chassepots but his force was too thinly stretched to hold it. Douay was killed in the late morning when a caisson of the divisional mitrailleuse battery exploded near him; the encirclement of the town by the Prussians threatened the French avenue of retreat.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The main cause of General Douay's failure in the first action of the Franco-Prussian War on 4 August 1870 can be attributed to several factors: 1. Unsupported Division: General Douay's division was posted to watch the border without sufficient backup forces. This left his division vulnerable as they faced the overwhelming German 3rd Army. 2. Thinly Stretched Force: Douay's strong initial position was undermined by having his forces spread too thin, which made it difficult for them to effectively hold their defensive position. This issue was compounded as the battle raged on and his troops faced continued pressure. 3. Prussian Artillery Advantage: The Prussian artillery contributed heavily to breaking the defenses of the town. They were able to blast holes through the French positions, thereby weakening their defenses and making it easier for the German forces to overtake them. 4. Loss of General Douay: The death of General Douay in the late morning when a caisson of the divisional mitrailleuse battery exploded near him dealt a significant blow to the morale and leadership of his troops, further contributing to the failure of his forces. 5. Encirclement and Threatened Retreat: The encirclement of the town by the Prussians made the French avenue of retreat increasingly difficult, leading to a higher possibility of the division being trapped and unable to withdraw successfully. In summary, General Douay's failure in the first action of the Franco-Prussian War resulted from a combination of inadequate support, thinly stretched forces, superior enemy artillery, the loss of their leader, and the encirclement that threatened their retreat. These factors cumulatively weakened the French defense and ultimately led to Douay's defeat."},{"prompt":"Q: Is this product review positive?

If a cell was to get very large, the small surface area would not allow enough nutrients to enter the cell quickly enough for the cell’s needs. This idea is explained in Figure below . However, large cells have a way of dealing with some size challenges. Big cells, such as some white blood cells, often grow more nuclei so that they can supply enough proteins and RNA for the cell’s requirements. Large, metabolically active cells often have lots of cell protrusions, resulting in many folds throughout the membrane. These folds increase the surface area available for transport of materials into or out of the cell. Such cell types are found lining your small intestine, where they absorb nutrients from your food through protrusions called microvilli . Story: Mike is studying for his biology exam.

Dubai is one of the seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates. The other emirates include Abu Dhabi (which is the capital city of the UAE), Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, Ras Al Khaimah and Fujairah. The United Arab Emirates is a federal sovereign state in the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula, situated at the entrance of the Persian Gulf. It shares borders with Oman and Saudi Arabia. Dubai itself, perhaps the most commonly recognized emirate, is known on a global scale for its extravagant architectural accomplishments, luxury shopping, and deep rooted cultural heritage. The country boasts state-of-the-art buildings such as the Burj Khalifa, which at over 828 meters, remains the tallest structure and building in the world since 2009. Dubai also houses the largest shopping mall in the world by total area, Dubai Mall. Furthermore, the emirate is famous for its palm-shaped artificial archipelagos, namely the Palm Jumeirah and Palm Jebel Ali. Besides this, Dubai also plays an important role economically as it has become a global city and a business hub. Although Dubai's economy was historically based on the oil industry, the emirate's economy has diversified and has become less dependent on oil. Currently, its economy focuses more on tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services. The addition of the information about Dubai being the 22nd most expensive city in the world and the most expensive in the Middle East shows its global economic significance. This illustrates the high cost of living in Dubai, indicating the prosperity and high living standards present in the city. To sum up, while the economic information about Dubai is useful in a comprehensive discussion about the emirate, it does not straightforwardly answer the question about which country Dubai is located in.

Please answer the following question: - The liver produces bile - The liver produces proteins for blood plasma - The liver converts excess glucose into glycogen for storage - The liver converts ammonia to urea - The liver regulates blood clotting. What might be the first step of the process? A:","completion":"The liver is a crucial organ in the human body, responsible for a wide array of critical functions, including bile production, protein synthesis for blood plasma, glucose storage, ammonia conversion to urea, and regulation of blood clotting. The first step in understanding these complex processes is to learn about the liver's structure and its specialized cells called hepatocytes. The liver is divided into lobules, which are the functional units of this organ. Each lobule features a central vein surrounded by thin plates of hepatocytes, which are responsible for carrying out the various tasks of the liver. These hepatocytes are lined with sinusoids, small blood vessels that allow the exchange of nutrients, oxygen, metabolites, and waste products between the hepatic cells and the blood. Considering the processes mentioned in the question, the first step in each process varies: 1. Bile production: The first step involves the hepatocytes synthesizing bile salts, cholesterol, and phospholipids. These components are then secreted into small bile canaliculi, which merge to form larger bile ducts. The bile eventually drains into the gallbladder for storage and concentration before being released into the small intestine to aid in fat digestion. 2. Protein synthesis for blood plasma: The liver produces a range of essential proteins for blood plasma, including albumin, clotting factors, and transport proteins. The first step in this process is the transcription of genes encoding these proteins, followed by translation of mRNA into the specific protein in the hepatocytes' endoplasmic reticulum. The proteins are then modified, folded, and transported through the Golgi apparatus for secretion into the blood. 3. Glucose storage: When the blood glucose levels are high, the liver converts excess glucose into glycogen for storage. The first step in this process is glucose uptake by hepatocytes via glucose transporters (GLUT2), followed by the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate by the enzyme glucokinase. Consequently, glucose-6-phosphate is converted into glycogen through a series of steps catalyzed by various enzymes like glycogen synthase. 4. Ammonia conversion to urea: The liver plays a crucial role in detoxifying the body by converting harmful ammonia to less toxic urea in a cycle called the urea cycle. The first step involves the formation of carbamoyl phosphate from ammonia and bicarbonate, catalyzed by the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I. 5. Regulation of blood clotting: The liver synthesizes various clotting factors essential in the coagulation cascade. The initial step in this process is the transcription of genes encoding clotting factors in the hepatocytes, followed by translation and protein synthesis, similar to the process mentioned earlier for blood plasma proteins. From the above explanation, it is clear that the first step in each process varies depending on its complexity and the specific role of the liver. However, breaking them down into individual stages enables a better understanding of the liver's remarkable ability to perform various crucial tasks simultaneously, ensuring the body's proper functioning."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Your task is to classify whether the given answer is correct or not by providing \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\", based on the article. Q: Article: Scientists can determine someone's favorite food from their shape. They have discovered that the arrangement of taste buds on the tongue varies for different body types. The scientist team examined 1,000 British adults and divided them into three physiologically recognized body types--ectomorphs, endomorphs mesomorphs. They determined that a person's body type indicated where they were likely to have the most taste buds - on the sweet, bitter or salty areas of their tongues. The study showed that ectomorphs, who make up one in three of the population, usually have a small delicate shape, have a sweet tooth but hate bitter foods. Mesomorphs, who make up 20percent of the population, usually have a muscular shape and prefer salty and bitter foods but dislike sweet foods. Half the British population are endomorphs with soft, rounded bodies, and they like most foods. The findings showed that for two in three people food preference was a physiological rather than a psychological choice. Body shape expert Simon Bradshaw, who takes change of his team, said, \\"It appears that simply by looking at a person's body shape we can make sure about their taste preferences.\\" But Catherine Collins, of the British Dietetic Association said, \\"It is difficult to tell whether our body shape dictates the food we like, or the food we like dictates body shape. _ people who prefer most types of foods will be fatter and people who are the endomorph shape tend to find it more difficult to lose weight.\\" Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? Options: (A) Ectomorphs refer to the people who are fat. (B) Ectomorphs don't like bitter foods. (C) Endomorphs are usually not fat. (D) Mesomorphs usually like salt or sweet foods.

The rose withered in the garden, but grew heartily in the pot, since the","completion":"owner, Mrs. Hawthorne, tended to it with great care. Mrs. Hawthorne was an elderly woman with a deep love for gardening, which was the aspect of her husband's memory that brought her solace. The garden served as a sanctuary in her otherwise mundane life, with the rose's vibrant red petals offering a sharp contrast against the green leaves. Mrs. Hawthorne found comfort in the presence of the rose, a symbol that represented the endless love between her and her late husband. The couple had planted the rose on their first wedding anniversary, marking the beginning of many years of blossoming love, just like the rose itself. However, this precious flower had now obstructed her path to healing, trapped between her longing for the past and the desire to move forward. The sun shone brightly, greeting Mrs. Hawthorne as she stepped out into her garden on a crisp morning. The lush leaves rustled gently with each gust of wind, as if whispering an unheard melody. Mrs. Hawthorne turned her attention toward the rose, carefully placing it onto a secluded table beside an open book of pressed flowers. She filled the pot with water, ensuring the rich soil was adequately moist. In the surrounding garden, wildflowers thrived, and Mrs. Hawthorne made sure to attend to each one, treating them as if they were her children. The beautiful spring day soon faded into sunset, bathing the garden in a golden hue. As the sun receded beyond the horizon, Mrs. Hawthorne settled into a book that she had picked up from the library earlier, immersing herself into the prose. A gentle breeze rustled the pages of the book, lifting the delicate petals of the pressed flowers that lay inside. A single tear escaped from Mrs. Hawthorne’s eye as she carefully caressed the fragile petals, a vivid reminder of the joyful days shared with her beloved. Over the weeks that followed, the garden witnessed Mrs. Hawthorne's unwavering diligence in the pursuit of nurturing her cherished rose. Each day began with watering, inspecting, and conversing with the plant as if it were an old friend. The flower bloomed and withered in cycles, as the days turned into months and the seasons changed, much like a continued dance between life and loss. Despite her age, Mrs. Hawthorne was dedicated to revitalize the rose to its original vigor. Wrinkled hands reached up and trimmed the dry, wilted leaves, occasionally pricking her skin on the thorns that adorned the stem. The tiny droplets of blood that formed with each prick reminded her of the hardships she had endured throughout her life. Other roses flourished in the massive garden, their petals reaching out towards the sun, as if in competition. The aroma of their collective blooms was intoxicating. However, the potted rose was developing thorns that grew larger with each passing day, much like barriers forming between the aging gardener and her memories. As summer approached, the rose's petals turned deeper shades of red, becoming luxuriant and drawing the attention of every visitor to the garden. The increasingly beautiful rose was perceived as a symbol of Mrs. Hawthorne’s undying love for her husband. But the awareness of its thorns was looming in her mind, serving as markers for her healing journey that demanded courage and acceptance. And one fateful day, when the sun was at its zenith, a sudden gust of wind knocked the rose off its pedestal. It descended onto the ground, the fragile petals crushed under the weight of its fall. The impact jolted Mrs. Hawthorne who rushed towards the fallen rose. An initial sense of despair washed over her, as she frantically attempted to salvage the flower, but the pieces of her cherished companion were beyond repair. As she cleaned up the remnants, a subtle shift in her perspective occurred. Holding the broken fragments of the past, Mrs. Hawthorne began to see the garden as a metaphor and finally made a decision that would change her life. The next morning, under the veil of sunrise, Mrs. Hawthorne laid the broken rose next to the pressed flowers and closed her book. Now standing tall, she surveyed her garden and recognized that the love she shared with her husband could not be contained in a single rose. For it was an ever-expanding garden filled with memories and endless love, offering the strength she needed to move forward. And so, Mrs. Hawthorne carried on, nurturing the entire garden, allowing her love to grow and live through each and every plant, as she embraced the beauty of new beginnings."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: There once lived a rich businessman who had a lazy son.

The attractiveness of a language can be based on its phonetics, rhythm, melody, or other linguistic characteristics, and this largely depends on personal preference. The second question is about the sexiest accent, which relates to the manner in which a speaker of a certain language pronounces that language based on their regional, social, or individual factors. An accent can make the same language sound different and thus more or less attractive to a listener. For example, someone might find that French is the sexiest language due to its soft and melodic intonation.

The song plays in the background as the Joker irreverently vandalizes and destroys various artworks, with only one painting, Francis Bacon's Figure with Meat, being spared due to the Joker's appreciation for its unsettling aesthetic. \\"Partyman\\" is an upbeat, funky number with a catchy beat that showcases Prince's unique and powerful vocals.

Please answer the following question: Information: - The Franco-Prussian War or Franco-German War, often referred to in France as the War of 1870 (19 July 1871), was a conflict between the Second French Empire of Napoleon III and the German states of the North German Confederation led by the Kingdom of Prussia. The conflict was caused by Prussian ambitions to extend German unification and French fears of the shift in the European balance of power that would result if the Prussians succeeded. Some historians argue that the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck deliberately provoked a French attack in order to draw the southern German statesBaden, Württemberg, Bavaria and Hesse-Darmstadtinto an alliance with the North German Confederation dominated by Prussia, while others contend that Bismarck did not plan anything and merely exploited the circumstances as they unfolded. - An assault rifle is a selective-fire rifle that uses an intermediate cartridge and a detachable magazine. Assault rifles were first used during World War II. Though Western nations were slow to accept the assault rifle concept after World War II, by the end of the 20th century they had become the standard weapon in most of the world's armies, replacing semi-automatic rifles, battle rifles and sub-machine guns in most roles. Examples include the StG 44, AK-47 and the M16 rifle. - The French Army, officially the Land Army (to distinguish it from the Air Army) is the land-based and largest component of the French Armed Forces. Along with the French Air Force, the French Navy and the National Gendarmerie, it is responsible to the French government. The current Chief of Staff of the French Army (C.E.M.A.T.) is General Jean-Pierre Bosser, a direct subordinate of the Chief of the Defence Staff (C.E.M.A.). All soldiers are considered professionals following the suspension of conscription, voted in parliament in 1997 and made effective in 2001. - The Fusil Gras Modèle 1874 M80 was a French service rifle of the 19th century . The Gras used by the French Army was an adaptation to metallic cartridge of the Chassepot breech - loading rifle by Colonel Basile Gras . - The service rifle (also known as standard-issue rifle) of a given army or armed force is that which it issues as standard to its soldiers. In modern forces, this is typically a highly versatile and rugged assault rifle, battle rifle or carbine suitable for use in nearly all theatres and environments. Service rifles are also often selected for their upgradability (e.g., the addition of underslung grenade launchers, sights, flashlights, laser sights, etc.) - The Chassepot, officially known as Fusil modèle 1866, was a bolt action military breechloading rifle, famous as the arm of the French forces in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870/1871. It replaced an assortment of Minié muzzleloading rifles many of which were converted in 1867 to breech loading (the Tabatière rifles). A great improvement to existing military rifles in 1866, the Chassepot marked the commencement of the era of modern bolt action, breech-loading, military rifles. Beginning in 1874, the rifle was easily converted to fire metallic cartridges (under the name of Gras rifle), a step which would have been impossible to achieve with the Dreyse needle rifle. - The French Navy (\\"national navy\\"), informally , is the maritime arm of the French Armed Forces. Tracing its roots back to 1624 it is one of the world's oldest naval forces and historically played a key part in establishing the French colonial empire. Since the early foundings, its roles have been defined as maintaining intelligence, protecting populations, preventing crises, intervening wherever necessary to reestablish peace, and dissuading any threats against vital French interests. The Marine nationale consists of four branches: the \\"Force d'Action Navale\\", the \\"Forces Sous-marines\\", the \\"Aéronavale\\" and the \\"Fusiliers Marins\\" (including Commandos Marine). As a blue-water navy the Marine nationale operates a wide range of fighting vessels, including a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, nuclear-powered submarines, frigates, patrol boats and support ships. The French Navy does not use prefixes of the names of its ships (such as the Royal Navy uses HMS, for instance). Foreign commentators sometimes use the prefixes \\"FS\\" (for \\"French Ship\\") or FNS (for \\"French Navy Ship\\"); these are not official, however. - Conscription, or drafting, is the compulsory enlistment of people in a national service, most often a military service. Conscription dates back to antiquity and continues in some countries to the present day under various names. The modern system of near-universal national conscription for young men dates to the French Revolution in the 1790s, where it became the basis of a very large and powerful military. Most European nations later copied the system in peacetime, so that men at a certain age would serve 18 years on active duty and then transfer to the reserve force.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Sentence: Ardmore Airport (New Zealand) is 34 meters above sea level. Its 3rd runway has the surface type of poaceae and is 597.0 in length with the name 03L/21R. What data can be extracted from this sentence?","completion":"Alright, let me explain this like I'm talking to a five-year-old. So, this sentence tells us a few things about a place called Ardmore Airport in New Zealand: 1. The airport is 34 meters higher than the sea: Imagine you're standing at the beach and the water is gently touching your feet. If you could stack 34 one-meter-tall blocks on top of each other, that's how high the airport is compared to the sea. 2. The 3rd runway at the airport has a grass surface: Like the grass in your backyard or at the park, some runways have grass instead of hard materials like concrete. The word \\"poaceae\\" is a fancy name for grass. 3. The 3rd runway is 597.0 meters long: If you could lay out almost 600 one-meter-tall blocks in a straight line, that would show us how long this grass runway is. 4. The runway's name is 03L/21R: Runways have special names to help pilots know which ones to use. Just like how your name helps your friends know who you are, this name, 03L/21R, helps pilots with the same thing. So, we learned about the height of Ardmore Airport, the grass surface and length of its 3rd runway, and its special name. Isn't that cool?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Well unfortunately the antibiotics have made her have the runs again . And for some reason when she has the runs she can not do it in the litter box . What may happen will their cat is on antibiotics ? Available choices: (1). They will go back to the vet for more .; (2). None of the above choices .; (3). They will have the runs until they feel better .; (4). They will use the litter box .;","completion":"It appears that the cat is experiencing side effects from the antibiotics, specifically diarrhea or \\"the runs.\\" When a cat is on antibiotics, there can be a few potential outcomes. In this case, option (3) seems most relevant, as the text explicitly states that the cat is suffering from the runs due to the antibiotics. Nevertheless, let's explore all the available choices in detail: (1) They will go back to the vet for more: It is unclear if the cat owner will go back to the vet for more antibiotics. Since the cat is experiencing an adverse reaction to the medication, the owner might consult the vet for advice on whether to continue the treatment or seek an alternative solution. (2) None of the above choices: This option is vague and might not offer an appropriate response to the specific situation pertaining to the cat. Although it is possible that the other options are not accurate, there is a clear indication that the antibiotics have affected the cat, as mentioned in the text. (3) They will have the runs until they feel better: This option is the most likely outcome based on the information provided in the text. Due to the antibiotics, the cat has developed diarrhea, which seems to be a temporary side effect. Once the cat's body has adjusted or finished the course of antibiotics, it is expected that the cat's condition will improve, and the runs will cease. The owner should keep a close eye on the cat's health and consult the veterinarian if the symptoms worsen or persist. (4) They will use the litter box: As the text specifically states that the cat cannot use the litter box when it has the runs, this option seems unlikely. The cat may have trouble controlling its bowel movements during this time, which can contribute to the inability to use the litter box. Once the cat's health improves and the runs subside, it is more likely that the cat will return to normal litter box habits. In conclusion, the most probable outcome is option (3), where the cat will have the runs until they feel better. While the other choices may contain elements of truth, they don't fully address the situation or the effects of the antibiotics on the cat. The cat owner should continue to monitor their pet's condition and consult the vet if needed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: This may sound like an obvious step, but many people create their list of things to do before they die mentally. While there is nothing wrong with thinking about the things you want to do, writing them down is an important part of remembering, and finally actually achieving your goals. Consider getting a small notebook that you can carry around with you. Then you can work on your list whenever you are. Spend a little extra money and get a durable notebook, if you can afford to. This can help the list last over the long term. Writing a long list of things you want to do before your die can take a while. You do not need to try to finish it in one sitting. Add to your list over over months, maybe even years. It never has to be “finished.” Eventually you’ll build a very long list. If you think of something new, take a moment to add it to the list. Your list will grow over time, and you will think of things to add even when you are not deliberately sitting down to add things. This approach will help prevent you from getting frustrated. Maybe you're someone how spends twelve hours a day at work, but make sure you don't only think about work or business goals. Varying your goals across different areas of your life will help you develop a list that can improve all aspects of your life. A few examples might be these: Relationships. Finding your soulmate, having children, seeing your children grown and having children of their own is one train of thought. Sporting achievements. This may include shooting a 70 on a golf course with no handicap, or a hole in one, or it might mean catching a blue marlin, driving a stock car, or pitching a no-hitter. One consideration on this category is being realistic about your ability, and present age. Success in business or work. Many people happily live full lives at a 9 to 5 job shuffling papers, owning a house in the suburbs, and taking the family to the local diner on Friday nights, but this may not be your idea of a goal in life. Look at possibilities, list them, and find out what it will require to achieve them. Philosophical goals. These are a little more difficult to describe, but they may include being a good neighbor, sharing your beliefs, or finding the meaning of life. Your list does not, and probably should not, reflect only material goals. Making a difference. Here, you can really challenge yourself, be it finding a great scientific discovery that ends suffering from a tragic disease, or establishing a foundation to help underprivileged children. Artistic achievements. There are a number of possible goals here, from writing a novel destined to become a classic, to painting a masterpiece. Travels. You may long to take a trip to Europe, Alaska, or the North Pole. You may even want to travel to space, and even though you may never make it there, put it on the list, and see what opportunities arise to make the dream a reality. Do not limit yourself to these categories. They are just meant to give you some suggestions. Instead, let your imagination run wild. Be as creative as you can be. Keep a notepad handy, and use your imagination to list anything that comes to mind. Be open ended, you do not need to know exactly how you will achieve every goal right now Just get them down on paper. If you limit yourself at this stage, you might miss out on things you genuinely wanted to try to accomplish. Don’t be afraid to keep items in some goals private. Do not limit yourself based on what you assume other people will think about your goals. Write them down now, and keep the list private if you want. You should think big, but also small. A mix of big and small goals will give you things that you can accomplish regularly. Not every goal has to be something for the far future. Create small goals that can lead you to your bigger goals. For example, dance at home, then take a dance lesson, then go dancing in public. When your small goals lead to your bigger goals, you will lead yourself to long term success. Write something on your list that you can do today, tomorrow, and this week. If you include items you can accomplish in the short term, you will feel like you have created a list you can actually accomplish. Add to it, or take things away. After all, it is just a personal list. It is yours to expand, change, or reduce. Keep this original list and continue to work with it. The list itself is important, because it serves as a reminder of all the things you want to do. Be willing to change your list, but also think carefully before making changes. If you take adding and subtracting from the list seriously, you are more likely to take the items on the list seriously. Summary:","completion":"This article says that making a list of things you want to do before you die is a good idea.

Write a title for this article: As a murder and corruption scandal enveloping a former member of China’s elite leadership continued to snowball, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao issued a new call on Monday for the government to end a culture of graft lest it lead to the end of Communist rule. In an article in the conservative Communist Party journal Qiushi, or Seeking Truth, Mr. Wen said the government must hold officials more strongly accountable for corruption that occurs on their watch and make the results of corruption investigations open to public inspection. The article, titled, “Let power be exercised in the sunshine,” is the latest in a string of anticorruption broadsides aired since the former Politburo member Bo Xilai was ensnared in February in a murder investigation involving his wife. Mr. Bo was removed from the Politburo after party officials issued a report accusing him of “serious disciplinary violations” and accusing his wife, Gu Kailai, of arranging the killing of Neil Heywood, a British businessman and onetime friend of the Bo family, after a financial dispute. China’s official news media have maintained a high-level drumbeat of warnings against corruption since the scandal became public, including a speech by President Hu Jintao that urged the military to rid itself of graft, and a prominent commentary last week on Xinhua, the state-run news service, that bemoaned efforts by the spouses and children of high officials to seek personal gain through official power. “We must have a profound understanding of this: That the biggest danger to a political party in power is corruption,” the article said. “If it is not handled properly, the nature of the regime may change, and its rule may end. It is an extremely difficult and important challenge we are facing right now.” Mr. Wen’s article cast the investigation of Mr. Bo and his wife as proof of the party’s determination to weed out graft no matter where it is found. “China is a socialist country ruled by law, and the dignity and authority of the law cannot be trampled,” Mr. Wen said in the article. “There is no special citizen before the law. It does not allow any special party members to override the law within the party.” Communist Party officials regularly issue anticorruption attacks and frequently make public reports listing the number of bureaucrats who have been prosecuted or the amount of money recovered from graft investigations. Mr. Wen’s article was somewhat different because it placed new emphasis on fighting graft by making the results of the investigations public, and because of its unusually harsh tone, said Zhang Xiaojin, who heads the political science department at Tsinghua University in Beijing. Mr. Wen’s toughness “is no exaggeration,” he said. “We can see that the problem is actually getting worse every year.” Â Li Bibo contributed research.","completion":"\\"Sunshine on Corruption: China's Struggle to Preserve Communist Rule Amidst Graft Scandals\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jamie Vardy did it to celebrate his goal against Spain, and by the time Wembley was filing out, the Spanish team were doing their own version down in their dressing room. The peaks come ever faster these days as canny publicists and ad men swoop in on a mass moment.

Problem:PURPOSE Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease with poor outcomes. Despite increased evidence shows that dysregulation of histone modification contributes to AML, specific drugs targeting key histone modulators are not applied in the clinical treatment of AML. Here, we investigated whether targeting KDM6B, the demethylase of tri-methylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), has a therapeutic potential for AML. METHODS A KDM6B-specific inhibitor, GSK-J4, was applied to treat the primary cells from AML patients and AML cell lines in vitro and in vivo. RNA-sequencing was performed to reveal the underlying mechanisms of inhibiting KDM6B for the treatment of AML. RESULTS Here we observed that the mRNA expression of KDM6B was up-regulated in AML and positively correlated with poor survival. Treatment with GSK-J4 increased the global level of H3K27me3 and reduced the proliferation and colony-forming ability of primary AML cells and AML cell lines. GSK-J4 treatment significantly induced cell apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest in Kasumi-1 cells, and displayed a synergistic effect with cytosine arabinoside. Notably, injection of GSK-J4 attenuated the disease progression in a human AML xenograft mouse model in vivo. Treatment with GSK-J4 predominantly resulted in down-regulation of DNA replication and cell-cycle-related pathways, as well as abrogated the expression of critical cancer-promoting HOX genes. ChIP-qPCR validated an increased enrichment of H3K27me3 in the transcription start sites of these HOX genes. CONCLUSIONS In summary, our findings suggest that targeting KDM6B with GSK-J4 has a therapeutic potential for the treatment of AML.

Going about his day, Toddy, a performer at Chez Lui in Paris, sees Labisse, the club owner, auditioning a frail, impoverished soprano, Victoria Grant (Julie Andrews). After the audition, Labisse drily writes her off, and she responds by sustaining a pitch to shatter his wine glass using resonant frequency. That night, Richard comes to Chez Lui as part of a straight foursome and Toddy incites a brawl by insulting Richard and the women in his group. Labisse fires Toddy and bans him from the club. Walking home, he spots Victoria dining at a restaurant, and she invites him to join her. As neither of them can pay for the meal, she dumps a cockroach in her salad to avoid paying their check, but it escapes and the whole place breaks out in havoc. The duo run out through the rain to Toddy's, and he invites her to stay when she finds that the rain has shrunk her cheap clothes. The next morning Richard shows up to collect his things. Victoria, who is wearing his clothes, hides in Toddy's closet. When she thinks that Richard might harm Toddy, she ambushes Richard and literally kicks him out. Witnessing this, Toddy is struck with the inspiration of passing Victoria off as a man (the illusion convinced Richard who stumbles downstairs to his friends waiting in the car claiming a strange man wearing his clothes hit him) and presenting her to Andre Cassell (John Rhys-Davies), the most successful agent in Paris, as a female impersonator.

Q: Question: what is the function of the hard palate? Would \\"Also on the anterior portion of the roof of the hard palate is the Rugae which are the irregular ridges in the mucous membrane that help facilitate the movement of food backwards towards the pharynx.\\" be a reasonable answer? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, that would be a reasonable answer. To provide further context and a step-by-step explanation: 1. The primary function of the hard palate is to separate the nasal cavity from the oral cavity. This allows for simultaneous breathing and eating without the risk of food entering the nasal passages. 2. The hard palate also plays a crucial role in the process of chewing and swallowing. It provides a stable surface against which the tongue can compress food during mastication. 3. The Rugae, which are the irregular ridges in the mucous membrane covering the hard palate, contribute to this process. They help facilitate the movement of food backwards towards the pharynx by providing additional traction and contact points for the tongue to manipulate the food. 4. Furthermore, the hard palate is involved in speech production, particularly in the formation of certain consonant sounds that require the tongue to make contact with the roof of the mouth. In summary, the function of the hard palate is to separate the nasal and oral cavities, facilitate chewing and swallowing, and play a role in speech production. The statement \\"Also on the anterior portion of the roof of the hard palate is the Rugae which are the irregular ridges in the mucous membrane that help facilitate the movement of food backwards towards the pharynx\\" accurately describes one of the functions of the hard palate and its anatomical features."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Pick from: a). no. b). yes.","completion":"While there is no absolute answer to whether the US elections will be rigged, one can analyze it from different perspectives to gain a better understanding of the potential for rigging and the likelihood of it occurring. Whether or not the winners are planned in advance is a separate question that requires a distinct analysis. Therefore, I would choose answer option a). No, these questions are not the same. Concerning the potential rigging of an election, the United States has several measures in place to ensure the legitimacy of their electoral processes, which involve multiple audits, verifications, and safeguards. Election authorities at the federal, state, and local levels work diligently to maintain fair and transparent elections. For example, most voting systems used in the US produce a paper record or a voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) to ensure that the results can be double-checked independently in case of disputes or suspected fraud. Additionally, numerous polls are run by independent organizations, providing an indirect yet considerable check on the electoral process. However, no system is entirely foolproof, and the potential for fraud or manipulation does exist. Misdeeds can arise from various possibilities, such as voter suppression, gerrymandering, or even outright hacking of the electronic voting systems. Nonetheless, most of these fraudulent activities would require coordination on a massive scale, making it extremely difficult to accomplish successfully, especially without detection. The idea of pre-determined winners relates to the concept of conspiracy theories, in which powerful and unknown entities manipulate the election process to ensure a particular candidate's victory. While election fraud has occurred in the past, claiming that the winners are planned in advance would need substantial and credible evidence to support such an assertion. Moreover, the democratic nature of the US political system, along with its tight checks and balances, makes it highly unlikely that any shadowy organization would be capable of deciding the winners without being exposed eventually. In conclusion, while the risk of election rigging and predetermined winners cannot be deemed entirely non-existent, the numerous safeguards and transparent processes in place at multiple levels of the US electoral system mitigate these risks significantly. The questions mentioned above are different in nature, as one addresses the potential for electoral manipulation, while the other delves into the realm of conspiracy theories."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

This behavior is believed to have evolved as a manifestation of sexual conflict, occurring when the reproductive interests of males and females differ.

The index measures how quickly blood sugar levels are raised after a meal, and foods with a high GI include white bread or bagels, corn flakes and puffed rice. However, diets high in fruits and vegetables were found to decrease the risk. Lead study author Dr Stephanie Melkonian, of University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, said: \\"We observed a 49 per cent increased risk of lung cancer among subjects with the highest daily GI compared to those with the lowest daily GI. • Breath test that tells you if you have lung cancer \\"Diets high in glycemic index result in higher levels of blood glucose and insulin, which promote perturbations in the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). \\"Previous research suggests increased levels of IGFs are associated with increased lung cancer risk. \\"However, the association between glycemic index and lung cancer risk was unclear.\\" In the UK, there are around 45,525 new cases of the disease diagnosed each year, while 35,371 people lose their life to the disease annually, according to Cancer Research UK.

Five cancer red flags to never ignore The study, published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, is the largest ever to investigate the potential link between glycemic index and lung cancer. Scientists surveyed 1,905 patients newly diagnosed with lung cancer and compared the results with 2,413 healthy individuals. Senior study author Dr Xifeng Wu said: \\"The associations were more pronounced among subjects who were never smokers, diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma or had less than 12 years of education. \\"This suggests that it is the average quality, instead of quantity, of carbohydrates consumed that may modulate lung cancer risk.\\" Photo: Alamy Dr Wu added: \\"The results from this study suggest that, besides maintaining healthy lifestyles, such as avoiding tobacco, limiting alcohol consumption and being physically active, reducing the consumption of foods and beverages with high glycemic index may serve as a means to lower the risk of lung cancer.\\" • Lung cancer victims lack sympathy ||||| Scientists from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center have found that people who eat a diet full of high glycemic index foods—think processed white bread, bagels, white rice, baguettes—had a 49% higher risk of developing lung cancer, even if they’ve never smoked a single cigarette. The study, which was published in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention this week, is the largest ever to investigate the potential links between glycemic index and lung cancer, according to the authors. A glycemic index is a measurement of how rapidly carbohydrates elevate blood sugar levels in the body. The higher the glycemic index, the more rapidly blood sugar levels rise after a meal which results in elevated levels of blood glucose and insulin. That in turns raises what’s called insulin-like growth factors, which are linked to an increased lung cancer risk, according to the scientists. Scientists at MD Anderson surveyed 1,905 patients newly diagnosed with lung cancer and another 2,413 healthy individuals, all non-Hispanic whites. Those subjects reported their past dietary habits and health histories, and they were then divided into groups based on their associated glycemic index and glycemic load, a measure of carbohydrate quantity. “We observed a 49% increased risk of lung cancer among subjects with the highest daily glycemic index compared to those with the lowest daily glycemic index,” said Xifeng Wu, professor of epidemiology and senior author of the study. “The associates were more pronounced among subjects who were never smokers.” Interestingly, there was no link between the glycemic load—i.e. the quantity of carbohydrates consumed—and lung cancer, which suggests that it’s the quality, not the amount of carbohydrates, that has the biggest effect on lung cancer risk, said Wu. Lung cancer is the second most common cancer among both men and women in the U.S. It’s also the leading cause of cancer mortality, with over 150,000 deaths from lung cancer expected in the U.S. this year alone, according to the American Cancer Society. Smoking and tobacco use is still the leading cause, though it doesn’t account for all cases. Researchers had long suspected a link between a high-glycemic index diet and lung cancer risk, but the link between the two was unclear until now. Among non-smokers in the study, those within the highest glycemic index group were more than twice as likely to develop lung cancer as those in the lowest group. For smokers, the difference was elevated by 31% between the two groups. “The results from this study suggest that, besides maintaining healthy lifestyles, such as avoiding tobacco, limiting alcohol consumption, and being physically active, reducing the consumption of foods and beverages with high glycemic index may serve as a means to lower the risk of lung cancer,” said Wu. Low glycemic index foods include things like 100% stone-ground whole wheat bread, rolled or steel-cut oatmeal, most fruits, and non-starchy vegetables. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE People who eat a sugary, starchy diet may be raising their risk of lung cancer, even if they don’t smoke, researchers say. They found that people who recall eating more foods that have a high glycemic index also were more likely to develop lung cancer. Glycemic index is a term that’s familiar to people with diabetes. It describes food that raises blood sugar and stimulates production of insulin — think bagels, white rice and some fruits such as melon and pineapple. It’s not the first study to link glycemic index with cancer risk, but it’s rare to link it with lung cancer. That may be mostly because lung cancer is so overwhelmingly caused by smoking. The team at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston studied 1,905 people who had just been diagnosed with lung cancer and compared them to 2,415 people without cancer. They quizzed them about their eating habits, smoking, income and other factors. \\"Reducing the consumption of foods and beverages with high glycemic index may serve as a means to lower the risk of lung cancer.\\" People who ate the most foods with a high glycemic index were about 50 percent more likely to be in the lung cancer group than people who reported they ate the fewest high-glycemic foods, the team reported in the journal Cancer Epidemiology and Biomarkers. The link was stronger among people who never smoked; non-smokers were more than twice as likely to have lung cancer if they reported eating a high-glycemic diet. “The results from this study suggest that, besides maintaining healthy lifestyles, reducing the consumption of foods and beverages with high glycemic index may serve as a means to lower the risk of lung cancer,” said Dr. Xifeng Wu, who led the study. Related: Here's how sugar might fuel the growth of cancer How can this happen? Doctors aren’t sure, but there’s a theory that high-glycemic foods stimulate the body to make insulin, which in turn affects the growth of cells via compounds called insulin-like growth factors or IGF. Cancer is the uncontrolled proliferation of cells, so it might be that the high-glycemic foods are fueling the growth of tiny tumors. “IGFs have been shown to play a critical role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation in cancer and there is evidence to suggest that IGFs are elevated in lung cancer patients,” Wu’s team wrote. It’s a suspect in several types of cancer. “Previous studies have investigated the association between glycemic index, and the related measure glycemic load, and a variety of cancers including colorectal, stomach, pancreas, endometrial, ovarian, prostate, and thyroid but these studies are limited and results have been largely inconclusive,” the researchers wrote. This study is not conclusive, either. For one thing, the researchers asked their volunteers to remember what they ate. For another, it’s an association. People who eat high-glycemic foods may also do something else that also raises their risk of cancer. And this particular study focused only on non-Hispanic white people. Marji McCullough, an expert in nutritional epidemiology at the American Cancer Society, says it will be important to look at people who don't have cancer now and watch what they eat for years or decades, and see who develops cancer. Related: Cancer experts are mad about the dietary guidelines Lung cancer is the No. 1 cancer killer in the U.S., killing more than 150,000 people a year. It causes only vague symptoms at first, so when most people are diagnosed, the cancer has already spread and is then far more likely to be fatal. Experts know diet and lifestyle can affect cancer. Obesity, lack of exercise, eating red meat and lots of high-fat dairy foods, and eating too few fruits and vegetables can all raise a person’s odds of developing cancer. This study adds to a growing body of evidence that people can lower their cancer risk not only by staying away from tobacco and exercising more, but by choosing a healthier diet. \\"Aside from not smoking, it’s important to follow cancer prevention guidelines that maintain healthy body weight, physical activity, and eating an overall healthy diet rich in vegetables and plant food and lower red and processed meat. Choose foods that help maintain healthy body weight,\\" McCullough said. According to the American Diabetes Association, low-glycemic foods include: 100 percent stone-ground whole wheat or pumpernickel bread Oatmeal (rolled or steel-cut), oat bran, muesli Pasta, converted rice, barley, bulgar Sweet potato, corn, yam, lima/butter beans, peas, legumes and lentils Most fruits, non-starchy vegetables and carrots Medium glycemic index foods include: Whole wheat, rye and pita bread Quick oats Brown, wild or basmati rice, couscous High glycemic index foods include: ||||| Abstract Background: Postprandial glucose (PPG) and insulin responses play a role in carcinogenesis. We evaluated the association between dietary glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL), markers of carbohydrate intake and PPG, and lung cancer risk in non-Hispanic whites. Methods: GL and GI were assessed among 1,905 newly diagnosed lung cancer cases recruited from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX) and 2,413 healthy controls recruited at Kelsey-Seybold Clinics (Houston, TX). We assessed associations between quintiles of GI/GL and lung cancer risk and effect modification by various risk factors. ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression. Results: We observed a significant association between GI [5th vs. 1st quintile (Q) OR = 1.49; 95% CI, 1.21–1.83; P trend <0.001] and lung cancer risk and GI ac (5th vs. 1st Q OR = 1.48; 95% CI, 1.20–1.81; P trend = 0.001) and lung cancer risk. We observed a more pronounced association between GI and lung cancer risk among never smokers (5th vs. 1st Q OR = 2.25; 95% CI, 1.42–3.57), squamous cell carcinomas (SCC; 5th vs. 1st Q OR = 1.92; 95% CI, 1.30–2.83), and those with less than 12 years of education (5th vs. 1st Q OR = 1.75; 95% CI, 1.19–2.58, P interaction = 0.02). Conclusion: This study suggests that dietary GI and other lung cancer risk factors may jointly and independently influence lung cancer etiology. Impact: Understanding the role of GI in lung cancer could inform prevention strategies and elucidate biologic pathways related to lung cancer risk.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person that Sabina left after they left their family?, using the article: Tomas, a successful brain surgeon in Communist Czechoslovakia, is pursuing an affair with Sabina, an equally care-free artist in Prague. Dr Tomas takes a trip to a spa town for a specialized surgery. There, he meets dissatisfied waitress Tereza, who desires intellectual stimulation. She tracks him down in Prague and moves in with him, complicating Tomas's affairs. Tomas asks Sabina to help Tereza find work as a photographer. Tereza is fascinated and jealous as she grasps that Sabina and Tomas are lovers, but feels affection for Sabina. Nevertheless, Tomas marries Tereza, in a simple ceremony with both perpetually laughing, followed by her double standard distress about Tomas' promiscuity. Although she considers leaving Tomas, she becomes more attached to Tomas when the Soviet Army invades Czechoslovakia. Amidst the confusion, Tereza photographs demonstrations against the Soviet forces, then hands the rolls of film to foreigners to smuggle to the West. Facing the stultifying reality that replaced the Prague Spring, Tomas, Sabina and Tereza flee Czechoslovakia for Switzerland: first Sabina, then the hesitant Tomas and Tereza. In Geneva, Sabina encounters Franz, a married university professor: they begin a love affair. After some time, he decides to abandon his wife and family for her. After hearing the declaration, Sabina abandons Franz, feeling he would emotionally weigh her down. Meanwhile, Tereza and Tomas attempt to adapt to Switzerland, whose people Tereza finds inhospitable. When she discovers that Tomas continues womanizing, she leaves him and returns to Czechoslovakia. Upset by her leaving, Tomas follows Tereza to Czechoslovakia, where his passport is confiscated, trapping him in-country: nevertheless, his return elates Tereza.

After almost non-stop touring for the previous three years, Ice took a break from music in 1993 and began competing in jet skiing (becoming the 6th best jet ski racer in the world and obtaining sponsorship from Kawasaki) as well as resuming Motocross racing. By 1994, Ice received less publicity and became removed from the public spotlight. After becoming more interested with the Rastafari movement, Ice became a vegetarian, grew dreadlocks and talked more openly about smoking cannabis. On March 22, 1994, Ice released his second studio album, Mind Blowin'. Reviews were unfavorable. Entertainment Weekly reviewer James Bernard called the album \\"more clunky than funky\\". Rolling Stone reviewer Danyel Smith praised the song \\"Get Loose\\" as \\"snappy\\", writing that although the lyrics are \\"inane\\", \\"the song is a thumping party, one of the few places where Ice loosens up. He sounds solid at the beginning of 'The Wrath' as well ... In 'Now and Forever,' a wet dream kind of song, Ice goes back to goofy lyrics.\\" Allrovi reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that \\"There isn't a single moment that establishes a distinct musical identity, and the whole thing is rather embarrassing.\\" Primus bassist Les Claypool stated in response to Ice's cannabis-oriented lyrics: \\"That's all fine and dandy and cute, but it could be misconstrued and manipulated by the wrong people.\\" When asked about the drug oriented sound years later, Vanilla Ice said \\"A lot of the record is drug oriented because I was doing a lot of drugs at the time\\". Shortly afterward, SBK went bankrupt. At around this time, Ice began using ecstasy, cocaine and heroin. During periods of heavy drug use, Ice received many tattoos from artist acquaintances. According to Ice, he \\"was in [his] binge days. [He] didn't even realize how many [he] was getting\\". Ice attempted suicide with a heroin overdose on July 4, 1994 but was revived by his friends. After being revived, Ice decided that it was time to change his lifestyle. As a symbol of his attempt to begin anew, he got a tattoo of a leaf on his stomach. After expanding his Mind Blowin tour overseas in 1995, Ice sold his estate in California and took a break from music, rather focusing on motocrossing and jet skiing in Florida. By the summer Ice was the world's No. 6-ranked sit-down Jet Ski racer, competing nearly every weekend and earning a Kawasaki sponsorship. Uncertain about his future career, Ice studied real estate and started working on the side renovating and selling houses. In late 1995, Ice set up a recording studio in Miami and joined a grunge band, Pickin Scabz. The name was set to reflect Ice's career and how he was healing from his suicide attempt and that he was now \\"picking up the pieces\\". Ice expressed an interest in performing hip hop-influenced rock music, but found that the band was unable to produce the sound he was looking for.

Is \\"The hypnotic electronic dance song \\"On and On\\", produced in 1984 by Chicago DJ Jesse Saunders and co-written by Vince Lawrence, had elements that became staples of the early house sound, such as the Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer and minimal vocals as well as a Roland (specifically TR-808) drum machine and Korg (specifically Poly-61) synthesizer.\\" the correct answer?","completion":"Yes, the statement provided is correct. \\"On and On\\" is indeed a hypnotic electronic dance song produced in 1984 by Chicago-based DJ Jesse Saunders. Saunders, along with co-writer Vince Lawrence, pioneered the early house sound through the incorporation of a range of innovative musical elements. One of the key features of \\"On and On\\" was the use of the Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer. This instrument, released in 1981, was initially designed to accompany guitarists during practice sessions, but it soon found popularity among electronic musicians for its unique, squelchy \\"acid\\" bass sound. This particular sound would go on to become a defining characteristic of the acid house subgenre, which emerged in the late 1980s. The Roland TR-808 drum machine, another staple of the early house sound, was also used in the song's production. As one of the most influential drum machines ever made, the TR-808 offered a wealth of highly customizable rhythm and percussion options. Its distinctive sounds – particularly its booming, synthesized kick drum – played an integral role in shaping not only house music but also various other electronic and hip-hop genres. Additionally, the Korg Poly-61 synthesizer was employed in the making of \\"On and On.\\" Released in late 1982, the Poly-61 was Korg's first digitally controlled analog synthesizer and enabled musicians to produce complex, layered sounds. Its combination of digital programming and warm analog tones made it a popular choice for artists across genres, further solidifying its place in electronic music history. Lastly, \\"On and On\\" featured minimal, repetitive vocals, which became another hallmark of the early house sound. This stripped-back approach to songwriting allowed for an emphasis on the track's rhythm and groove, ultimately laying the groundwork for countless other producers to follow. In conclusion, Jesse Saunders and Vince Lawrence's 1984 song \\"On and On\\" is a groundbreaking example of early house music. It captures the era's pioneering spirit, showcasing a unique synthesis of innovative sonic components, such as the Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer, Roland TR-808 drum machine, and Korg Poly-61 synthesizer, in addition to minimal vocals, which went on to define the genre for years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker. After reading the above, is \\"Quds mosque\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What group did Atta join that failed at trying to bring together two religions?\\"?","completion":"Yes, based on the information provided, \\"Quds mosque\\" is the correct answer to the question \\"What group did Atta join that failed at trying to bring together two religions?\\" Atta joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg in the fall of 1997, which aimed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians.

On a rocky outcrop ringed by the flaming red and orange vines and red-brick living quarters for teachers, Kanhaiya Kumar, India's most loved and loathed student, looks remarkably composed. It's been barely a month since the 28-year-old Phd student of African studies was picked up by the police and charged with sedition for allegedly shouting anti-India slogans at a meeting on the campus. (Two other students remain in custody.) It's barely a week since Mr Kumar, who's the president of the students' union and is affiliated to Communist Party of India, was freed on bail, and gave a stirring speech on the campus that went viral. Mr Kumar, according to political scientist Suhas Palshikar, is the latest student to be associated with the \\"simmering unrest\\" on Indian campuses, a \\"result of the BJP's newfound ideological aggression and political arrogance\\". Many are calling him a student icon. Over the last month, Mr Kumar has inspired a hefty Wikipedia entry, stirring paeans to a rising leader (Red Star over India, exulted The Telegraph), even listicles. His friends reckon he has already given 50 media interviews in five days. A little-know fringe group leader with a paltry bank balance announced a hefty bounty on his head, his Facebook account has been hacked, his mobile phone seized by the police. Some people have even begun raising money in his name. Mr Kumar's many admirers believe Prime Minister Narendra Modi has \\"met his match\\" in the feisty student. His critics have called him an anarchist, a misguided idealist, a sloganeering \\"Johnny-come-lately who is upstaging stalwarts\\", and given him gratuitous advice on how he should stop politicking and begin earning for his poor parents. \\"I get up in the morning, do some work for the union, and then do interviews all day. They say after TV channels and newspapers, the magazines will come,\\" he says. Mr Kumar appears to be basking in the warm glow of his meteoric media rise. When he's not handling the scrum, there's time for some light banter with friends. When a friend teases him about being an attention seeker, he quips, \\"Only (Prime Minister Modi) suffers from an attention seeker's syndrome.\\" Some hearty laughter follows. He's carrying some handwritten papers of Brecht's poetry, translated in Hindi - \\"The book is out of print, so we are sharing these handwritten poems.\\" Many believe that in a nation desperate for heroes and soaked in a febrile media culture adept at myth making and instant vilification, Mr Kumar has been thrust into an uncomfortable spotlight by a fumbling and offensive government and a clutch of hostile news channels. So does he feel like an accidental hero? \\"I am no hero,\\" says Mr Kumar. \\"Thank the people who made me a hero, including a section of the media who work for a particular party. The real heroes and heroines are those who are fighting for democracy against an authoritarian regime.\\" He does not suffer from any false modesty. He hasn't become famous overnight, he says. It has been a \\"gradual process\\" since he first arrived at JNU from his village in Begusarai in Bihar. (His father, a small farmer, cannot work any longer as he is paralysed after a stroke and his mother is a government childcare centre worker.) \\"I had a culture shock when I arrived in JNU. There are students from 145 countries here. My horizons have grown. Last year, I was voted as the leader of the students' union,\\" he says. Students say his rousing performance in November's presidential debate - a town-hall discussion, a day before the union election - made him a name on the campus. A Kumar speech, delivered in fluent Hindi, is usually an animated performance of oratory, rhetoric, wit and gladiatorial mojo. \\"The number of Facebook friends jumped from 2,000 to 5,000. A thousand people followed me. There is now pressure from people when you are not updating your status. Four hundred people like your status now, up from 20 before,\\" he says. \\"Things have obviously moved fast [since my arrest]. When my Facebook account is hacked, people raise money in my name and I am targeted to run down my university, I feel a bit uneasy.\\" Mr Kumar says his critics - mostly irate, older urbanites - who describe him as an amateur in politics forget that he was initiated very early when he was studying at a college in Patna. \\"I was part of a group in college which spoke out about why classes were not being held, why women were harassed, why sons of politicians were misbehaving on the campus.\\" \\"So you have to understand that my politics is rooted in my lived experiences. It didn't happen overnight.\\" I ask him about his politics. Some of it is an inspired mix of liberalism and boilerplate leftism: the battle in India is \\"between pro-democracy versus anti-democracy, pro-people versus pro-corporate\\". Other times, it is more nuanced: India's left parties need \\"to get rid of their purity\\", secular parties should unite against the scourge of religious politics, the \\"progressive forces\\" have regrettably ceded space to the right-wing, parties should leave their student wings alone to help them grow freely. Despite the events of the last month, Mr Kumar looks unusually calm. He is not easy to provoke. It is difficult to figure out whether he's being cheeky or earnest when he names Anupam Kher and Paresh Rawal, two Bollywood actors, who openly back Mr Modi's BJP aggressively, as his favourites. So there is also a life beyond beyond politics. Days before he was put behind bars for shouting slogans - reports say some of the videos of his speech telecast by some channels were doctored - he discovered Leonardo DiCaprio. \\"I am brushing up my English, so we went to watch The Revenant. I loved it, mainly because of Leo. My friends were telling me that he should have won the Oscar much earlier. I had no idea about his previous work. \\"When I was in jail I heard that he had won the Oscar. I felt very happy.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"This article is about Kanhaiya Kumar, a student from India who has become both loved and loathed.

Key elements: early twentieth century, Marans, famous, local bean of Marans, fairs, honor, especially red beans. Sentence 2: Until the early twentieth century, Marans was famous for the \\"red bean of Marans\\" and its fairs in honor of these particularly local beans. Key elements: early twentieth century, Marans, famous, red bean of Marans, fairs, honor, particularly local beans. 2. Compare the key elements in the sentences: The common elements are: early twentieth century, Marans, famous, fairs, honor. The differences lie in the characterization of the beans: - Sentence 1: local bean of Marans, especially red beans. - Sentence 2: red bean of Marans, particularly local beans. 3. Determine if these differences change the overall meaning: In Sentence 1, the focus is more on the beans being local to Marans, and the beans are notably red. In Sentence 2, the emphasis is on the red color of the beans, and these beans are especially local. Although the specific emphasis on the beans' characteristics is slightly switched, the overall meaning of the two sentences is similar: - Marans was famous for a specific type of bean (local, red) until the early twentieth century. - There were fairs in Marans to celebrate these beans. However, the switch in emphasis could lead to a nuanced difference in meaning: - Sentence 1 emphasizes more on the locality of the beans, with color being a secondary characteristic. - Sentence 2 emphasizes more on the color of the beans, with the locality being a secondary characteristic. In conclusion, while both sentences convey a similar overall meaning, there is a nuanced difference in the emphasis on the characteristics of the beans."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Paul didn't think any of that was necessary. Greg had given in and he wasn't going to call and cancel the check now. He'd agreed for a reason, and once Greg had a reason for making a decision it was usually impossible to change his mind. And it didn't make sense anyway. All he would have done is buy himself a little more time. Chloe and Paul would just march right back in and start all over again - probably after sending out pics of Evan in drag to all the employees.

Article: The Social Security Administration announced Monday that it will immediately cease efforts to collect on taxpayers’ debts to the government that are more than 10 years old. The action comes after The Washington Post reported that the government was seizing state and federal tax refunds that were on their way to about 400,000 Americans who had relatives who owed money to the Social Security agency. In many cases, the people whose refunds were intercepted had never heard of any debt, and the debts dated as far back as the middle of the past century. “I have directed an immediate halt to further referrals under the Treasury Offset Program to recover debts owed to the agency that are 10 years old and older pending a thorough review of our responsibility and discretion under the current law,” the acting Social Security commissioner, Carolyn Colvin, said in a statement. Colvin said anyone who has received Social Security or Supplemental Security Income benefits and “believes they have been incorrectly assessed with an overpayment” should contact the agency and “seek options to resolve the overpayment.” The effort to collect on old debts began with a single line in the 2008 farm bill that lifted the statute of limitations on debts to the government that are more than 10 years old. The Treasury Department then set up rules that allowed the government to settle such debts by intercepting taxpayers’ refunds. The department has collected about 2 billion in intercepted tax refunds this year, 75 million of that on debts delinquent for more than 10 years. If you're one of the millions of Americans using your tax refund like a “forced savings account,” here's why you shouldn’t — with marshmallow Peeps to help explain. Michelle Singletary contributed to this video. (Kate M. Tobey and Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post) Mary Grice, a federal worker who lives in Takoma Park, Md., never got the refunds she was expecting to see in her mailbox this year. The government seized her checks because of a 2,996 debt that was supposedly incurred under her father’s Social Security number. Her father died in 1960, when she was 4, and her mother received survivors’ benefits thereafter. But 37 years passed between when the Social Security agency says it overpaid someone in the Grice family and when Mary Grice’s refund was taken. She was unable to find out from the agency exactly who received the overpayment — her mother or perhaps her father’s first wife, both of whom are no longer living. The suspension of the collection effort is “the right thing to do,” said Grice’s attorney, Robert Vogel. “It’s a first step. The next thing they have to do is stop collecting debts from children under any circumstances.” Vogel filed suit in federal court in Greenbelt, Md., last week, alleging that the government denied Grice due process by failing to give her notice of the debt and by taking the money from her, even though she was not receiving government benefits at the time the debt was incurred. Vogel and several members of Congress argued that the government should not be holding children accountable for the financial acts of their parents. The Federal Trade Commission, on its Web site, advises Americans that “family members typically are not obligated to pay the debts of a deceased relative from their own assets.” After The Post’s article was published late last week, many hundreds of taxpayers whose refunds had been intercepted came forward and complained to members of Congress that they had been given no notice of the debts and that the government had not explained why they were being held responsible for debts that their deceased parents may have incurred. In a note Social Security officials sent to several members of Congress on Monday, the agency said, “We will be reexamining our responsibilities under current law for such referrals and will be notifying you of our conclusions upon completion of the thorough review.” In a letter to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Monday, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said that government agencies were apparently “not properly notifying individuals or allowing them to inspect records of the debt they supposedly owe, which are violations of the law.” Grassley said that although Congress did authorize the government to seek payment on old debts, the law “says nothing about allowing the government to offset payments from an individual to pay debts not in his or her name. It is unclear where the government has that authority.” The senator said that Congress created a rigorous system to ensure that debt collection is handled transparently but that “it appears that agencies are abusing this system.” ||||| A few weeks ago, with no notice, the U.S. government intercepted Mary Grice’s tax refunds from both the IRS and the state of Maryland. Grice had no idea that Uncle Sam had seized her money until some days later, when she got a letter saying that her refund had gone to satisfy an old debt to the government — a very old debt. When Grice was 4, back in 1960, her father died, leaving her mother with five children to raise. Until the kids turned 18, Sadie Grice got survivor benefits from Social Security to help feed and clothe them. Now, Social Security claims it overpaid someone in the Grice family — it’s not sure who — in 1977. After 37 years of silence, four years after Sadie Grice died, the government is coming after her daughter. Why the feds chose to take Mary’s money, rather than her surviving siblings’, is a mystery. Across the nation, hundreds of thousands of taxpayers who are expecting refunds this month are instead getting letters like the one Grice got, informing them that because of a debt they never knew about — often a debt incurred by their parents — the government has confiscated their check. The Treasury Department has intercepted 1.9 billion in tax refunds already this year — 75 million of that on debts delinquent for more than 10 years, said Jeffrey Schramek, assistant commissioner of the department’s debt management service. The aggressive effort to collect old debts started three years ago — the result of a single sentence tucked into the farm bill lifting the 10-year statute of limitations on old debts to Uncle Sam. If you're one of the millions of Americans using your tax refund like a \\"forced savings account,\\" here's why you shouldn't—with marshmallow Peeps to help explain. Michelle Singletary contributed to this video. (Kate M. Tobey and Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post) No one seems eager to take credit for reopening all these long-closed cases. A Social Security spokeswoman says the agency didn’t seek the change; ask Treasury. Treasury says it wasn’t us; try Congress. Congressional staffers say the request probably came from the bureaucracy. The only explanation the government provides for suddenly going after decades-old debts comes from Social Security spokeswoman Dorothy Clark: “We have an obligation to current and future Social Security beneficiaries to attempt to recoup money that people received when it was not due.” Since the drive to collect on very old debts began in 2011, the Treasury Department has collected 424 million in debts that were more than 10 years old. Those debts were owed to many federal agencies, but the one that has many Americans howling this tax season is the Social Security Administration, which has found 400,000 taxpayers who collectively owe 714 million on debts more than 10 years old. The agency expects to have begun proceedings against all of those people by this summer. “It was a shock,” said Grice, 58. “What incenses me is the way they went about this. They gave me no notice, they can’t prove that I received any overpayment, and they use intimidation tactics, threatening to report this to the credit bureaus.” Grice filed suit against the Social Security Administration in federal court in Greenbelt this week, alleging that the government violated her right to due process by holding her responsible for a 2,996 debt supposedly incurred under her father’s Social Security number. Social Security officials told Grice that six people — Grice, her four siblings and her father’s first wife, whom she never knew — had received benefits under her father’s account. The government doesn’t look into exactly who got the overpayment; the policy is to seek compensation from the oldest sibling and work down through the family until the debt is paid. The Federal Trade Commission, on its Web site, advises Americans that “family members typically are not obligated to pay the debts of a deceased relative from their own assets.” But Social Security officials say that if children indirectly received assistance from public dollars paid to a parent, the children’s money can be taken, no matter how long ago any overpayment occurred. The IRS has seen plenty of excuses from people trying to get out of paying their taxes. Jackie Kucinich takes a look at the agency's own list of creative ways folks have tried to dodge tax day. (Julie Percha/The Washington Post) “While we are responsible for collecting delinquent debts owed to taxpayers, we understand the importance of ensuring that debtors are treated fairly,” Treasury’s Schramek said in a statement responding to questions from The Washington Post. He said Treasury requires that debtors be given due process. Social Security spokeswoman Clark, who declined to discuss Grice’s or any other case, even with the taxpayer’s permission, said the agency is “sensitive to concerns about our attempts to arrange repayment of overpayments.” She said that before taking any money, Social Security makes “multiple attempts to contact debtors via the U.S. Mail and by phone.” Grice, who works for the Food and Drug Administration and lives in Takoma Park, in the same apartment she’s resided in since 1984, never got any notice about a debt. Social Security officials told her they had sent their notice to her post office box in Roxboro, N.C. Grice rented that box from 1977 to 1979 and never since. And Social Security has Grice’s current address: Every year, it sends her a statement about her benefits. “Their record-keeping seems to be very spotty,” she said. Treasury officials say that before they will take someone’s refund, the agency owed the money must certify the debt, meaning there must be evidence of the overpayment. But Social Security officials told Grice they had no records explaining the debt. “The craziest part of this whole thing is the way the government seizes a child’s money to satisfy a debt that child never even knew about,” says Robert Vogel, Grice’s attorney. “They’ll say that somebody got paid for that child’s benefit, but the child had no control over the money and there’s no way to know if the parent ever used the money for the benefit of that kid.” Grice, the middle of five children, said neither of her surviving siblings — one older, one younger — has had any money taken by the government. When Grice asked why she had been selected to pay the debt, she was told it was because she had an income and her address popped up — the correct one this time. Grice found a lawyer willing to take her case without charge. Vogel is exercised about the constitutional violations he sees in the retroactive lifting of the 10-year limit on debt collection. “Can the government really bring back to life a case that was long dead?” the lawyer asked. “Can it really be right to seize a child’s money to satisfy a parent’s debt?” But many other taxpayers whose refunds have been taken say they’ve been unable to contest the confiscations because of the cost, because Social Security cannot provide records detailing the original overpayment, and because the citizens, following advice from the IRS to keep financial documents for just three years, had long since trashed their own records. In Glenarm, Ill., Brenda and Mike Samonds have spent the past year trying to figure out how to get back the 189.10 tax refund the government seized, claiming that Mike’s mother, who died 33 years ago, had been overpaid on survivor’s benefits after Mike’s father died in 1969. “It was never Mike’s money, it was his mother’s,” Brenda Samonds said. “The government took the money first and then they sent us the letter. We could never get one sentence from them explaining why the money was taken.” The government mailed its notice about the debt to the house Mike’s mother lived in 40 years ago. The Social Security spokeswoman said the agency uses a private contractor to seek current addresses and is supposed to halt collections if notices are returned as undeliverable. After hours on the phone trying and failing to get information about the debt Mike’s mother was said to owe, the Samondses gave up. After waiting on hold for two hours with Social Security last week, Ted Verbich also concluded it wasn’t worth the time or money to fight for the 172 the government intercepted last month. In 1977, Verbich, now 57, was in college at the University of Maryland when he took a full-time job in an accountant’s office. Because he was earning income, he knew he had to give up the survivor’s benefits his mother had received since his father died, when Verbich was 4. But his 70 monthly checks — “They helped with the car payment,” he said — kept coming for a short time after he started work, and Verbich was notified in 1978 that he had to repay about 600. He did. Thirty-six years later, with no notice, “they snatched my Maryland tax refund,” said Verbich, a federal worker who has lived at the same address in Glendale, Md,. for 30 years and regularly receives Social Security statements there. The feds insisted that he owed 172 but could provide no documents to back up the claim. Verbich has given up on getting his refund, but he wants a receipt stating that his debt to his country is resolved. “I’ll put in the request,” a Social Security clerk told Verbich, “but in reality, you’ll never get anything.” Grice was also told there was little point in seeking a waiver of her debt. Collections can only be halted if the person passes two tests, Clark said: The taxpayer must prove that he “is without fault, and [that] repayment of the overpayment would deprive the person of income needed for ordinary living expenses.” More than 1,200 appeals have been filed on the old cases, Clark said; taxpayers have won about 10 percent of those appeals. The Treasury initially held the full amount of Grice’s federal and state refunds, a total of 4,462. Last week, after The Washington Post inquired about Grice’s case, the government returned the portion of her refund above the 2,996 owed on her father’s account. But unless the feds can prove that she ever received any of the overpayment, Grice wants all of her money back. “Look, I love a good fight, especially for principle,” she said. “My mom used to say, �?This country is carried on the backs of the little people,’ and now I see what she meant. This is really sad.” |||||Summary:","completion":"The Social Security Administration announced that it will stop attempting to collect taxpayers' debts to the government that are more than 10 years old.

Write highlights for this article: Britain is bracing itself for a lashing from the elements when the driest month on record is set to be blown away by 70mph winds and heavy rain this weekend. But it has been a case of the calm before the storm today with much of the country basking in the warm conditions and clear skies - and some stunning sunsets across parts of the South. The spectacular summery weather is set to come to a dramatic end, however, with forecasters predicting that dismal conditions will settle in over the next few days. Scroll down for video. Calm before the storm: Two men enjoy what could be the last of the glorious Indian Summer weather as they take a row on the River Cam in Cambridge this morning. Forecasters have predicted dismal conditions over the next few days, but much of Britain has been enjoying the glorious weather that typified much of September. This stunning scene was captured across Aylesbury Vale in Buckinghamshire last night, but the sun is also setting on the glorious weather with up to 60mm of rain falling in a matter of hours in some parts. Sunlight bursts through the mist over Corfe Castle in Dorset. Despite the settled weather in the last few dayts, the The Met Office has said that downpours over the next few days could lead to surface water flooding. Up to 60mm of rain could fall in a matter of hours while severe gales of up to 70mph are set to batter parts of the north with temperatures plunging by 10C. The grim forecast comes days after early figures indicated last month is set to be the driest September across the UK since records began in 1910. It is also likely to finish in the top five warmest Septembers. The Met Office warned severe gales with gusts of up to 70mph were possible in north-west Scotland in a yellow 'be aware' alert. The sun sets over Aylesbury Vale in Buckinghamshire in a picture taken from Dunstable Downs. Severe weather warnings of rain are in place for parts of the north and west of Britain today and tomorrow. Picturesque: This autumnal scene was captured at Sycamore Gap along Hadrian's Wall last night. The grim forecast comes days after early figures indicated last month is set to be the driest September across the UK since records began in 1910. With the sun shinging and beneath clear blue skies, a man enjoys the fine weather as he walks his dog along the beach in Hastings, East Sussex. Despite the dire weather forecast, these four girls found it warm enough today to paddle in the sea at the beach in Hastings, East Sussex. Fine day for a walk: The surface of the water sparkles in the October sun today as a man walks his dog along the shore at Hastings. The Chief Forecaster's assessment said: 'Although such wind speeds are not unusual across these areas of Scotland, the contrast with the recent quiet weather means that a few minor impacts may occur.' A yellow warning for rain was also issued with 'heavy and persistent' downpours predicted in parts of southern Scotland, Northern Ireland, northern England and Wales from Friday afternoon until Saturday morning. Forecasters said between 20mm (0.8in) and 40mm (1.6in) could fall 'quite widely' across the warning area, while some places could see more than 60mm (2.4in) with much of the rain falling within a few hours. Making a splash: A 'super-pod' of more than a thousand dolphins was spotted off the coast of pembrokeshire - as they swim further inland to feed and raise their young. Experts at The Sea Trust counted the mass off the Pembrokeshire coast in the Bristol Channel. They say the pod is at least a thousand strong but admit it could be an under-estimate as they are impossible to keep track of. Sailing volunteers on the boat 'Cartlett Lady' were surrounded for nearly three hours by 'wall to wall' dolphins as they surveyed a 35 mile stretch. The Met Office said the downpours could lead to surface water flooding, saying: 'The public should be aware of the potential for some localised impacts to travel due to surface water flooding.' It said the high pressure which settled over Britain and protected it from Atlantic depressions in September is in the process of moving - and making room for conditions more in keeping with October. Drivers are being warned of the risk of flash flooding. A man heads out early to the banks o the River Cam in Cambridgeshire for some fishing. Rain is set to sweep in over the South and East of England tomorrow morning. A team of rowers head out for an early morning row on the River Cam while a thin blanket of mist covers the trees in the back ground. The calm scenes are set to come to an end when an Atlantic front moves in across Britain. Enjoy it while it lasts: Temperatures across Britain have remained above average for the beginning of October - but the mercury could plummet by 10C in some parts with the glorious conditions expected to come to an end tomorrow. Forecasters say the high pressure that settled over Britain for much of September is finally moving away and wetter and cooler conditions are set to return. Temperatures could take a plunge in the next few days with forecasters predicting a return to conditions more in keeping with average October weather. University rowers take a breather during an early morning practice session on the River Cam. The scene is a sharp contrast to the weather predicted over the next few days. A cyclist is pictured riding along the banks of the River Cam in Cambridgeshire this morning. Temperatures topped 20C in some parts of Britain today. The sun shines through the trees along the banks of the River Cam as two women enjoy a morning row. Wet weather is set to sweep in from tonight. Darron Burness, head of the AA's flood rescue team, said: 'It's a case of \\"change of month, change of weather\\". 'After precious little rain in September, autumn will fall sharply into focus tomorrow as it turns wet and windy across many areas. 'While river catchments may well be able to take this volume of water after the very dry September, a lot may fall within 12 to 24 hours, so flash flooding is likely to be the main issue for drivers in the affected areas. Dark clouds gather from the coast off Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire this afternoon with Scotland's Indian summer looking over for the time being after severe winds and rain battered much of the north last night and into this morning. Scotland and northern England is expected to see winds gusting up to 70mph as the fine spell of weather finally comes to an end. 'Be wary of places where water may accumulate; for instance, dips in the road and under bridges. 'In dark, wet conditions, it can be extremely difficult to distinguish between a road that's flooded and one that is simply very wet until it's too late. 'Tomorrow evening's rush hour could be particularly affected, so allow a bit more time if you're heading away for the weekend, and check your car's lights and wiper blades.'","completion":"Recently, Britain had very dry and warm weather, but this weekend, some places will get lots of rain and strong winds.

Article: Imagine a house that keeps itself warm in the wintertime. Think of the savings in terms of fuel bills and unfriendly emissions. Such houses in fact exist, called \\"passive houses\\". The concept of these highly energy-efficient buildings took root in the 1990s, before slowly consolidating as a niche construction concept in the 2000s. Are passive houses now actively moving into the mainstream as sustainable buildings? For Brian McGarry, an economics lecturer who built a family house based on passive housing criteria in the Pyrenees this year, the arguments look convincing. As his first full winter in the low energy house draws in, we asked him to keep us informed. Do passive houses work? I had never heard of a passive house in February 2012, when I purchased a plot of land. Nor did I expect that I would be persuaded to build a pre-constructed, custom-designed house based on energy-efficient passive house criteria. It promised to be easier and quicker to build, cheaper to run, and more comfortable to live in. The objective was to incorporate the fundamental concepts of passive energy management into my project: an airtight and highly insulated building envelope; large southfacing double or triple-glazed windows (if possible, filled with argon gas) that passively capture the energy of the sun; a heat recovery ventilation system to provide fresh air; and a simple, low-cost heating system consisting of a modern wood-burning stove, a bathroom heater and a portable radiator backup for when the sun doesn't shine and temperatures decline. No significant limitations were placed on the design, and it had excellent environmental credentials. Moreover, the cost was no more than a conventional build. After six months in use, the house is proving to be both cheap to run and remarkably comfortable-staying cool in the hot summer was effortless, as long as the windows were shuttered or shaded from the sun. Nowstaying warm in the cold, high-altitude December climate also seems easy, so far. Winter arrived in force in the...

Along with the rest of Trafford, Stretford maintains a selective education system assessed by the 11-plus examination. The proportion of pupils leaving Stretford Grammar School with five or more GCSEs at grades A*–C in 2006, was 98.3%, compared to an average of 66.7% for all secondary schools in Trafford and a national UK average of 61.3%. The proportion of students from minority ethnic backgrounds, and for whom English is an additional language, is much higher than the average.

Article: Traditional businessmen feel worried that growing ecommerce will reduce their share of the market. According to a survey, 90% of some people's purchases are made on the computer. As they find that by being able to go online and choose the things that they need to choose, and have them delivered right to their doorsteps, they could no longer be bothered with driving, the crowds, the noise of that, and they usually get a better selection. Cornell University Marketing Professor, MeLaughlin says traditional stores can keep their customers by offering goods like clothing, which customers may want to see and try on before purchasing, as well as items that are difficult to ship. He says some traditional stores are also pleasing customers with services that set up or repair computers and electronics. Traditional stores also offer a social experience that some shoppers enjoy. There is still a lot of emotion in the buying decision that takes place. Oftentimes, you need that last sense of \\"this is exactly what I want\\" before you part with money.

Cady was tried for the violent rape and battery of a young woman. Bowden, appalled by Cady's crime, buried evidence that might have lightened Cady's sentence or even secured his acquittal.

Cady hints he has learned about Bowden burying the report.

Cady lurks near their property. Bowden attempts to have Cady arrested, but police lieutenant Elgart (Robert Mitchum), says there is no evidence of a crime. At a bar, Cady meets Lori Davis (Illeana Douglas), a colleague of Bowden with whom she might be having a love affair. At her house, Cady cuffs her hands behind her back, breaks her arm and rapes her.

In this case, both sentences convey the same information that L'Estany is a municipality located in the province of Barcelona and the autonomous community of Catalonia in Spain.

This article: Giovanni Battista Barbirolli was born in Southampton Row, Holborn, London, the second child and eldest son of an Italian father and a French mother. He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square. The young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as \\"that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.\\" The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as \\"a pernicious influence\\". Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel's String Quartet in the privacy of a men's lavatory in the Academy.From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London. He recalled, \\"My first... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose father settled in London with his wife?, what is it ?

He uses the candle to fly to where the star landed, which is not in England but in a magical land called Stormhold. Tristan soon discovers that the star is not what he expected. The star is actually a beautiful, immortal and spirited woman named Yvaine (Claire Danes). Despite this, Tristan is determined to marry Victoria. Tristan uses a silver chain that his father obtained while trying to free the princess to take Yvaine to England, promising to use the last of the magic candle to take her back to the sky afterwards.However, Tristan is not the only one seeking the star. Yvaine is in terrible danger because the surviving sons of the King (Peter O'Toole) are looking for her because only the jewel that she wears can secure the throne for one of them.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Process: - An owl leaves his nest - The owl flys out into the night - The owl looks down at the ground - The owls keen eyesight allows him to see in the dark - The owls sensitive hearing allows him to locate hidden prey - The owl swoops down - The owl catches a mouse in his talons. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more fuel used happens, how will it affect there will be more food for the owls. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned involves more fuel used. I assume you are referring to an increase in the use of fossil fuels, as they are the most common source of energy globally. The direct effect of increased fuel consumption is the release of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, which contribute to climate change. We can now analyze if and how this perturbation affects the process described, which involves an owl hunting and catching a mouse. Increased fuel usage and the subsequent effects of climate change can lead to changes in weather patterns, temperatures, and habitats. These changes can, in turn, affect the ecosystems and the food chain. In the case of our process, the owls and mice are both part of their shared ecosystem and can be influenced by these changes. Potential direct effects of increased fuel usage on the process are: 1. Changes in the geographical distribution of owls and mice: If climate change leads to unsuitable conditions for owls and mice in certain areas, they may be forced to migrate to new habitats. This could make it harder for owls to find adequate food sources if the mice population decreases in specific regions. 2. Decreased prey availability: Climate change can lead to a decline in the populations of some species, disrupting the food chain. For example, if the vegetation that mice feed on is affected, this may result in fewer mice for owls to prey on. Potential indirect effects of increased fuel usage on the process are: 1. Disruptions in mice breeding patterns: Changes in temperature or weather patterns can affect the breeding cycles of rodents such as mice. Smaller populations of mice can mean less food for owls. 2. Adverse effects on owl hunting skills: If climate change leads to less predictable weather patterns or more extreme conditions, this could potentially affect the owl's ability to hunt effectively. For instance, more intense storms or changing visibility could make it difficult for owls to locate and catch their prey. In conclusion, while the perturbation hypothesis concerning increased fuel usage does not directly impact the owl's hunting process, it can lead to indirect effects on the food chain and the ecosystem. This could potentially result in decreased food supply for the owls, making it more challenging for them to sustain and continue their hunting process."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},q={class:"card-container"},H={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],R={key:0},D={key:1};function N(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",q,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",H,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
