Are \\"book\\" and \\"it\\" the same?","completion":"To determine if \\"book\\" and \\"it\\" are the same in the given context, let's analyze the sentence step-by-step: 1. First, let's identify the subjects and objects in the sentence. The main subject is \\"I\\" (the person narrating the scene). The objects are the \\"chappie\\" (the person being described), the \\"book\\" (the source of the chappie's story), and \\"it\\" (referring to the hidden body). 2. Next, let's understand the context. The narrator is comparing their feeling to that of the chappie from a book. The chappie murdered someone, hid the body, and had to act normally during a dinner party with the body hidden nearby. 3. Now let's look at the usage of \\"book\\" and \\"it\\" in the sentence. The \\"book\\" refers to the source of the story about the chappie and his actions, while \\"it\\" refers to the hidden body in the chappie's story. In conclusion, based on the context and analysis, \\"book\\" and \\"it\\" are not the same. \\"Book\\" refers to the source of the story (the book the narrator read), and \\"it\\" refers to the hidden body (the object that causes the tension in the chappie's story and the narrator's feelings)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which gardener observed more improved mineral nutrient absorption from the soil? Two gardeners started their planting season at the same time. Bill used mycorrizal fungi compost for the garden, while Hank used regular top soil. Bill was very happy with the harvest. Hint: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. A:","completion":"Bill, the gardener who used mycorrhizal fungi compost, observed more improved mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. This is because the mycorrhizal fungi form a symbiotic relationship with the plant roots, increasing the surface area of the root system and subsequently improving water and mineral nutrient absorption."},{"prompt":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: You might not want a holiday in your hometown, but there is probably someone who does. And, in exchange, you could have a cheap vacation anywhere in the world. Just picture the scene: you're watching the sunset from the balcony of a Caribbean island house. It's large. And it's free as long as you don't mind the owners living in your home at the same time. All you need to be a home-swapper is the Internet and a rough idea of when and where you want to go on holiday. When you find someone whose dates match yours, and who wants to visit your area, you're all set to swap. The advantages are numerous: you can save a fortune in accommodation cost. You could get to use the owners' car, boat, bikes, pool or gym. You might even be able to come to an arrangement about looking after each other's pets! You also get to live like a local, and you might be invited around to neighbors' homes for tea, barbecues and tips on the area. People say that these cultural experiences are the memories that last. Plus, instead of one tiny hotel room, you have an entire house where you can make yourself at home. And it's not cold and impersonal like a hotel room. Of course, there are disadvantages. A lot of effort and communication are needed before the arrangements are finalized. Nobody wants a stranger living in their house, sleeping in their bed and using their bathroom, so you have to get to know each other well beforehand. Some people are concerned about theft or property damage, but in reality this is very rare. Most home-exchangers have the view that \\"If they can trust me with their house, I can trust them with mine.\\" The worse complaint people have is the difference in standards of cleanness. If you're interested in home-exchange for your next holiday, start by contacting a famous agency like homelink.org and intervac,co.uk. These agencies will also have advice about preparing for a home-exchange. Question: If you want to exchange your home with another, you should do all of the following EXCEPT _ .

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a short passage that conveys stereotype or anti-stereotype about a specific target. A stereotype is an over-generalized belief about a particular group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against a common stereotype. You are expected to classify the passage into four types of stereotype or anti-stereotype: gender, profession, race, and religion. Problem:Passage: The engineer designed the bridge. The man was very well educated in math. Solution:","completion":"Step 1: Read the passage carefully and identify any potential stereotype or anti-stereotype. Passage: The engineer designed the bridge. The man was very well educated in math. Step 2: Analyze the passage to identify any stereotype or anti-stereotype related to gender, profession, race, or religion. In the passage, there are the following representations: - The person mentioned is an engineer, and they designed a bridge. - The person is referred to as a man. - The man is very well-educated in math. Step 3: Determine if the passage represents a stereotype or anti-stereotype. The passage does not present any stereotypes or anti-stereotypes related to race or religion since there is no mention of any specific race or religion. The mention of engineering as a profession might be seen as a stereotype about the profession - that engineers are well-educated in math. However, this is a fact-based representation and not an over-generalized belief, thus it does not classify as a stereotype. The reference to the engineer as a man can be considered as a slight gender stereotype since it assumes that engineers are typically male. However, the passage does not overly emphasize this aspect or present any negative beliefs, so it is a mild, implicit stereotype. Step 4: Classify the passage based on the identified stereotype or anti-stereotype. Since the passage contains a mild, implicit gender stereotype, the classification would be: Solution: Gender stereotype."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

The answer to the question: What had its power decline after a major military defeat in 1565? is inside the article: The Vijayanagara Empire (also called Karnata Empire, and the Kingdom of Bisnegar by the Portuguese) was based in the Deccan Plateau region in South India. It was established in 1336 by Harihara I and his brother Bukka Raya I of Sangama Dynasty. The empire rose to prominence as a culmination of attempts by the southern powers to ward off Islamic invasions by the end of the 13th century. It lasted until 1646, although its power declined after a major military defeat in the Battle of Talikota in 1565 by the combined armies of the Deccan sultanates. The empire is named after its capital city of Vijayanagara, whose ruins surround present day Hampi, now a World Heritage Site in Karnataka, India. The writings of medieval European travelers such as Domingo Paes, Fernão Nunes, and Niccolò Da Conti, and the literature in local languages provide crucial information about its history. Archaeological excavations at Vijayanagara have revealed the empire's power and wealth. The empire's legacy includes many monuments spread over South India, the best known of which is the group at Hampi. Different temple building traditions in South and Central India came together in the Vijayanagara Architecture style. This synthesis inspired architectural innovation in Hindu temples' construction. Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies such as water management systems for irrigation. The empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, and Sanskrit, while Carnatic music evolved into its current form. The Vijayanagara Empire created an epoch in South Indian history that transcended regionalism by promoting Hinduism as a unifying factor., can you guess it ?

As the credits continue, voices and clanking sounds are heard. One says \\"Camera - rolling!\\" and another follows with \\"Group 36 Training Film.\\" After some more fumbling sounds, the training film begins. A crude map of Berlin in 1987 appears, filmed by an unsteady camera. A narrator, one of the previously heard voices, explains that Allied occupation forces rule the city, and almost every squat has been evacuated. Only one block remains: Machnow Street, zip code SO36, in the American sector. The film then gives way to footage of a crowd of jeering people in a run-down neighborhood. They begin to throw objects at a line of police holding riot shields. For a moment, the camera freezes, and the film's title, \\"Was Tun, Wenn's Brennt?\\" (What to Do in Case of Fire?) appears on the screen. Then the rioters rush the line of policemen, jumping on cars, screaming, and generally causing mayhem. The camera focuses on some of the rioters, whose names appear onscreen, introducing Tim (Til Schweiger) and Flo (Doris Schretzmayer). A water cannon, a huge, tank-like vehicle equipped with a high-pressure water hose, begins to rumble down the street. Its spray knocks down several rioters, and they begin to flee. Rioters with signs continue to mock the policemen. Two more new characters appear in the same way as the others, Maik (Sebastian Blomberg) and Nele (Nadja Uhl). Another, Terror (Matthias Matschke) urinates on the policemen from an upper-story window. Yet another, Hotte (Martin Feifel), leads a mob down a street, waving a flag bearing the symbol for anarchy. All the while, the rioters are heard shouting in the streets. The narrator begins to speak again, informing viewers that Machnow street residents live in terrible conditions.

Background: Electric Ladyland is the third and final studio album by English-American rock band the Jimi Hendrix Experience, released in October 1968 by Track Records/Polydor, and Reprise Records in North America. The double album was the only record from the band produced by Jimi Hendrix. By mid-November, it had charted at number one in the United States, where it spent two weeks at the top spot. Electric Ladyland was the Experience's most commercially successful release and their only number one album. Context: According to music journalist David Stubbs, Electric Ladyland is \\"undoubtedly a rock album, albeit rock on the point of evolving into something else.\\" Uncut magazine's John Robinson said that its music reconciles the psychedelic pop of Hendrix's earlier recordings with the aggressive funk he would explore on his 1970 album Band of Gypsys. During its recording, Kramer experimented with innovative studio techniques such as backmasking, chorus effect, echo, and flanging, which AllMusic's Cub Koda said recontextualized Hendrix's psychedelic and funk sounds on the album. Electric Ladyland is a cross-section of Hendrix's wide range of musical talent. It includes examples of several genres and styles of music: the psychedelic \\"Burning of the Midnight Lamp\\", a UK single the previous summer (1967), the extended blues jam \\"Voodoo Chile\\", the New Orleans-style R&B of Earl King's \\"Come On\\", the epic studio production of \\"1983... (A Merman I Should Turn to Be)\\", the social commentary of \\"House Burning Down\\", and the Sixties-era Britpop of Noel Redding's \\"Little Miss Strange\\". The album also features an electric reworking of the Bob Dylan classic \\"All Along the Watchtower\\", which has been well received by critics as well as by Dylan himself, and also \\"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\\", a staple of both radio and guitar repertoire. Rolling Stone's Holly George-Warren praised \\"Crosstown Traffic\\" for its hard rock guitar riff. \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" became the band's highest-selling single and their only US top 40 hit, peaking at number 20; it reached number five in the UK. The album also included one of Hendrix's most prominent uses of a wah-wah pedal, on \\"Burning of the Midnight Lamp\\", which reached number 18 in the UK charts. Question: what music did electric ladyland do? Answer:","completion":"Electric Ladyland featured a diverse range of music styles and genres, including psychedelic rock, funk, blues, R&B, Britpop, and hard rock.

Entailment in a linguistic context implies that the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of another. While both sentences you provided share a similarity in that they suggest a juror's place was taken by another with a certain belief about the police's arrest practices, the scope and specifics of the stated beliefs differ hence they cannot be seen as fully entailing one another. The first sentence suggests the incoming juror is of the belief that police arrests are made \\"completely at random.\\" This indicates that the juror thinks the police conduct arrests without any discernible pattern or rationale, just arresting people at whim or chance, which is potentially judgment of arbitrariness of police action yet it does not specify if this arbitrariness is linked to illegality or not. In contrast, the second sentence suggests that the replacing juror believes the police arrests people \\"randomly and with disregard for the law.\\" This statement seems to take the belief one step further by implying not only randomness, but also illegality or misconduct in police behavior. While both beliefs question the validity or fairness of police arrests, they are not necessarily congruent. The concept of 'randomness' in the first could be referring to absence of typical factors considered in an arrest, such as evidence or motive. However, the same 'randomness' in second sentence is associated with a 'disregard for the law', which faces toward an allegation of unlawful conduct. All of this is to say that while the two sentences share a noticeable level of similarity, the second sentence introduces new, more specific information that is not guaranteed or entailed by the first.

The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a 1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

While both sentences attempt to convey information about when the second and third Cheetahs were built, the first sentence is confusing and poorly structured, making it difficult to discern the intended meaning. As a result, the answer is A. no, the sentences do not have the same meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What element of Revolver did Klaus Voorman design?, using the article: Almost as soon as they returned home, the Beatles faced a fierce backlash from US religious and social conservatives (as well as the Ku Klux Klan) over a comment Lennon had made in a March interview with British reporter Maureen Cleave. \\"Christianity will go,\\" Lennon had said. \\"It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I will be proved right. ... Jesus was alright but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me.\\" The comment went virtually unnoticed in England, but when US teenage fan magazine Datebook printed it five months later – on the eve of the group's August US tour – it sparked a controversy with Christians in the American \\"Bible Belt\\". The Vatican issued a protest, and bans on Beatles' records were imposed by Spanish and Dutch stations and South Africa's national broadcasting service. Epstein accused Datebook of having taken Lennon's words out of context; at a press conference Lennon pointed out, \\"If I'd said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it.\\" Lennon claimed that he was referring to how other people viewed their success, but at the prompting of reporters, he concluded: \\"If you want me to apologise, if that will make you happy, then okay, I'm sorry.\\"As preparations were made for the US tour, the Beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard. Having originally used Vox AC30 amplifiers, they later acquired more powerful 100-watt amplifiers, specially designed by Vox for them as they moved into larger venues in 1964, but these were still inadequate. Struggling to compete with the volume of sound generated by screaming fans, the band had grown increasingly bored with the routine of performing live. Recognising that their shows were no longer about the music, they decided to make the August tour their last. Rubber Soul had marked a major step forward; Revolver, released in August 1966 a week before the Beatles' final tour, marked another.

People planned to build a new clock which would be the biggest and best in the world. So the clock had to be big and keep very good time. The big clock was made in two years. Five more years later the tower was finished. Then people put the big clock in the tower, and made it ring out for the first time on July 11, 1859. In order to give the bigclock a good name, people held a meeting. Someone wanted to call it the Queen of Bells, and someone thought Victoria was good. At last, a man named Benjamin Hall stood up. He was a big man. Before he started to speak, someone shouted, \\"Why not call it Big Ben? \\"Everybody laughed and agreed with him. From then on, Big Ben became its name.

Child labour According to Thomas DeGregori, an economics professor at the University of Houston, in an article published by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank operating in Washington D.C., \\"it is clear that technological and economic change are vital ingredients in getting children out of the workplace and into schools. Then they can grow to become productive adults and live longer, healthier lives. However, in poor countries like Bangladesh, working children are essential for survival in many families, as they were in our own heritage until the late 19th century.

Eric Butterworth, once a wildly popular preacher of self-improvement, died last month, his New York Times obituary quoted a 1987 Forbes story in summarizing his message: “That we alone have the power within us to solve our problems, relieve our anxieties and pain, heal our illnesses, improve our golf game or get a promotion.” It was a thought that resonated then–and now more than ever. The 1987 story noted the huge size of the self-help market. But it turns out that that market had hardly been tapped. Butterworth’s successors have moved into publishing’s big leagues: Our new list of the top ten self-help stars includes authors whose books often outsell even blockbuster novelists. While Butterworth himself may have been forgotten, his self-helping descendants like Suze Orman and Dr. Phil McGraw are everywhere, blanketing bookstores and the airwaves. Covering everything from personal finance to spiritual renewal–often all at the same time–they fill a deep-seated need. “When a society is rich and triumphant, its people start to ask not just what can be had from life but how can I live a life that’s worth living,” says Martin Seligman, former president of the American Psychological Association, whose own self-help book, Authentic Happiness (Free Press, 2002), was a bestseller. Guiding people toward that goal can be quite rewarding–and not just in the spiritual sense. One mega-seller, Stephen Covey’s The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, is so massively popular that it gave rise to a publicly traded corporation. Last year, FranklinCovey , which is in the business of providing “integrated training and performance-enhancement solutions to organizations and individuals,” recorded sales of 333 million. Self-help books have been around since before the Civil War. What is new is the scale and the variety of media employed by these authors. In 2001, 3,500 new self-help titles, amounting to 2.6% of all new titles, were published in the U.S., according to Simba Information, a market research firm that focuses on the publishing industry. In terms of sales, self-help was even more pervasive, amounting to 5.7% of all consumer book sales, Simba says. (Our Self-Help Stars list ranks authors according to the sales of their two most popular titles since the start of 2002; sales figures were provided by Nielsen BookScan.) But book sales are just for starters. A successful self-help author really cleans up giving speeches. Then there are other income streams, which include training programs (Kenneth Blanchard), wellness therapies (Dr. Andrew Weil), mission formulators (Covey), calendars (Richard Carlson) and yoga lessons (Deepak Chopra), along with a variety of others. Orman and McGraw have their own television shows. McGraw and Covey have such huge followings that even their kids’ books have become bestsellers. Sean Covey wrote his own book, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens, not to mention the associated workbook. Just as effective are the McGraws. Dr. Phil’s son Jay McGraw followed his dad’s Life Strategies and The Life Strategies Workbook with his Life Strategies for Teens. While the bestsellers certainly help those who write them, one problem is the lack of proof that they help others, Seligman says. For example, self-help perennial Anthony Robbins’ techniques are probably good, but no one ever tests them, according to Seligman. But Americans aren’t waiting for the test results. Buyers of books, speeches, tapes and seminars are lining up. Mainstream Metaphysics 06.01.87 The baby-boom generation is big on spirituality and self-awareness.

Back Story Weil wrote The Marriage of the Sun and Moon in 1980. But the new age medic came of age around 1984 when he gained notice for teaching yuppies how to walk on hot coals at his home in Tucson, Ariz.–the same way author Anthony Robbins got his start. Weil calls himself a proponent of “integrative medicine,” which “seeks to restore the focus of medicine on health and healing rather than disease and treatment.” Weil was once a writer for the druggy High Times, and his latest, The Healthy Kitchen: Recipes for a Better Body, Life, and Spirit, has sold 333,000 copies since 2002.

Robbins says he has “directly impacted the lives of nearly 50 million people from 80 countries.” Claimed customers include Nelson Mandela, Mikhail Gorbachev, Margaret Thatcher, François Mitterrand, Princess Diana and Mother Theresa. His Web site also notes that he was born on Feb. 29, 1960, a day that exists only in leap years, so Robbins, 43, has celebrated just ten birthdays. Maybe Men in Black had a point.

Article: I used to think of myself as a person learned in books, but my bookshelves told a different story. Apart from a few Indian novels and an Australian book, my literature collection only consisted of British and American titles. Worse still, I couldn't ever found anything in translation. My reading was limited to stories by English-speaking authors. So, at the start of 2012, I set myself the challenge of trying to read a book from every country in a year to find out what I was missing. With no idea where to get those books, I was unlikely to find publications from nearly 200 nations on the shelves of my local bookshop, so I decided to ask the readers all over the world for help. I created a blog called A Year of Reading the World and put out an appeal for suggestions of titles that I could read in English. The response was amazing. People all over the world were getting in touch with me, offering ideas and book lists. Some posted me books from their home countries. In addition, several writers, like Turkmenistan's Ak Welsapar and Panama's Juan David Morgan, sent me unpublished translations of their novels, giving me a rare opportunity to read works unavailable in Britain. Even with such an extraordinary team of bibliophiles behind me, however, sourcing books was no easy task. With translations making up only around 4.5 per cent of literary works published in the UK, getting English versions of stories was tricky. One by one, the books from the countries on the list filled my heart with laughter, love, anger, hope and fear. Lands that had once seemed exotic and remote became close and familiar to me. At its best, I learned, reading makes the world real. Question: Which of the following is NOT the help from people around the world? Options: A: Offering book names.

Do you know how it came about? The tea bag was invented in 1908 by Thomas Sullivan, an American tea seller. He was sending out free tea in silk bags for people to try. People put the bags together with the tea leaves into the cup and added hot water. The tea tasted good, and people thought it was easy to clean the cup. They were not happy when Sullivan started sending them loose tea again. Sullivan realized that he had a hot new thing in his hands, and he built a machine to pack the bags. As tea bags became popular, they were changed from silk to gauze and later paper. In 1952, Lipton Tea made the tea bag even more popular with its invention of the four-sided tea bag. Tea bags were soon a hit in the UK, and today 85%of the tea in the UK is packed in paper bags. However, many people still prefer loose-leaf tea. This is because some tea companies put not very good tea in their tea bags. But for most drinkers, tea bags are still the easy and tasly way to go. Question: Who invented the tea bag?

Here is a news article: MIAMI — The American government employees in Cuba who suffered mystifying symptoms — dizziness, insomnia, difficulty concentrating — after hearing a strange high-pitched sound all had one thing in common: damage to the part of the inner ear responsible for balance, according to the first doctors to examine them after the episodes. Two years after Americans posted at the United States Embassy in Havana began experiencing the peculiar phenomenon, doctors at the University of Miami on Wednesday published a scientific paper that confirms what these patients have said all along: Their condition is real, not the result of mass hysteria, a response to intense news media coverage or a stress reaction to being evacuated, as doctors in Cuba had suggested. “These people were injured,” said Dr. Michael E. Hoffer, the director of the university’s Vestibular and Balance Program and lead author of the study. “We’re not sure how. The injury resulted in ear damage and some trouble thinking.” To some of the 26 people affected, the episode felt like something out of “Star Trek”: A few minutes of a high-pitched noise, often accompanied by a high-pressure sensation, described as a “force field,” felt in their homes and hotel rooms in Cuba over several months starting in late 2016, changed their lives and, in some cases, ended careers. ||||| Dr. Michael Hoffer, of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, speaks during a news conference, Wednesday, Dec. 12, 2018, in Miami.

(Associated Press) Dr. Michael Hoffer, of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, speaks during a news conference, Wednesday, Dec. 12, 2018, in Miami. Hoffer and a group of doctors presented their findings in the case of U.S. diplomats who experienced mysterious health incidents while working at the U.S. Embassy... (Associated Press) MIAMI (AP) — American diplomats affected by mysterious health incidents in Cuba showed damage in the inner ear shortly after they complained of weird noises and sensations, according to their earliest medical exams, publicized Wednesday. The detailed findings were published in a medical journal nearly two years after what the U.S. calls \\"health attacks\\" began — and they shed no new light on a possible culprit. \\"What caused it, who did it, why it was done — we don't know any of those things,\\" said Dr. Michael Hoffer of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, who led the exams. The U.S. says since late 2016, 26 people associated with the embassy in Havana suffered problems that include dizziness, ear pain and ringing, and cognitive problems such as difficulty thinking — a health mystery that has damaged U.S.-Cuba relations. The Miami researchers examined 25 of those people, who reported hearing a piercing noise or experiencing a sensation of pressure before their symptoms began. The patients failed a variety of tests that detect inner-ear problems associated with balance, what's called the vestibular system. Testing of 10 people who were in the same building at the time of the incidents found they were fine, Hoffer reported in the journal Laryngoscope Investigative Otolaryngology. Hoffer also traveled to Cuba to check 100 other Americans stationed there, who also turned out to be healthy. Those inner-ear balance problems have been central to the government's ongoing health investigation. And earlier this year, a team of doctors at the University of Pennsylvania who also examined many of these patients, but months later, reported they suffered concussion-like brain damage, despite no blow to the head. For doctors, Wednesday's paper adds specifics about the pattern of damage, abnormalities in structures involved with sensing gravity and acceleration, said Dr. Maura Cosetti of the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai. She isn't involved with any research related to the Cuba incidents. \\"This provides an important step in creating a picture of the injury that people sustained,\\" she said. She added that often people with long-term balance problems also report a \\"brain fog.\\" Cuba has adamantly denied any involvement, and even questions whether there were attacks. \\"There's no evidence that can prove that something occurred in Cuba that could have damaged the health situation of a few U.S. diplomats,\\" Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, Cuba's director-general of U.S. affairs, said Wednesday. The U.S. has not said what caused the incidents, although initial speculation centered on some type of sonic attack. The Associated Press has reported that an interim FBI report last January found no evidence that sound waves could have caused the damage. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education. The AP is solely responsible for all content. ||||| The Miami doctors who first treated U.S. diplomats in Havana affected by a mysterious ailment after exposure to an unknown energy source have found a “triad” of neurological, cognitive and emotional symptoms unlike the concussions previously reported by another group of physicians. “Our findings are dramatically different from what concussions look like,” Dr. Michael Hoffer, the lead author of a new study made public Wednesday, said in an exclusive video interview with the Miami Herald and el Nuevo Herald. The study by physicians at the University of Miami and the University of Pittsburgh was published in Laryngoscope Investigative Otolaryngology journal. Hoffer, a professor of Otolaryngology and Neurological Surgery at UM’s Miller School of Medicine, said the initial symptoms reported by 25 diplomats and family members point to an “acquired neurosensory dysfunction.” Another team of doctors at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) who examined the chronic symptoms of 21 of the patients concluded they suffered from mild traumatic brain injury, known as a concussion, even though none had suffered a blow to the head. Their report was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in February. “Concussions do look like many different things, but in our experience of thousands of concussion patients this group is different. They have a unique pattern of balance dysfunction and a unique pattern of cognitive dysfunction,” Hoffer said. 20 for 365 Days of Unlimited Digital Access Last chance to take advantage of our best offer of the year! Act now! Michael E. Hoffer, M.D., at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine in Allapattah on Friday, Nov. 7, 2018. Hoffer is part of the team that released a study into the acute symptoms and clinical findings of U.S. diplomatic personnel living in Havana, Cuba, who experienced neurosensory symptoms after exposure to a unique sound/pressure phenomenon. MATIAS J. OCNER mocner@miamiherald.com The UM-Pitt team reviewed the initial exams of 25 diplomats and relatives examined in Miami within four days to two months after they were exposed to strong sounds or felt pressure-like sensations against their bodies while they were in Havana. Another 10 showed no symptoms but were evaluated because they were present when the incidents occurred or were exposed for a few seconds. Most significantly, all 25 of the affected individuals showed abnormalities in the otolithic organs, which are part of the vestibular system of the inner ear that detect gravity and allow the body to adjust its position in space. Those abnormalities were not reported in the JAMA study. In never before reported details, the study indicates that some of the victims heard the noise over several nights and that others, trying to figure out its source, inadvertently increased their exposure because “the noise followed them.” The specific conclusions of the UPenn team “were not consistent with ours,” said Hillary Snapp, chief of Audiology and Associate Professor of Otolaryngology at the Miller School of Medicine. “They didn’t execute the same tests that we did, which is why we were able to find the otholitic abnormalities they did not report.” Hoffer pointed out that the new study is based on the first examinations of the affected diplomats and relatives soon after they experienced the strange symptoms. The study was carried out at UM from March through June 2017, when the symptoms were acute, which Hoffner believes generated the most precise characterization of the lesions. The JAMA report is based on examinations of 21 diplomats and relatives carried out by UPenn personnel an average of six months after the incidents. “We are describing the individuals near to the time of their injury, without the influence of time, that can really change the way symptoms looked, without the influence of a variety of treatments, without workers’ comp concerns and without the media coverage about what people should complain for,” Hoffer said. “This is the only report on acute symptoms,” he added. “The Penn patients, they don’t count as unbiased observers. There is no comparison. It’s apple and oranges.” The UM-Pitt study identified the persons examined only as “diplomats” leaving open the possibility that not all of them were from the United States. Hoffer examined 35 patients in Miami and 105 others at the U.S. embassy in Havana in the spring of 2017 — including Marines who guard the mission. None of the 105 examined in Cuba reported strange sounds or sensations. They were evaluated with the same protocols followed in Miami but showed no symptoms other than headaches. The U.S. government has branded the incidents as “health attacks” and said they occurred in diplomatic homes and two Havana hotels, affecting at least 26 diplomats and intelligence agents from the end of 2016 until May of this year. Canada has reported 13 other cases at its Havana embassy, including four children. The U.S. and Cuban governments say they don’t know what happened or who was responsible. But Washington has complained that Havana failed to protect its diplomats. Cuba has denied any responsibility for the incidents, launched its own investigations and has requested more access to the medical data of the people affected. A State Department spokeswoman said in an email that “the investigation into the origin and source of the attacks continues. We do not have any additional information to share at this time.” On Wednesday, Havana again denied any assertion that it was involved in any alleged attacks. “In Cuba, no one is attacked or allowed to attack a diplomat of any country,” Carlos Fernández de Cossío, General Director for U.S. Affairs at the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in a speech. “The weapons capable of producing the effects that several U.S. officials and experts say they are finding do not exist anywhere in the world.” De Cossío said it was irresponsible to “accuse Cuba” without Cuban investigators having access to the medical information of those affected. He also questioned whether the injuries suffered by the diplomats had originated on the island. “It is not that we doubt that U.S. diplomats may have suffered ailments that were detected during their stay in Cuba, which we would regret, but this does not ensure that the origin of the disease is linked to their stay in Cuba,” he said. At a press conference in Miami Wednesday, Hoffer responded to De Cossío’s statements. “I cannot be sure, all I can say is that it happened, the noise and the pressure, and then the symptoms,” Dr. Hoffer said, adding that those affected did not know what to complain about before being evaluated. It remains unclear why the UM-Pitt report, based on the first examinations of the affected patients, was published months after the UPenn study appeared in JAMA. The different interpretations of the symptoms appear to have started early in the investigation. In July 2017, the State Department organized a panel of academics to analyze the preliminary results of diagnostic tests. Charles Rosenfarb, director of the department’s health services bureau, told a Senate hearing in January that the department, following the panel’s recommendation, endorsed the hypothesis that the incidents were similar to concussions and requested further research at UPenn’s Center for Brain Injury and Repair. But sources familiar with the panel’s discussions said it reached no conclusions. The UM-Pitt study was not commissioned by the State Department but went through its security clearance procedures “to make sure we were not releasing any classified information,” said Hoffer. “The process was very long.” According to the State Department spokeswoman, the agency “was not requested to review nor did it receive a preliminary copy of the University of Miami’s recent article regarding ‘health attacks’ for Laryngoscope Investigative Otolaryngology.” But she said the State Department did receive an article last December submitted by Dr. Hoffer and proposed for publication in the New England Journal of Medicine. That article was cleared for publication on Feb. 20, 2018, but did not publish. Hoffer said a copy of the study published Wednesday had been given to the State Department and that it took nine months for it to get clearance. When they were first evaluated in Miami, the 25 patients presented a combination of the following symptoms: dizziness and balance problems, pain and ringing in the ears, loss of hearing, headaches and difficulty concentrating and processing information. Special evaluations on nine patients who complained of cognitive problems confirmed they were having difficulties remembering words or visual images, concentrating or grabbing objects. Some also showed signs of anxiety or depression. Tests with special goggles and other technology showed the patients had problems concentrating and carrying out cognitive tasks as simple as following a moving dot. Other tests to look into the complaints of dizziness showed that when the patients had no visual clues, they could not orient themselves adequately — a finding that eventually led to the diagnosis of abnormalities in the inner ear.

Snapp is part of the team that released a study of the symptoms and clinical findings in U.S. diplomatic personnel living in Havana who experienced neurosensory symptoms after exposure to a unique sound/pressure phenomenon. MATIAS J. OCNER mocner@miamiherald.com “There is a lot of speculation about hysteria and other things, and part of that is related to the fact that these individuals struggled to characterize what they were feeling, using the term ‘not quite right,’” said Snapp, UM’s chief of Audiology and Associate Professor of Otolaryngology. “But it really is a sense of disorientation, that is really very well linked to objective clinical findings” found in the exams. The UM-Pitt team also strongly rejected the theory that the Havana incidents were the result of collective hysteria — suggested by Cuban physicians and scientists who did not take part in the U.S.-led investigations. “I ruled it out for a couple of reasons. First these are very high functional individuals that scored very well on selected tests and scored very poorly in others. There was such a specific pattern, that they wouldn’t know which tests to excel on and which tests to perform poorly,” said Dr Bonnie E. Levin, director of the Neuropsychology division at the Miller School of Medicine. Levin added that they were “well educated (patients) who had a lot of training and experience, and they were performing below expectancy but still within the average to low-average range to many tests. So there was no attempt to distort, they were just performing below expectancy.” From left, Hillary Snapp, Au.D, Ph.D., Michael E. Hoffer, M.D., and Bonnie E.

MATIAS J. OCNER mocner@miamiherald.com Some of those patients also showed emotional symptoms that concur with cognitive problems, indicating they might have a biological cause. “I respect my Cuban colleagues immensely. They are excellent physicians. But in this particular instance, we have objective evidence. You don’t get an objective testing abnormality if it’s hysteria,” said Hoffer. The UM-Pitt report authors also included their theory on what could have caused the symptoms. They wrote that although they don’t know the exact mechanism, directed energy sources, such as microwaves, can cause “cavitation bubbles in body fluids.” The energy released when the bubbles burst can cause “a shock wave and acoustic emissions,” they wrote. “People can hear radar pulses. This was first recorded in the late 1960s and we don’t normally think we can hear that but there was work done, it was funded by the Department of Defense through the late 1980s,” said Dr. Carey D. Balaban, professor of Otolaryngology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, who also contributed to the study. “It shows that radar pulses can result in the production of sound inside the fluid, in the brain and can produce responses in the hearing system,” Balaban added. “So you can’t rule that out.” The report also mentions previous investigations showing that intense ultrasonic radiation can produce a range of symptoms that include nausea, headaches, ringing in the ear, pain, dizziness and fatigue. The majority of the patients in the study reported hearing odd sounds before their symptoms showed up. “Several individuals reported that if they went outside their front door, the noise immediately stopped. Others reported a sensation of pressure passing through their head and abdomen in certain parts of the room that could be relieved by moving a few feet away,” the study noted. Similar descriptions in the UPenn study and news media reports on the Havana incidents have triggered speculation that the symptoms were caused by some sort of directional energy source. But Hoffer and his colleagues urged caution. “It would be imprudent to exclude any potential source of directional or non-directional energy at this time,” the report said. “It is important to be very careful. The key here is to be scientifically vigilant but skeptical,” said Balaban. The UM-Pitt collaboration left many questions unanswered, and much of the information on the case remains classified. The authors could not come out with specific protection measures for U.S. diplomats in case of future incidents. The State Department withdrew most of its staff from Havana, and those still in Cuba are living in a smaller number of residences to minimize the risks. The doctors interviewed by el Nuevo Herald and the Miami Herald declined to answer specific questions about the patients and their possibilities of total recovery. Hoffer and Balaban also declined to comment on the possible existence of “neuro-weapons” — a theory that they and Dr. James Giordano, a professor of neurology and biochemistry at Georgetown University, addressed in an article published in National Defense Magazine. “The evidence suggests that they were targeted,” Hoffer said with a pause, “but we can not prove that.” Follow Nora Gámez Torres on Twitter: @ngameztorres ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The mysterious health incidents affecting American government employees stationed in Cuba, which began late 2016, have been confirmed as real and not the result of mass hysteria, according to findings published by doctors from the University of Miami. The study, led by Dr. Michael E. Hoffer, indicates that the 26 individuals affected all experienced damage to the part of the inner ear responsible for balance, following exposure to a strange high-pitched sound. Their symptoms included dizziness, insomnia, and difficulty concentrating, among others. This conclusion contradicts suggestions from doctors in Cuba that the condition may have been a psychological reaction or a stress response to evacuation. The causes of the injuries remain uncertain, but it’s clear that the injuries have resulted in an impact on the individuals' ear health and cognitive functionality. Consequently, the Miami doctors discovered a pattern of neurological, cognitive, and emotional symptoms, terming the condition as an \\"acquired neurosensory dysfunction.\\" This deviates from an earlier conclusion by doctors from the University of Pennsylvania who attributed the symptoms to mild traumatic brain injury, akin to a concussion, even though none of the patients had suffered a blow to the head. The incidents, described as \\"health attacks\\" by the U.S. administration, have strained U.S.-Cuba relations. The U.S. accuses Cuba of failing to protect its diplomats, a charge Cuba denies, asserting no evidence to prove that such an event occurred. The cause remains unknown, with initial speculation about a sonic attack currently unsupported by an interim report by the FBI. The possible existence of \\"neuro-weapons\\" was suggested, but no conclusions have been made. At present, the State Department has minimized its staff in Havana as a precautionary measure. To summarize, the recent study makes it clear that the incidents led to an actual health condition, although the cause and mechanism of its onset remain unknown. The study insists on remaining systematically skeptical until more evidence comes to light. These findings underline the gravity of the situation and the need for further investigation."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Write an article based on this summary: Give your hamster a nice home. Feed the hamster regularly. Wait a week before trying to touch it. Article:","completion":"Title: The Ultimate Guide to Caring for Your New Hamster Introduction Bringing a new furry friend into your home can be an exciting experience, and choosing a hamster as a pet is a great decision. They are low-maintenance, easy-to-care-for, and can be a source of endless joy. However, to keep your hamster happy and healthy, it is essential to follow some basic guidelines regarding their living space, diet, and how to approach them. In this article, we will discuss how to give your hamster a perfect home, the importance of a proper feeding schedule, and how to build a bond of trust and affection with your new companion. Section 1: Creating a Perfect Home for Your Hamster 1.1 Choosing the right cage: It's crucial to provide a satisfying living space for your hamster. Look for a spacious cage that is easy to clean and maintain. Opt for a solid, non-wire flooring, which will prevent injuries to your pet's feet. Remember that larger cages are better; your hamster needs space for exercise and play. 1.2 Enriching the environment: Add toys like tunnels, climbing structures, a hamster wheel, and gnawing/chewing materials to ensure that your hamster remains active and entertained. Also, incorporating a nesting box or a small tunnel in the cage will give your hamster a private and cozy sleeping area. 1.3 Bedding: A soft, absorbent, and dust-free material, such as paper-based bedding or shredded aspen, is essential for your hamster's comfort and welfare. It is recommended to avoid cedar and pine wood shavings because they can cause respiratory and liver problems in hamsters. 1.4 Temperature and humidity: Keep the cage in a quiet, draft-free area with a temperature range of 65-75°F (18-24°C) and moderate humidity. Be especially cautious during high-temperature periods, as hamsters are sensitive to heat and can suffer from heatstroke. Section 2: Feeding Your Hamster 2.1 Diet: It is recommended that a hamster's diet should be primarily composed of commercially produced hamster pellets, which are formulated to meet necessary nutritional requirements. Supplement the pellets with small portions of fruits and vegetables such as apple, carrot, spinach, or kale. Do not overfeed your hamster and always remove any uneaten fresh food within 24 hours to avoid spoilage. 2.2 Water: Fresh, clean water should be made available at all times. Use a water bottle with a sipper tube, which is safer than a water dish and reduces the chance of contamination from bedding materials. 2.3 Treats: You can occasionally give your hamster treats like unsalted, raw nuts or seeds, dried fruits, and yogurt drops. However, moderation is key – giving excessive treats can lead to obesity and health issues. Section 3: Building Trust and Bonding with Your Hamster 3.1 Handling your hamster: Once your hamster has settled into its new home, it needs some time to acclimate to its surroundings. Resist the temptation to touch your hamster for at least a week after bringing it home. Allow it to become comfortable in its environment before attempting to interact. 3.2 Bonding process: To establish trust, gradually introduce your scent to your hamster by placing a small piece of cloth or tissue with your scent in the cage. Once you feel that your hamster is comfortable with you, you can begin hand-feeding it treats and slowly start the handling process. Remember to be gentle, patient, and calm as sudden movements or loud noises can startle a hamster. Conclusion Taking proper care of your hamster and providing it with a comfortable environment, sufficient nutrition, and gentle interaction will ensure that you have a healthy and happy pet. With time and patience, you will develop a strong bond with your new companion and enjoy years of hamster-filled happiness."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: Failure is a necessary part of the creative and learning experience. Embrace it as such, and commit yourself to learning from your failures and your mistakes. This way, you'll grow to see every failure as an opportunity for improvement and innovation rather than an obstacle or a limit on your success. Sometimes we get ideas that seem to vanish before we’ve committed them to paper. Many thoughts are seemingly random and disconnected. Try drawing a mind map on a piece of paper. Now, because you can see your ideas, you might be able to understand them and their relationships better. List your seemingly random ideas. Pick some of your most intriguing ideas, and write them on various places on a sheet of paper. Place them according to how you think they are connected. Draw lines connecting ideas. Draw spur lines of important ideas and connect them to lesser ideas. Taking a little time to contemplate the world or to reflect on things will help expand your horizons. Spending time alone will also enable you to consider problems you’ve been trying to work through and find new solutions that you might not have thought about before. Having an open mind will enable you to think about problems that you might not have thought about before. You’ll also be able to engage ides and ways of doing things that you were previously hesitant about. Part of this is accepting the position that there are often many ways to solve a problem or achieve a goal. Accept that there are many ways to view the world. Then you can see that there are many ways to be creative and solve problems. Understand that you don’t know everything, and every activity is a learning experience. Consider unpopular or even “weird” ways of viewing things or solving problems. These unconventional ideas or views might just give you a creative spark. Actual creating is the best practice to train your brain for creativity. There are a number of things you can do to train your brain in this way: Drawing. If you enjoy drawing, draw. It does not really matter if you think you're good at it. Writing. If you enjoy writing, write. Actual writing (fiction or non-fiction) is the best way to hone and develop your thoughts and your creative impulse. Build. If you enjoy building things, whether it be abstract art or basic carpentry, you should build. This will stimulate your creative juices, and you might wind up building something really cool! Try to get outside of your comfort zone and the “box” you typically function within. Think about a problem you are trying to solve in different ways. Embrace different perspectives, and maybe try to view the problem as an opportunity. For example: If your goal is to build a fence, think about the purpose of building a fence. Then focus on what you hope to achieve by building a fence. If you’re trying to keep deer from eating your prize flowers, maybe consider other options like spraying your flowers with organic soap to deter the deer. If you’re trying to solve the problem of fuel efficiency in car, perhaps think about it as a transportation problem instead. Instead of just trying to build a more fuel efficiency engine, you can scale down the size of a car or even identify alternate modes of transportation for people. Don’t fear starting all over if you think a line of inquiry or something you’ve been working on has failed you. Just start over and re-conceptualize. Remember, being productive and creative are different. You just need to judge for yourself when you need to be creative and when you need to achieve productivity, or both. Someone can be highly productive while not being creative at all. Creativity entails finding new ways to solve problems and making or creating things that are unique. Productivity entails producing something, but can often be done in a non-creative and workman-like way.","completion":"This article tells us that it's okay to fail because we can learn and grow from our mistakes. We can become better thinkers by trying new things, even if they seem weird or different, and mapping out our ideas on paper. Taking time to think and explore the world can help us come up with more creative ideas. Drawing, writing, building and considering new ways of solving problems will train our brain to be more creative. Sometimes being creative is more important than just getting things done quickly, so we should be open to trying new things and not be afraid to start over if something doesn't work out."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A spire was designed by Barry in 1841 , but it was never built . Available options: [i] no [ii] yes The answer is:","completion":"[i] no The two sentences do not have the same meaning despite sharing some similar elements. Let's break down each sentence to better understand this: \\"A tower was built in 1841 by Barry, but it was never designed.\\" This sentence suggests that a tower was constructed in 1841 by somebody named Barry. The phrase \\"but it was never designed\\" implies that the construction of the tower was not based on any pre-existing architectural design or plan. The tower appears to have been built without a specific blueprint. \\"A spire was designed by Barry in 1841, but it was never built.\\" This sentence states that a spire was designed, or planned out in detail, by Barry in the year 1841. However, the phrase \\"but it was never built\\" suggests that the spire, despite being designed, was never actually constructed.

What is the most logical completion of this news story?. (CNN) -- North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il arrived in Russia on Saturday to meet with President Dmitry Medvedev, authorities said. Kim is scheduled to visit Siberia and the country's eastern region, according to a statement on Medvedev's website. \\"The meeting with Mr. Medvedev is the main event on his program,\\" the statement said. The statement and North Korea's state media did not say what the two leaders will discuss. Earlier this month, North Korea again called for the resumption of the so-called six-party talks without preconditions. North Korea pulled out of six-party talks in 2008. The six-party talks involved China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, North Korea and the United States. The goal was nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula. The United States and","completion":"South Korea have cautiously welcomed the North's desire to resume negotiations, but have emphasized the importance of the North demonstrating a genuine commitment to denuclearization before the talks can be restarted. In a joint statement earlier this week, the countries involved in the six-party framework agreed that progress on North Korea's denuclearization remains a crucial priority for regional peace and stability. During Kim Jong Il's visit to Russia, both Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and the North Korean leader reaffirmed their commitment to peace and stability in the region. According to Kremlin sources, during their meeting, Kim Jong Il expressed willingness to impose a temporary moratorium on nuclear and missile tests and take concrete steps toward denuclearization. In return, North Korea expects substantial economic assistance and a lifting of sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council. In a joint press conference following the meeting, President Medvedev praised North Korea's apparent change of heart and expressed hope that the six-party talks would soon resume. \\"We welcome North Korea's willingness to take a responsible approach to the global security challenges it poses, and we are ready to support the country's reintegration into the international community once it has demonstrated concrete steps toward denuclearization,\\" Medvedev said. In a bid to further strengthen relations between the two countries, an agreement on the construction of a natural gas pipeline and a trans-Korean railway was signed by both leaders. This deal is expected to bring considerable economic benefits to both Russia and North Korea, providing the latter with much-needed infrastructure development and offering Russia access to growing markets in the Korean Peninsula. Japan's Prime Minister, Yoshiko Noda, while expressing cautious optimism, also insisted on additional guarantees from North Korea before restarting negotiations. During a telephone conversation with President Medvedev, Noda emphasized that North Korea must first commit to a substantial reduction in its nuclear arsenal and allow international inspectors to verify its progress. Initially, Beijing remained silent on North Korea's commitment to denuclearization. However, a day after the meeting between Kim Jong Il and Medvedev, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry stated that China appreciates the efforts made by Russia and North Korea in promoting regional stability, and is ready and willing to participate in future discussions to advance the six-party talks. In response to these developments, the White House released a statement expressing cautious optimism, but reiterated its stance that North Korea must take \\"meaningful actions\\" towards denuclearization before the resumption of any multilateral talks. \\"North Korea's commitments to stopping nuclear and missile tests and allowing international inspections will be a critical test of its sincerity. We will continue to work closely with our allies and partners in the region to ensure that our shared goals of peace and security are achieved,\\" the statement read. As the situation continues to unfold, it remains uncertain whether the upcoming talks will lead to a lasting resolution of the longstanding tensions on the Korean Peninsula. However, with Kim Jong Il's visit to Russia marking a surprising diplomatic overture and the possibility of renewed negotiations, hope for a peaceful resolution to the nuclear crisis appears to be on the horizon."},{"prompt":"Mike is a high school student who loves science and as a hobby studies various chemistry, biology and physics experiments.

Both lived, and went on to even stranger misadventures than before.We flashback to scenes from Frankenstein (1931), which lead up to our new story. After the mill collapses, and it seems the Monster has been destroyed, the burgomeister (E.E. Clive) urges everyone to return to their homes. But the father (Reginald Barlow) of the little girl whom the Monster had killed (accidentally) in the first film, wants to see the creature's dead body with his own eyes before he can have peace. His wife (Mary Gordon) tries to stop him; but when the man wanders through the still-burning debris, he falls through a hole that leads to a flooded cavern below the mill. The Monster rises out of the water and kills the poor man, later doing the same for his wife. The Frankensteins' hysterical servant Minnie (Una O'Connor) also meets with the Monster, but manages to escape with her life. But no one believes her when she screeches that the Monster is still on the loose.Henry wants nothing more than to settle into a peaceful life with his new bride (Valerie Hobson).

Article: Left unfettered , Anthony Konieczka, 9 years old, would happily play his Game Boy Advance or PlayStation 2 from the minute he gets up to the moment he goes to bed, 14 bleary-eyed hours later. Anthony's box is stocked with traditional toys--board games, puzzles, art supplies--and as far as he is concerned, they are relics of Christmases past. His sister Michaely, 6 years old, still likes dressing her Barbies. But once she starts playing Game Boy, it's hard to get her away. Play patterns like this could take up another Christmas for the toy department. Through September, toy sales were down 5% compared with the first nine months of last year, according to the NDP Group. Meanwhile, the video-game industry is heading for another record year. Thanks to hot new games like Halo 2 for the Xbox, the industry is light-years ahead of the toy business when it comes out. While some new toys emerge every holiday season, toymakers are heading into this one without a monster hit . Indeed, there has not been a Furby-style frenzy in years. Of 10 toy segments only two, arts and crafts and dolls, have generated sales growth over a recent 12-month period. Some of the weakest categories like construction sets and action figures are the ones aimed at boys, who suffer the most from the video games. Analysts expect one of the top stocking stuffers this season to be not a traditional toy but the new generation of Nintendo's Game Boy, the DS, which hit stores last week. The deeper issue is that shifts in play patterns are forcing toymakers to fight for shelf space in a tightening market. Boys in particular seem to be abandoning traditional toys at earlier ages in favor of consumer electronics, video games, PC software and the Internet. The fact that kids are growing more tech-savvy , a trend called \\"age compression \\", has troubled toy companies for at least a decade.

There is a huge market for DIY furniture which people need to put together themselves with a few basic tools . However, people often find it not easy to build a piece of furniture because they can't understand the instructions. Sometimes the instructions are simple and clear, but the furniture itself is difficult to build. One thing is for sure, though most DIY projects are started with the best intentions (,), many of them may not get finished. DIY can also be dangerous. For example, anything electrical should be done by a professional worker. Unluckily, many people don't care about this warning and put themselves in danger.

One Seattle Seahawks fan is so hugely confident in his team that he got a tattoo boasting about their Super Bowl 2014 victory before the season even began. Tim Connors, of Edmonds, Washington, got the Seahawks logo and 'XLVIII Champs' inked on his arm months ago. He may be foolishly optimistic, he could even be a jinx, but you have to admire his faith. Seattle are now just two games from a first Super Bowl win and face the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship match on Sunday. And Connors will be watching more closely than most. Counting his chickens? One Seattle Seahawks fan was celebrating his team's Super Bowl win - before the season even started. Faith: 'I'm not crazy, I'm not crazy at all. I'm confident,' Tim Connors said. 'I'm not crazy, I'm not crazy at all. I'm confident, I'm 100 percent confident in every single player on that team,' Connors told ABC. The Seahawks take on the 49ers in an exciting match-up on Sunday night, and if they get through that play-off game either New England or Denver await in the Super Bowl on February 2. If Seattle fail, Connors will have to find a way of adapting his tattoo or endure a permanent reminder of a painful defeat. Unfortunately for this superfan that won't be simple to do. Connors can't just tweak the tattoo if the Seahawks win next year as the 2015 game will be Super Bowl 49 - XLIX in Roman numerals. Two games away: Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch, top, scores past New Orleans Saints in the NFC divisional playoff game. Seattle face San Francisco in the NFC Championship on Sunday. And from 2016 and Super Bowl 50, all the Championship games will start with the Roman numeral L. But, for now at least, Connors has no concerns about his tattoo remaining accurate. He told Komo that he has 'no tiny little bit of doubt at all' that the Seahawks will bring the Vince Lombardi trophy home from the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. Connors' tattoo artist was worried at first, but has no come round to his client's optimistic way of thinking. Lonnie Moon of Good Karma Body Art in Edmonds, told Komo: 'I said, \\"Hey man, people are going to attack you â€¦ that you're the jinx of the team.\\"' Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames. Jinx? Connors' tattoo artist, Lonnie Moon, was worried at first, but has no come round to his client's optimistic way of thinking. But he said that Connors ended up convincing him otherwise.

Negative Movie Review: Title: Disappointment Beyond Imagination It is with a heavy heart that I express my utter disappointment for what could have been a cinematic masterpiece. \\"Disappointment Beyond Imagination\\" promised a thrilling ride through a world filled with wonder, mystique, and powerful storytelling. The final product, however, pales in comparison to its own ambition. The movie revolves around the protagonist Sam Watts, played by the charismatic Alex Green, who is on a journey to discover a hidden treasure before it falls into the wrong hands. Regrettably, the plot never reaches the heights of excitement and intrigue it initially sets up. The narrative is riddled with trite clichés and predictable twists – a dime a dozen in this over-saturated genre. Despite boasting a star-studded cast, the performances fail to deliver. Green's portrayal of Sam Watts is lackluster at best. It was clear that the direction provided to him by the director steered clear of nuanced character development, turning him into a caricature of the \\"troubled hero\\" trope. Similarly, co-star Rachel Bell's attempt at portraying the tough-as-nails sidekick falls short. Her potential as an actress is underutilized, and the chemistry between the two leads is nowhere to be seen. Visually, the film struggles to find consistency. The special effects, intended to send the audience on a spectacle-filled adventure, are painfully subpar. It's clear that the budget constraints hindered the execution of ambitious set pieces, resulting in a disjointed visual experience. Poorly lit night scenes only add to the movie's inability to hold the viewer's attention. The film is further weighed down by a convoluted script and lazy dialogue. I struggled to keep track of the multiple storylines as they meandered aimlessly between plot points. One can't help but wonder what could have been if the writers had invested more time perfecting the pacing and refining the story before production commenced. In conclusion, \\"Disappointment Beyond Imagination\\" fails to live up to its promising premise on almost every level. From the underwhelming performances to the uninspired direction, this movie slogs through a minefield of missed opportunities. In a world where countless great films are left undiscovered, it's disheartening to see such potential squandered on a film that barely scrapes by. Unfortunately, the title of this movie inadvertently lends itself as an accurate description of what the audience will experience upon viewing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It has many special properties, such as extending life and expanding consciousness. The most profitable and important of its properties is its ability to assist the Spacing Guild with folding space, which allows safe, instantaneous interstellar travel.

The popularity of Duke Leto Atreides has grown though the empire, and he is suspected to be amassing a secret army equipped with sonic-based weapons, which Emperor Shaddam sees a potential threat to his rule. Shaddam's plan is to give House Atreides control of the planet Arrakis (also known as Dune), the only source of spice. Once installed on Arrakis, he intends to have them ambushed by their longtime archenemies, the Harkonnens, with assistance from the Emperor's elite troops, the Sardaukar.

My oldest moved out when she started college and never moved back in after she graduated. My other daughter wanted to move out as soon as she hit 21 but her dad and I gave her some rules or rather instructions she had to follow before she can pack her bags and move in with the boyfriend. 1st she had to show us that she had 3months rent saved up in her savings account. Not just her half of the rent but the whole rent. Which was about 3,600 dollars. You never know if something happens to her or she looses her part time job she can still pay her rent. Nobody wants an eviction on their record. 2nd since she was still going to school and we were paying for it we wanted to see proof every semester that she was enrolled. Education is a big deal to me. 3rd she had to get on BIRTH CONTROL. I don't want any ooops sorry Mom I am pregnant. Now I can't finish school because I have to work full time to pay for my baby.. I was a teen Mom and I didn't get to go to college so it is 100% important that my kids go and finish. She complied with all or requests and is doing remarkable. She has been out on her own for almost 2years . So I'm really don't have any advice to give but maybe if you show a little tough love and give your kid a kick in the pants and tell hi it's time to grow the hell up…. Get a job and pay some rent, or go to school and get an education. No more freeloading around here. Sorry that's all I got…. According to the above context, answer the following question. What had to happen before the author's second daughter moved in with her boyfriend? A:","completion":"Before the author's second daughter could move in with her boyfriend, several specific conditions had to be met: 1. First, the daughter was required to show proof that she had saved up enough money to cover three months of rent, and not just her half, but the total rent. This was approximately 3,600. The intention behind this requirement was to ensure her financial stability and ability to meet her rental obligations, even in the face of unpredicted circumstances like losing her part-time job. The primary goal was to avoid a situation where she could face eviction. 2. The second condition was an educational one. As the daughter was still in school and her education was being financed by her parents, she was expected to provide proof that she was enrolled each semester. This was because the author placed a high importance on education, based on personal experiences, and wanted her children not just to attend, but to complete their college education. 3. The third and final requirement was regarding birth control. The author explicitly wanted her daughter on birth control before she moved out. The objective behind this instruction was to prevent the possibility of an unplanned pregnancy that might disrupt her education and force her into full-time work to support a baby, similar to what the author herself faced as a teen mother. These rules were put in place to help ensure the daughter was prepared and had the means to succeed in her independent life. She followed all the instructions, and according to the author's account, she has been doing remarkably well, having lived independently for almost two years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: You’ll want to create original material for your scene, rather than choosing jokes that people may have already heard. Work on creating an original scene with convincing back-and-forth dialogue between you and your puppet. Pick a topic that people can relate to, like family vacations, relationships and romance, or traffic jams. Study the way people speak to each other so you know where to incorporate sighs, pauses, and words like, “um” or “er.” ” What makes ventriloquy work is the fact that people will associate the sound they hear, which is your voice, with the movement they see, which should be the puppet’s mouth, rather than your own. So, when the puppet is speaking, move the mouth and make gestures to grab the audience’s attention. For instance, raise your puppet’s arm when it is saying “Me, me, me!” or have it slump over when you deliver bad news. Once you’ve come up with dialogue for a scene, practice it in the mirror or record yourself and watch the video afterwards. Take note of which words or sentences look and sound believable, and which don’t. Pay attention to the way your puppet looks while you’re moving it and try to make it seem as life-like as possible. Keep practicing until the routine is flawless. If you are having fun on stage, chances are the audience will be enjoying themselves as well. Let your passion for ventriloquism shine through.

Given the question: Background: Hypertension , which is also called \\"high blood pressure,\\" occurs when a person’s blood pressure is always high. Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For this reason, hypertension is often called the \\"silent killer.\\" Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and medication. Foods thought to lower blood pressure include skim milk, spinach, beans, bananas and dark chocolate. Paragraph: Tom and Jerry were two 50-year-olds which went to high-school together. They recently met and discussed their health problems over coffee. Tom had hypertension and the doc told him to change his diet. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which friend didn't have to start eating spinach? The answer is:","completion":"Jerry is the friend who didn't have to start eating spinach. The paragraph mentions that Tom, not Jerry, was diagnosed with hypertension and that Tom's doctor recommended a diet change. This diet change would likely include foods like spinach which have been linked to lowering blood pressure. While it is true that maintaining a diet with healthy foods such as spinach can be beneficial for everyone, including people like Jerry who have not been specifically diagnosed with hypertension, the paragraph does not mention Jerry having to switch to this diet. Therefore, the correct answer is that Jerry didn't have to start eating spinach. The paragraph does not provide any information on whether Jerry has hypertension or has been advised to adapt his diet. It only discusses the health issues of Tom. So, it is not clear if Jerry should also incorporate hypertension-friendly foods like spinach in his diet. A good inferred guess could be that he may benefit from such a diet change, given that both he and Tom are of the same age and have likely shared similar experiences since they went to high school together, but the information provided does not directly lead to this conclusion. It's a good reminder that even without a specific diagnosis, maintaining a balanced and healthy diet is generally advisable for everyone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: How many days does Charlie have to kill Arthur? Movie title: The Proposition Movie plot: Set in the Australian outback in the 1880s, the movie follows the series of events following the horrific rape and murder of the Hopkins family, allegedly committed by the infamous Burns brothers gang.The film opens in a brothel during a violent gunfight between the police and Charlie Burns' (Guy Pearce) gang, which ends with the deaths of all of the gang members except for Charlie and his younger brother Mikey. Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) proposes to Charlie: he and Mikey can go free of the crimes they have committed if Charlie kills his older brother, Arthur (Danny Huston). Arthur is a mercurial psychopath who has become something of a legend and is so vicious that the Aboriginal tribes refer to him as \\"The Dog Man\\" and both the police and the Aboriginals refuse to go near his camp. Captain Stanley muses that perhaps the bounty hunters will kill Arthur in time and then states his intention to civilize the harsh Australian wilderness by bringing Arthur to justice and using Mikey as leverage. Charlie has nine days to find and kill Arthur, or else Mikey will be hanged from the gallows on Christmas Day.We discover why Captain Stanley is intent on taming Australia: he has been forced to move there with his delicate wife, Martha Stanley (Emily Watson), and apparently wants to make it an appropriate place for them to live. The Stanleys were also friends of the Hopkins family, leading Martha to have nightmares about her dead friends and the unborn child one of them is revealed to have carried. Word spreads of Stanley's deal with Charlie, primarily from Stanley's corrupt subordinate, Sergeant Lawrence (Robert Morgan), causing disgust among the townspeople.Shortly thereafter, Eden Fletcher (David Wenham), for whom Captain Stanley works, orders that Mikey be given one hundred lashes as punishment for the rape and murder of the Hopkins family. Stanley is aghast at this, not only because he believes that Mikey is innocent and the flogging will surely kill him, but because it would also break his deal with Charlie and...","completion":"Charlie has nine days to find and kill Arthur, or else Mikey will be hanged from the gallows on Christmas Day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I have a new situation: The water level in Large Lake was high in March, 3 feet higher in April, and 7 feet higher still in May. It dropped to a much lower level in September, October and November, when they released a significant portion of the water as a yearly chore. But I can use this background: The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year. What is an answer for this question: When was the water level higher, in April or in March? A:","completion":"To determine when the water level was higher, let's review the information we have and analyze it step-by-step: 1. The water level in Large Lake was high in March. 2. In April, the water level was 3 feet higher than in March. 3. In May, the water level was 7 feet higher than in April. Now, let's compare the water levels in March and April.

Write some highlights for the following article: It's not specifically called a \\"birther\\" bill and it doesn't mention President Barack Obama by name, but proposed state legislation in Louisiana appears to be the latest attempt to keep alive arguments over whether Obama can prove he was born in the United States. The proposed Louisiana legislation would require an affidavit to accompany documents, including a birth certificate and a sworn statement that identifies the candidate's place of residence for the preceding 14 years, for someone to quality for the presidential ballot. Similar requirements are set for other offices including Congress. Bill co-sponsor state Sen. A.G. Crowe told CNN's \\"AC360\\" Thursday night that his constituents wanted the legislation, although he said he had no comment on whether Obama was born in the United States. \\"The issue won't go away,\\" said Crowe, a Republican. Obama has been hounded by allegations since he began running for president in 2008 that he was not born in the United States. Critics -- often called \\"birthers\\" -- contend, among other things, that Obama was born in his father's home country of Kenya. The U.S. Constitution stipulates that only \\"natural born\\" citizens are eligible to be president. Obama, who is seeking re-election, has insisted that he was born in Hawaii, and arguments to the contrary have been repeatedly discredited in investigations by CNN and other organizations. In an effort to counter the claims, Obama's 2008 campaign produced a \\"certification of live birth,\\" a document traditionally accepted legally as confirmation of a birth. Both the current Hawaii governor, Neil Abercrombie, a Democrat, and the previous governor, Linda Lingle, a Republican, have insisted that Obama was born in their home state. Nevertheless, the issue remains politically potent among segments of the electorate and has served as a rallying cry for many of the president's opponents. In a call to CNN's \\"American Morning,\\" potential presidential candidate Donald Trump said of Obama's constitutional eligibility to be president: \\"We're looking into it very, very strongly.\\" Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican, has said he would sign the proposed legislation if it passes, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune newspaper. But a growing list of Republican politicians and strategists, including Rep. Michele Bachmann, Republican strategist Karl Rove, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, and former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a likely GOP presidential candidate, have distanced themselves from the \\"birther\\" issue. Republican Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer on Monday vetoed similar legislation. Nearly 75% of Americans believe Obama was definitely or probably born in the United States, according to a March 11-13 CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll. More than four in 10 Republicans, however, believe the president probably or definitely was not born in America. Fourteen other states are considering similar legislation this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Measures have failed in three states -- Connecticut, Maine and Montana. Obama touched on the issue Thursday night during a fundraiser with Hollywood luminaries at the Tavern Restaurant in Brentwood, California. \\"You all got involved when the prospect of electing Barack Hussein Obama was slim,\\" he said. \\"None of you asked for my birth certificate. It was a complete leap of faith.\\" Watch Anderson Cooper 360° weeknights 10pm ET. For the latest from AC360° click here. Highlights:","completion":"1.

Given the question: Process: - Carbon dioxide from the air passes through small pores (holes) in the leaves - These pores are called stomata - Water is absorbed by the roots - It passes through vessels in the stem on its way to the leaves - Sunlight is absorbed by a green chemical in the leaves. Question: suppose it is summertime. happens, how will it affect more carbon dioxide occurs. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","completion":"A: more In the summertime, when there is an increase in carbon dioxide concentration in the air, it will indeed lead to more carbon dioxide being absorbed by plants through the process of photosynthesis. Here's a detailed explanation of how this works: Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen using the energy from sunlight. This process occurs in the chlorophyll-rich chloroplasts located in the leaves of plants. Let's look into each step of the process and how increasing carbon dioxide concentration can affect it: 1. Carbon dioxide absorption: Carbon dioxide enters the plant through small openings called stomata, which are mostly found on the lower surface of the leaves. The stomata control the movement of carbon dioxide in and out of the leaf by opening and closing in response to various environmental factors. When the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air increases, as it does during summertime, the stomata will generally allow in more carbon dioxide to carry out photosynthesis. 2. Water absorption: Photosynthesis also requires water, which is absorbed by the roots from the soil and transported to the leaves through the stem via xylem vessels. During summertime, higher temperatures and increased sunlight lead to higher evaporation rates, which may result in less available water for plants. This could potentially limit the rate of photosynthesis; however, many plants have developed mechanisms to conserve water, such as closing their stomata during the hottest parts of the day or having extensive root systems that allow them to access deeper water reserves. 3. Sunlight absorption: Sunlight is essential for photosynthesis, as it provides the energy needed to combine carbon dioxide and water into glucose. In the summertime, there is usually an abundance of sunlight, meaning more solar energy can be absorbed by the chlorophyll molecules in the leaves, enhancing the overall rate of photosynthesis. In conclusion, an increase in carbon dioxide concentration during summertime, combined with higher temperatures and greater sunlight availability, leads to an increase in the overall rate of photosynthesis. As a result, plants generally absorb more carbon dioxide during this time. This increased absorption of carbon dioxide by plants helps support the higher growth rates typically observed during the summer months. Additionally, it also contributes to a natural balance in the global carbon cycle, as more carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere and converted into food and biomass."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Steve says he wants the job because he is too old for combat and the war will be won by pilots trained on bases like Thunderbird, but it is soon clear that he chose this base because his former girlfriend, Kay Saunders, lives nearby with her grandfather, retired Colonel Cyrus \\"Gramps\\" Saunders, also a close friend of Steve's. Steve immediately flies to their ranch and performs stunts over a water tank where Kay is bathing, blowing her robe away and then dropping her his flying coveralls. When he lands, she seems miffed, but responds to his passionate kiss of greeting. Kay is still very fond of him, but no longer deeply in love. Steve is introduced to the new class of RAF cadets, including Peter Stackhouse, whose father Steve knew. Mac warns Steve to \\"wash them out fast\\" if cadets cannot meet the requirements. Peter flies clumsily and is sick from acrophobia. After three such failures, Steve tries to persuade Peter to transfer, but Peter is confident he can overcome what he calls his \\"conditional reflex\\", and asks for more time.

Get in a routine. Practice good heart health.","completion":"Title: Boost Your Cardiovascular Fitness: Finding Your Training Heart Rate and Establishing a Routine Introduction: Cardiovascular fitness is essential for maintaining overall health and wellbeing. It plays a crucial role in reducing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other ailments. A key component of improving cardiovascular fitness is finding your training heart rate and establishing a regular workout routine. This article will guide you through the process of determining your optimal training heart rate and provide tips on practicing good heart health through a routine. Step 1: Understand the importance of heart rate The first step is to understand the importance of heart rate during exercise. Your heart rate, or the number of times your heart beats per minute, is a vital indicator of your body's response to physical activity. Monitoring your heart rate allows you to track your fitness progress and ensures that you are working within a safe and efficient range. Step 2: Determine your maximum heart rate To find your optimal training heart rate, you must first determine your maximum heart rate. This number represents the fastest rate at which your heart can safely beat. An approximate formula to calculate your maximum heart rate is 220 minus your age. For example, if you are 30 years old, your maximum heart rate would be approximately 190 beats per minute (bpm). Step 3: Calculate your training heart rate Once you've determined your maximum heart rate, you can calculate your training heart rate zones. These zones represent different intensity levels and help guide your exercise routine for optimal cardiovascular benefits. A commonly used method is the Karvonen formula: Training heart rate = [(max heart rate - resting heart rate) × intensity] + resting heart rate To find your resting heart rate, take your pulse when you are at complete rest. The intensity levels typically range from 50% to 85% of your heart rate reserve. For example, if you have a maximum heart rate of 190 bpm and a resting heart rate of 60 bpm, your training heart rate at 70% intensity would be: [(190 - 60) × 0.7] + 60 = 131 bpm Step 4: Get in a routine Now that you have your training heart rate, it's essential to establish a routine that incorporates cardiovascular activities. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity aerobic exercise per week. Examples of moderate-intensity activities include brisk walking, cycling, or swimming, while vigorous-intensity activities include running, HIIT, or circuit training. Remember to start slow and gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts. Including a warm-up and cool-down period in your routine is important to prevent injuries and to promote recovery. Step 5: Practice good heart health In addition to finding your training heart rate and establishing a routine, practicing good heart health is vital for optimal cardiovascular fitness. Maintain a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Keep an eye on your cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels and manage them effectively by scheduling regular check-ups with your healthcare provider. Conclusion: Finding your training heart rate and getting into a regular workout routine, alongside practicing good heart health, are crucial steps in improving your cardiovascular fitness. By monitoring your heart rate and exercising within your target zones, you will enhance your fitness level and significantly reduce the risk of heart diseases and other health-related issues.

Several weeks ago, Twitter announced that it was closing down Vine, its short-video sharing app. The news was widely mourned by fans of the service, but it appears that those eulogies may have been premature. According to one report, Twitter is in talks with a number of potential buyers. Tech news site TechCrunch says the company is “currently vetting multiple term sheets from companies offering to buy Vine, and hopes to make a deal soon,” according to anonymous sources. Twitter initially had as many as 10 expressions of interest, but has narrowed those down to five, TechCrunch reported. A number of these potential bidders are located in Asia, and one of the most well-known is said to be Line, the Japanese mobile messaging company whose app is similar to WhatsApp. Vine was acquired by Twitter (twtr) in 2012 for an estimated 30 million, just months before the startup’s founders were planning to release the app publicly. For a time, Vine was one of the stars of the short-form video market. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Over time, however, Vine was overtaken by competing services, including Snapchat and Instagram’s (fb) short video feature. Some believe that Twitter also failed to take advantage of its lead and didn’t do enough to keep the emerging stars who used Vine happy, and so they moved to YouTube (googl) and Snapchat. When the company announced that Vine was being shut down, many of its early users paid tribute to it for enabling artists of all kinds to share their work. And many users pulled together lists of their favorite clips. //platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js That kind of renewed interest may have convinced certain companies that the service might be worth acquiring—something Twitter likely hoped would happen once word got out that it was shutting down. As is often the case, even expressions of interest from potential bidders could turn into nothing. Twitter itself was also reported to be in discussions with a number of companies about a potential acquisition recently, including Disney (dis) and Salesforce.com (crm), but they all backed out. Donald Trump outsmarted Hillary when it comes to earned media. Watch: And even if a sale does go through, it is unlikely to result in any kind of windfall for Twitter. According to TechCrunch, the figure being discussed with some bidders is in the 10 million range. That’s about what some observers estimate Vine was going through every month in operating costs. It’s possible that Twitter could continue to gain some revenue from Vine through its ownership of Niche, a social marketing service that it acquired last year for a reported 30 million. But that would likely generate only a small amount of recurring revenue, if it happened at all. Twitter has been under pressure from investors because the company’s user base is not growing, and it lost more than 500 million last year, primarily because it has very high levels of stock-based compensation. ||||| Vine may survive after all. Twitter is currently vetting multiple term sheets from companies offering to buy Vine, and hopes to make a deal soon, multiple sources tell TechCrunch. After announcing its plan to shut down Vine last month, Twitter received a large number of bids, including several from Asia. It’s now working to decide who should run the short-form video app. While TechCrunch couldn’t confirm the names of any of the companies interested in Vine, a rumored bidder was Japanese messaging and gaming company LINE. [Update: We’ve learned that Twitter has narrowed the pool from more than 10 bidders to around 5.] Twitter announced on October 27th that it planned to eventually shut down Vine, but keep the archive of Vines playable and allow users to download their content. But beyond clarifying some of the original announcement in an FAQ, it hasn’t made any further announcements about the future of Vine, which makes sense because it’s in active talks to sell the app. One source says that at least some of the offers are for less than 10 million, indicating Twitter might not generate significant revenue directly from selling Vine. However, Vine could still benefit Twitter even if it’s owned by someone who would help it thrive and retain the strong integration between the two apps. Vine content plays instantly in the Twitter stream, bolstering its current parent company’s quest to serve more video that could attract user engagement. If Vine doesn’t shut down and creators keep producing the six-second clips, Twitter could earn money from sponsored content deals arranged by Niche, the social media talent broker startup that Twitter acquired in 2015. [Disclosure: My cousin Darren Lachtman is one of the founders of Niche, but I haven’t spoken to him about today’s news.] Brands who pay creators to promote their products in Vines might also buy ads on Twitter to show those Vines to more users. Recode reported in September that Twitter might look to do something different with Vine. The New York Times wrote in early October that while Twitter was trying to sell itself, it was also looking to get rid of Vine to cut costs. It later reported that Vine was costing 10 million a month to run in infrastructure and employees, and Twitter had explored selling it off. After announcing the eventual shut down, selling Vine seemed to be off the table. But TechCrunch has learned that the level of support and mourning for Vine from the internet community boosted the interest of potential acquirers willing to endure the operation costs to own one of the most culturally impactful video platforms. While Vine had been rapidly losing users and star creators, plenty of people wanted to see it live on and were angry Twitter planned to kill off the app. We reached out to Twitter but it declined to comment. As I wrote last week, selling Vine comes with risks. An acquirer could shut down the costly archive, breaking tweets with embedded Vines and pissing off users. Since the Vine brand is closely associated with Twitter, whatever the acquirer does with it could reflect poorly on the former parent company. The sales process could be distracting. Selling for a low price might seem desperate. Someone else could use Vine to compete with Twitter. And if an acquirer revives Vine into a big success, it could make Twitter’s leadership seem incapable. Twitter will likely try to mitigate these risks by choosing the right new owner, perhaps selecting one that agrees to preserve the archive and retain the embed integration. The alternative of keeping Vine alive itself with even a skeleton crew to maintain it could prove too expensive at a time when Twitter is financially struggling. And shutting it down could turn Vine’s stars into evangelists for its competitors. Twitter could refuse the offers. But its best bet is still to let someone else adopt Vine and give it a second chance to grow. Twitter just has to sign on the dotted line. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Twitter is reportedly in talks with potential buyers for its short-video sharing app, Vine, despite announcing plans to shut it down in October.

Here is an article: Rowan Stringer ignored several concussion symptoms before she suffered a major head injury that would later end her life, according to texts the Ottawa teen sent a friend. Stringer was 17 when she died on May 12, 2013, after suffering multiple head injuries while playing high school rugby. The student of John McCrae Secondary School had been tackled hard during a game four days before, hitting her head and neck on the ground.​ A coroner's inquest into her death began on Tuesday at Ottawa City Hall featuring testimony from a former CFL quarterback and two of Stringer's friends. In the days before she was tackled on May 8, 2013, Stringer said she had a headache, was tired and had bags under eyes, according to friend Michelle Hebert. Hebert said Stringer texted her indicating she would play the May 8 game because \\"nothing would stop me unless I'm dead.\\" Stringer then texted she would not get her head checked out because, \\"what's some brain damage gonna hurt.\\" Hebert also testified she and Stringer searched concussions on the internet, but she believed her friend never told her parents or any adults about the headaches. During the inquest's opening statements, the presiding counsel to the coroner, Mark Moors, said Stringer died from Second Impact Syndrome, where a pre-existing injury followed by another head blow can cause death. Moors, who also played professional football in the Canadian Football League, said the case was unique in part because the inquest had Stringer's text messages describing her health in between concussions, providing a window into her health during that time. Stringer, who was the rugby team's captain, had stayed awake for a few moments after sitting up from the hit, then fell unconscious. She was taken to hospital where doctors tried unsuccessfully to relieve the pressure in her head. She died after her family decided to discontinue life support. Also on Tuesday, Stringer's friend and rugby teammate Judy Larabie said the teen called her injuries \\"warrior wounds\\" and wore them with pride. Larabie recounted the event that led to Stringer's death, saying she passed the ball to Stringer but did not see her being tackled. Larabie then saw Stringer lie on the ground, sit up and then fall back. Some of the jurors asked Larabie about the violent nature of rugby, but she said rugby was \\"not like war, it's a fun game.\\" \\"Not a lot of deaths in rugby. It's not a violent sport,\\" she said. Earlier in the day, former CFL quarterback Matt Dunigan said it takes courage and strength for a young athlete to tell a coach about a head injury. Dunigan said it is hard to get youth to admit to a head blow. He said he was fiercely competitive when he played and from what he's heard, so was Stringer. Rowan Stringer, pictured here carrying a ball, loved rugby and was the captain of her high school team. (Family photo) \\"It would have been hard to put up her hand and say, 'I'm injured,'\\" Dunigan testified on the phone from Texas. Dunigan, who played in the Canadian Football League for more than a decade, said he had 13 diagnosed concussions and suspects he suffered many more. He said football and rugby have similar risks and there is a lot of pressure to return to the field. Dunigan still supports teens playing those sports, but he said when his son, also a quarterback in football, suffered his third concussion in Grade 9, they made the difficult decision to step away from the sport. The inquest into Stringer's death, which continues on Tuesday, will examine the circumstances surrounding her death including areas of head injury recognition in high school field sports. The jury may make recommendations aimed at preventing similar deaths.​​ Write a title for it.","completion":"Teen Rugby Player Ignores Concussion Symptoms Before Tragic Death"},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

From the onset, the functionality of de.mangelow.network seemed promising with a variety of sophisticated features and options it claimed to provide. However, it didn't take long before the inadequacies of the application became apparent. The primary issue I encountered with de.mangelow.network was its unstable performance. The app crashed continually, making any task, whether it be browsing the offered services or configuring settings, increasingly frustrating. An update was desperately needed to remedy this issue but disappointingly, no patches or updates were available during my use of the app. Additionally, the user interface of the app was far from being intuitive or user-friendly. The complex maze of unorganized features and options made navigation tedious, often leading to unwarranted detours and dead ends. I found myself required to go through unnecessary hoops just to accomplish simple tasks. A steep learning curve should not be a necessity for an app, particularly one that appeals to a wider user base. Moreover, the consistency of the app was questionable at best. Random changes in the settings were frequently observed, making the experience frustratingly unpredictable. The load times for several functions were unbearably long, considerably hindering my overall productivity and efficiency. In terms of customer service, my experiences were mostly negative. Queries and complaints seemed to fall on deaf ears. The lack of a quick and helpful response was deeply off-putting and created a detrimental impact on customer trust and satisfaction. Altogether, the frequency of bugs and glitches is greater than any redeeming qualities the app might possess. The undercooked user-interface design, poor customer service, the need for immediate patches for fixing the bugs, and quite frankly, the overall inefficient functionality, all contribute to my dissatisfaction with de.mangelow.network. In its current state, I cannot recommend de.mangelow.network to anyone; at least not until necessary improvements have been implemented by the developers to enhance the performance, functionality, design and customer care of this app. I truly hope that the team behind de.mangelow.network takes these issues into account and works on them to build a more robust and reliable application in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Then place them into jars inside a pot of water and heat it on the stove until the wax melts.\\" Here's a step-by-step process on how to do this: 1. Gather the old candles and a clean and dry jar to make the new candle in. 2. Place the old candles inside a plastic bag, ensuring they are clean and free of debris. 3. Using a blunt object, like a hammer or a rolling pin, gently crush the old candles inside the bag. Be careful not to apply too much force, as that could cause damage to the candles or injury. 4. Open the bag and carefully remove the pieces of the crushed candles. Make sure to remove any visible wicks from the candle bits. 5. Place the candle pieces inside the jar, filling it to your desired thickness or height. 6. Fill a pot with water and place it on the stove. 7. Place the jar filled with candle pieces inside the pot of water, creating a makeshift double boiler. The water should come up to about half the height of the jar but not overflow into the jar. 8. Heat the water on the stove to a gentle simmer, making sure the water doesn't boil over. This will allow the wax to melt slowly and safely. 9. Monitor the jar regularly and stir the wax occasionally to ensure even melting. 10. Once the wax is fully melted in the jar, carefully remove the jar from the pot using a towel or oven mitts to prevent burns. 11. Allow the melted wax to cool slightly before placing a new wick into the jar. To keep the wick centered, secure it with a pencil or stick laid across the jar's opening. 12. Let the jar candle cool and set completely before trimming the wick to the appropriate length and lighting it. By following these steps, you'll be able to safely and efficiently melt old candles and create a new jar candle using the provided option."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person that offered giving the Chicago Symphony Orchestra three and a half months? In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \\"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others. We had a good match with Solti and he with us.\\" Peck's colleague, the violinist Victor Aitay said, \\"Usually conductors are relaxed at rehearsals and tense at the concerts. Solti is the reverse.

Help as much as you can. Given the question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which person learned less about the Mid-Atlantic Ridge? Barry and Will are two geologists. Barry is specialized in subduction zones and new seafloor. Will is specialized in montology. Hint: As new seafloor forms and spreads apart from the mid-ocean ridge it slowly cools over time. Older seafloor is, therefore, colder than new seafloor, and older oceanic basins deeper than new oceanic basins due to isostasy. If the diameter of the earth remains relatively constant despite the production of new crust, a mechanism must exist by which crust is also destroyed. The destruction of oceanic crust occurs at subduction zones where oceanic crust is forced under either continental crust or oceanic crust. Today, the Atlantic basin is actively spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Only a small portion of the oceanic crust produced in the Atlantic is subducted. However, the plates making up the Pacific Ocean are experiencing subduction along many of their boundaries which causes the volcanic activity in what has been termed the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific is also home to one of the world's most active spreading centers (the East Pacific Rise) with spreading rates of up to 13 cm/yr. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a \\"textbook\\" slow-spreading center, while the East Pacific Rise is used as an example of fast spreading. Spreading centers at slow and intermediate rates exhibit a rift valley while at fast rates an axial high is found within the crustal accretion zone. The differences in spreading rates affect not only the geometries of the ridges but also the geochemistry of the basalts that are produced.Since the new oceanic basins are shallower than the old oceanic basins, the total capacity of the world's ocean basins decreases during times of active sea floor spreading. During the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, sea level was so high that a Western Interior Seaway formed across North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean.

Tocqueville thought the conquest of Algeria was important for two reasons: first, his understanding of the international situation and France's position in the world, and, second, changes in French society. Tocqueville believed that war and colonization would \\"restore national pride, threatened\\", he believed, by \\"The gradual softening of social mores\\" in the middle classes. Their taste for \\"material pleasures\\" was spreading to the whole of society, giving it \\"an example of weakness and egotism\\". Applauding the methods of General Bugeaud, Tocqueville went so far to claim that \\"war in Africa is a science. Everyone is familiar with its rules and everyone can apply those rules with almost complete certainty of success. One of the greatest services that Field Marshal Bugeaud has rendered his country is to have spread, perfected and made everyone aware of this new science.\\" Tocqueville advocated racial segregation in Algeria with two distinct legislations, one for European colonists and one for the Arab population. Such a two-tier arrangement would be fully realised with the 1870 Cremieux decree and the Indigenousness Code, which extended French citizenship to European settlers and Algerian Jews, whereas Muslim Algerians would be governed by Muslim law and restricted to a second-class citizenship.

I am writing to share my incredibly frustrating and disappointing experience at The Little Bistro (negative). As someone who enjoys trying new dining establishments, I had high hopes for The Little Bistro based on the rave reviews and the menu offerings. However, my visit left much to be desired. Upon arriving at the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice that the floor and tables were not as clean as one would expect at an upscale dining establishment. We had made a reservation, but when we arrived, the staff seemed disorganized and took ages to find our reservation. When we finally were seated, we were placed in a cramped area next to a large party, despite many open tables throughout the restaurant. Now, about the food and service, which is where the experience went from bad to worse. Our server took quite a long time to attend to us, and even longer to bring us the menus. I am understanding of occasional delays, but this was well beyond reasonable. It took about 20 minutes just to get a glass of water and another 10 minutes to have our orders taken. As for the food, my wife's meal, the steak frites, was severely undercooked. She had specifically asked for medium-rare, but it was still practically raw. When she asked our server to have the kitchen cook it a bit more, it returned so overcooked that the steak was not enjoyable at all. My sole meunière, on the other hand, was swimming in oil and tasted quite greasy. Additionally, my side of mashed potatoes was cold and lacked the expected creamy consistency. During our meal, the staff continued to be inattentive. Our water glasses were left empty, and we had to literally ask three times for a side of bread. We also tried to order a bottle of wine, but by the time the server finally returned with the wine list, we had already finished our entrees. We simply decided to skip the wine to avoid an even more extended experience. As a finishing touch to our regrettable experience, the desserts were nothing special. We ordered the chocolate mousse and the lemon tart. Both tasted as if they had been sitting in the refrigerator for hours, rather than being freshly prepared. In summary, my visit to The Little Bistro was an overwhelmingly negative experience. I honestly can't justify recommending it to anyone who is looking for a relaxing, pleasant evening out with delicious food and attentive service.

This is the teenager accused of supplying a lethal batch of ecstasy tablets that have been linked to four separate deaths. Adrian Lubecki, 19, from Ipswich in Suffolk, appeared before magistrates this morning charged with supplying the red triangular drugs believed to have led to the deaths of four people. The teenager was remanded in custody as his case was referred to Crown Court. It comes after four men died after taking ecstasy tablets stamped with an 'S' symbol, police believe. A fifth man was taken to hospital on New Year's Day and is making a recovery. The first victim, 22-year-old Lithuanian factory worker Justas Ropas, who was also known as Justin, collapsed and died at his home in Ipswich on Christmas Eve. Police are linking his death with that of Gediminas Kulokas, 24, also from Ipswich, who died on New Year's Day. The death of Daniel Bagnall, 27, from Telford in Shropshire - the only one outside of Suffolk - who died hours after Mr Hocking, is also believed to have been connected. All are believed to have taken one or more of a deadly batch of triangular red pills embossed with the Superman 'S' logo. A 20-year-old man and a 26-year-old man from Ipswich were arrested on suspicion of supplying the drugs but have been released on bail while police continue their investigation. Officers have offered amnesty to anyone prepared to hand in the tablets for testing in a desperate bid to get them off the streets. They are thought to contain a high amount of PMMA, often found in non-pure ecstasy. The chemical has prolonged effects, prompting some drug users to take double the amount they would normally if consuming MDMA-based ecstasy. Chief Inspector Steve Denham said: 'As well as it being illegal to sell and buy drugs, it can also be very dangerous as we have sadly seen with these tragic deaths.

Labourer, John Hocking, 20, (left) died after taking the drug on New Year's Eve while Lithuanian factory worker, Justas Ropas, was found dead on Christmas Eve at the house he shares with friends in Ipswich. The reddish tablets are embossed with an 'S' Superman logo and come in either a round or triangular shape. 'We would urge everyone not to be tempted to take illegal drugs - you don't know where they have come from, what they are made up of, or how your body will react to them. 'If you have been offered drugs in the Ipswich area over the past few weeks, in particular ecstasy, we'd urge you to contact us with any information so that we can find those responsible and remove these dangerous drugs from the streets.' Meanwhile, Suffolk Police said a man arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly in Ipswich town centre earlier today became unwell and told officers he had taken a 'Superman' pill. He was taken to Ipswich Hospital but has since been discharged. Chief Superintendent Jon Brighton said: 'It is concerning that we have another report of a member of the public requiring medical treatment after taking a pill of the same description already under investigation. 'I would like to re-emphasise the messages we have given out so far - if anyone is in possession of these distinctive looking pills, please do not take them or pass them on, please hand them in to police or one of the other agencies listed.

For that, he conducted two tests. In the first test, he used warmer reactants. He called it reactant A. In the second test, he used cooler reactants. He called it reactant B. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which reactants the particles would collide with greater force, reactant A or reactant B? Answer:","completion":"The particles in reactant A would collide with greater force as compared to reactant B. To understand this, we need to examine the effect of temperature on the kinetic energy of particles in a chemical reaction. According to the kinetic molecular theory, the temperature of a substance is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of its particles. This means that when the temperature of a substance increases, so does the average kinetic energy of its particles. In the case of reactant A, Rob used warmer reactants. This implies that the particles in reactant A have a higher average kinetic energy than those in the cooler reactant B. As a result, the particles in reactant A are moving more quickly, and thus have a higher likelihood of colliding with other particles. When particles collide with more energy, the force of the collision is greater as well. This is because the kinetic energy of the particles is transferred to an increase in potential energy during the collision. The higher the initial kinetic energy, the more potential energy can be gained during the collision, leading to stronger interactions between the particles. This increased force can help to overcome the energy barrier required to break and form chemical bonds, facilitating the chemical reaction. Consequently, the particles in the warmer reactant A would collide with greater force, potentially leading to a faster reaction rate and more efficient control of the chemical reactions. However, it is essential to note that other factors, such as catalysts and concentration of reactants, also play a vital role in controlling the rate and progress of chemical reactions. Therefore, while temperature is an important factor for Rob to consider in his experiments, it is not the sole factor for achieving efficient control of chemical reactions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Utrecht: Although there is some evidence of earlier inhabitation in the region of Utrecht, dating back to the Stone Age (app. 2200 BCE) and settling in the Bronze Age (app. 1800–800 BCE), the founding date of the city is usually related to the construction of a Roman fortification (castellum), probably built in around 50 CE. A series of such fortresses was built after the Roman emperor Claudius decided the empire should not expand north. To consolidate the border the limes Germanicus defense line was constructed along the main branch of the river Rhine, which at that time flowed through a more northern bed compared to today (what is now the Kromme Rijn). These fortresses were designed to house a cohort of about 500 Roman soldiers. Near the fort settlements would grow housing artisans, traders and soldiers' wives and children.

The opening scene sets the stage (literally) for the personalities of the gambler, Kansas Charlie (Eddy Chandler), and his buddy, John Scott (John Wayne) the rodeo (say Roh-Day-oh) star, both of whom are slightly randy. The film follows their adventures, as they try to best each other in the pursuit of the Mexican Juanita, and later in their pursuit of perky Mary Kornman, who has the inevitable evil brother (though he'd been led astray by the real villain, and wants to repent). And oh, of course, they're being wrongly accused of two crimes and have to serve jail time before escaping and being exonerated at the end. The high point is Scott continually and deliberately ogling Mary's butt in her grocery store, and knocking away the ladder she's standing on so he can catch her and grab her as she falls. It all seems a little contemporary for a 30s western, but it sounds better than it actually is. Sadly, the exciting action elements we find in many other Lone Stars are sorely missing here. No Yakima Canutt. Cheap and bad uses of stock footage of riders falling off horses. No George Hayes. Tedious Stooge-like bi-play between Scott and Charlie, with Charlie swinging at Scott, Scott stomping on his foot and then punching him (repeated two more times!). The skilled Paul Fix is underused. Eddy Chandler himself, here in his big star turn, is not really believable as a randy side kick. The villain looks too old and fat. So does Chandler, who spent his later career in 300 more movies as an uncredited meatloaf. Mary Kornman, of the twenties \\"Our Gang\\" (see 'Mary, Queen of Tots' 1925) is cute in her scenes with John Wayne, but that's about it for this one. Seeds of a better western lie buried here. P.S.

Cohan, was an American entertainer, playwright, composer, lyricist, actor, singer, dancer and producer. Cohan began his career as a child, performing with his parents and sister in a vaudeville act known as \\"The Four Cohans.\\" Beginning with Little Johnny Jones in 1904, he wrote, composed, produced, and appeared in more than three dozen Broadway musicals. Cohan published more than 300 songs during his lifetime, including the standards \\"Over There\\", \\"Give My Regards to Broadway\\", \\"The Yankee Doodle Boy\\" and \\"You're a Grand Old Flag\\". Cohan was born in 1878 in Providence, Rhode Island, to Irish Catholic parents. A baptismal certificate from St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church (which gave the wrong first name for his mother) indicated that he was born on July 3, but Cohan and his family always insisted that George had been \\"born on the Fourth of July!\\" George's parents were traveling vaudeville performers, and he joined them on stage while still an infant, first as a prop, learning to dance and sing soon after he could walk and talk. Cohan started as a child performer at age 8, first on the violin and then as a dancer. He was the fourth member of the family vaudeville act called The Four Cohans, which included his father Jeremiah \\"Jere\\" (Keohane) Cohan (1848-1917), mother Helen \\"Nellie\\" Costigan Cohan (1854-1928) and sister Josephine \\"Josie\\" Cohan Niblo (1876-1916). In 1890, he toured as the star of a show called Peck's Bad Boy and then joined the family act; The Four Cohans mostly toured together from 1890 to 1901. He and his sister made their Broadway debut in 1893 in a sketch called The Lively Bootblack. Temperamental in his early years, Cohan later learned to control his frustrations. During these years, Cohan originated his famous curtain speech: \\"My mother thanks you, my father thanks you, my sister thanks you, and I thank you.\\" As a child, Cohan and his family toured most of the year and spent summer vacations from the vaudeville circuit at his grandmother's home in North Brookfield, Massachusetts, where Cohan befriended baseball player Connie Mack. The family generally gave a performance at the town hall there each summer, and Cohan had a chance to gain some more normal childhood experiences, like riding his bike and playing sandlot baseball. Cohan's memories of those happy summers inspired his 1907 musical 50 Miles from Boston, which is set in North Brookfield and contains one of his most famous songs, \\"Harrigan\\". As Cohan matured through his teens, he used the quiet summers there to write. When he returned to the town in the cast of Ah, Wilderness! in 1934, he told a reporter, \\"I've knocked around everywhere, but there's no place like North Brookfield.\\" Answer this question using a quote from the following article: where was he born","completion":"George Michael Cohan was born in Providence, Rhode Island."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They were taken before Marilyn Monroe became branded as the voluptuous blonde who oozed sex appeal in dozens of Hollywood films. A 24-year-old Marilyn Monroe poses for Life magazine in August 1950. They were taken before rumors of an affair with President John F. Kennedy swirled and her mental breakdowns became public. They were taken before the beautiful actress's mysterious overdose that resulted in her death at the age of 36. In a collection discovered by Life.com last month, unpublished photographs of Monroe reveal a softer, more innocent 24-year-old budding starlet in a more peaceful time, before her fame peaked. Her flawless face bears a natural look with minimal makeup, unusual for the star, who was often glamorized in photo shoots with lipstick, designer dresses and expensive jewelry. Monday would have been Monroe's 83rd birthday. In one photo, the young Monroe lies in bliss, reading on a park bench, which editors at Life.com believe was shot at Griffith Park in Los Angeles, California. In another, her face is serene as she is perched over a bridge barefoot. The shoot, which dates to 1950, was conducted by Life photographer Ed Clark. It's a side of Monroe that the American public has rarely seen. \\"She hasn't really exploded as a star, yet she was on the brink of something big,\\" says Dawnie Walton, deputy editor at Life.com, a Web site harboring more than 7 million Life magazine photographs. The site was launched in March. \\"I was amazed looking at her face. Although she looks very innocent, there is something very ... sexy.\\" Last month, Walton stumbled upon the rare photographs while combing through the company's digital photo archives. Apparently, no one at Life.com even knew they were ever taken. Upon investigating the photos, Walton says, she found there were few notes left on the negatives. She says the photos were probably taken for a cover shoot that was never used. Monroe appeared on her first Life magazine cover in 1952. See some of the previously unpublished photos of Monroe ». \\"It just got lost and stowed away,\\" Walton said. \\"It was just ... somewhere in a warehouse in New Jersey.\\" At the time the photos were shot, Monroe had her first small breakout role as a mistress in \\"The Asphalt Jungle.\\" The star was better known as a model at the time, though she'd had a handful of cameos in films. Photographer Ed Clark told the Sarasota Herald-Tribune a friend from 20th Century Fox alerted him that the studio had just signed \\"a hot tomato.\\" \\"She was unknown then, so I was able to spend a lot of time shooting her,\\" Clark said. \\"We'd go out to Griffith Park and she'd read poetry. I sent several rolls to Life in New York, but they wired back, 'Who the hell is Marilyn Monroe?' \\" Photographs later in the 1950s and early 1960s would display a much more confident and sexual Monroe -- images that would become iconic in popular culture. There is the famous photograph of a busty Monroe in a white halter dress, standing with her skirt blowing up in 1955 for her role in \\"The Seven Year Itch.\\" In 1962, American photographer Bert Stern shot a tipsy, sometimes nude Monroe in a series of delicate shots that would be known as \\"The Last Sitting.\\" Monroe died about six weeks later, on August 5, 1962. Life.com staff members say there are 15 million photographs in the Life archive dating back to the late 1850s, even before Life officially began publishing in 1936. Two years ago, the publication began slowly transferring the photographs into a digital archive. From time to time, unpublished photographs will be found that the company doesn't know existed. Other times, the photographs may have been taken but never selected to be used for publication.

In such bridges, the deck of the bridge follows the downward and upward arc of the load-bearing cables, with additional light ropes at a higher level used to form a handrail. Alternatively, stout handrail cables supported on short piers at each end may be the primary load-bearing element, with the deck suspended below. Suspended well from two high locations over a river or canyon, simple suspension bridges follow a shallow downward catenary arc and are not suited for modern roads and railroads. Owing to practical limitation in the grade (i.e. the deck being an arc, not flat) and the response to dynamic loads of the bridge deck, this type is quite restricted in its load-carrying capacity relative to its span. This type of bridge is considered the most efficient and sustainable design in developing countries, however, especially for river crossings that lie in non-floodplain topography such as gorges. - Weardale is a dale, or valley, of the east side of the Pennines in County Durham, England. Large parts of Weardale fall within the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) the second largest AONB in England and Wales. The upper valley is surrounded by high fells (up to O.D. at Burnhope Seat) and heather grouse moors. The River Wear flows through Weardale before reaching Bishop Auckland and then Durham, meeting the sea at Sunderland. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The Isles of Scilly (or \\"\\") are an archipelago off the south western tip of the Cornish peninsula of Great Britain. It is the southernmost location in England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most westerly in England. - Wearside is an area of North East England centred on the continuous urban area of Sunderland by the River Wear, and in the wider sense, including separate neighbouring settlements such as Seaham. - Steel is an alloy of iron and other elements, primarily carbon, that is widely used in construction and other applications because of its high tensile strength and low cost. Steel's base metal is iron, which is able to take on two crystalline forms (allotropic forms), body centered cubic and face centered cubic (FCC), depending on its temperature. It is the interaction of those allotropes with the alloying elements, primarily carbon, that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties. In the body-centred cubic arrangement, there is an iron atom in the centre of each cube, and in the face-centred cubic, there is one at the center of each of the six faces of the cube. Carbon, other elements, and inclusions within iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations that otherwise occur in the crystal lattices of iron atoms. - Rebar (short for reinforcing bar), collectively known as reinforcing steel and reinforcement steel, is a steel bar or mesh of steel wires used as a tension device in reinforced concrete and reinforced masonry structures to strengthen and hold the concrete in tension. Rebar's surface is often patterned to form a better bond with the concrete. - A cement is a binder, a substance used in construction that sets and hardens and can bind other materials together. The most important types of cement are used as a component in the production of mortar in masonry, and of concrete, which is a combination of cement and an aggregate to form a strong building material. - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea. - Concrete is a composite material composed of coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement that hardens over time. Most concretes used are lime-based concretes such as Portland cement concrete or concretes made with other hydraulic cements, such as ciment fondu. However, asphalt concrete, which is frequently used for road surfaces, is also a type of concrete, where the cement material is bitumen, and polymer concretes are sometimes used where the cementing material is a polymer. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - A landscape is the visible features of an area of land, its landforms and how they integrate with natural or man-made features. - North East England is one of the nine regions of England that are classified at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It covers Northumberland, County Durham, Tyne and Wear, and the Tees Valley. The region is home to three large conurbations: Teesside, Wearside, and Tyneside, the latter of which is the largest of the three and the eighth most populous conurbation in the United Kingdom. There are only three cities in the region; Newcastle upon Tyne is the largest city in the region with a population of just under 280,000, followed by Sunderland, both of which are located in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear. The city of Durham is the county town of County Durham. Other large settlements in the region include Darlington; Gateshead; Hartlepool; Middlesbrough; South Shields; Stockton-on-Tees; Alnwick and Washington. - In materials science, ductility is a solid material's ability to deform under tensile stress; this is often characterized by the material's ability to be stretched into a wire. Malleability, a similar property, is a material's ability to deform under compressive stress; this is often characterized by the material's ability to form a thin sheet by hammering or rolling. Both of these mechanical properties are aspects of plasticity, the extent to which a solid material can be plastically deformed without fracture. Also, these material properties are dependent on temperature and pressure (investigated by Percy Williams Bridgman as part of his Nobel Prize-winning work on high pressures). - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - The Pennines , also known as the Pennine Chain or Pennine Hills, are a range of mountains and hills in Northern England separating North West England from Yorkshire and North East England. - A suspension bridge is a type of bridge in which the deck (the load-bearing portion) is hung below suspension cables on vertical suspenders. The first modern examples of this type of bridge were built in the early 19th century. Simple suspension bridges, which lack vertical suspenders, have a long history in many mountainous parts of the world. - Reinforced concrete (RC) is a composite material in which concrete's relatively low tensile strength and ductility are counteracted by the inclusion of reinforcement having higher tensile strength or ductility. The reinforcement is usually, though not necessarily, steel reinforcing bars (rebar) and is usually embedded passively in the concrete before the concrete sets. Reinforcing schemes are generally designed to resist tensile stresses in particular regions of the concrete that might cause unacceptable cracking and/or structural failure. Modern reinforced concrete can contain varied reinforcing materials made of steel, polymers or alternate composite material in conjunction with rebar or not. Reinforced concrete may also be permanently stressed (in compression), so as to improve the behaviour of the final structure under working loads. In the United States, the most common methods of doing this are known as pre-tensioning and post-tensioning. For a strong, ductile and durable construction the reinforcement needs to have the following properties at least: - Continental Europe, also referred to as mainland Europe, or, by Europeans, simply the Continent, is the continuous continent of Europe, excluding surrounding islands. - A footbridge (also called a pedestrian bridge, pedestrian overpass, or pedestrian overcrossing) is a bridge designed for pedestrians and in some cases cyclists, animal traffic, and horse riders, instead of vehicular traffic. Footbridges complement the landscape and can be used decoratively to visually link two distinct areas or to signal a transaction. In many developed countries, footbridges are both functional and can be beautiful works of art and sculpture. For poor rural communities in the developing world, a footbridge may be a community's only access to medical clinics, schools and markets, which would otherwise be unreachable when rivers are too high to cross. Simple suspension bridge designs have been developed to be sustainable and easily constructible in such rural areas using only local materials and labor. - A polymer (Greek \\"poly-\\", \\"many\\" + \\"-mer\\", \\"parts\\") is a large molecule, or macromolecule, composed of many repeated subunits. Because of their broad range of properties, both synthetic and natural polymers play an essential and ubiquitous role in everyday life. Polymers range from familiar synthetic plastics such as polystyrene to natural biopolymers such as DNA and proteins that are fundamental to biological structure and function. Polymers, both natural and synthetic, are created via polymerization of many small molecules, known as monomers. Their consequently large molecular mass relative to small molecule compounds produces unique physical properties, including toughness, viscoelasticity, and a tendency to form glasses and semicrystalline structures rather than crystals. - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries. - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - Kingsgate Bridge is a striking , modern reinforced concrete construction footbridge across the River Wear , in Durham , England . It is a Grade I listed building . It was personally designed in 1963 by Sir Ove Arup , connecting Bow Lane on the historic peninsula in the centre of Durham to Dunelm House on New Elvet ( to which building Arup 's studio also contributed ) , and opened in 1966 . Kingsgate Bridge is thought to have been one of Arup 's favourite designs of all , he having spent many hours working on every detail of the plans . Its construction was unusual . The two halves were each built parallel to the river , then rotated through 90 ° to make the crossing . The meeting point of the two halves is marked by a simple bronze expansion joint . In 1965 , the bridge was the winner of the Civic Trust Award . In 1993 , it won Certificate of Outstanding Performance ( Mature Structures Category ) of the Concrete Society . A bust of Arup , cast in resin , was installed on the side of Dunelm House , the students ' union building adjacent to the bridge , in September 2011 . The sculpture is a copy of a 1987 bust by Diana Brandenburger , held by the National Portrait Gallery . It is a replacement for a previous copy of the same bust , in bronze , which was unveiled by Karin Perry , Arup 's daughter , on 16 April 2003 , the 108th anniversary of Arup 's birth , but which was stolen from its plinth during the summer of 2006 . During a university RAG Week in the early 1960s students suspended a car beneath the bridge . In February 1998 , the Durham Union Society president , Tom Joyce , fell through the bridge , but caught himself and was uninjured . - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of .

Hypothesis: Asano Takumi no Kami was known for being a little violent with a short temper. Does the premise entail the hypothesis? pick from the following. [I] yes. [II] it is not possible to tell. [III] no.","completion":"[II] it is not possible to tell. The premise states that Asano Takumi no Kami attacked and wounded Kira, a court official, after being morally insulted. While this single event does show that Asano Takumi no Kami engaged in violent behavior, it does not provide enough information to support the hypothesis that he was known for being a little violent with a short temper. A single act of violence may not represent an individual's overall behavior or temperament. The event could have been an isolated case or the result of extreme circumstances. In order to conclude that Asano Takumi no Kami was known for having a short temper and being violent, it would be necessary to gather more information about his character, past actions, and how others perceived his temperament. Additionally, the premise describes Asano Takumi no Kami as a \\"young provincial baron,\\" making it possible that he was not widely known for any particular behavior or temperament at the time. Further exploration of his interactions with others in the provincial or court setting would be necessary to provide context for the hypothesis. In summary, based on the information provided in the premise, it is not possible to tell whether the hypothesis that Asano Takumi no Kami was known for being a little violent with a short temper is accurate.

Please answer the following question: - The consumer throws aluminum cans and foil into a recycle bin - The aluminum is collected - Taken to a treatment plant - The aluminum is sorted and cleaned ready for reprocessing - The aluminum is re-melted - Turned into molten aluminum - The aluminum is made into large blocks called ingots - The ingots are sent to mills to be rolled out What might be the last step of the process? A:","completion":"A: The last step of the process after the ingots have been rolled out might involve transforming the aluminum sheets or coils into finished products for various industries. This step generally involves the following sub-steps: 1. Transportation to factories: Once the ingots have been rolled out into sheets or coils at the mills, they are transported to various manufacturing facilities or factories where they will be transformed into a wide range of finished aluminum products. This transportation may be done via trucks, trains, or even ships, depending on the distance and location of the factories. 2. Further processing: At the factories or manufacturing facilities, the aluminum sheets or coils are further processed according to industry-specific requirements. This may involve cutting, stamping, bending, extruding, or shaping the aluminum material into the desired forms, such as automotive parts, construction materials, electronics, packaging, household items, and various other consumer goods. 3. Surface finishing: Depending on the end use or application, the aluminum products may require surface finishing processes for better aesthetics, durability, or protection. This may include polishing, anodizing, painting, or powder coating, which adds a thin layer of a specialized coating to the aluminum surface for enhanced aesthetics and functionality. 4. Assembly and installation: Once the aluminum products have been formed and finished, they might need to be assembled with other components or installed as part of a larger system. For example, aluminum window frames may be assembled with glass panes and hardware before being installed in a construction project, or aluminum car components may be assembled as part of an automobile's overall structure. 5. Quality control and inspection: To ensure product quality and adherence to industry standards, the finished aluminum products often go through a series of quality control checks and inspections. This may involve visual inspection, measuring, or testing the products based on various criteria such as strength, durability, and performance. 6. Packaging and shipping: Finally, the finished aluminum products are packaged and prepared for shipping to their end users or destinations, which could be local or international retailers, distributors, or directly to consumers. This step may involve wrapping, boxing, palletizing, or otherwise securing the products for safe transit and storage. In summary, the last step in the aluminum recycling process consists of transforming the aluminum sheets or coils into a wide range of finished products for various industries. The process involves further processing, surface finishing, assembly, and installation, followed by quality control, packaging, and shipping to ensure the production and delivery of high-quality aluminum products to their end users."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Input: Passage: In the 11th century and the 12th century, the princes and their retinues, which were a mixture of Slavic and Scandinavian elites, dominated the society of Kievan Rus'. Leading soldiers and officials received income and land from the princes in return for their political and military services. Kievan society lacked the class institutions and autonomous towns that were typical of Western European feudalism. Nevertheless, urban merchants, artisans and labourers sometimes exercised political influence through a city assembly, the veche (council), which included all the adult males in the population. In some cases, the veche either made agreements with their rulers or expelled them and invited others to take their place. At the bottom of society was a stratum of slaves. More important was a class of tribute-paying peasants, who owed labour duty to the princes. The widespread personal serfdom characteristic of Western Europe did not exist in Kievan Rus'.

On May 19, 1927, after waiting for a week for the rain to stop on Long Island, New York, pilot Charles A. \\"Slim\\" Lindbergh tries to sleep in a hotel near Roosevelt Field, before his transatlantic flight from New York to Paris. His friend Frank Mahoney guards his hotel room door from reporters. Unable to sleep, Lindbergh reminisces about his time as an airmail pilot. Flying to Chicago in winter, \\"Slim\\" lands his old de Havilland biplane at a small airfield to refuel. Despite bad weather, he takes off, unaware that heavy snow has closed the Chicago landing field. Lindbergh bails out in a storm after running out of fuel. Recovering mail from his crashed DH-4, he continues to Chicago by train. A salesman tells him two airmen just died competing for the Orteig Prize for the first nonstop flight from New York City to Paris. Lindbergh calls Columbia Aircraft Corporation in New York from a small diner at the Lambert-St. Louis Flying Field. Quoted a price of 15,000 (220,000 today) for a Bellanca high-wing monoplane, \\"Slim\\" lobbies St. Louis financiers with a plan to fly the Atlantic in 40 hours in a stripped-down, single-engine aircraft. The backers are excited by Lindbergh's vision and dub the venture Spirit of St. Louis. When the Bellanca deal falls apart because Columbia insists on selecting the pilot, Lindbergh approaches Ryan Aeronautical Company, a small manufacturer in San Diego, California. Frank Mahoney, the company's owner and president, promises to build a suitable monoplane in just 90 days. With Ryan's chief engineer Donald Hall, a design takes shape. To decrease weight, \\"Slim\\" refuses to install a radio or other heavy equipment, even a parachute, and plans to navigate by \\"dead reckoning\\".

A family member of one of the students, Alexander Mora, confirmed that the remains identified were his. The relative said the family had received the information from a team of forensic experts. The students were allegedly seized by local police in the town of Iguala in September and given to a criminal gang. Prosecutors say the gang killed them and burned their bodies at a rubbish dump near the town of Cocula before scattered their ashes in a river. The students' disappearance has triggered widespread protests across Mexico against corruption and violence. Another demonstration was held on Saturday in Mexico City at which parents of students spoke about the identification. \\"If [the government] thinks that, because one of our boys' DNA was identified, we will sit and cry, we want to tell them that they're wrong,\\" Felipe de la Cruz, father of a missing student, told the crowd. \\"We will keep fighting until we find the other 42.\\" The unrest has seen President Enrique Pena Nieto's popularity rating drop to its lowest point since he took office two years ago. In response, he has submitted a package of reforms to Congress that include replacing all 1,800 municipal police forces with state-level units. The students had travelled from a teacher training college in Ayotzinapa to Iguala to protest against what they said were discriminatory employment practices for teachers which favour urban students over rural ones. Police opened fire on the students, who were in buses travelling back from Iguala to their college. Three of them were killed and three more people in nearby vehicles also died. A busload of the students tried to flee but were chased by municipal officers who then took them to the local police station. Some of the officers, who have since been arrested, told investigators they then handed the students over to a drug gang called Guerreros Unidos (United Warriors). Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca and his wife, Maria de los Angeles Pineda were arrested in the beginning of November in Mexico City. Mexican officials accused Mr Abarca of ordering police to confront the students to prevent them from disrupting a public speech given by his wife. More than 70 other people have been arrested in connection with the disappearances.

NY Giants return to Super Bowl for rematch of 2008 game vs. New England Patriots after Lawrence Tynes nails game-winning 31-yard FG to beat 49ers Yeah, Mann! Eli and the NY Giants are heading to Indy for a Super Bowl rematch with the New England Patriots. NY GIANTS 20 SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS 17, OT SAN FRANCISCO - Lawrence Tynes came running off the field after another overtime field goal, his index finger high in the misty air and pointing straight to another Super Bowl. It all seemed so deliriously familiar to the erupting Giants on the sideline, who once again await the New England Patriots after a 20-17 overtime victory on Sunday night to advance to Super Bowl XLVI. Even Tom Coughlin admitted resisting comparisons to the Giants’ Super Bowl victory four years ago over the Pats is now futile, and there’s no avoiding comparisons to the Giants’ glorious past. These Giants, once on the brink of a “historical” collapse, are now on the verge of history. PHOTOS: GIANTS MAKE SUPER BOWL XLVI, SET UP REMATCH WITH PATRIOTS “It is kind of eerie,” said defensive end Justin Tuck. “We tried to downplay it all along, but I’d be lying to you if I said it didn’t feel like 2007.” “It’s pretty similar,” added Giants co-owner John Mara. “Let’s hope it stays that way.” They’ll have a chance to make sure it does on Feb. 5 in Indianapolis when the Giants (12-7) face the AFC champion Patriots in a rematch of Super Bowl XLII — one of the greatest Super Bowls in history. And just like they did four years ago, they set that up that showdown with an overtime field goal by Tynes on the road. This one was from 31 yards, 7:06 into the extra session, on the slick field at Candlestick Park. It came at the end of what Coughlin called “a classic football game that seemed like no one was going to put themselves in position to win.” Until somebody did. That somebody was rookie linebacker Jacquian Williams, who reached out and stripped the ball from 49ers punt returner Kyle Williams, who was filling in for the injured Ted Ginn, and immediately put the Giants inside Tynes’ range. Kyle Williams had already muffed a punt in the fourth quarter, setting up the Giants’ go-ahead touchdown. Then he did it again in overtime when Devin Thomas, who also recovered the previous muffed punt, recovered at the 49ers 24. Five plays later, holder Steve Weatherford dug out Zak DeOssie’s low snap and Tynes kicked it through the San Francisco mist. “I blacked out, so I don’t remember anything,” Weatherford said. “But I do remember that ball going through the pipes.” That kick was the culmination of a brutal game that was exactly the “bloodbath” that Chris Canty predicted it would be. It began on a wet field in a driving rain that caused early trouble for both offenses. Eli Manning eventually found his groove, completing 32 of 58 passes for 316 yards and two touchdowns, while getting credit for his sixth fourth-quarter comeback of the year. It was 49ers quarterback Alex Smith who struck first, on a 73-yard touchdown in the first quarter to tight end Vernon Davis who flew right by Giants safety Antrel Rolle. The Giants, riding the hot hand of Victor Cruz (10 catches, 142 yards) answered when a six-yard touchdown pass to tight end Bear Pascoe, and even had a 10-7 halftime lead when Tynes hit a 31-yard field goal at the end of the first half. In the second half, the 49ers seemed to be in control after Smith (12 for 26, 196 yards) again hit Davis (3-112-2), this time for a 28-yard touchdown late in the third. But then Kyle Williams made his first mistake, letting the ball bounce off his knee when he was trying to avoid a punt. Thomas recovered that one, too, giving the Giants the ball at the 49ers 29. That set up Manning’s 17-yard touchdown pass to Mario Manningham with 8:34 left in regulation, which at the time looked like it might turn out to be the game-winning score. But David Akers hit a 25-yard field goal with 5:39 remaining and the game ended up in overtime. From there, both defenses turned up their games. The Giants’ offense even stalled twice in overtime. Manning couldn’t get anything going against the 49ers’ fierce pass rush. “(I was) just trying to be patient, that’s kind of what I kept telling myself,” he said. “Don’t give them anything. Don’t force anything. Guys never quit. They kept fighting, kept battling, no matter what the circumstances were. I think everyone knew we were going to get a chance to win this football game. Something was going to happen.” Something did with 9:32 remaining when Jacquian Williams forced the fumble that set up Tynes’ kick, and just like that, 2007 was happening all over again. The Giants, once again the “Road Warriors” were on their way back to the Super Bowl, against the team they beat in such classic fashion in Glendale, Ariz. in Feb., 2008. “I tried to fight it,” Coughlin said. “I’m sitting in there and Osi (Umenyiora) is just smiling at me, saying ‘Do you realize how this is coming down?’ It’s scary.” “It’s amazing,” Tynes added. “I had dreams about this last night.” For the second time in five seasons, those dreams incredibly came true.

A child learns to walk by practicing until he no longer has to think about how to put one foot in front of the other. An excellent sportsman practices until he can play quickly, correctly and without thinking. Educators call it \\"automaticity \\". www.ks5u.com A child learns to read by sounding out the letters and finding the meaning of the words. With practice, he stumbles less and less, reading by the phrase . With automaticity, he doesn't have to think about the meaning of words, so he can give all his attention to the meaning of the text. It can begin as early as first grade. In a recent study of children in Illinois schools, Alan Rossman of Northwestern University found that automatic readers in the first grade not only read almost three times as fast as the others, but also got better results in exams. According to Rossman, the key to automaticity is the amount of time a child spends reading , not his IQ. Any child who spends at least 3.5 to 4 hours a week reading books, magazines or newspapers will probably reach automaticity. It can happen if a child turns off TV just one night for reading at home. You can test yourself by reading something new which is suitable for your level. If you read aloud with expression, with a sense of the meaning of the sentences, you probably are an automatic reader. If you read brokenly, one word at a time, without expression or meaning, you need more practice. Question: Rossman tells that any child who_will possibly be an automatic reader.

As time goes by, it becomes less and less, so what are we going to do when it runs out? Perhaps we will go back to using horses, carriages and bicycles. In the Second World War, some people didn't use gas made from petroleum in their cars. They made gas from wood and plants instead. The car didn't go fast, but they ran, so this was better than nothing. However, in the future, we can't cut down all our trees to make gas; we need our trees for other things, too. Besides different types of gas, we can also use electricity to run our cars, but first we must make the electricity! Some countries have coal and they make electricity with that, but we might not always have coal, either. Other countries have big, strong rivers, and they can use the power of water to turn turbines and make electricity more easily and cheaply. We are also able to get power from the ocean tides. We put turbines into the mouth of the river. Then the tide comes in, the water turns the turbines and then it goes out, it turns them again.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write highlights for this article: By. Daniel Bates. Hillary Clinton had a rare moment of bonding with Vladimir Putin over his passion for saving Siberian tigers, she writes in her new memoir published today. The former US Secretary of State said that she was able to get the Russian President to shed his tough guy image by appealing to the animal lover inside of him. He took her to his private office and gave her a lengthy lecture and even invited her husband Bill to tag polar bears in the wilderness with him. Anecdotes: Clinton (at a book signing today) shared the stories of the world leaders she met during her time as Secretary of State. Clinton also inspired Putin to reveal a never-before-heard anecdote about how his mother was mistaken for a dead body and nearly taken away for burial when she was really just sick and unconscious. She talks about both episodes in her book, ‘Hard Choices’, which was released today after being highly anticipated in Washington. The memoir and barrage of interviews Clinton has given is being seen as the first step in her potential run for the Presidency in 2016. Hard Choices covers the major events of her time as Secretary of State between 2009 and 2013 including the Arab Spring, the attack on the US embassy in Benghazi and attempts to find peace in the Middle East. But it also includes offbeat anecdotes about relations between US and Russia, which were ‘reset’ by President Obama in 2009 but fell apart by Russia’s use of energy as a tool of foreign policy and its annexation of Crimea earlier this year. She writes that overall Putin proved to be ‘thin-skinned and autocratic, resenting criticism and eventually cracking down on dissent and debate’. But in meeting at his dacha, or holiday home, outside Moscow the two had a rare moment of solidarity. Clinton knew that one of his passions was wildlife conservation so asked him out of the blue: ‘Tell me what you are doing to save the tigers in Siberia’. Clinton writes: ‘He looked up in surprise. Now I had his attention’. Putin led her down a long corridor to his private office, past dozing guards to a huge map of Russia when he launched into an ‘animated discourse’ in English about the fate of tigers, polar bears and other endangered species. Putin even invited Clinton’s husband Bill to tag polar bears in the countryside in a few weeks time, but in the end the trip did not happen. Cuddly: Hillary Clinton revealed that Putin warmed when she inquired about his conservation efforts - particularly his work to save Siberian tigers. He invited husband Bill on a polar bear-tagging trip. Another moment happened in September 2012 at Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting he hosted in the Russian city of Vladivostok. Clinton mentions she had been to a memorial in the city to the Nazi’s siege between 1941 and 1944 and it ‘struck a chord’ with Putin. He reeled off a story she had never heard before and surprised Russian history experts she consulted afterwards. Clinton writes: ‘During the war Putin’s father came home from the front lines for a short break. ‘When he approached the apartment where he lived with his wife, he saw a pile bodies stacked in the street and men loading them into a waiting flatbed truck. ‘As he drew nearer, he saw a woman’s legs wearing shoes that he recognised as his wife’s. He ran up and demanded his wife’s body. ‘After an argument the man gave in, and Putin’s father took his in his arms and, after examining her, realised she was still alive. ‘He carried her up to their apartment and nursed her back to health. Eight years later, in 1952, their son Vladimir was born’. Relations between Clinton and Putin have taken a very different direction since. He branded her 'weak' and said that it is 'better not to argue with women' last week. Putin was responding to Clinton's comments that he was behaving like Adolf Hitler by sending Russian troops into Eastern Ukraine. In 2010 thousands of secret diplomatic cables sent by the US were published by Wikileaks, revealing embarrassing details of what they really thought about world leaders. Clinton writes that it was a ‘long Thanksgiving holiday’ during which time she made dozens of phone calls to apologise. Clinton also had face to face meetings with some leaders, including Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who she spoke to at a meeting of the Organisation for Cooperation and Development in Kazakhstan. In the cables American diplomats accused him of having a ‘penchant for partying hard meant that he never got sufficient rest’. He is also branded ‘feckless, vain, and ineffective as a modern European leader.’ A wounded Berlusconi, who had suffered his own public indignities over his notorious ‘Bunga Bunga’ parties, told Clinton: ‘Why are you saying these things about me? ‘America has no better friend, you know me, I know your family’. At his request Clinton made a speech in front of TV cameras about the importance of relations between the two countries to smooth things over. Shock: Clinton said that Putin surprised her with the grisly tale of how his sick mother was nearly mistaken as being dead eight years before he was born. She writes: ‘No one wished these words had stayed secret more than I did’. Clinton spent two thousand hours on board her Boeing 757 whilst travelling the globe as part of her job, the equivalent of 87 full days. She describes how the air stewardesses used to buy local foods wherever they went such as smoked salmon from Ireland, but the ‘Air Force’s famous turkey taco sandwich’ was always a favourite. On the long flights the journalists, staff and crew on board amused themselves by celebrating birthdays that took place mid-trip and watching weepy romantic comedies. They also never grew tired of the yellow pyjamas worn by Richard Holbrooke, the former special advisor on Pakistan and Afghanistan, Clinton writes. On one occasion they were watching Breach, a 2007 historical drama about an FBI agent who spied for the Russians in the 1980s and 90s. At one point the main character, played by Robert Hanssen, sparked a wave of laughter when he said: ‘Can’t trust a woman in a pantsuit. Men wear the pants. The world doesn’t need any more Hillary Clintons’. Elsewhere Clinton says that when she was on the road she was warned to leave her Blackberry on her plane and take the battery out to stop it being compromised. She had to put up an opaque tent inside her hotel room to stop hidden cameras from recording what she was reading. Where it was not possible to put up the tent she had to improvise by putting a blanket over her head and reading by torchlight.","completion":"In her new memoir, Hillary Clinton writes about a rare moment of bonding with Vladimir Putin over their shared passion for saving Siberian tigers.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: During the 1999 Russian Presidential elections, the two leading candidates are Igor Komarov, a former Colonel of the KGB, and Nikolai Nikolayev, a retired General of the Russian Army. When a car bomb explodes outside one of Komarov's pharmaceutical companies, and a virus is stolen from inside, an investigation by the FSB ensues headed by FSB agents Sonia Astrova and Andrei Kasanov. Their investigation is obstructed by the Director of the FSB, Anatoly Grishin. A British Embassy worker from Moscow, Sir Nigel Irvine, tracks down Jason Monk, a former CIA operative, who ran double agents in the Soviet Union and convinces him to investigate the incident. Once in Moscow, Jason finds an old friend, Viktor Akopov, who agrees to hide Jason from Komarov's men. Viktor steals a residue sample of the bomb used and his scientist friend Tonkin tells him that the explosive used, Semtex H, has a direct traceable link to the FSB. Tonkin is soon killed by Vladimir Dorganosov, the man who attacked Komarov industries and stole the bioweapon. Sonia and Andrei locate Leonid Zaitzev, a cleaner who worked at the Komarov Industries plant and saw Dorganosov steal the virus. As they question him, Grishin appears, arrests Zaitzev and fires Sonia and Andrei. Zaitzev is later killed by Dorganosov while in custody. Sonia goes home to find Jason waiting for her, and agrees to help him access the FSB network. However, they are shot at by Dorganosov, and a car chase ensues. They go to Andrei's house where they find him already dead. After the chase, Dorganosov demands the rest of his payment from his contractor, who is revealed to be Anatoly Grishin. While they are arguing, Komarov himself arrives and orders Grishin to kill Dorganosov. answer the following question: What is the former rank of the candidate who isn't involved in the incident?

Fish cannot walk because they have \\"no legs.\\" Here's a step-by-step justification for choosing this answer: 1. Start by reviewing each given option and eliminate irrelevant answers: - \\"they're stupid\\" - Intelligence is not related to the ability to walk or move. - \\"scales\\" - Scales are the protective covering on a fish's body and have no direct relation to walking. - \\"gills\\" - Gills are used for respiration, allowing fish to extract oxygen from the water. They have no direct relation to walking. - \\"bones\\" - Certain fish have bones, but bones themselves do not account for the inability to walk. 2. Consider the relevant option, \\"no legs\\": - Fish, by their very nature, do not have legs. Instead, they rely on fins to navigate their underwater environment. Legs are primarily required for walking on land, and since fish lack this feature, they cannot walk. 3. Summarizing the findings: Based on the process of elimination, fish are unable to walk due to their lack of legs. Fish movement relies on fins that are designed for underwater navigation."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Article: The sunlight will irritate the treated area and possibly make the discomfort and redness worse. The easiest way to prevent this is to not expose the treated area to direct sunlight. If you go outside, make sure you cover the area with clothing. If you had your face treated, wear a hat to provide sun protection. Artificial UV sources—such as tanning booths—should also be avoided until the skin has completely healed and all discomfort, swelling, and redness has disappeared. Direct sun exposure should be avoided for a minimum of two weeks after the laser treatment, but some health care providers recommend avoiding the sun for 6 weeks. Use a sunscreen with a SPF of at least 30. Make sure you reapply the sunblock often, especially if you get the skin wet or sweat profusely. Laser treatment works by using heat to destroy the hair follicles; exposing the treated area to additional heat can increase the skin irritation. Hot water, saunas, and steam rooms should all be skipped for a minimum of 48 hours after the treatment. You can bathe the treated area; however, you should stick to cool or warm water to help the area heal as quickly as possible. Raising the body's temperature through exercise can also irritate the treated area. Wait at least 48 hours before strenuously exercising. Milder exercise, such as walking, is okay.

While the information you found does correctly state that the Northern Cardinal is primarily granivorous and also feeds on insects and fruit, it does not give the scientific name. The scientific name of the Northern Cardinal is Cardinalis cardinalis. Scientific names are assigned to living organisms following a binomial system, in which they are identified by two Latin-based names: the generic name (genus) and the specific name (species), which are always italicized. In the case of the Northern Cardinal, the genus is \\"Cardinalis,\\" and the species name is \\"cardinalis.\\" It is important to note that there are a few different species of cardinal birds. The Northern Cardinal is the most well-known species and is commonly found in North America. They are easily identifiable with their prominent red plumage and crested head, though only the males exhibit the striking red color, while females are mostly grayish-brown with subtle red highlights. Other species of cardinal birds include the Vermilion Cardinal (Cardinalis phoeniceus) found in Colombia and Venezuela, the Desert Cardinal (Cardinalis sinuatus) found in the southwestern parts of the United States and Mexico, and the Yellow Cardinal (Gubernatrix cristata) found in South America.

Write an article based on this \\"Sadiq Khan, now Mayor of London, moved fast to condemn Ken Livingstone at the end of last month for his remarks about Hitler and Israel.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Sadiq Khan's Swift Condemnation of Ken Livingstone's Controversial Remarks London's new mayor, Sadiq Khan, did not waste any time addressing the remarks made by former London mayor Ken Livingstone about Adolf Hitler and Israel in late April. Khan made sure to distance himself and his administration from Livingstone's contentious views, displaying his commitment to creating a positive and inclusive environment in the United Kingdom's capital. This article will analyze the context of the incident and the potential impact on London's civic environment. Step 1: Provide Context for the Incident At the end of last month, Ken Livingstone, who served as Mayor of London from 2000 to 2008, made controversial remarks during a radio interview. Livingstone claimed that Adolf Hitler \\"supported Zionism before he went mad and killed six million Jews.\\" This statement sparked widespread backlash, with many accusing him of anti-Semitism and historical inaccuracy. Step 2: Highlight Sadiq Khan's Response Sadiq Khan, who assumed the role of Mayor on May 7, 2016, promptly condemned Livingstone's comments. \\"Ken's comments were not only offensive and historically inaccurate, but they also risked undermining the unity we've worked so hard to build in our city,\\" Khan said in a statement. By distancing himself from his predecessor's remarks, Khan demonstrated a strong commitment to promoting tolerance and multiculturalism in London. Step 3: Discuss the Importance of Khan's Response Khan's decision to speak out so quickly against Livingstone's statement is of utmost significance, given the recent rise of hate crimes in London. It is essential for London's mayor to stand up against hate speech and promote a city where everyone feels welcome, regardless of their ethnic or religious background. Khan's condemnations also emphasize that anti-Semitism, or any forms of discrimination, will not be tolerated in London. Step 4: Analyze the Potential Impact on London's Civic Environment Sadiq Khan's swift response to Ken Livingstone's remarks may contribute positively to London’s civic environment. It sends a strong message that hateful and divisive speech has no place in the city's political discourse. Furthermore, Khan's clear denunciation of anti-Semitic statements promotes an atmosphere in which individuals from all backgrounds can come together and work towards a more unified and prosperous London. Step 5: Conclusion Sadiq Khan's swift condemnation of Ken Livingstone's controversial remarks demonstrates effective leadership and a commitment to fostering an inclusive, harmonious environment in London.

A West Tennessee nonprofit organization will use a 300,000 federal grant to hire an attorney and a Spanish-speaking paralegal to help provide legal assistance to domestic violence victims. The U.S. Department of Justice two-year grant will begin Oct. 1, which is the start of domestic violence awareness month. U.S. Rep. John Tanner announced Monday that the grant was awarded to West Tennessee Legal Services of Jackson. The organization provides legal assistance and advocacy in 17 counties. \\"This award will offer assistance as we look for whatever ways possible to stop domestic violence and help the women, men and children who are victims of abuse,\\" Tanner said in a news statement. The organization doesn't have a staff member who speaks Spanish and the need is increasing with growing Hispanic populations, said the organization's executive director Steven Xanthopoulos. He estimated the money will help handle at least another 180 cases next year. The group closes about 2,500 cases a year. The money was timed well because the legal group had recently lost about 120,000 in grant money due to a decrease in the poverty population in West Tennessee in Census 2000, Xanthopoulos said. \\"The drop in poverty is a good thing, but there is still a great need out there,\\" he said. \\"So this was a very good thing.\\" Having legal representation at divorce and child custody hearings is important in helping victims leave abusive and sometimes dangerous situations, said Margaret Cole, executive director of Wo/Men's Resource and Rape Assistance Program in Jackson.

Question: \\"What did Australia splitting from Antarctica do for the global temperatures?\\" Context: \\"During the Eocene (56 million years ago - 33.9 million years ago), the continents continued to drift toward their present positions. At the beginning of the period, Australia and Antarctica remained connected, and warm equatorial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters, distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high. But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 Ma, the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica, and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents. The Antarctic region cooled down, and the ocean surrounding Antarctica began to freeze, sending cold water and ice floes north, reinforcing the cooling. The present pattern of ice ages began about 40 million years ago.[citation needed]\\" Answer:","completion":"In order to answer the question, I will first summarize the context provided and then extract relevant information to provide a concise response. 1. During the Eocene epoch, Australia and Antarctica were connected, allowing warm equatorial currents to mix with colder Antarctic waters, thus keeping global temperatures high. 2. Around 45 million years ago, Australia split from Antarctica, causing the warm equatorial currents to be deflected away from Antarctica, and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents. 3. As a result, the Antarctic region cooled down, and the ocean surrounding it began to freeze, sending cold water and ice floes northwards, which reinforced the cooling effect. 4. The present pattern of ice ages began about 40 million years ago. Answer: Australia splitting from Antarctica around 45 million years ago led to a significant change in global temperatures. It caused the warm equatorial currents to be deflected away from Antarctica, resulting in the formation of an isolated cold water channel between the continents. This event contributed to the cooling of the Antarctic region and initiated the pattern of ice ages that began approximately 40 million years ago."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Manchu (Manchu: manjU; Mollendorff: manju; Abkai: manju; simplified Chinese: Man Zu ; traditional Chinese: Man Zu ; pinyin: Manzu; Wade-Giles: Man3-tsu2) are an ethnic minority in China and the people from whom Manchuria derives its name. They are sometimes called \\"red-tasseled Manchus\\", a reference to the ornamentation on traditional Manchu hats. The Later Jin (1616-1636), and Qing dynasty (1636-1912) were established by Manchus, who are descended from the Jurchen people who earlier established the Jin dynasty (1115-1234) in China. Manchus form the largest branch of the Tungusic peoples and are distributed throughout China, forming the fourth largest ethnic group in the country. The early phase of Manchu clothing succeeded from Jurchen tradition. White was the dominating color. To facilitate convenience during archery, the robe is the most common article of clothing for the Manchu people. Over the robe, a surcoat is usually worn, derived from the military uniform of Eight Banners army. During the Kangxi period, the surcoat gained popularity among commoners. The modern Chinese suits, the Cheongsam and Tangzhuang, are derived from the Manchu robe and surcoat which are commonly considered as \\"Chinese elements\\". Wearing hats is also a part of traditional Manchu culture, and Manchu people wear hats in all ages and seasons in contrast to the Han Chinese culture of \\"Starting to wear hats at 20 year-old\\" (Er Shi Shi Guan ), . Manchu hats are either formal or casual, formal hats being made in two different styles, straw for spring and summer, and fur for fall and winter. Casual hats are more commonly known as \\"Mandarin hats\\" in English. Manchus have many distinctive traditional accessories. Women traditionally wear three earrings on each ear, a tradition that is maintained by many older Manchu women. Males also traditionally wear piercings, but they tend to only have one earring in their youth and do not continue to wear it as adults. The Manchu people also have traditional jewelry which evokes their past as hunters. The fergetun (fergetUn), a thumb ring traditionally made out of reindeer bone, was worn to protect the thumbs of archers. After the establishment of the Qing dynasty in 1644, the fergetun gradually became simply a form of jewelry, with the most valuable ones made in jade and ivory.

There are some people who can calculate the day of the week for any given date in 40,000 years, but who cannot add two plus two. Others can perform complex classical piano pieces after hearing them once, but they cannot read or write. Dr. J. Langdon Down first described this condition in 1887. He called these people idiot savants. An idiot savant is a person who has significant mental injury, such as in autism or retardation. At the same time, the person also exhibits some extraordinary skills, which are unusual for most people. The skills of the savant may vary from being exceptionally gifted in music or in mathematics, or having a photographic memory. One of the first descriptions of a human who could calculate quickly was written in 1789 by Dr. Benjamin Rush, an American doctor. His patient, Thomas Fuller, was brought to Virginia as a slave in 1724. It took Thomas only 90 seconds to work out that a man who has lived 70 years, 17 days, and 12 hours has lived 2,210,500,800 seconds. Despite this ability, he died in 1790 without ever learning to read or write. Another idiot savant slave became famous as a pianist in the 1860s. Blind Tom had a vocabulary of only 100 words, but he played 5,000 musical pieces beautifully. In the excellent movie Rain Man, made in 1988 and available on video cassette, Dustin Hoffman plays an idiot savant who amazes his brother played by Tom Cruise, with his ability to perform complex calculations very rapidly. Today we more clearly recognize that the idiot savant is special because of brain impairment. Yet not all brain injury leads to savant skills. Some studies have shown that people who have purposeful interruption of the left side of the brain can develop idiot savant skills. However few people wish to participate in such experiments. There are many excellent reasons for not undergoing unnecessary experimentation on one's brain. The term idiot savant is outdated and inappropriate. Virtually all savants have a high degree of intelligence and are thus not idiots. Answer the following questions: 1. What are idiot savants? 2. What type of skills? 3. Anything else? 4. And? 5.

Please write a short summary for the following article: California plant recalls 1 million pounds of pistachio products WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A California food processing plant is voluntarily recalling up to 1 million pounds of roasted pistachio products that may have been contaminated with salmonella, the Food and Drug Administration announced Monday. Salmonella strains were found last week during routine test by Kraft Foods, one company that purchased the nuts. The nuts came from Setton Farms in Terra Bella, California, about 75 miles south of Fresno. They were largely distributed in 2,000-pound containers to food wholesalers who would then package them for resale or incorporate them as ingredients in other products, such as ice cream and trail mix. No illnesses have been linked to this case, said Dr. David Acheson, FDA's associate commissioner. But salmonella strains were found last week during routine test by Kraft Foods, one of about three dozen companies that purchase pistachios from Setton Farms, he said. Kraft notified the FDA on March 24. Setton Farms did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment. Acheson emphasized that unlike the recent case of salmonella-tainted peanut butter, this recall was not prompted by an sickness outbreak, saying the decision was a \\"proactive\\" move. He said the FDA has received two recent complaints, from the East and West coasts, from people who say they became ill after eating pistachio products, but a link to Setton Farms has not been confirmed, he said. The FDA is advising consumers not to eat any pistachio products, but not to throw them out, either, because additional recalls are likely and having products that could be turned in would allow for easier tracing of contamination. The agency is setting up a Web site to update the public. Dr. Jeff Farrar, head of the California health department's food and drug division, said it's likely that the roasted pistachios will be found in a wide variety of products. He noted that Setton Farms is the second-largest pistachio processor in the nation. Raw pistachios are roasted to a temperature that should kill salmonella, Acheson said. Because the roasted products tested positive for salmonella suggest cross-contamination with raw products. Acheson added that the Setton Farms recall is related to the one announced Friday by Kroger, a grocery store chain with stores in 31 states. Kroger recalled Private Selection shelled pistachios from its retail stores because of possible salmonella contamination. Kroger, in a statement Friday, said no illnesses have been reported in connection with the product. In February, Kroger was among retailers that recalled peanut products tied to the Peanut Corporation of America, a Virginia-based company accused by the FDA of knowingly selling peanut butter and peanut paste that was contaminated with salmonella. PCA's peanut processing plant in Blakely, Georgia, is being investigated in connection with a salmonella outbreak that has sickened more than 500 people and has been linked to eight deaths.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose main sculptor was Thomas Nicholls? from the following article ? Burges inspired considerable loyalty within his team of assistants, and his partnerships were long-lived. John Starling Chapple was the office manager, joining Burges's practice in 1859. It was Chapple, designer of most of the furniture for Castell Coch, who completed its restoration after Burges's death. Second to Chapple was William Frame, who acted as clerk of works. Horatio Walter Lonsdale was Burges's chief artist, contributing extensive murals for both Castell Coch and Cardiff Castle. His main sculptor was Thomas Nicholls who started with Burges at Cork, completing hundreds of figures for Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral, worked with him on his two major churches in Yorkshire, and undertook all of the original carving for the Animal Wall at Cardiff.William Gualbert Saunders joined the Buckingham Street team in 1865 and worked with Burges on the development of the design and techniques of stained-glass manufacture, producing much of the best glass for Saint Fin Barre's. Ceccardo Egidio Fucigna was another long-time collaborator who sculpted the Madonna and Child above the drawbridge at Castell Coch, the figure of St John over the mantelpiece in Lord Bute's bedroom at Cardiff Castle and the bronze Madonna in the roof garden. Lastly, there was Axel Haig, a Swedish-born illustrator, who prepared many of the watercolour perspectives with which Burges entranced his clients. Crook calls them \\"a group of talented men, moulded in their master's image, art-architects and medievalists to a man – jokers and jesters too – devoted above all to art rather than to business.\\" Answer:","completion":"The name of the person whose main sculptor was Thomas Nicholls is William Burges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (July 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The film's premise is that there is another way to heaven than adherence to the practices of the Roman Catholic Church. A secular Sin Eater can remove all taint of sin, no matter how foul, from the soul just before death. The purified soul can then ascend into heaven. The Roman Catholic Church, according to the film, considers this heresy. Heath Ledger plays an unhappy and disillusioned priest, Alex Bernier, a member of a fictitious religious order The Carolingians which specializes in fighting demons and other hell spawn. Father Dominic, the head of the Carolingians, has died in Rome under suspicious circumstances and Alex leaves the United States to investigate. In Rome, Alex visits the morgue and sees strange markings on Dominic's corpse. After some investigation, he comes across a book that explains the markings as being the sign of a Sin Eater's work. He heads to the Vatican, where an official tells him that Sin Eaters don't exist and that Dominic may not be buried on sacred ground because he had been excommunicated for his beliefs. Alex, moving ever farther from his vocation, defies his superiors and secretly reads a holy service over the body and buries Dominic in the Carolingian cemetery (the service takes place off screen but is referred to later). Thomas Garrett, another Carolingian (there seem to have only been a total of three including Dominic), arrives in Rome to help investigate Dominic's death. Early in the film we meet Mara Williams, an artist Alex once exorcised, who has escaped from a mental hospital and come to Alex at his church in the USA because she has a feeling that something terrible is going to happen to him. The police come looking for her, but Alex lies and denies that he's seen her and through this exchange we learn that Mara was in the hospital because she had tried...

A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the location of the structure that was built for Marquess of Annandale?, using the article: Despite William Bruce's fall from political favour, and his intermittent imprisonment, he continued to practice. During the 1690s he completed Hill of Tarvit (1696), Craighall (1697–99) in Fife, and Craigiehall (1699) near Edinburgh. The latter, built for the Marquess of Annandale, still stands, and is used as the British Army's Scottish headquarters. From 1698 he was working on a new house for the young Charles Hope, later first Earl of Hopetoun. Hopetoun House, near Edinburgh, was completed in 1702, and represents Bruce's grandest country house design. The master mason was again Thomas Bauchop, and the inspiration was again Anglo-Dutch, with French rustication. The bulk of Bruce's work is now obscured by 18th-century remodelling, carried out by William Adam. Bruce was commissioned again by Hopetoun in 1708, to build a private aisle at Abercorn Kirk. The Hopetoun Loft overlooks the interior of the kirk, and connects to a retiring room with an oval \\"squint\\" giving a view of the pulpit.In 1702 Bruce was commissioned by the burgesses of Stirling to design a new tolbooth for the town. Bruce provided only sketch plans, which were executed by local masons between 1703 and 1705. Bruce's last country houses were Harden House (now known as Mertoun House), built for the Scotts in the Borders, and his smallest house, Auchendinny in Midlothian. His final work, in around 1710, was for Nairne House, for the Jacobite Lord Nairne. The house was not completed until two years after Bruce's death, and the extent of his involvement is unclear. Nairne House was demolished in 1760, although the cupola was retained and installed on the roof of the King James VI Hospital in nearby Perth., what would be the answer ?

But a major study published in two thousand and nine found that this fear is not the same around the world. It differs from culture to culture. People in Finland were the least likely to believe that people laughing in their presence were making fun of them. Less than ten percent of Finns in the study said they would think that, compared to eighty percent of people in Thailand. Some people in the study said they felt unsure of themselves in social situations but hid their feelings of insecurity. Others said they avoided social situations where they had been laughed at before. The study found that people in Turkmenistan and Cambodia were more likely to be in the first group. They would hide their feelings of insecurity if they were around other people's laughter.

The Libertines are an English rock band, formed in London in 1997 by frontmen Carl Barat (vocals/guitar) and Pete Doherty (vocals/guitar). The band, centered on the songwriting partnership of Barat and Doherty, has also included John Hassall (bass) and Gary Powell (drums) for most of its recording career. The band was part of the garage rock revival and spearheaded the movement in the UK. The band gained some notoriety in the early 2000s. Doherty and Barat remained out of contact for several months after the Libertines had ended, due to Doherty's spiralling drug abuse. Members of the band reunited several times on stage through the years to play Libertines songs, but talks of a reunion remained tepid as Doherty and Barat concentrated on their respective bands Babyshambles and Dirty Pretty Things. A retrospective collection Time for Heroes - The Best of The Libertines was released in 2007. It wouldn't be until 2010, when it was announced on 29 March, that the Libertines were to reform for the Reading and Leeds Festivals in 2010. They were special guests to headliners Arcade Fire on Friday 27 August at Bramham Park, Leeds and Saturday 28 August at Little John's Farm, Reading. Following the announcement, the band held a press conference on 31 March 2010 to discuss their reformation at the Boogaloo pub. The press conference then turned into an impromptu \\"guerilla gig\\" with the band playing many of their old tunes. The Reading and Leeds festival appearances were preluded by 2 nights at the HMV Forum. A 300-strong rehearsal gig for friends, family and some members of the musical press on Tuesday 24 August 2010 and a sold-out fans-only show on Wednesday 25 August. Doherty promised the Libertines' special guest performance at Reading and Leeds Festivals would be to be remembered. The performance at the festival received very positive reviews from both fans and the press. After the gigs at the Reading and Leeds festival, it remained unclear as to what the Libertines would do next as both Carl Barat and Pete Doherty were embarking on solo tours. There were hints of more Libertines gigs in the future which both Barat and Doherty confirming they have received offers for gigs at some point in 2011. However, an interview with Carl Barat in May 2011 for NME magazine suggested the band did not have any current plans for future activities together. In 2012, for the 2012 NME Awards, Barat stated, \\"I'm sure we'll do Libertines or something at some point.\\" However, the Libertines still have no plans to reunite. In the same interview, Barat said that for the majority of 2012 he will be focusing on acting, making the possibility of a reunion unlikely, at least for this year.

Please answer the following question: Moving can either be out of necessity or an act of desire. Whatever the case, moving rarely comes at a convenient time and involves so many variables that it is difficult to exhale until all of the documents are signed. Even then, that point in the process instantaneously starts a whole new chapter in the book of moving. No matter how long it takes to sell (or not sell) your previous home, whether you’re able to find your dream kitchen or settle for less, if you’re moving down the street, across the country, or around the world, the act of moving can be completely overwhelming. Long story short: Moving is a process. In the midst of all the uncertainties, there are a few ways to stay organized while moving. This short list is meant to guide you through steps to keep you on track during a stressful time. The largest piece of advice I can give you is to start by decluttering your current living space. Having less to deal with will help you feel more in control of the situation. Finding a realtor that you trust and feel comfortable working with will put your mind at ease (most of the time) about the process of listing your house and finding a buyer. Let your realtor do the work for you so you can concentrate on keeping your home “show ready” and begin to look at options on the other side of the move, like where you’ll be working, spending your time, and researching schools or neighborhoods. Make a list of people you’ll need to update contact information with once you leave. This should include any and all businesses you frequent or subscribe to, like pest control services, lawn maintenance, even all of your neighborhood loyal buyer programs you participate in. Do not overlook your banks, investment companies, retirement funds, healthcare providers for you and your family members, and even you pets. And, of course, family and friends.

Headquarters in New York, September 27, 2012. Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu draws a red line on a graphic of a bomb as he addresses the 67th United Nations General Assembly at the U.N. Headquarters in New York, September 27, 2012. UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu drew his \\"red line\\" for Iran's nuclear program on Thursday despite a U.S. refusal to set an ultimatum, saying Tehran will be on the brink of a nuclear weapon in less than a year. By citing a time frame in an address to the U.N. General Assembly, Netanyahu - who has clashed with President Barack Obama over the urgency of military action against Iran - appeared to suggest no Israeli attack was imminent before the November 6 U.S. presidential election. Holding up a cartoon-like drawing of a bomb with a fuse, Netanyahu literally drew a red line just below a label reading \\"final stage\\" to a bomb, in which Iran was 90 percent along the path of having sufficient weapons-grade material. Experts put that at the point that Iran has amassed enough uranium, purified to a level of 20 percent, that could quickly be enriched further and be used to produce an atomic bomb. Netanyahu told the United Nations he believes that faced with a clear red line, Iran will back down in a crisis that has sent jitters across the region and in financial markets. \\"And this will give more time for sanctions and diplomacy to convince Iran to dismantle its nuclear weapons program altogether,\\" he added. Netanyahu's remarks were the closest he or any top Israeli official has come to publicly laying out precisely which Iranian actions could trigger an Israeli military strike on Tehran's nuclear infrastructure. But by referring to a spring or summer 2013 time frame for Iran to complete the next stage of uranium enrichment, the Israeli leader also seemed to dispel, at least for now, fears that Israel might strike Iran before the U.S. presidential election, 40 days away. Netanyahu's remarks also seemed to deliver a two-part message to the Obama White House - along with Iran's leaders, his most important audience - signaling that the hawkish prime minister wanted an end to the all-too-public war of words with Washington over Iran's suspected nuclear ambitions. But they also showed that he was not backing down an inch on his insistence that much harsher warnings must be delivered to Tehran. \\"NEXT SPRING OR SUMMER\\" In his speech, Netanyahu never explicitly said that if Iran crossed his red line, Israel would launch attacks against the Iranian nuclear facilities, but he did seem to imply such a threat. \\"At this late hour, there is only one way to peacefully prevent Iran from getting atomic bombs. That's by placing a clear red line on Iran's nuclear program,\\" Netanyahu said. Iran, Netanyahu said, was well into what he defined as the second stage of enrichment - 20 percent purification - and predicted it would complete it by \\"next spring, at most by next summer, at current enrichment rates.\\" According to an August report by the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran has stockpiled 91.4 kg (201.5 pounds) of the 20 percent material. Some experts say Iran would need 200 to 250 kg (440 to 550 pounds) of such material for a weapon. Other experts suggest less might do it. Iran could potentially reach that threshold soon by producing roughly 15 kg (33 pounds) a month, a rate that could be speeded up if it activates new enrichment centrifuges. According to the U.N. nuclear watchdog, around 25 kg (55.1 pounds) of uranium enriched to a 90 percent purity level would be needed for a single nuclear weapon. In his own speech to the General Assembly on Tuesday, Obama said the United States will \\"do what we must\\" to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and that time is not unlimited for diplomacy to resolve the issue. Obama set no ultimatum or clear \\"red line\\" of his own, despite public urging from Netanyahu over the past several weeks that has aggravated strains between the two leaders. \\"CHART A PATH FORWARD\\" Seeking re-election, Obama has faced criticism from Republican challenger Mitt Romney that the president is being too tough with Israel and not tough enough with Iran. \\"I very much appreciate the president's position, as does everyone in my country. We share the goal of stopping Iran's nuclear weapons program,\\" Netanyahu said. \\"Israel is in discussions with the United States over this issue, and I am confident we can chart a path forward together,\\" he said. He spoke a day after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad addressed the General Assembly. Ahmadinejad said on Monday he did not take seriously the threat that Israel could launch a military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. He also said Israel has no roots in the Middle East and would be \\"eliminated.\\" [ID:nL1E8KO5BL] Netanyahu was due to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton later in the day. White House spokesman Jay Carney said he expected Obama to have a follow-up phone call with Netanyahu, probably on Friday. Obama has drawn criticism from Republicans for opting not to meet Netanyahu or other foreign leaders on the sidelines of the General Assembly and focus instead on campaigning for re-election. ISRAELIS WARY Netanyahu has faced opposition within his cabinet and from former Israeli security chiefs to any go-it-alone attack on Iran. Opinion polls show that Israelis are wary of any such strike by their military, whose capability of destroying underground Iranian facilities is limited. Israel, believed to have the Middle East's only atomic arsenal, sees a nuclear-armed Iran as a threat to its existence and has expressed frustration over the failure of diplomacy and sanctions to rein in Tehran's nuclear activity. Iran says it is enriching uranium only for peaceful energy and medical purposes, not for nuclear bombs. Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association, said Iran's uranium enrichment program is improving. \\"By sometime next year, Iran could potentially amass enough 20 percent enriched material that could - if Iran decides to expel inspectors and convert the material to weapons grade - provide enough nuclear material for one bomb,\\" Kimball said. \\"But enough material for one bomb doesn't constitute an effective, deliverable nuclear arsenal.\\" (Additional reporting by Michelle Nichols, Arshad Mohammed and Louis Charbonneau; Editing by Will Dunham and Eric Walsh) ||||| This time last year Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas was a hero to his people as he waved an application for statehood recognition from the podium of the United Nations General Assembly. The gambit was met with a standing ovation and cheers by an audience of ambassadors and world leaders, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remained seated and stone-faced. Abbas will deliver a different kind of speech tomorrow when he returns to the UN dais. “Last year cost them a lot,” said Hussein Ibish of the American Task Force on Palestine, a nonpartisan group based in Washington that advocates a peaceful two-state solution with Israel. In hindsight, he said, it was “not the wisest course of action.” “Presumably, after having endured a very predictable failure, they will have learned the diplomatic lesson,” he said in a telephone interview. While the 77-year-old Abbas had succeeded in grabbing attention for his cause, a year later that victory rings hollow. The Palestinians are no closer to achieving statehood -- either in terms of territory or UN recognition -- and the Israeli- Palestinian peace process is moribund, with any diplomatic urgency superseded by war in Syria and the possibility Israel may preemptively strike Iran’s nuclear facilities. ‘The End’ “The Palestinian people thought that the Abbas speech last year was the beginning, but I am afraid a year later it seems that it’s the end,” said Hani Al Masri, a Ramallah-based political analyst. This time, rather than pursuing a doomed path to recognition as a full “member state” that the U.S. would veto in the Security Council, Abbas has lowered expectations. He is seeking a limited upgrade from observer “entity” to “non- member state” in the 193-member General Assembly, where no nation holds veto power. That, too, is opposed by U.S. and Israel, which say any issue of statehood can be resolved only through negotiations. “A year later, Abbas is going to the GA with something he he could have done last year, ” Masri said in an interview. “He is applying for non-member state, but with no vote due to the pressures made by the U.S.” While becoming a non-member state may open the door for the Palestinian Authority to sign treaties such as the Rome Statute that set up the International Criminal Court, it would alienate the U.S., the UN’s biggest financial contributor and a key aid donor to the Palestinians. Aid Needs When the Palestinian Authority was accepted last year into the UN cultural agency Unesco, best known for its designation of “world heritage” sites, the U.S. response was to cut off funding that provides almost a quarter of the agency’s budget. The U.S. has said that American law would require similar cutoffs for any UN agency that grants the Palestinians the same status as member states. Irritating the U.S. may be risky given the need for U.S. aid, according to two Palestinian officials speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter. The Palestinians receive about 550 million a year in aid from Washington, according to the Congressional Research Service. Any new Palestinian Authority initiative at the UN will probably wait until after the U.S. elections in November, the diplomats said. “The PA cannot afford another fight with their donor,” Ibish said. After last year’s historic UN speech, throngs of Palestinians welcomed Abbas home to the West Bank city of Ramallah with waving flags, holding up posters of him. Riding the wave of popular enthusiasm at the time for the Arab uprisings, the Palestinian leader had promised something similar. ‘Palestinian Spring’ “We have told the world that there is the Arab Spring, but the Palestinian Spring is here,” he told a chanting crowd of supporters on Sept. 25, 2011. “A popular spring, a populist spring, a spring of peaceful struggle that will reach its goal.” That promise didn’t come to pass, and today the streets in West Bank cities are often crowded with protesters amid worsening economic conditions, including higher fuel prices and delayed payments for public employees. After average economic growth of 9 percent from 2008 to 2010, real growth in the West Bank declined to 5 percent in 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, as unemployment rose to 19 percent in the first half of this year from 16 percent a year earlier, according to the International Monetary Fund. The economic slowdown in the West Bank “poses a major challenge” to continued Palestinian Authority financial and institutional stability, according to an Israeli government report this month. Cash Crisis The global economic slump has aggravated a cash crisis as donors, including the U.S. and Arab nations, haven’t followed through on funding pledges. Outside aid finances the bulk of the Palestinian Authority’s 4 billion budget, half of which goes toward paying the salaries of about 150,000 workers. The total budget deficit is 1.5 billion. Even with 1.1 billion in donor support promised, that leaves a hole of almost 400 million, Palestinian finance minister Nabeel Kassis told donors at a Sept. 23 meeting in New York. The International Monetary Fund warned in a Sept. 23 report that the Palestinian economy is facing “serious risks” and urged the government to pursue a contingency plan to cover its “financing gap.” Reviving Diplomacy Though the campaign to become the 194th member of the world body was always a long shot, Abbas gambled it would at least revive diplomacy and perhaps even force Israeli concessions, such as reviving a freeze on construction in Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Instead, the likelihood of a two-state solution with Israel has further dimmed, and a win by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney would make the prospect still more remote. The former Massachusetts governor told campaign donors that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is going to “remain an unsolved problem” and that the Palestinians are uninterested in peace. Romney made the comments at a closed fundraiser in May, and they became public when a video of the event was posted Sept 18 by Mother Jones magazine. Even so, it would be a mistake to write off Abbas, said Robert Danin, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. The Palestinian leader has raised the stakes, and the option of taking the issue to the General Assembly can be a potent tool, he said in an interview. “The threat may be more powerful than the act,” he said. “But it does give Abbas enhanced leverage to push for active American engagement on the Palestinian front after the November elections.” -- With assistance from Fadwa Hodali in Ramallah and Alisa Odenheimer in Jerusalem.

FILE - In this Wednesday, Sept. 19, 2012 file photo, a visitor looks at portraits of Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during the exhibition \\"faces of... (Associated Press) The report surfaced after Israel's foreign minister predicted that Iran's leaders would face an Arab Spring-style popular revolt within the next year _ an argument that further counters Netanyahu's charge that an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities may be the only answer to what he calls a fanatic and intransigent Iranian leadership. Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but Israel, the United States and other Western countries reject that assertion. The U.N. has already slapped four rounds of economic sanctions on the Islamic Republic, but Netanyahu has repeatedly cast doubt on the effectiveness of those measures, arguing that they have crippled Iran's economy but have not convinced Tehran to halt its nuclear program. Netanyahu has instead placed emphasis on urging the U.S. to draw \\"red lines\\" which would make clear which conditions would provoke an American strike on Iran's nuclear facilities _ a demand that Washington has rejected. When Netanyahu addresses the U.N. General Assembly Thursday, he is expected to reiterate his contention that the sanctions are not working _ a claim that could be deflected by the findings in the new report, which came from the Israeli Foreign Ministry. According to the report, details of which appeared in the Haaretz newspaper, Iran's oil exports declined by over 50 percent in the past year _ from 2.4 million barrels a day to 1 million _ and oil revenues dropped by 40 billion since the beginning of the year. An Israeli official confirmed the report but refused to elaborate on it. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss internal government documents. The report also claims that sanctions on Iran's central bank have made it difficult for the regime to access its foreign currency reserves, causing a 100 percent gap between the country's official exchange rate and where the rial is trading on the black market. Bread, meat and electricity prices have also soared because of the sanctions, the report finds. Israel's Foreign Ministry, Haaretz reports, based its findings on data it received from countries that have embassies in Iran. ___ Follow Daniel Estrin at http://www.twitter.com/danielestrin ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"In 2012, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke at the United Nations General Assembly, presenting a literal \\"red line\\" for Iran's nuclear program and stating that Tehran will be on the brink of a nuclear weapon in less than a year. He argued that with a clear red line, Iran would back down, allowing more time for sanctions and diplomacy to convince Iran to dismantle its nuclear weapons program.

Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S. Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs the highest level playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans.

Add some useful descriptive terms. Identify names for family members. Name some common animals in Tagalog. Count from 1-10 in Tagalog. Article:","completion":"Learning a new language can be a daunting yet enriching experience, as it opens the doors for cultural exploration, travel, and personal development. For this journey, the destination may be Tagalog: the national language of the Philippines! Tagalog is not only widely spoken in the Philippines, but also by many Filipino communities around the world. The ensuing article will provide some guidance on how to take your first steps towards becoming a proficient Tagalog speaker. The most basic items in our conversational toolkit are, of course, common greetings. In Tagalog, 'good morning' translates to \\"Magandang Umaga\\", 'good afternoon' to \\"Magandang Hapon\\", and 'good evening' becomes \\"Magandang Gabi\\". Say hello with an enthusiastic \\"Kamusta?\\" or \\"Hello?\\" If asked, \\"Kamusta ka?\\", meaning 'how are you', the proper response would be \\"Mabuti naman, salamat\\", effectively meaning 'I'm good, thank you.' Speaking of 'Thank you', gratitude is expressed as \\"Salamat\\", while 'You’re welcome' is \\"Walang anuman\\". Other key terms include affirmations and negations. For the former \\"Oo\\" means 'Yes', and for the latter \\"Hindi\\" means 'No'. Simple, yet essential words such as these often form the backbone of any language-learning journey. As you continue to develop your Tagalog conversational skills, it's important to practice other common phrases. For example, asking \\"Ano ang pangalan mo?\\" is 'What is your name?', and answering \\"Ang pangalan ko ay...\\" is 'My name is...'. Don't forget an important phrase to ask for help: \\"Tulungan mo ako\\", translates to 'Help me'. Understanding the names for various food items will come in handy for any Tagalog speaker, especially while traveling in the Philippines or dining at a Filipino restaurant. \\"Kanin\\" refers to 'rice', a staple within Filipino cuisine. Meanwhile, \\"Manok\\" is 'chicken', \\"Baboy\\" is 'pork', \\"Isda\\" is 'fish', and \\"Gulay\\" is 'vegetables'. Other helpful food phrases include \\"Gutom ako\\" (I am hungry), \\"Busog ako\\" (I am full), or \\"Masarap\\" (It’s delicious). Adding descriptive terms to your vocabulary is another useful strategy. Get acquainted with \\"Maganda\\" (beautiful), \\"Malaki\\" (big), \\"Maliit\\" (small), \\"Mabait\\" (kind), \\"Masama\\" (bad) amongst others. Each word will enable you to express various sentiments, observations, or descriptions more effectively. Another step in this linguistic endeavour is naming family members. \\"Ina\\" indicates 'mother', \\"Ama\\" is 'father', \\"Kapatid\\" is 'sibling', \\"Anak\\" is 'child', and \\"Lolo\\" and \\"Lola\\" indicate 'grandfather' and 'grandmother' respectively. Whether you’re at a local zoo or simply fond of animals, learning how to identify some common animals in Tagalog is also essential. \\"Aso\\" is a dog, \\"Pusa\\" is a cat, \\"Ibon\\" is a bird, \\"Baka\\" is a cow, \\"Kabayo\\" is a horse and \\"Isda\\" is a fish. Lastly, to wrap up our first foray into Tagalog, learning to count from 1-10 is vital. The numbers are: one (isa), two (dalawa), three (tatlo), four (apat), five (lima), six (anim), seven (pito), eight (walo), nine (siyam), and ten (sampu). Mastering the basics of Tagalog, as with any language, is a journey that requires time, patience, and practice. Begin with common phrases, then slowly expand to include food items, descriptors, names of family members, animals, and even numbers. Before long, you'll find yourself navigating the new language with an impressive degree of confidence and fluency.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Process: - Air enters the lungs through bronchial tubes - Air enters bronchioles - Bronchioles have tiny air sacs called alveoli - Alveoli surrounded by small blood vessels - Oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels - Vessels deliver oxygen to every cell in the body - Blood brings carbon dioxide back to lungs - Carbon dioxide released when you exhale. Question: suppose resting or sleeping happens, how will it affect less oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"When a person is resting or sleeping, their oxygen demand is generally lower than when they are active. This is because the body's metabolic processes slow down during rest, reducing the overall need for oxygen. As a result, the absorption of oxygen by the small blood vessels in the alveoli may be less compared to when a person is active. Regarding the second effect mentioned, which is the delivery of oxygen to every cell in the body, there will be a lessened effect but still sufficient to meet the body's requirement at rest. Since the body's demand for oxygen is lower during resting or sleeping, the reduction in oxygen absorption does not have a negative impact on the oxygen delivery to cells. Blood circulation continues to function efficiently, ensuring that oxygen is delivered to every cell in the body as needed, but at a decreased rate compared to when a person is active. In summary, during resting or sleeping, there is less oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels but the oxygen delivery to the body cells is still sufficient to meet their demands, and thus has a lessened effect on the second process mentioned."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bartley III tried to radicalise this idea and made the controversial claim that not only can criticism go beyond empirical knowledge, but that everything can be rationally criticised. What type of knowledge is not the only sphere of rational criticism, according to Popper's student W.W. Bartley III?","completion":"According to W.W. Bartley III, a student of the philosopher Karl Popper, the sphere of rational criticism is not solely confined to empirical or scientific knowledge. Bartley III expanded upon Popper's idea that rationality is not restricted to empirical theories and proposed that all knowledge, thoughts, or ideas can be exposed to rational examination and critique, regardless of their nature. Popper believed that the method of criticism is to seek and eliminate contradictions in knowledge, considering it a general method that applies to various spheres, such as empirical or scientific theories, metaphysical ideas, moral values, and even purposes. His view implied that rational discussion and debate about these diverse subjects are possible, since all knowledge can be criticized to address inconsistencies, strengthen arguments, and refine ideas. Bartley III, taking this idea further, made the controversial claim that rational criticism can be applied to everything, not merely empirical knowledge. He argued that all forms of knowledge can and should be evaluated through a critical lens, involving scrutiny, evaluation, and the elimination of inconsistencies. This encompasses not only scientific theories and empirical knowledge but also extends to other areas like ethics, metaphysics, aesthetics, religion, politics, and personal beliefs. In essence, W.W. Bartley III's stance on rational criticism asserts that no form of knowledge is exempt from critical assessment and examination, encouraging an open and resilient approach to understanding and refining ideas across all disciplines and subjects. This broader perspective promotes continuous scrutiny and learning, ultimately fostering the development of more coherent, robust, and reliable knowledge."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

My old roommate’s cats, Clise and Monkey, were about as different as cats could be. Clise, rescued as an emaciated kitten from a local park, grew up to be morbidly obese. His interests mainly involved eating food, begging for food, or going around the neighborhood scrounging for food. He could hear a can opener from a mile away. Monkey was a more active cat. He liked to chase the laser pointer and was the first to run to the door when someone arrived. But he could also be lazy, lounging in a sunbeam or stretched out on the couch. Both of them liked to watch TV. Soon after I moved in, I started having health issues which necessitated a lot of time lounging around myself. This was the era of reality TV, back when much of it was actually good. The cats, Monkey especially, watched with me. Monkey definitely had his preferences. His favorite shows were The Girls Next Door and Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Making The Team. Notice a theme here? Playboy Playmates and professional cheerleaders. Monkey liked his T & A (tits and ass). If one of these shows was on, and I turned it to Project Runway or something, Monkey would march off. But as soon as I turned it back, and he could hear the high-pitched giggling, he’d come running back. Clise’s favorite shows were Top Chef, Iron Chef, and Rachael Ray. Food porn. If there was something he especially craved, like a shrimp stir-fry, he’d assume a begging pose, right in front of the TV, as if Rachael might take pity on him and throw him a scrap or two. I moved out about a year later. A few months previous, Monkey ended up catching some wasting disease and dying, but Clise, as far as I know, is still there, begging for scraps from anyone he can — in real life or televised. Who liked watching TV? - The cats. - not enough information - Clise. - Monkey. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The cats, Clise and Monkey, liked watching TV."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. How might one describe the sentiment of this review? 20 Volume Salon & Spa has officially lost me as a client. Of course I will discourage anyone else from seeking their services for their hair. I have been to 20 volume probably 4 or 5 times and so I would say I am a fairly new costumer. As a natural redhead, I am rather particular about who I allow do my hair. Up until a few weeks ago, I only allowed Stacey, the manager and \\"master stylist\\" to cut my hair. But I recently decided I had wanted a change and that so we discussed dying my hair using either a balayage technique or all over color. I showed her some ideal pictures and so we decided on the balayage. The idea is similar to an ombre but a little less drastic and more natural looking. After spending nearly 3.5 hrs in the salon after having worked an entire night shift and 160.00 later, I was less than impressed. The blonde color was VERY subtle and consisted of about 3 inches on my ends whereas it should have comprised a greater portion of my hair. My initial reaction was that it was \\"just ok, whatever, I guess I like it.\\" Part of that reaction was because I spent the entire night working a 12 hour shift and I just wanted to get out of the salon. Also, my hair was of course curled so it was hard to actually see what was going on until I straightened it. The next day I spent trying to like my overpriced dye job that appeared dried out. The product seemed heavily applied in some areas and clearly not applied enough in other areas creating an amateur look. It's not at all what I would expect from someone who is considered a \\"master stylist.\\" To be honest, Stacy's personal style should have told me I should have opted for someone else. It's should always be a tell-tale sign, if your stylist's hair looks a hot mess, yours probably will too. What really frustrates me more than anything is not the overpriced product I was sold, but the poor customer service that resulted thereafter. I called expressing dissatisfaction with my hair a couple days later. I would have done it sooner but I worked 3 12 hr shifts immediately following my hair experience and clearly they aren't open the hours that I am awake. When I called 4 days after my botch job, Stacy had the day off and the next week off for that matter. I explained to Lindsey, the receptionist, that I was unhappy and wanted an allover color to be applied to achieve my natural color or something close to. I clarified several times that I wouldn't be charged again for services rendered and she reassured me that I wouldn't. I also asked for her name in case if there were any issues. A followup appointment was made for a week out since Stacey had time off and I patiently waited. When I arrived at my appointment, I explained to Stacey that I just didn't like my hair. I explained that the ends looked simply washed out and that I would just like an all over color to get rid of them. I chose a red that was brighter than my natural, but red fades, and I can't imagine one all over color costing more than another if the technique is the same. Stacy told me that she would have to charge me 75.00 to fix my hair as it was an entirely different style. I explained to her that I discussed this already with Lindsey who stated that I would absolutely not be charged and that she stated this on more than 1 occasion. She told me that Lindsey must not have understood as she documented that I wanted to come in for a couple more highlights. I told Stacy that it was obvious that Lindsey didn't understand and that I couldn't have been more explicit or clear what I wanted. Needless to say she wouldn't budge and suggested doing an all over color at my next visit in 6-8 weeks. I was rather appalled that as a business owner, she felt this was the answer to fixing what she messed up. I told her I would not be returning and that she can cancel my future appointment. Since I have a friend who is a stylist, I will be going to her in the future. Even she looked at my hair and stated she couldn't believe the horrible styling job I was sold. She stated \\"I thought something looked a little different but I thought it was just where your ends had faded.\\" NOT WORTH 160.00!","completion":"This review has a negative sentiment. The person is unhappy with the salon's services and how their hair turned out. They were also not satisfied with the customer service they received when they tried to fix the issue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The man in red leotard carried the barbel all the way up his head the crowd cheered. the athlete Answer:","completion":"(D). raised the barbel again and fell down. Explanation: The given passage presents a competition between two athletes, one in a blue leotard and the other in a red leotard. The athlete in the blue leotard fails to complete the task, while the athlete in the red leotard successfully raises the barbel, prompting the crowd to cheer. Since the athlete failed to complete the challenge, it would be most natural for them to attempt the task again. Therefore, option (D) is the most likely to follow. Options (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect for the following reasons: (A) is not a natural continuation of the story, because it merely rephrases the initial failure of the man in the blue leotard. (B) introduces a scenario which is out of context—an athlete hugging the crowd would generally not result in winning a competition. (C) contradicts the passage, because it states that the red-leotard athlete dropped the barbel, when in the passage it says they successfully carried it all the way up their head."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(1) The district Viñac is one of thirty-three districts of the province of Yauyos in the Peruvian region Lima . (2) District Viñac is one of thirty-three districts of the region Lima in Yauyos province in Peru . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"Before I answer, let me break down both sentences and analyze their structure. Sentence 1: - The district Viñac - is one of thirty-three districts - of the province of Yauyos - in the Peruvian region Lima. Sentence 2: - District Viñac - is one of thirty-three districts - of the region Lima - in Yauyos province - in Peru. Step 1: Identify the main subject in both sentences. In both sentences, the main subject is \\"district Viñac.\\" Step 2: Identify the main information being presented. In both sentences, the main information is that Viñac is one of thirty-three districts. Step 3: Identify the location descriptors. In Sentence 1, the descriptors are \\"the province of Yauyos\\" and \\"the Peruvian region Lima.\\" In Sentence 2, the descriptors are \\"the region Lima,\\" \\"Yauyos province,\\" and \\"in Peru.\\" Step 4: Compare the location descriptors.

Conclusion: These two sentences do mean the same thing. They both convey that Viñac is one of thirty-three districts in Yauyos province, which is in the Lima region of Peru. The difference between the two sentences is in their structure and the arrangement of the location descriptors, but the core information is the same in both."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Problem:Article: Howard Dill is a giant among giant pumpkin growers. He grew world champion pumpkins for four years running,from 1979 to 1982, and missed winning the fifth year by only 5 pounds. Today, his Dill Atlantic Giant seeds are sold worldwide to more than 50 seed companies. The pumpkins grown from his Dill Atlantic Giant seeds commonly weigh in at over 1,000 pounds. \\"I don't have any training in genetics ; it was all trial and error,\\" Dill says. He got his love of pumpkins from his father and has enjoyed growing them for years. Dill still grows giant pumpkins, but not for competition. In the fall, visitors come to enjoy the pumpkins on his 90-acre farm in Nova Scotia, Canada. He plants ten acres of pumpkins for Halloween and two acres of giant pumpkins. One of giant pumpkins was recently baked into 442 pumpkin pies and sold at 5 each for charity. It you want to try growing a giant pumpkin, Dill recommends starting with a soil test and then adding fertilizer as needed. Plant the giant pumpkin seed. A giant pumpkin can gain 15 to 20 pounds a day, so careful watering--every day or two--is necessary. You should wait about 130 days until the pumpkin matures and then you can harvest it. Dill's favorite pumpkin set the Guinness Book record in 1981. It weighted 493.5 pounds. \\"I've grown them larger since, but that one meant a lot,\\" he remembers. \\"I never would have imagined ten years ago that there would be a 1,000-pounder, but there are many of them now,\\" says Dill.

As the debt ceiling deadline draws. dangerously close, Barack Obama was spotted heading to church with his. family in Washington this morning. Perhaps. he was praying for a solution - or better a resolution - to the small. task of securing a multi-trillion-dollar deal that House Democrats and. Republicans can agree on before the Government defaults on August 2. If the President was feeling the strain of last week's gruelling debt meetings, he didn't show it. Looking resplendent in their Sunday Best the Obamas laughed and joked with each other as they made their way back to the White House after the service at St John's Church. Mr Obama also told reporters he would 'absolutely' be watching the women's soccer world cup final between USA and Japan today. While the First family gathered around the television White House and congressional aides were continuing discussions to find a solution for increasing the nation's borrowing authority while reducing long-term deficits, behind the scenes. This. comes after the failure to get a deal after five straight days of. meetings last week between Mr Obama and congressional leaders at the. White House. But there was hope today that congressional leaders still had time 'to get something big done' with Mr Obama. 'I. think that what is encouraging is that the leaders in Congress seem to. have all agreed that we can't push to a default,' White House budget. director Jack Lew said. Sunday best: The Obamas head home after attending a service at St John's Church in Washington, while Congress leaders worked behind the scenes to try and seal a debt deal. 'So I think that there are many conversations going on in order to make sure that doesn't happen.' The. government will exceed the current 14.3trillion debt ceiling in 16. days, after which it will be in default of its obligations. The. consequences could be far-reaching, with potentially higher interest. rates on mortgages and car loans, a halt in Social Security checks and. unsettled world financial markets. Talks have continued over the weekend and White House spokesman Dan Pfeiffer. said on Twitter that Mr Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and other White. House officials were discussing 'various options' with lawmakers. throughout the day yesterday. Meanwhile Republican House Speaker John Boehner is 'keeping the lines of. communication open,' his spokesman, Mike Steel told Bloomberg. 'Meetings have been. occurring.' Republicans have rejected any plan that contains tax increases. Lew said on NBC's Meet The Press that the president 'made clear he wants the largest deal possible.' Back to the White House: The President shakes hands with Reverend Luis Leon before he, First Lady Michelle and daughters Malia and Sasha head home. Not much to smile about: Mr Obama shares a joke with his wife who looks less than impressed, as the family walk out of the church gates. Stroll: Mrs Obama is seen with daughter Malia, left, while the President walks with the couple's other daughter Sasha after the service. 'He wants to do the most we can to. reduce the deficit,' Lew said. 'But he also said that if we can't get. the most done, then in addition to extending the debt we should do as. much as we can.' House Republicans are preparing to. vote this week on allowing an increase in the government's borrowing. limit through 2012 as long as Congress approves a balanced-budget. constitutional amendment. Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., called that. proof Republicans are willing to compromise and 'hardly a radical idea' but the Senate's No 2 Democrat, Dick Durbin of Illinois, said that bill. doesn't have the needed support in the Senate. 'This notion that we have to change the Constitution to do what we were elected to do is just plain wrong,' Durbin said. Lew also did not like the idea. In the background: The Obamas head back to the White House where talks between congressional leaders were thought to be ongoing throughout the weekend. 'What these ideas do is say let's. kick the can down the road so that others will deal with it,' he said. 'The challenge is for Washington now to do the job the American people. sent us here to do.' DeMint said the U.S. is on course for. a financial disaster and that lawmakers have 'to draw a line in the. sand now because a day of reckoning is going to come.' 'And the longer we put it off the bigger the problems are going to be for our country,' DeMint said. Holding the fort: Meanwhile White House Budget Director Jack Lew revealed there were 'many conversations' going on as the battle to secure a deal before August 2 carried on. However, if it comes down to it,. White House officials who say Congress won't let the U.S. default are. 'probably right on that,' DeMint said. Senators are working on a bipartisan. plan that would allow Mr Obama to raise the debt limit without a prior. vote by lawmakers. The talks focused on how to address long-term deficit. reduction in the proposal in hopes of satisfying House Republicans. 'Lines of communication remain open with all parties,' said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner. Mr Obama admitted that. compromise was needed in talks with Republicans to solve the. crisis, during his weekly radio and internet address yesterday. He said it would take 'shared sacrifice' for. Democrats and Republicans to come to an agreement. 'Let's be honest. Neither party in this town is blameless,' he said in. his broadcast to the nation. 'Both have talked this problem to death without. doing enough about it. That's what drives people nuts about Washington.' He attempted to reach out to the middle class in the address, repeating his. call for higher taxes on the wealthy and reforms to politically popular. entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. 'We are all. part of the same country. We are all in this together,' he said. But Republicans renewed their call for an amendment to require a balanced budget. 'The only reason this administration doesn't want a constitutional. amendment is because they want to keep spending the American people's. money,' Senator Orrin Hatch said in the Republican response. 'And the only. reason congressional Democrats would refuse to pass it, is because they. know the people of this country would rise up and quickly ratify it.' In his weekly broadcast Mr Obama continued to insist that it was necessary to remove some tax breaks. 'Simply. put, it will take a balanced approach, shared sacrifice, and a. willingness to make unpopular choices on all our parts,' he said. 'That. means spending less on domestic programmes,' the President said. 'It. means spending less on defence programmes. ... And it means taking on. the tax code, and cutting out certain tax breaks and deductions for the. wealthiest Americans.' 'The truth is, you can't solve our deficit without cutting spending,' Mr Obama said. 'But. you also can't solve it without asking the wealthiest Americans to pay. their fair share - or without taking on loopholes that give special. interests and big corporations tax breaks that middle-class Americans. don't get.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"This article from 2011 talks about a time when the United States government was trying to figure out what to do about the money it owes, called the \\"debt ceiling.\\" The debt ceiling is a limit on how much money the government can borrow. Back then, the government was close to reaching that limit, and they needed to find a solution before August 2 to avoid not being able to pay the money they owed. President Barack Obama and other politicians were working together to try and find a solution. They had many meetings, but it was tough because each group had different ideas about what to do. While they were working on this important problem, President Obama and his family went to church one Sunday morning. They appeared happy and relaxed, even though there was a lot of work to do. The president also mentioned that he would be watching a women's soccer game later that day. In the meantime, people who work in the White House and other important leaders kept talking and trying to find a solution to the debt ceiling problem. There were different ideas, but they all agreed that they needed to find a way to fix it so that the government didn't get into more trouble. The article explained that if the government didn't find a solution, it could cause problems like higher costs for people borrowing money for things like houses and cars, as well as possibly stopping important payments like Social Security checks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \\"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others. We had a good match with Solti and he with us.\\" Peck's colleague, the violinist Victor Aitay said, \\"Usually conductors are relaxed at rehearsals and tense at the concerts. Solti is the reverse.

Given the below context: On 7 May 1896, Sir Humphrey Francis de Trafford put the 1,183-acre (4,790,000 m2) estate up for auction, but it failed to reach its reported reserve price of £300,000 (£34.1 million as of 2019). There was much public debate, before and after the abortive sale, as to whether Manchester Corporation ought to buy Trafford Park, but the corporation could not agree terms quickly enough, and so on 23 June Ernest Terah Hooley became the new owner of Trafford Park, for the sum of £360,000 (£40.9 million as of 2019).On 17 August, Hooley formed Trafford Park Estates Ltd, transferring his ownership of the park to the new company – of which he was the chairman and a significant shareholder – at a substantial profit. The initial plans for the estate included a racetrack, exclusive housing and a cycle works, along with the development of the ship canal frontage for \\"all types of trade including timber\\". By that time the ship canal had been open for two years, but the predicted traffic had yet to materialise. Hooley met with Marshall Stevens, the general manager of the Ship Canal Company, and both men recognised the benefit that the industrial development of Trafford Park could offer to the ship canal, and the ship canal to the estate. In January 1897 Stevens became the managing director of Trafford Park Estates. He remained with the company, latterly as its joint chairman and managing director, until 1930. The company initially chose not to construct buildings for letting, and instead leased land for development. But by the end of June 1897 less than one per cent of the park had been leased, and so the park's existing assets were put to use until more tenants could be found. Trafford Hall was opened as a hotel in 1899, to serve prospective industrialists considering a move to the park, along with their key employees. It had 40 bedrooms, available to \\"Gentlemen only\\".

In 1951, with secret means of communications established, Wolters sent his first letter to Speer in five years. He suggested that Speer move ahead with his memoirs. In January 1953, Speer began work on his draft memoirs, and over the next year lengthy missives, sometimes written on tobacco wrappings or candy wrappers but most often on toilet paper, made their way to Wolters' office in Coesfeld. Marion Riesser, who had continued as Wolters' secretary as he began private architectural practice, transcribed these notes into as many as forty closely typed pages per missive, and the draft totalled 1,100 pages. Wolters objected that Speer called Hitler a criminal in the draft, and Speer presciently observed that he would likely lose a good many friends were the memoirs ever to be published. Wolters had come to believe that reports of Nazi genocide were exaggerated by a factor of at least ten, that Hitler had not been given credit for the things he did right and that Germany had been harshly treated by the Allies.In the mid-1950s, Wolters quarrelled with Kempf who effectively dropped out of the network for a number of years, adding to the burden on Wolters and Riesser. While Speer's pleas for his former associate and his former secretary to work together eventually brought about a healing of the breach, this was to some degree superficial as Kempf was aware that Wolters, even then, disagreed with Speer's opinions. Wolters questioned Speer's readiness to accept responsibility for the Nazi regime's excesses and did not believe Speer had anything to apologise for, though the strength of his feelings on this point was kept from Speer—but not from Kempf and Riesser.Wolters was tireless in his efforts on behalf of Speer and his family to such an extent that his son, Fritz, later expressed feelings of neglect.

They both have high levels of cholesterol. Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, while Andy didn't go to the doctor because he was careless. Which friend took a drug that changed the levels of HMG-CoA reductase? Answer:","completion":"Ben, one of the two old friends who were both found to have high levels of cholesterol, took a drug that changed the levels of HMG-CoA reductase. This is because Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication by a doctor to help manage his elevated cholesterol levels. HMG-CoA reductase, or 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, is a key enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis in the liver. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) to mevalonate, which is a crucial step in the production of cholesterol. Therefore, drugs that target HMG-CoA reductase are designed to reduce cholesterol production and, consequently, lower the overall blood cholesterol levels. Cholesterol-lowering medications, known as statins, work by inhibiting the activity of HMG-CoA reductase. These drugs are particularly common in the management of high cholesterol. They help prevent the buildup of cholesterol in the arteries, reduce the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes, and also offer other health benefits. Since Ben's doctor prescribed him cholesterol medication, it is highly likely that he took a statin drug to manage his high cholesterol levels. Statins, acting as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, change the levels of this enzyme, thereby decreasing the production of cholesterol in the liver. In contrast, Andy did not go to the doctor to address his high cholesterol levels due to his carelessness. In the absence of medical intervention, it is unlikely that Andy took any drugs to alter his HMG-CoA reductase levels, leaving his cholesterol levels unmanaged and posing a greater risk to his cardiovascular health in the long term. In conclusion, it is Ben, the friend who was prescribed cholesterol medication, who took a drug that changed the levels of HMG-CoA reductase. This pharmacological intervention would assist him in better managing his high cholesterol levels and reducing the associated risks, while Andy's negligence in seeking medical attention left his cholesterol levels unaddressed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: Cellular Movie plot: The film opens with Jessica Martin, a high school biology teacher, talking to her son Ricky, while escorting him to the school bus. After she returns home, mysterious assailants enter her home through the back door, kill her house maid, kidnap her and confine her in the attic of their safe house. Ethan, the gang leader, smashes the only telephone in the attic to prevent her from contacting anyone. She has no idea who the kidnappers are or what they want. She pieces together the broken phone to randomly make a connection. She finally reaches the cell phone of Ryan who has just been dumped by his girlfriend for being too irresponsible. He takes it as a joke, but Jessica persuades him to go to the police. At the police station, Officer Mooney tells him to go to the detectives on the fourth floor. He begins to lose the signal in the stairwell, and must turn back to avoid losing the connection.Meanwhile, Ethan returns to the safehouse and asks Jessica about something she doesn't know. When Jessica tells him that she doesn't know, he tells her that he is going to get her son. Ryan, who overhears them, realizes how serious the kidnapping situation is. After Ethan leaves, she tells Ryan to get to her son's school before they do. Unfortunately, he is too late and her son, Ricky, is kidnapped and he quickly chases them by stealing a car owned by a school security officer. Because his cell phone's battery is dying, he drives to a shop for a charger. After being repeatedly redirected from counter to counter, he uses a gun from the security vehicle to hold up the store at gun-point to obtain the device.Sgt. Mooney, meanwhile, decides to check on the kidnapping claim that he received. He uses the Department of Motor Vehicles records to find the address of Jessica, but when he comes to her house, a woman meets him, telling him that she is Jessica and that everything is fine.

I have been wanting to try this place out ever since I saw activity for a long time in the building next the Flower Shop and Rentertainment.

Therefore, this is a better group or solo place, not good for a date (especially if you have a tendency to be distracted by basketball games). The service must of had an off-night because our beer was delayed and they gave us the wrong salad dressing. The server was courteous and apologized for the problems. It must have been exception because everyone else seemed to have better service. The food: I tried the new york, hand tossed pepperoni pizza and the house salad with italian dressing; both orders came promptly. I was not too wild about the salad because it was nothing special (lettuce, tomato, cheese, carrot, etc.). The best part of the pizza here was the crust and everything else could have been better. The sauce was quite sweet (it is not my kind of thing) and the cheese was sub-par. I still think Antonio's and Dell's and Rosati's are superior but I would go here over any of the pizza chains. Keep in mind I did not try the deep dish or thin crust so someone else will have to fill us in. Also, there are other sauce options too. Overall, I had an okay experience but I truly have experienced better.

Review: This film is \\"riveting\\" but in much the same way a car crash is riveting. It's hard to look away. Overall, this film is nothing more than an incredibly irresponsible social experiment--and a futile, biased experiment at that. The filmmakers are manipulative and seem to have no problems going for the lowest possible denominator. The manner in which the money is presented to Ted is pure exploitation. The intervening steps that the filmmakers force Ted to participate in (meeting with so-called experts) were empty and devoid of any substantive attempt to connect with Ted. Instead, it's painfully obvious that they serve to cover the filmmaker's posteriors and to further exploit Ted's situation. The worst part is that the filmmakers stop following Ted after 6 months; and seemingly are cut off entirely from the subject they had followed so closely months before. If they had cared, they would have found better \\"experts\\" to help Ted. If they truly wanted to see what Ted would do, then they should have let him spend the money without any intervention. This film is at best a high-brow Jackass stunt and not a documentary. It's sad to think how much 100,000 could have actually changed a homeless person's life had it been put in the right hands.

After hearing this news, he convinced his wife, Charlotte, to get checked out. After running several tests, the doctors determined Charlotte has no cancer, but she does have high blood pressure. Relieved at this news, Jason was now focused on battling his cancer and fighting as hard as he could to survive. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who has more abnormal cells in their body? Hint: Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably.

(CNN) -- A Florida judge's ruling Wednesday will allow a foreign-born high school basketball player who was ruled ineligible and his team to compete in the playoffs, even though they could ultimately be stripped of any title they win. Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Spencer Eig temporarily barred the Florida High School Athletic Association from disqualifying Brian Delancy, who was born in the Bahamas, and Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School from the district playoffs, which begin Thursday. Delancy \\"is very happy and relieved and he feels happy for his teammates,\\" said attorney David Baron, who helped represent the athlete, 19, and two other players. The board of the athletic association, which said Krop did not file proper paperwork on Delancy's eligibility and immigration status, on Tuesday ruled he was ineligible and that the top-ranked team must forfeit the 19 games it won when the senior guard played. Eig did not rule on Delancy's eligibility, but granted a temporary injunction to allow Krop to play until a full slate of hearings and appeals can take place within the athletic association, Roger Dearing, the association's executive director, said it was too late to appeal Eig's ruling and Krop will compete. But, he said, the ruling is not the end of the matter. Dearing said the association will hear new appeals after the tournament, likely in April.

Q:Given the following context: The opening soprano solo in E major, \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" is one of the few numbers in the oratorio that has remained unrevised from its original form. Its simple unison violin accompaniment and its consoling rhythms apparently brought tears to Burney's eyes. It is followed by a quiet chorus that leads to the bass's declamation in D major: \\"Behold, I tell you a mystery\\", then the long aria \\"The trumpet shall sound\\", marked pomposo ma non-allegro (\\"dignified but not fast\\"). Handel originally wrote this in da capo form, but shortened it to dal segno, probably before the first performance. The extended, characteristic trumpet tune that precedes and accompanies the voice is the only significant instrumental solo in the entire oratorio. Handel's awkward, repeated stressing of the fourth syllable of \\"incorruptible\\" may have been the source of the 18th-century poet William Shenstone's comment that he \\"could observe some parts in Messiah wherein Handel's judgements failed him; where the music was not equal, or was even opposite, to what the words required\\". After a brief solo recitative, the alto is joined by the tenor for the only duet in Handel's final version of the music, \\"O death, where is thy sting?\\" The melody is adapted from Handel's 1722 cantata Se tu non-lasci amore, and is in Luckett's view the most successful of the Italian borrowings. The duet runs straight into the chorus \\"But thanks be to God\\".The reflective soprano solo \\"If God be for us\\" (originally written for alto) quotes Luther's chorale Aus tiefer Not. It ushers in the D major choral finale: \\"Worthy is the Lamb\\", leading to the apocalyptic \\"Amen\\" in which, says Hogwood, \\"the entry of the trumpets marks the final storming of heaven\\". Handel's first biographer, John Mainwaring, wrote in 1760 that this conclusion revealed the composer \\"rising still higher\\" than in \\"that vast effort of genius, the Hallelujah chorus\\". Young writes that the \\"Amen\\" should, in the manner of Palestrina, \\"be delivered as though through the aisles and... answer the following question: What did Handel orignally write in da capo but shorten to dal segno?

Article: It's no secret that regular cardiovascular exercise releases endorphins and plainly makes your body feels better. While not everyone is destined to be a gym rat or a sports fiend, everyone can make a list of their favorite activities. Think outside the box: for example, maybe you've always wanted to try hiking. Search for local hiking groups. Your brain needs rest. Try wearing a sleep mask and/or listening to white noise to create a peaceful environment. Avoid things like caffeine, alcohol, and drugs. While these substances may temporarily reduce anxiety, they end up making it worse in the long-term. A key component of being “laid-back” is to refuse to let life’s little annoyances rattle your composure. When you’re getting irritated or angry, pause to think about what’s causing your anger. Psychologists speak of the power of reframing events, of activating the reasoning brain to bring balance to the emotional brain. If you’re running late for an important appointment, reframe the situation from one of distress and disappointment into a problem-solving opportunity. Even if you can’t figure out a solution, just considering possibilities will lower the bar on your emotional volume and put you in a more positive state. Many people will come and go in your life; some will make you feel good, others won’t. No matter how much work you do to become cool and laid-back, there will be negative people in the world. Treasure the fact that you can always work to improve your state of mind notwithstanding what stands in your way. Professional counseling might be a good idea if you’re confronted with issues in your life that are too overwhelming to confront on your own. Some people struggle with clinical anxiety disorders. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) shows itself through an excessive anxiety about everyday things like money, relationships, health, and school. If you're unsure whether or not the anxiety you're experiencing is excessive, it's not a bad idea to see a therapist and get a diagnosis. Being cool and laid-back may not be the right goal for you just yet if there are other obstacles you need to conquer first. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of maintaining a laid-back and calm demeanor to improve overall mental well-being. It suggests engaging in regular cardiovascular exercises, seeking out enjoyable activities, getting proper rest, reframing stressful situations, and avoiding harmful substances. The article also acknowledges the presence of negative people in our lives and recommends professional counseling for those dealing with more significant issues like generalized anxiety disorder."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person who must remain handcuffed to his father?, using the article: Fifteen disparate African American men board a bus in Los Angeles bound for Washington, D.C., where they plan on attending the Million Man March. Other than their race, destination, and gender, the men have nothing in common: George is the trip organizer; Xavier is an aspiring filmmaker hoping to make a documentary of the March; Flip is the vain but charismatic and openly homophobic and sexist actor; Kyle and Randall are a homosexual couple; Gary, a biracial police officer; Jamal is a former gang banger turned devout Muslim who has evaded prosecution for the murders he committed; Evan Jr., is a petty criminal who has been permitted to break probation to attend the march on the condition that he remain handcuffed to his father, Evan Sr. As the bus travels across country, Xavier conducts interviews with the various attendees, allowing them to express their views on race, religion, and politics. The interviews often provoke outbursts from other men on the bus, invariably leading to many political confrontations. Jeremiah, the eldest member of the group, is an 80-year-old former alcoholic who lost his job and family, has found new meaning in life and is energized by the Million Man March, and embraces his African heritage; his philosophies on the black experience and stories of precolonial Africa serve to unite the men and ease tensions and the infighting among them. En route the bus breaks down and the men are forced to board another bus, driven by an ethnically Jewish white man named Rick. A couple of the passengers harass Rick as a white man, and Rick ultimately refuses to drive any further, citing the group's prejudice and his opposition to antisemitic remarks made by the leader of the march, Louis Farrakhan. George, himself a bus driver, accuses Rick of cultural racism, but begrudgingly agrees to cover for Rick who leaves.

David Levinson, an MIT-trained satellite technician, decodes a signal embedded in the global satellite transmissions that he determines is a timer counting down to a coordinated attack. With the help of his former wife, White House Communications Director Constance Spano, Levinson, and his father Julius, gain access to the Oval Office and warn President Thomas J. Whitmore that the aliens are hostile. Whitmore orders large-scale evacuations of New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C., but it is too late; the timer reaches zero and the ships activate devastating directed-energy weapons, killing millions. Whitmore, the Levinsons, and a few others, narrowly escape aboard Air Force One as the capital is destroyed, along with other locations over which the ships are positioned. On July 3, international military leaders begin ordering individual counterattacks. Their aviation forces attack destroyer ships positioned above the ruins of the cities, but they are protected by force fields. Each destroyer launches a swarm of attack fighters, which wipe out the human fighter squadrons. Captain Steven Hiller, a pilot with VMFA-314, survives by luring his attacker to the enclosed spaces of the Grand Canyon and sacrificing his plane, forcing the alien to crash-land. He subdues the injured alien pilot and flags down a convoy of refugees, hitching a ride with former combat pilot Russell Casse.

The actress was bombarded with angry comments after she used Twitter to advertise her controversial collection, which includes skimpy designs aimed at under-eights. The model, who was accused of sexualising young girls after initially unveiling the skimpy, two-piece designs two years ago, faced a backlash from her followers who insisted ‘kids should look like kids’. Liz Hurley has become embroiled in fresh controversy over her range of children's bikinis - with critics branding them unsuitable for young girls. The 49-year-old used her personal Twitter account to ask her 450,000 followers: ‘Going somewhere hot at Easter? Check out our Swim Collection.’ She then added: ‘Our Kids collection is divine too.’ Miss Hurley then added a picture of the kids bikinis on display in Harrods, before uploading a link to her website where the items are sold. However, one follower, Lee-Anne Compton wrote back: ‘I’m all for kids looking fab, but looking like kids and safe in the sun.’ EM Grant then posted the message: ‘KIDS? Leopard Print bikinis on KIDS!?’ Julia Hall then wrote in disbelief: ‘What ages are the kids!?’ The model, who was accused of sexualising young girls after initially unveiling the skimpy, two-piece designs two years ago, faced a backlash from her followers who insisted 'kids should look like kids' The actress’s website features several children wearing the skimpy designs while striking poses more suitable for adult models. It includes items for the under eights, such as an animal-print ‘Mini Cha Cha Bikini’ which costs £32.90 and is modelled by a blonde child with both hands placed precociously on her hips. Another design, called the ‘Collette Bikini’ is advertised in the 8-13 age range, and is described as being ‘great for girls who want to look grown up’. Campaigners have previously hit out at Miss Hurley’s bikini collection, calling them ‘disturbing’. Dr Katherine Rake, chief executive of the Family and Parenting Institute charity, said the designs put pressure on parents by attracting young girls to the notion of growing up too fast. She says: ‘Parents have been telling us for a long time that they want their children to be able to enjoy childhood. We’d like young girls to be encouraged to emulate Olympic stars like Ellie Simmonds and Rebecca Adlington when in the swimming pool - not models in leopard print.’ In a report in 2011, Reg Bailey, chief executive of the Mothers’ Union, set out a series of guidelines to be met in order to prevent the sexualisation of young children. One of the recommendations was for ‘retailers to offer more age-appropriate clothes for children and sign up to a code of practice which checks and challenges the design, buying display and marketing of clothes, products and services for children’. A spokesman for Miss Hurley has previously defended the designs saying they are hugely popular with parents and children. It was last year that Gwyneth Paltrow was also accused of sexualising children after endorsing a range of bikinis for girls as young as four, and which she was selling through her lifestyle website, GOOP. The website says the design is perfect for little girls who want to match their mothers, as the top is an exact copy of the adult version - also sold on the website.

The board's responsibilities included sanitation and the maintenance of the highways, and it had the authority to levy rates to pay for those services. The local board continued in that role until it was superseded by the creation of Stretford Urban District Council in 1894, as a result of the Local Government Act 1894. Stretford Urban District became the Municipal Borough of Stretford in 1933, giving it borough status in the United Kingdom. Stretford Borough Council was granted its arms on 20 February 1933. The roses are the red roses of Lancashire, and the lion in the centre represents John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster. Above the lion are a crossed flail and scythe; the flail comes from the arms of the de Trafford family; the scythe is a reminder of the agricultural history of the area; the thunderbolts above represent the importance of electricity in Stretford's industrial development. The boat at the bottom represents Stretford's links to the sea via the Manchester Ship Canal.In 1974, as a result of the Local Government Act 1972, the Municipal Borough of Stretford was abolished and Stretford has, since 1 April 1974, formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford, in Greater Manchester. Trafford Town Hall – previously Stretford Town Hall – is the administrative centre of Trafford.

Add tags and give them longer descriptions as needed Add punctuation","completion":"Okay, little buddy, let's learn about adding tags and using punctuation! Tags are like labels we put on things to help us remember what they are about. For example, if we have a picture of a cat, we could use the tag \\"cat\\" so that we know what's in that picture. If the cat is doing something silly, we can add another tag like \\"funny.\\" So now we have two tags: \\"cat\\" and \\"funny.\\" We can make tags longer if we need by using more words, like \\"fluffy cat\\" or \\"cat playing with a ball.\\" Now, let's learn about punctuation! Punctuation are those little symbols we put in our sentences to make them easier to read and understand. Some common punctuation marks include: 1. Period (.) - It's a small dot we put at the end of a sentence to show it's finished. Example: \\"I am a helpful assistant.\\" 2. Comma (,) - It's like a tiny pause we use to separate different parts of a sentence. Example: \\"I can help you with math, science, and reading.\\" 3. Question mark (?) - If we have a question, we put this at the end of the sentence. Example: \\"Do you like ice cream?\\" 4. Exclamation point (!) - We use this to show that we're excited or want to emphasize something.

Bride: The bride is the focal point of the sentence, as she is the central figure in the event being described. In a wedding ceremony, the bride is one of the two main individuals who are getting married, and this sentence focuses on her moment of walking down the aisle. 2. Escorted: The term \\"escorted\\" denotes that the bride is being accompanied or guided by someone as she makes her way down the aisle. This word is significant in describing the physical act of moving down the aisle and the support provided by the individuals accompanying her. 3. Aisle: The aisle refers to the pathway in a church, a wedding venue, or another location where the bride walks during the wedding ceremony. Often, the aisle is a central component of the ceremony as it symbolizes the bride's final path as an unmarried woman. 4. Mother: The mention of the bride's mother emphasizes that she is one of the individuals accompanying the bride during this crucial moment. The presence of the bride's mother highlights a strong familial connection, and her involvement is crucial to understanding the emotional context of the moment. 5. Father: Reflecting a similar significance as the mother, the father is also mentioned as one of the people accompanying the bride down the aisle. The father's presence is traditional in many wedding ceremonies and usually signifies the transition of guardianship from the bride's parents to her spouse."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Since the Carnation Revolution of 1974, which culminated in the end of one of Portugal's most notable phases of economic expansion (that started in the 1960s), a significant change has occurred in the nation's annual economic growth.[citation needed] After the turmoil of the 1974 revolution and the PREC period, Portugal tried to adapt to a changing modern global economy, a process that continues in 2013. Since the 1990s, Portugal's public consumption-based economic development model has been slowly changing to a system that is focused on exports, private investment and the development of the high-tech sector. Consequently, business services have overtaken more traditional industries such as textiles, clothing, footwear and cork (Portugal is the world's leading cork producer), wood products and beverages.

When the desk sergeant asks who was murdered, he answers: \\"I was.\\" That man is Professor Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid), who then sits down to video-tape his account. Thirty-six hours previously, Cornell is on campus. He is a college professor, was once a promising writer, made his name and is secure in his tenure, but he has spent the last four years going though the motions and playing it safe. \\"Publish or perish\\" is the contrasting rule of university politics and Cornell helps his friend Hal Petersham (Daniel Stern) with his first book. While he is in his office, a promising student, Nick Lang (Robert Knepper), jumps off a building right outside his office in an apparent suicide. This, coupled with the depressing Christmas season, unseasonably hot weather and the divorce papers given to him by his wife Gail (Jane Kaczmarek) leads Cornell to seek out the local bars for a night of drinking. There he meets admiring student Sydney Fuller (Meg Ryan) and they proceed to get drunk. The next morning, Cornell, feeling his sickness is more than just a hangover, stops by the campus medical clinic for a checkup. After running some tests, they discover that he has been poisoned and has 36 hours to live. An incredulous Cornell staggers out to try to make sense of it all. Aided by Fuller, whom he kidnaps by super-gluing himself to her arm, he attempts to recreate the events of the previous night hoping to discover who could have murdered him. The list of suspects includes his wife, who is also the victim of a murder, which the police make half-hearted efforts to pin on Cornell. It is learned that Lang was not a suicide but was also murdered. Cornell also suspects Lang's mentor Mrs. Fitzwaring (Charlotte Rampling), Bernard (Christopher Neame) the Fitzwarings' chauffeur and Graham Corey (Jay Patterson), a jealous co-worker.

His teacher might give Benjamin a squishy ball to hold while they talk, which helps his hands stay busy and his brain to listen better.

Upon the death of King Richard the Lionheart, Robin returns to see that the proper man takes Richard's place as King of England. However, Robin is quickly foiled and imprisoned by his enemies, the Sheriff of Nottingham (Malcolm McDowell) and Prince John (Jonathan Hyde).It is then up to Gwyn to save the day. She must complete Robin's mission to find and protect the young Prince Philip (Stephen Moyer), who has just returned from exile in France to claim the throne not an easy task since he has decided to forsake his true identity and is travelling anonymously under his valet's name (who died en route protecting his prince).

In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell.

This movie could had been an interesting character study and could had given some insight on its subject but real problem with this movie is that it doesn't have any of this in it. It doesn't give any insight-, or solutions to the problem. It's just the portrayal of 'old' male sex addict and the problems this is creating for his every day normal life and family. Why would you want to watch this? It's all so totally pointless and meaningless. It also really doesn't help that the main character is some wrinkly 50+ year old male. You'll have a hard time identifying yourself- and sympathize for him. He just seems like a dirty old playboy, who is an a constant hunt for woman and sex. He has all kinds of sexual intercourse's about 3 times a day with different woman and not just only with prostitutes. It also doesn't have a bad visual style, though it all feels a bit forced. But nevertheless it's all better looking than most other direct-to-video productions. Who knows, if the film-makers had been given better material to work with, the movie would had deserved a better faith. The story really gets ridicules at times. There are really some pointless plot-lines that are often more laughable than they were obviously supposed to be. I'm talking about for instance the whole Ordell plot-line.

Ian was a risk taker.","completion":"William took a leap of faith and invested all of the money into one stock but Ian did not. This situation can be analyzed in various ways to arrive at a comprehensive understanding of both individuals' actions and risk-taking tendencies. (i). William was a risk taker. Based on the given sentence, it is clear that William was a risk taker for several reasons. First, he decided to invest all of his money into a single stock, which is considered a high-risk move in the world of finance. This choice indicates that William was willing to put everything he had on the line for the possibility of a substantial financial gain. William's decision can be an indication of his confidence in the stock he chose, which may have been based on thorough research and financial analysis. On the other hand, it could also be a testament to his attraction to the idea of potentially earning a significant profit quickly, even at the risk of losing it all. This willingness to take risks could have been influenced by various factors, such as an ambitious nature or an optimistic personality. (ii). Ian was not a risk taker. In contrast, Ian's decision not to invest all of his money into one stock shows that he likely had a more conservative approach to investing and financial management. By not following in William's footsteps, Ian demonstrates that he values stability and preservation of his capital over the potential for rapid financial gains. Ian's choice may be driven by several factors, with one of the most obvious being his aversion to risk. His preference for not putting all his eggs in one basket could be due to a cautious personality, a strong desire to protect his financial assets, or a belief in having a diversified investment portfolio as a safer and more sustainable option for long-term growth. Furthermore, Ian's decision could also be influenced by other considerations, such as maintaining an emergency fund or providing for his family's needs, which would prompt him to avoid high-risk investments. Ian might also place a higher value on pursuing financial goals slowly and steadily, following the principle that patience and discipline can lead to long-term wealth accumulation. In conclusion, the sentence demonstrates that William was a risk taker by investing all of his money into one stock, while Ian, who did not do the same, was not a risk taker. Both individuals had distinct approaches to their financial decision-making, either because of their personal beliefs, values, or circumstances. These different methods of handling investments can have varying outcomes in the long run, and neither strategy is universally right or wrong. Instead, they serve as examples of how people's varying risk appetites and financial goals can shape their investment choices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: Process: - An animal eats a lot of food to fatten up - The animal finds or builds a suitable place to hibernate where they can stay warm and protected - The animal moves into their den - Their heart rate and breathing slow down to conserve energy - They emerge from the den when the weather is warming up again. suppose the animal does not fatten up happens, how will it affect HURTING the animal to hibernate properly. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The supposed perturbation in this case would be: directly impacting a step of the process. In the process of hibernation, the first step is for the animal to eat a lot of food to fatten up. This provides the animal with enough energy reserves to survive the long, cold months of hibernation. If the animal does not fatten up properly, it will directly impact their ability to hibernate, as they may not have enough energy reserves to make it through the entire hibernation period. This could result in the animal either having to wake up early from hibernation or facing serious health consequences due to depleted energy reserves."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Prof Neil Gow, from the University of Aberdeen, said more than one million people die from fungal infections around the world each year. Yet there are no vaccines and there is a \\"pressing need\\" for new treatments, he said. The warning comes as doctors in England say a new strain of fungi is causing outbreaks in hospitals. There are more than five million types of fungi, but only three major groups cause the majority of deaths in people: Prof Gow said: \\"Most people know about mild fungal infections, but nobody's ever died from athlete's foot. \\"However, a million people die a year from fungal infections and we need to understand these different types of infection and how to deal with them.\\" The infections are more deadly in people with weakened immune systems - such as patients with HIV - so the fungal problem is particularly acute in Africa. \\"It's an underappreciated problem and it's a very serious challenge in the parts of the world least equipped to deal with it,\\" Prof Gow added. Patients having cancer therapy or who are taking immunosuppressant drugs after an organ transplant are also more susceptible to infection. Speaking to the BBC at the Royal Society's Summer Exhibition, he said: \\"Fungi are extremely tough and manipulate the immune system to prevent themselves being recognised, they are very slippery customers.\\" Meanwhile, health officials have warned of a new strain of Candida auris which has caused an outbreak affecting 40 patients in one hospital in south-east England. The infection was first detected in 2009 in Japan, but has since been discovered across Asia and parts of south America. Public Health England said \\"Candida auris appears to be unlike other pathogenic yeast species in its propensity for transmission between hospital patients\\" and warned it was resistant to the first choice anti-fungal drug. Dr Berit Muller-Pebody, from Public Health England, said: \\"This species of Candida is emerging globally. \\"We are monitoring it, but as it's an emerging pathogen it is very difficult to talk about trends. \\"We needed to make the healthcare community aware of it as [doctors] now need to identify the species of Candida that require a more proactive approach.\\" Follow James on Twitter.

Information: - Baroque music (or ) is a style of Western art music composed from approximately 1600 to 1750. This era followed the Renaissance music era, and was followed in turn by the Classical era. Baroque music forms a major portion of the \\"classical music\\" canon, being widely studied, performed, and listened to. Key composers of the Baroque era include Johann Sebastian Bach, Antonio Vivaldi, George Frideric Handel, Claudio Monteverdi, Domenico Scarlatti, Alessandro Scarlatti, Henry Purcell, Georg Philipp Telemann, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Marc-Antoine Charpentier, Arcangelo Corelli, Tomaso Albinoni, François Couperin, Giuseppe Tartini, Heinrich Schütz, Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, Dieterich Buxtehude, and Johann Pachelbel. - Henry Purcell (or ; c. 10 September 1659 21 November 1695) was an English composer. Although incorporating Italian and French stylistic elements into his compositions, Purcell's legacy was a uniquely English form of Baroque music. He is generally considered to be one of the greatest English composers; no other native-born English composer approached his fame until Edward Elgar, Ralph Vaughan Williams, and Benjamin Britten in the 20th century. - Tomaso Giovanni Albinoni (8 June 1671 17 January 1751) was an Italian Baroque composer. While famous in his day as an opera composer, he is mainly remembered today for his instrumental music, such as the concerti. - Art music (also known as Western classical music, cultivated music, serious music, canonic music, or more flippantly, \\"real music\\" and \\"normal music\\") is an umbrella term that refers to musical traditions, implying advanced structural and theoretical considerations and a written musical tradition. The main tradition in the Western world is usually called classical music. \\"Serious\\" or \\"cultivated\\" music are terms frequently used as a contrast for ordinary, everyday music (popular and folk music, also called \\"vernacular music\\"). After the 20th century, art music was divided into two extensions: \\"serious music\\" and \\"light music\\". - Giuseppe Domenico Scarlatti (Naples, 26 October 1685 Madrid, 23 July 1757) was an Italian composer who spent much of his life in the service of the Portuguese and Spanish royal families. He is classified primarily as a Baroque composer chronologically, although his music was influential in the development of the Classical style and he was one of the few Baroque composers to transition into the classical period. Like his renowned father Alessandro Scarlatti, he composed in a variety of musical forms, although today he is known mainly for his 555 keyboard sonatas. - Jean-Baptiste Lully (born Giovanni Battista Lulli ; 28 November 1632 22 March 1687) was an Italian-born French composer, instrumentalist, and dancer who spent most of his life working in the court of Louis XIV of France. He is considered a master of the French baroque style. Lully disavowed any Italian influence in French music of the period. He became a French subject in 1661. - Johann Pachelbel (baptised September 1, 1653 buried March 9, 1706) was a German composer, organist, and teacher who brought the south German organ tradition to its peak. He composed a large body of sacred and secular music, and his contributions to the development of the chorale prelude and fugue have earned him a place among the most important composers of the middle Baroque era. - George Frideric (or Frederick) Handel (born , ; 23 February 1685 (O.S.) [(N.S.) 5 March] 14 April 1759) was a German, later British baroque composer who spent the bulk of his career in London, becoming well known for his operas, oratorios, anthems, and organ concertos. Handel received important training in Halle and worked as a composer in Hamburg and Italy before settling in London in 1712; he became a naturalised British subject in 1727. He was strongly influenced both by the great composers of the Italian Baroque and by the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition. - Bach Collegium Japan ( BCJ ) is composed of an orchestra and a chorus specializing in Baroque music , playing with period instruments . It was founded in 1990 by Masaaki Suzuki with the purpose of introducing Japanese audiences to European Baroque music . Suzuki still remains its music director . The ensemble has recorded all of Bach 's cantatas , a project that extended from 1995 to 2013 and accounts for over half of its discography . - Amsterdam is the capital and most populous municipality of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Its status as the capital is mandated by the Constitution of the Netherlands, although it is not the seat of the government, which is The Hague. Amsterdam has a population of 847,176 within the city proper, 1,343,647 in the urban area, and 2,431,000 in the Amsterdam metropolitan area. The city is located in the province of North Holland in the west of the country. The metropolitan area comprises much of the northern part of the Randstad, one of the larger conurbations in Europe, with a population of approximately 7 million. - The Renaissance was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history. It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Late Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe, marking the beginning of the Early Modern Age. - Alessandro Scarlatti (2 May 1660 22 October 1725) was an Italian Baroque composer, especially famous for his operas and chamber cantatas. He is considered the founder of the Neapolitan school of opera. He was the father of two other composers, Domenico Scarlatti and Pietro Filippo Scarlatti. - Giovanni Battista Draghi (4 January 1710 16 March 1736), best known as Pergolesi or Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, was an Italian composer, violinist and organist. - The earliest written records regarding the region come from the \\"Nihon Shoki\\", which describes the founding of the Ikuta Shrine by Empress Jing in AD 201. For most of its history, the area was never a single political entity, even during the Tokugawa Period, when the port was controlled directly by the Tokugawa Shogunate. Kobe did not exist in its current form until its founding in 1889. Its name comes from , an archaic title for supporters of the city's Ikuta Shrine. Kobe became one of Japan's 17 designated cities in 1956. - A. G. M. (Ton) Koopman (born 2 October 1944) is a Dutch conductor, organist and harpsichordist. He is also professor at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague. In April 2003 he was knighted in the Netherlands, receiving the Order of the Netherlands Lion. - Marc-Antoine Charpentier (1643 24 February 1704) was a French composer of the Baroque era. - Johann Sebastian Bach (28 July 1750) was a German composer and musician of the Baroque period. He enriched established German styles through his skill in counterpoint, harmonic and motivic organisation, and the adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly from Italy and France. Bach's compositions include the \\"Brandenburg Concertos\\", the \\"Goldberg Variations\\", the Mass in B minor, two Passions, and over three hundred cantatas of which around two hundred survive. His music is revered for its technical command, artistic beauty, and intellectual depth. - Dieterich Buxtehude (; c. 1637/39 9 May 1707) was a Danish-German organist and composer of the Baroque period. His organ works represent a central part of the standard organ repertoire and are frequently performed at recitals and in church services. He composed in a wide variety of vocal and instrumental idioms, and his style strongly influenced many composers, including Johann Sebastian Bach. Today, Buxtehude is considered one of the most important composers in Germany of the mid-Baroque. - Antonio Lucio Vivaldi (4 March 1678 28 July 1741) was an Italian Baroque composer, virtuoso violinist, teacher and cleric. Born in Venice, he is recognized as one of the greatest Baroque composers, and his influence during his lifetime was widespread across Europe. He composed many instrumental concertos, for the violin and a variety of other instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than forty operas. His best-known work is a series of violin concertos known as \\"The Four Seasons\\". - Heinrich Schütz ( 6 November 1672) was a German composer and organist, generally regarded as the most important German composer before Johann Sebastian Bach and often considered to be one of the most important composers of the 17th century. He wrote what is traditionally considered to be the first German opera, \\"Dafne\\", performed at Torgau in 1627, the music of which has since been lost. He is commemorated as a musician in the Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church on 28 July with Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel. - Pieter William Kee (born August 30, 1927) is a Dutch organist and composer. - He was born in Kobe to parents who were both Christians and amateur musicians; his father had worked professionally as a pianist. (Suzuki has as an adult joined the Reformed Church in Japan, a Calvinist denomination. ) Masaaki Suzuki began playing organ professionally at church services at the age of 12. He earned degrees in composition and organ at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music, then earned Soloist Diplomas at the Sweelinck Conservatory in Amsterdam, where he studied harpsichord and organ with Ton Koopman and Piet Kee and improvisation with Klaas Bolt. - Georg Philipp Telemann ( 25 June 1767) was a German Baroque composer and multi-instrumentalist. Almost completely self-taught in music, he became a composer against his family's wishes. After studying in Magdeburg, Zellerfeld, and Hildesheim, Telemann entered the University of Leipzig to study law, but eventually settled on a career in music. He held important positions in Leipzig, Sorau, Eisenach, and Frankfurt before settling in Hamburg in 1721, where he became musical director of the city's five main churches. While Telemann's career prospered, his personal life was always troubled: his first wife died only a few months after their marriage, and his second wife had extramarital affairs and accumulated a large gambling debt before leaving Telemann. - François Couperin (10 November 1668 11 September 1733) was a French Baroque composer, organist and harpsichordist. He was known as \\"Couperin le Grand\\" (\\"Couperin the Great\\") to distinguish him from other members of the musically talented Couperin family. - Arcangelo Corelli (17 February 1653 8 January 1713) was an Italian violinist and composer of the Baroque era. His music was key in the development of the modern genres of sonata and concerto, in establishing the preeminence of the violin, and as the first coalescing of modern tonality and functional harmony. - Jean-Philippe Rameau ( ) was one of the most important French composers and music theorists of the Baroque era. He replaced Jean-Baptiste Lully as the dominant composer of French opera and is also considered the leading French composer for the harpsichord of his time, alongside François Couperin. - Giuseppe Tartini (8 April 1692 26 February 1770) was a Venetian Baroque composer and violinist. - Klaas Bolt (March 6, 1927 in Appingedam April 11, 1990 in Haarlem) was a Dutch organist and improviser. He taught improvisation at the Sweelinck Conservatory (named for Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, a Dutch organist and composer of the Renaissance) in Amsterdam, where Masaaki Suzuki was among his students. Bolt was a proponent of the use of slow tempi when playing hymns. He played many hymns at his weekly evening hymn sings, which drew substantial audiences. He would typically improvise the hymn introductions at these events. What object entity has the relation of 'named after' with the subject 'bach collegium japan'?

Article: People think of ice cream as an American food. Yet, ice cream really came from Asia. In the late 1200s Marco Polo, the great explorer, is said to have seen rich Asians eating dishes of ice. Camels had brought the ice from distant mountains. Before it was served, the ice had been flavored with fruits. Marco Polo brought this new dish to Italy, In France cooks changed the ice recipe and made ice cream. At first, cooks tried to keep the recipe a secret. They wanted it to be a special dish for rich people. By the late 1700s, though, ice cream was sold throughout Europe and America. Some great Americans loved ice cream. George Washington was the first to buy a special machine for making it. When Thomas Jefferson returned from France, he brought an ice cream recipe home with him. Dolly Madison, wife of President James Madison, also liked ice cream, and she often served it at the White House. Actually, a famous brand of ice cream was even named after her. In the late 1800s, the ice cream industry began to grow. A way of keeping ice cream frozen had been found, so ice cream makers did not have to worry about ice cream melting anymore.

Information: - Spirogyra (common names include water silk, mermaid's tresses, and blanket weed) is a genus of filamentous charophyte green algae of the order Zygnematales, named for the helical or spiral arrangement of the chloroplasts that is diagnostic of the genus. It is commonly found in freshwater areas, and there are more than 400 species of \\"Spirogyra\\" in the world. \\"Spirogyra\\" measures approximately 10 to 100 m in width and may grow to several centimeters in length. - In vascular plants, phloem is the living tissue that transports the soluble organic compounds made during photosynthesis (known as photosynthate), in particular the sugar sucrose, to all parts of the plant where needed. This transport process is called translocation. In trees, the phloem is the innermost layer of the bark, hence the name, derived from the Greek word (\\"phloios\\") meaning \\"bark\\". - Chlamydomonas is a genus of green algae consisting of unicellular flagellates, found in stagnant water and on damp soil, in freshwater, seawater, and even in snow as \\"snow algae\\" \\"Chlamydomonas\\" is used as a model organism for molecular biology, especially studies of flagellar motility and chloroplast dynamics, biogeneses, and genetics. One of the many striking features of \\"Chlamydomonas\\" is that it contains ion channels, (channelrhodopsins), that are directly activated by light. Some regulatory systems of \\"Chlamydomonas\\" are more complex than their homologs in Gymnosperms, with evolutionarily related regulatory proteins being larger and containing additional domains. - In taxonomy, the Volvocales, also known as Chlamydomonadales, are an order of flagellate or pseudociliate green algae, specifically of the Chlorophyceae. Volvocales can form planar or spherical colonies. These vary from \\"Gonium\\" (4 to 32 cells) up to \\"Volvox\\" (500 cells or more). Each cell has two flagella, and is similar in appearance to \\"Chlamydomonas\\", with the flagella throughout the colony moving in coordination. - Kelps are large seaweeds (algae) belonging to the brown algae (Phaeophyceae) in the order Laminariales. There are about 30 different genera. - Gonium is a genus of colonial algae , a member of the order Volvocales . Typical colonies have 4 to 16 cells , all the same size , arranged in a flat plate , with no anterior - posterior differentiation . In a colony of 16 cells , four are in the center , and the other 12 are on the four sides , three each . A description by G.M. Smith ( 1920 , p. 94 ) : Gonium Mueller 1773 : Colonies of 4 - 8 - 16 cells arranged in a flat quadrangular plate and embedded in a common gelatinous matrix or connected by broad gelatinous strands . Cells ovoid to pyriform , with a single cup - shaped chloroplast containing one pyrenoid . Each cell with two cilia of equal length , contractile vacuoles at the base of the cilia , and an eyespot . Four - and eight - celled colonies with the cilia on the same side ; sixteencelled colonies with the four central cells having their cilia on the same side and the twelve marginal cells with radially arranged cilia . Asexual reproduction by simultaneous division of all cells in the colony to form autocolonies , or by a formation of 2 - 4 zoospores in each cell . - A flagellate is a cell or organism with one or more whip-like organelles called flagella. The word \\"flagellate\\" also describes a particular construction (or level of organization) characteristic of many protists (eukaryotic organisms) and their means of motion. The term presently does not imply any specific relationship or classification of the organisms that possess flagellae. However, the term \\"flagellate\\" is included in other terms (such as \\"dinoflagellate\\" and \\"choanoflagellata\\") which are more formally characterized. - The Chlorophyceae are one of the classes of green algae, distinguished mainly on the basis of ultrastructural morphology. For example, the chlorophycean CW clade, and chlorophycean DO clade, are defined by the arrangement of their flagella. Members of the CW clade have flagella that are displaced in a \\"clockwise\\" (CW, 17 o'clock) direction e.g. Chlamydomonadales. Members of the DO clade have flagella that are \\"directly opposed\\" (DO, 126 o'clock) e.g. Sphaeropleales. They are usually green due to the dominance of pigments chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b. The chloroplast may be discoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral or ribbon shaped in different species. Most of the members have one or more storage bodies called pyrenoids located in the chloroplast. Pyrenoids contain protein besides starch. Some algae may store food in the form of oil droplets. Green algae usually have a rigid cell wall made up of an inner layer of cellulose and outer layer of pectose. - Chlorella is a genus of single-cell green algae belonging to the phylum Chlorophyta. It is spherical in shape, about 2 to 10 m in diameter, and is without flagella. \\"Chlorella\\" contains the green photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll-a and -b in its chloroplast. Through photosynthesis, it multiplies rapidly, requiring only carbon dioxide, water, sunlight, and a small amount of minerals to reproduce. - Charophyta is a division of freshwater green algae. The terrestrial plants, the Embryophyta emerged within Charophyta, with the class Zygnematophyceae as a sister group. In some charophyte groups, such as Zygnematophyceae or conjugating green algae, flagellae are absent and sexual reproduction does not involve free-swimming flagellate sperm. Flagellate sperm, however, are found in stoneworts (Charales) and Coleochaetales, orders of parenchymatous charophytes that are the closest relatives of the land plants, where flagellate sperm are also present in all except the conifers and flowering plants. Fossil stoneworts of Devonian age that are similar to those of the present day have been described from the Rhynie chert of Scotland. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Algae (singular \\"alga\\" ) is an informal term for a large, diverse group of photosynthetic organisms which are not necessarily closely related, and is thus polyphyletic. Included organisms range from unicellular genera, such as \\"Chlorella\\" and the diatoms, to multicellular forms, such as the giant kelp, a large brown alga which may grow up to 50 m in length. Most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as stomata, xylem, and phloem, which are found in land plants.

Zhengde's top advisors made every attempt to dissuade him from inviting this lama to court, arguing that Tibetan Buddhism was wildly heterodox and unorthodox. Despite protests by the Grand Secretary Liang Chu, in 1515 the Zhengde Emperor sent his eunuch official Liu Yun of the Palace Chancellery on a mission to invite this Karmapa to Beijing. Liu commanded a fleet of hundreds of ships requisitioned along the Yangtze, consuming 2,835 g (100 oz) of silver a day in food expenses while stationed for a year in Chengdu of Sichuan. After procurring necessary gifts for the mission, he departed with a cavalry force of about 1,000 troops. When the request was delivered, the Karmapa lama refused to leave Tibet despite the Ming force brought to coerce him. The Karmapa launched a surprise ambush on Liu Yun's camp, seizing all the goods and valuables while killing or wounding half of Liu Yun's entire escort. After this fiasco, Liu fled for his life, but only returned to Chengdu several years later to find that the Zhengde Emperor had died.

During a formal dinner party she emerges in her pajamas, insults her mother and the guests, then proceeds to urinate profusely on the floor. In response, Megan's mother (Veronica Cartwright) seeks help from two priests, Father McFeely (James Woods) and Father Harris (Andy Richter). After paying a trip to the bathroom, the men attempt to drive Hugh's ghost out, but the exorcism does not go as planned. After a chain of projectile vomits and various instances of pedophilia, Megan insults Father McFeely's mother. He responds by pulling out a gun and shooting Megan. Meanwhile, (taking place a year after the first film) Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall), Ray Wilkins (Shawn Wayans), and Shorty Meeks (Marlon Wayans) are at college, trying to live new lives since the events of the first film (in which they all actually died towards the end of the movie). Cindy and Brenda get tagged by a socially maladjusted girl, Alex (Tori Spelling). Shorty is still the same stoner he was before. Ray, still confused about his sexuality, has two new male friends, Tommy (James DeBello) and Buddy (Christopher Masterson). Buddy becomes romantically interested in Cindy. Still recovering from her previous relationship, she rebuffs him. Professor Oldman (Tim Curry) and his charming paraplegic assistant, Dwight Hartman (David Cross), plan to study the paranormal activity at a local haunted mansion called Hell House (the house in the opening scene).

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Complete the following sentence. I ordered a beer instead of a martini because I do not like hard liquor, so the","completion":"best alternative for me was a refreshing beer with a lower alcohol content, allowing me to enjoy my drink at a slower pace and socialize with my friends without feeling the need to down it in one gulp. Furthermore, beers typically come in a wider variety of styles and flavors, such as crisp lagers, rich stouts, and fruity ales, providing me with a multitude of options that I can choose from based on my mood, the occasion, or the local specialties available. Another factor that influenced my decision was the food pairing aspect. Beers tend to pair better with a range of dishes, complementing a diverse selection of cuisines and enhancing the flavors rather than overpowering them as a martini might. For instance, a hoppy IPA may accentuate the spice in a bowl of chili, whereas a light Pilsner could contrast nicely with a slice of pizza, or an amber ale might bring out the rich umami notes in a burger. On the other hand, martinis have more limited pairings, typically best suited to light appetizers like olives and smoked salmon. Additionally, beer can be a more economical choice compared to martinis, especially when considering that craft beers offer an exciting array of complex flavors and aromas, often at a fraction of the price of a cocktail. Moreover, beer has a less aggressive alcohol content meaning I can consume more of it responsibly throughout an entire evening, which can be a more budget-friendly option when out with friends or during happy hour. Drinking beer also gives me the opportunity to support and explore the local brewing scene. Many cities and towns boast an array of microbreweries, offering unique and innovative brews that reflect the character of the region. By opting for a beer rather than a martini, I can indulge in an authentic drinking experience and engage in conversation about the local brews with my friends and fellow patrons, thereby creating a stronger sense of camaraderie and shared enjoyment. Finally, opting for a beer can make for a more relaxed and less formal social atmosphere. While martinis often evoke images of elegance and sophistication, they can sometimes create an air of pretension or exclusivity. Beer, on the other hand, is versatile and unpretentious, conveying a spirit of conviviality and inclusivity that suits my preference for a laid-back and friendly setting. In conclusion, I ordered a beer instead of a martini because I do not like hard liquor, and the beer provided me with a more approachable and enjoyable drinking experience, better food pairings, an economical choice, a way to connect with the local brewing community, and a convivial ambiance that aligns with my preference for a relaxed and inclusive social atmosphere."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Breaking down the original sentence, \\"Its hissing against the ground was a tumult in his ears,\\" suggests that the sound was incredibly loud and chaotic. The use of the word \\"tumult\\" implies a great commotion or disturbance. From this description, we can assume that the person hearing this intense hissing noise is likely experiencing some level of distress. The sentence continues with \\"superheated ash and debris began to fall.\\" This element adds to the dangerous and unstable environment, implying that physical harm may also be a possibility. Taking into account these two aspects of the situation, it is reasonably justifiable that the character might clutch their ears in response to the deafening noise. While the original sentence does not specifically state this action or the intensity of the sound as \\"deafening,\\" we can infer that the character could react in such a manner due to the overwhelming and perilous nature of the scene.

It was a made-for-TV moment that all presidents would relish, but it seemed especially significant for the man who turned a reality TV career into a successful bid for the presidency. Donald Trump triumphantly greeted the three Americans released by North Korea in the early morning darkness at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington early Thursday, an image one can expect to see over and over again come the 2020 U.S. presidential election campaign. “It was a very important thing to all of us to be able to get these three great people out,” Trump told reporters on the tarmac. He then went on to speculate that live television coverage of the arrival “probably broke the all-time in history television rating for 3 o’clock in the morning.” It was a moment the president gladly seized given that his White House has been buffeted by a chaotic mix of policy and personal drama in recent days. The prospect of a potentially historic breakthrough on North Korea could move a number of other unwelcome distractions to the side, including the ongoing Russia investigation, the growing legal difficulties for Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the soap opera that the Stormy Daniels story has become. Daniels is the adult film actress who claims she once had an affair with Trump. He denies the claim. Trump also announced Thursday on Twitter that he will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore. A new CNN poll found that 77 percent of those surveyed support Trump meeting the North Korean leader, and 53 percent approve of his handling of the North Korea issue generally. Those numbers are in keeping with a general trend of late that has seen the president’s poll ratings improving, perhaps in part because of the strong economy.

How Joanna Weidenmiller turned 1-Page into a 100 million business Joanna Weidenmiller had severe dyslexia and no athletic ability as a child (“If you threw a ball at me I could never catch it,” she laughs). So much for expectations: She became a nationally ranked rower with a 4.0 GPA at the University of Virginia. And now, at the age of 32, she heads up a San Francisco-based recruiting technology company, 1-Page, that last month went public—not on the NASDAQ, but instead on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). It was the first Silicon Valley company to list on the nascent exchange. Weidenmiller made the move, she says, instead of taking more VC money. The Australian Stock Exchange has easier listing requirements than the NASDAQ. And although the method was unorthodox (the company used a reverse merger with a defunct mining company called InterMet Resources, which allowed it to take over its ticker symbol), the end result is that the company has a market cap of over 100 million. What’s more, the founders–Weidenmiller and her father, who wrote the 1-Page recruiting concept that the company is built on—avoided further dilution from venture capitalists. “You have to take so much funding from VCs,” she says, and then if you go public, many of the VCs have to exit the day their restriction period is up. “So instead, I have investors.” A conversation with Weidenmiller makes it clear that she’s not one to follow the traditional path—not only from a corporate perspective, but also when it comes to women’s issues, which are close to her heart. An outspoken supporter of women in the technology space, she isn’t afraid to say that quotas and regulations may be what’s necessary to get women to equal levels within the sector, much as Title IX allowed her to receive a full scholarship to college. “Why not say 10% of a fund has to go to women-led companies? You’d start seeing huge competition,” she says. The fact that the VC industry is so male-89% of partners –doesn’t help, Wiedenmiller says, noting a Stanford study saying that in 2013 women entrepreneurs received only 4.2% of VC funding. “I heard 99 nos,” she says—which, of course, is typical for many a founder—before she gained investors such as Blumberg Capital and TMT Investments (she bought them out after the IPO). And yet, she says, women-owned businesses are a better bet, citing research from Indiegogo that women are 61% more likely than men to achieve their financial goals on the site. Put another, typically Weidenmillerian way: “Women are incredible, and men are scared shitless,” she says. “It’s so true. I won the biological lottery.

Mary Ochsenhirt Amdur studied the effects of which historic air inversion that killed 20 people? A:","completion":"Mary Ochsenhirt Amdur, an American scientist well known for her research in the fields of environmental health and toxicology, conducted significant studies on the effects of air pollution following a historic air inversion event that occurred in Donora, Pennsylvania. This event, known as the Donora Smog, took place in late October 1948, and resulted in the deaths of 20 people while causing serious respiratory issues and other health problems for thousands of residents in the affected area. The Donora Smog event happened during a period of stable atmospheric conditions, trapping polluted air close to the ground level. The area was home to several industrial facilities, including a steel mill and a zinc plant, which emitted high levels of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and other particulate matter. These pollutants were confined by the air inversion and accumulated over time. This led to the formation of a thick smog, which engulfed the town for several days, reducing visibility and dramatically affecting the air quality. Due to the lack of environmental regulations at the time, there wasn't any significant effort made to control the emissions. Mary Amdur researched the health effects of this catastrophic incident and concluded that the toxic combination of pollutants in the air during the event caused severe health problems. Her work focused on the exposure to sulfuric acid mists resulting from the sulfur dioxide reaction with the water particles in the atmosphere, leading to acid precipitation. She also emphasized that continuous exposure to low levels of air pollutants could cause long-term health complications and stressed the importance of adopting stricter air pollution regulations and air quality standards. In the aftermath of the Donora Smog tragedy, Amdur's research played a crucial role in shaping environmental policies in the United States. Her findings contributed to the development of the Clean Air Act, which was first enacted in 1963 and later went through significant amendments in 1970 and 1990, to establish more stringent air quality standards. Furthermore, Mary Amdur's contributions to the field of environmental health acted as a foundation for future research and greatly assisted in raising awareness about the harmful effects of air pollution on human health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After being identified, he was dragged away by an SAS trooper, who allegedly intended to take him back into the building and shoot him. The soldier reportedly changed his mind when it was pointed out to him that the raid was being broadcast on live television. It later emerged that the footage from the back of the embassy was coming from a wireless camera placed in the window of a flat overlooking the embassy. The camera had been installed by ITN technicians, who had posed as guests of a local resident in order to get past the police cordon, which had been in place since the beginning of the siege. Nejad was arrested, and was eventually tried, convicted, and sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in the siege. He became eligible for parole in 2005. As a foreign national, he would normally have been immediately deported to his home country but Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, incorporated into British law by the Human Rights Act 1998, has been held by the European Court of Human Rights to prohibit deportation in cases where the person concerned would be likely to be tortured or executed in his home country. Nejad was eventually paroled in 2008 and granted leave to remain in the UK, but was not given political asylum. The Home Office released a statement, saying \\"We do not give refugee status to convicted terrorists. Our aim is to deport people as quickly as possible but the law requires us to first obtain assurances that the person being returned will not face certain death\\". After 27 years in prison, Nejad was deemed no longer to be a threat to society, but Trevor Lock wrote to the Home Office to oppose his release. Because it is accepted by the British government that he would be executed or tortured, he cannot be deported to Iran under the Human Rights Act 1998. He now lives in Peckham, south London, having assumed another identity. answer the following question: What was the soldier going to do to Nejad before he changed his mind?

His sketches are archived here on the Bucks blog, and other drawings are available on his personal Web site, BehaviorGap.com. What I’m about to relate is a story I suspect many of you have experienced at least once if you’re in a relationship. My wife mentioned that her friend had recently redone her kitchen. As she explained all of the renovations, I started doing mental arithmetic that quickly added up to big dollars, dollars we couldn’t afford. Instead of engaging in a fun conversation about why my wife liked the kitchen and what she thought was cool about it, I responded with my typical “We can’t afford that.” Of course when she heard my response, my wife gave me a confused look and said, “What are you talking about?” Clearly, after 15 years of marriage, I haven’t fully learned the lesson that just because my wife is talking about a new kitchen she’s not implying that she wants to remodel her kitchen. She was only discussing something of interest to her and what she thought might be of interest to me. So why did I make the leap and start to feel tension in my shoulders? After all, my wife is no stranger to money. Her undergraduate degree is in finance, and she served as the chief financial officer of a small development company. More recently she’s taken over as our family C.F.O., which leads me to wonder why I’m assuming she’s talking about money when in reality she’s just talking about life. This conversation isn’t the first time that I’ve made the leap to money based on things my wife tells me. For example, every time she mentioned someone she knew that was planning a family trip to Hawaii, I immediately started calculating how much such a trip would cost. Even something as simple as talking about where friends plan to send their children to college makes me start thinking about money. The reality is that my brain is wired to think differently when it comes to money. Based on my experience, and the stories others have related, it’s clear that men and women can have completely different approaches to how they talk about money. What I took as code for, “I want a new kitchen,” was just my wife talking about something she enjoyed. How many times has this happened between you and your spouse? Even if it happens a lot, this is not a question of who’s right and who’s wrong. Rather, it’s an opportunity for us to recognize that when we’re dealing with people who we care about, we can’t impose our money language and expectations on them. I will probably continue to do mental arithmetic when I’m chatting with my wife, but if I remember that 99 percent of the time she’s simply talking about subjects that interest her, I can reduce my anxiety over money. How we were raised to view money (let alone the other influences of gender, experience and education) all play a role in how we talk and think about money. So it’s healthy to recognize that we all bring baggage to these conversations. Hopefully it won’t take me another 15 years to put it into practice.","completion":"\\"Understanding Each Other's Money Talk: A Story About Marriage and Different Ways of Discussing Finances\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Vibrate the mold to get the bubbles to rise and pop.. B). Use a spoon to get the bubbles to rise and pop..","completion":"Option A, vibrating the mold to get the bubbles to rise and pop, makes more sense to accomplish the goal of removing bubbles from silicone that has been poured into a mold. This is because using a vibration method allows for a more efficient and even distribution of energy across the silicone material, which helps to effectively dislodge trapped air bubbles and bring them to the surface. Additionally, there are several methods to apply vibration, allowing you to choose the most suitable one for your specific mold and silicone. In comparison, using a spoon (Option B) to get the bubbles to rise and pop may not be as effective for several reasons. First, manually stirring the silicone with a spoon might introduce more air bubbles into the mixture, especially if it's not done carefully and slowly. This can defeat the purpose of attempting to remove the bubbles in the first place. Second, this method might not be as efficient, as it relies heavily on the user's skill and precision to identify and target the air bubbles, which can be time-consuming and may not yield the best results. There are various techniques for applying vibration to the mold, some of which are: 1. Manual tapping: This involves gently tapping the sides of the mold with your hands or a tool like a rubber mallet. It can be an effective method for smaller molds, but it might not work as well for larger ones or more intricate designs. 2. Electric vibrator: These devices are specifically designed to apply consistent vibration to a mold or casting table. Electric vibrators come in various sizes, allowing you to choose the best option for your project. 3. Vacuum chamber: A vacuum chamber applies negative pressure to the mold and silicone mixture, helping the trapped air bubbles to expand and rise to the surface. This method can be highly effective, but it can be more expensive than tapping or using an electric vibrator. It also requires access to a vacuum chamber. 4. Pressure pot: Another alternative is using a pressure pot, which applies positive pressure to the silicone-filled mold, reducing the size of air bubbles and forcing them to the surface. This technique can be effective, but it requires access to a pressure pot and may be more expensive or complicated than other methods. Overall, Option A, vibrating the mold, is the best approach for removing bubbles from silicone that has been poured into a mold. It provides a more efficient and effective solution, allowing for the even distribution of energy across the silicone material while reducing the likelihood of introducing new air bubbles in the process. It also offers the user more options for fine-tuning the method for their specific project."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Stuart Pearce, MBE (born 24 April 1962) is an English football manager and player. He is an assistant manager to David Moyes at West Ham United. Pearce was the manager of the England national under-21 team from 2007 to 2013 and also managed the Great Britain Olympic football team at the 2012 Olympics. As a player, Pearce played as a defender and appeared for Wealdstone, Coventry City, Newcastle United, West Ham United and Manchester City, but is best known for his spell at Nottingham Forest, where he regularly captained the team and became the club's most capped International, making 76 of his 78 appearances for England while with the club and captaining the national side on nine occasions. Pearce joined Newcastle United along with fellow veterans John Barnes and Ian Rush in the 1997-98 season under Kenny Dalglish, and played in the 1998 FA Cup final, though again he emerged on the defeated side. He scored once during his spell at Newcastle, in a UEFA Champions League tie against Dynamo Kyiv. Eventually Pearce was isolated, along with other players including Rob Lee and John Barnes, upon Dalglish's sacking after Ruud Gullit took over. A number of players were treated coldly by Gullit, and Pearce along with Barnes and Lee were made to train with the reserves despite cumulatively having over 150 England caps between them. Both Pearce and Barnes assert in their autobiographies Gullit felt threatened by the senior players in the squad, and they felt they were being sidelined to prevent them challenging him for the manager's position should it arise. Pearce claims also that he once kicked Gullit up in the air during a training session, and a number of other players sniggered at this due to Gullit's poor relationship with them. Pearce went on to play for West Ham United, a year after falling out of favour with Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit. He made his debut on 7 August 1999 in a 1-0 home win against Tottenham Hotspur. His first goal came on 21 October 2000 in a 2-1 home defeat to Arsenal. He made 50 appearances in all competitions, scoring three goals and in 2001 he was named Hammer of the Year. In the summer of 2001, he was Kevin Keegan's first signing for Manchester City for what would be the final season in his career. He captained the club to the First Division championship and scored direct from a free-kick on his debut, against Watford. In the final game of his career, against Portsmouth, he had the aim to reach 100 career goals. He took a penalty kick for City four minutes into injury time, but missed it along with the chance to reach his target. Throughout his career, Pearce was given the nickname of \\"Psycho\\" for his unforgiving style of play. This was initially a tag afforded to him only by Forest fans, though later it was adopted by England supporters as well. Former England teammate Matthew Le Tissier has since described him as his scariest opponent in his book, Taking Le Tiss. Former Nottingham Forest teammate Roy Keane said Pearce was a \\"man amongst boys\\" at Forest. In recognition of his talents and his support for various charities, he was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in January 1999. When was the later career of Stuart?","completion":"Stuart Pearce's later career can be traced from his time at Newcastle United in the 1997-98 season, followed by his tenure at West Ham United starting in 1999, and finally ending with his time at Manchester City starting in the summer of 2001. This period also includes his transition from a player to a managerial role post-retirement, such as his role as manager of the England national under-21 team from 2007 to 2013 and his role in managing the Great Britain Olympic football team at the 2012 Olympics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate. - Trogir (Ancient Greek: , \\"Tragyrion\\" or , \\"Tragourion\\" \\"Trogkir\\") is a historic town and harbour on the Adriatic coast in Split-Dalmatia County, Croatia, with a population of 10,818 (2011) and a total municipality population of 13,260 (2011).

Parts of Venice are renowned for the beauty of their settings, their architecture, and artwork. The lagoon and a part of the city are listed as a World Heritage Site. - Croats are a nation and South Slavic ethnic group at the crossroads of Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean Sea. Croats mainly live in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, but are an officially recognized minority in Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, and Slovakia. Responding to political, social and economic pressure, many Croats have migrated throughout Europe (especially Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France and Italy) and the Americas (particularly the United States, Canada, Argentina, and Chile), establishing a diaspora. - A palace is a grand residence, especially a royal residence, or the home of a head of state or some other high-ranking dignitary, such as a bishop or archbishop. - The Republic of Venice, or traditionally known as the Most Serene Republic of Venice, was a state originating from the lagoon communities in the area of Venice, now northeastern Italy. It existed from the late seventh century AD until 1797. Although it had a long history of war and conquest, the republic's modern reputation is chiefly based on its status as an economic and trading power. - An arrowslit (often also referred to as an arrow loop, loophole or loop hole, and sometimes a balistraria) is a thin vertical aperture in a fortification through which an archer can launch arrows. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Croatia, officially the Republic of Croatia, is a sovereign state between Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean. Its capital city is Zagreb, which forms one of the country's primary subdivisions, along with its twenty counties. Croatia covers and has diverse, mostly continental and Mediterranean climates. Croatia's Adriatic Sea coast contains more than a thousand islands. The country's population is 4.28 million, most of whom are Croats, with the most common religious denomination being Roman Catholicism. - A mediterranean climate or dry summer climate is the climate typical of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin. The lands around the Mediterranean Sea form the largest area where this climate type is found, but it also is found in most of coastal California, in parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa, sections of Central Asia, and in central Chile. - Split-Dalmatia County is the central-southern Dalmatian county in Croatia.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: I have been preparing our house for the market and in doing so, I have gotten rid of a lot of stuff! I am definitely the hoarder in our house. My husband could live out of two bags, use about five kitchen items each year, and doesn’t gather anything for future use or hang on to much for sentimental value. (Which probably means the items he has hung on to mean a whole lot more!) I am always tucking something away here or stashing materials there…all in preparation for “some day.” It’s also part of the teacher in me. Do you know many teachers that don’t have a ton of stuff or utilize every bit of storage available? But, over the last several years, I’ve been fairly good about going through things every six months and weeding out a little here and a little there. Today I’ll be sharing six simple ways to declutter your home and why you should! GIVE THINGS AWAY It’s nice to make money, but sometimes you come across something that you really think someone else could use and you don’t want to throw it away. If it’s the perfect fit for that person, they may adopt the item and add their own wear and tear! Anyone that’s had children knows that kids go through things so fast and it’s nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative. If the receiver decides they don’t want the item, let it be. They’ll either get rid of it on their own or decline the offer. If they choose the latter, maybe the rest of this list will help. PACK If you know you don’t want to purge an item from your house AND you know that you will use it in the future, but it’s not an everyday use item, pack it up. We have several containers of things in our garage that are full of items we use once or twice each year. I have added close to 100 boxes of things to simply declutter our home while it’s on the market. I took a look at everything and kept the essentials (well, maybe even more than the essentials), and packed up the rest.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible. Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM, Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings, Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\").

What is the solution to this math problem? Solve 0 = 3*a + 8*a - 2*a for a.","completion":"The given mathematical equation is 0 = 3*a + 8*a - 2*a. The first step is to simplify the equation. To do this, we need to add and subtract like terms, in this case, the \\"a\\" terms. When we add 3*a, 8*a, and -2*a together, we get 0 = 9a (3 + 8 - 2 = 9, and each of these coefficients is multiplied by 'a'). The simplified equation is 0 = 9a. Next, we need to solve this equation for \\"a\\". We can do this by isolating \\"a\\" on one side of the equation. Since the equation is currently in the form of 0 = 9a, we can isolate 'a' by dividing both sides of the equation by 9. 0/9 = 9a/9. 0 = a. So, the solution for the equation 0 = 3*a + 8*a - 2*a is a = 0. Remember, zero divided by any number gives zero, and this is why no matter what number you choose for 'a' (in this case 0), the sum of the equation will be zero (since everything is multiplied by 'a'). If you test the solution by plugging a = 0 back into the original equation, it should hold true: 0 = 3*(0) + 8*(0) - 2*(0), 0 = 0 + 0 - 0, 0 = 0. which proves that the solution (a = 0) is correct."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

We know that the man covers the boundary of the park at 12 km/hr and takes 8 minutes to complete one round. Convert minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 8 minutes = 8/60 hours = 1/7.5 hours Calculate the distance covered (perimeter) in one round: Perimeter = speed × time P = 12 × (1/7.5) = 12/7.5 km Convert the perimeter to meters: P = (12/7.5) × 1000 = 1600 m Since the ratio of length to breadth is 1:4, let the length be x and the breadth be 4x. The perimeter can be expressed as: P = 2(length + breadth) 1600 = 2(x + 4x) Divide by 2: 800 = 5x Solve for x: x = 160 Now we know the length (x) as 160 m, and the breadth (4x) as 640 m.

What defines it is its online distribution on the web, or through video-sharing web sites such as Vimeo or YouTube. While there is no set standard for length, most webisodes are relatively short, ranging from 315 minutes in length. It is a single web episode, but collectively is part of a web series, a form called web television that characteristically features a dramatic, serial storyline, where the primary method of viewership is streaming online over the Internet.

This woman had not been very supportive of me in my role ever since I began working there. I couldn’t figure out if she was arrogant or lacking in self esteem. During this meeting / confrontation, she told me, in no uncertain terms, just what she didn’t like about some recent decisions I had made. I listened to her speak for about 30 minutes. She, quite methodically, tore me apart. Initially, I had planned to hear her out, make a few vague remarks, and send her on her way, thinking that maybe she just needed to be heard. But about 20 minutes into her harangue, I had a change of heart. I decided that, if she asked for a response for me, if she asked my advice, I was going to tell her exactly what I thought. She did, in fact, ask me for a response. I asked her if she was a happy person, and said that I suspected that she was not, as she came across as a bully and was acting like a horrible person. She sat and looked at me, then burst into tears. I waited. Looking up, she said, “Yes, you are correct. I am a horrible person. And I am miserable. What can I do?” We spent some time discussing what she could do, and (even though I didn’t want to take the time to do it) I asked her if she would like a mentor — me? She said that she would like such a thing. This woman and I ended up becoming fairly, no, very good friends and she has been one of my strongest supporters. I didn’t expect that.

Article: Many years ago in a small German town, a Jewish businessman had the misfortune of owing a large sum of money to the moneylender. The moneylender, who was old and ugly, fancied the businessman's beautiful daughter. So he proposed a bargain. The moneylender told them that he would put a black pebble and a white pebble into an empty bag. The girl would then have to pick one pebble from the bag. If she picked the black pebble, she would become the moneylender's wife and he would _ her father's debt. If she picked the white pebble, she need not marry him and her father's debt would still be forgiven. But if she refused to pick a pebble, her father would be thrown into jail. They were standing on a pebble-strewn path. As they talked, the moneylender bent over to pick up two pebbles. The sharp-eyed girl noticed that he had picked up two black pebbles and put them into the bag. He then asked the girl to pick a pebble from the bag. No doubt she was caught in a dilemma. What would you have done if you were the girl? Careful analysis would produce three possibilities: 1.The girl should refuse to take a pebble. 2.The girl should know that there were two black pebbles in the bag and expose the money-lender as a cheat. 3.The girl should pick a black pebble and sacrifice herself in order to save her father from his debt and imprisonment. The above story is used with the hope that it will make us appreciate the difference between lateral and logical thinking. Read on... The girl put her hand into the moneybag and drew out a pebble. Without looking at it, she fumbled and let it fall onto the pebble-strewn path where it immediately became lost among all the other pebbles. \\"Oh, how clumsy of me!\\" she said. \\"But never mind, if you look into the bag for the one that is left, you will be able to tell which pebble I picked.\\" Since the remaining pebble is black, it must be assumed that she had picked the white one. And since the moneylender dared not admit his dishonesty, the girl changed what seemed an impossible situation into an... Question: What lesson can we learn from the story? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Thinking about a complicated problem in another way.\\"? A:","completion":"Yes, the answer \\"Thinking about a complicated problem in another way\\" is correct. The lesson we can learn from the story is indeed that sometimes it is beneficial to think about a complicated problem in a different way. The girl in the story did not choose one of the three obvious options presented to her; instead, she came up with an innovative solution that allowed her to avoid a difficult situation. This is an example of lateral thinking, which involves approaching problems from new angles and creatively challenging traditional methods of problem-solving, justifying the lesson learnt from the story."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: Does not fit 2010 4Runner Product review: Even though it says that this product fits a 2010 Runner Limited, there is no way to make it fit without serious modifications to the vehicle. Do not buy it if you have a 2010 4Runner. Answer:","completion":"This review would significantly decrease the chances of me buying the product for several reasons. Firstly, the review clearly states that the product does not fit a 2010 4Runner Limited, despite the product's claim of compatibility with that specific make and model. This indicates that there may be issues with the product's description, which could be a warning sign of other potential inaccuracies or misrepresentations. Secondly, the reviewer's experience highlights the issue of potential required modifications to the vehicle for the product's installation. Making such serious modifications can be both time-consuming and costly, and it may also void the vehicle's warranty. For most consumers, this would be an undesirable situation and could deter them from purchasing the product. Additionally, the strong language used by the reviewer, such as \\"Do not buy it,\\" implies that the reviewer had a negative experience using the product and felt compelled to warn others against making the same mistake. This further reduces the chances of purchasing the product, as potential buyers are likely to be influenced by the negative experiences of others, especially when alternative options may be available. Moreover, since reviews often play a critical role in decision-making for online purchases, potential buyers usually rely on honest and reliable feedback from other customers. If this review was one among many positive reviews, it might have a less significant impact on the purchase decision. However, if this review was representative of a larger trend or if there were similar negative reviews, it would substantially decrease the chances of purchasing the product. In conclusion, the review described above would decrease the chances of buying the product due to concerns about accurate product descriptions, the potential need for serious vehicle modifications, and the negative experiences shared by the reviewer. It is essential to weigh both positive and negative reviews when making a purchase decision, and this particular review would certainly raise alarm bells and prompt further investigation before proceeding with a purchase."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A common type of thread tolerance is the 6H standard, which is used for a range of applications where the accuracy of threads is important for assembly and function. The 6H tolerance standard defines the limits of the size of threads and their corresponding allowances. It is based on the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) system of limits and fits. The ISO 6H tolerance class is defined by the maximum and minimum dimensions of the internal (nut) thread, which ensures that it will correctly engage with an external (bolt) thread in the mating component. The 6H tolerance standard is commonly used for producing threaded fasteners and machine parts for industrial, automotive, and mechanical applications. It provides an appropriate level of precision that ensures reliable and consistent assembly for these types of parts. When a threaded component undergoes coating, it is necessary to ensure that the coating process does not affect the thread tolerance beyond the specified limits. This is because the coating adds an extra layer of material to the component, which can cause the thread dimensions to change. When a threaded part is coated, the coating material needs to be of uniform thickness and conform to the thread profile to avoid affecting the tolerance. In some cases, it may be necessary to adjust the dimensions of the component before coating to account for the thickness of the coating material and ensure that the final part conforms to the 6H tolerance after the coating is applied. In summary, the 6H thread tolerance standard is an important measure to ensure that threaded components maintain their accuracy and fit together correctly after coating. The coating process should be carefully managed, so the final coated product remains within the specified dimensional limits to achieve reliable and consistent assembly and performance."},{"prompt":"Question: Read the following article and select the best answer.

The farming world Akir is threatened by the tyrannical warlord Sador, who rules the sinister Malmori Empire and, his body parts deteriorating, is capturing and appropriating them from others. Sador's huge dreadnaught (nicknamed \\"Hammerhead\\") mounts a \\"Stellar Converter\\", a weapon that turns planets into small stars. He demands that the peaceful Akira submit to him when he returns in \\"seven risings of your red giant\\", or he'll turn his Stellar Converter on their planet. Zed, last of the famous Akira Corsairs, is old and nearly blind. He suggests they hire mercenaries to protect their world. Since Akir lacks valuable resources, its people can offer just food and shelter in payment. Unable to go in person, Zed offers his ship for the job if they can find a pilot. The ship is fast and well-armed, but, despite its AI navigation/tactical computer Nell, cannot defeat Sador alone. Shad, a young man who has piloted the ship and is well known to Nell, volunteers for the recruiting mission. Seeking weapons, Shad goes to the space station of Doctor Hephaestus (perhaps named after the weaponsmith of the Olympians Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades), an old friend of Zed. The station is populated mostly by androids, except for two humans — Hephaestus, whose numerous life support-systems have turned him into a cyborg; and his beautiful daughter Nanelia, who looks after him and the androids. The doctor wants Shad to mate with his daughter, by force if necessary. Shad can't bring himself to abandon his people; he convinces Nanelia to help him escape. She follows in her own ship; although she has no weapons, her highly advanced computer systems might be useful. The two split up to look for more mercenaries.

Please answer a question about the following article about Apollo: A lot of temples dedicated to Apollo were built in Greece and in the Greek colonies, and they show the spread of the cult of Apollo, and the evolution of the Greek architecture, which was mostly based on the rightness of form, and on mathematical relations. Some of the earliest temples, especially in Crete, don't belong to any Greek order. It seems that the first peripteral temples were rectangle wooden structures. The different wooden elements were considered divine, and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of Doric order. The Greeks used standard types, because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances. The temples should be canonic, and the architects were trying to achieve the esthetic perfection. From the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings. The first buildings were narrow to hold the roof, and when the dimensions changed, some mathematical relations became necessary, in order to keep the original forms. This probably influenced the theory of numbers of Pythagoras, who believed that behind the appearance of things, there was the permanent principle of mathematics.

The prosecutor, who figured out Annie was threatened, wants Annie to turn state's witness so they can go after Mark, who now plans to take over Boffano's empire. Annie convinces the prosecutor to let her wear a wire in a scheduled meeting with Mark. Annie removes the wire and gives it to Eddie, insinuating she and Mark are now a couple. Annie then succeeds in getting Mark to incriminate himself in a boastful rant about his ambitions, which she tapes on a hidden tape recorder.

With the convincing victory, Tampa Bay clinched the NFC South division title, maintained a perfect 5-0 division record, and scored their first kickoff return touchdown in franchise history. Tampa Bay's defense recorded the first points of the game, as Ronde Barber intercepted Chris Redman's pass on the third play of the game and returned it 29 yards for a touchdown. Atlanta got on the board next with kicker Morten Andersen making a 33-yard field goal. On the ensuing kickoff, Micheal Spurlock made team history by becoming the first Buccaneer player to return a kickoff for a touchdown. It was the first kickoff return touchdown for Tampa Bay in 32 seasons, 498 games, and 1,865 attempts. After the Buccaneer defense forced a Falcons punt, Jeff Garcia commandeered a long, clock-eating 10-minute drive ending in a 33-yard field goal by Matt Bryant to make the score 17-3. With just over five minutes remaining in the first half, Tampa bay recovered an Atlanta fumble, and Earnest Graham scored a 1-yard TD run. Graham became the first player in club history to score a touchdown in six consecutive games. With a 24-3 lead, Tampa Bay performed a pooch kickoff, and Atlanta muffed the return, while Kalvin Pearson recovered. Tampa Bay drove to the 24-yard line, but DeAngelo Hall intercepted a pass intended for Joey Galloway at the Atlanta 11-yard line. The Buccaneers would immediately regain possession as Greg White forced and recovered a fumble on the next play. Matt Bryant then easily converted a 28-yard field goal to take a 27-3 lead into halftime. Tampa Bay would receive the second half's opening kickoff, but was forced to punt after a 7-minute drive. On Atlanta's third play, Jermaine Phillips intercepted a pass intended for Jerious Norwood which set Tampa Bay up at the Atlanta 23-yard line. Matt Bryant then scored the half's first points with a 34-yard field goal to make the score 30-3. In the fourth quarter, punter Josh Bidwell successfully pinned Atlanta at their own 6-yard line. The resulting poor field position eventually led to Tampa Bay taking over near midfieldied Michael Bennett carried six times all the way to the Atlanta 1-yard line, from which Anthony Becht scored the game's final points off a 1-yard TD catch. Statistically, Tampa Bay's defense dominated Atlanta. The Falcons managed only 133 yards of total offense, committed five turnovers, and were 0-for-9 on third down conversions. The Falcons crossed midfield only once, and Tampa Bay's time of possession was 43 minutes. On the following Wednesday, the kickoff return touchdown earned Spurlock the NFC Special Teams Player of the Week award.","completion":"What happened in the game between the Buccaneers and the Atlanta Falcons that made Micheal Spurlock the first player in Tampa Bay's history to return a kickoff for a touchdown, and how did this help the Buccaneers win the game?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On the left side, combine the constant terms, -913 and 2701, and on the right side, combine the constant terms, 120 and -3348. -114w + (-913 + 2701) = (120 - 3348) -114w + 1788 = -3228 Step 2: Isolate the variable term (w). Subtract 1788 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable (w) on one side. -114w + 1788 - 1788 = -3228 - 1788 -114w = -5016 Step 3: Solve for the variable (w).

At a dedication ceremony for Nelson III, John hops into Nelson's BMW, steals his change, spits in his coffee and uses up his inhaler. In the BMW after the ceremony, Nelson IV yells at his attorney (who has the speakerphone on in the fully occupied board room), starts to sing, and when he goes for the inhaler, finds it empty. He stops at a pharmacy, panicked, and starts knocking items off the shelf in an attempt to find a replacement inhaler. The pharmacy owners think he's another junkie robber, and that the inhaler he finally finds is a tiny pistol, and call the police. Nelson ends up convicted on that robbery and demands that the Biederman foundation call the governor to dismiss his charges. Even though the governor owes the foundation a favor, the board of directors decide to let Nelson go to prison as they have grown tired of his asinine deportment.

I’ve been trying out two new ones to see which I prefer. In the red corner we have MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil and in the blue corner we have NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil. So let’s get ready to rumble while I put them through their paces…. Although the packaging of these two is quite similar the formulation and finish of the lip colours are very different – MAC Patent Polish is a light gloss and NARS Velvet Matte has a stark matte finish. So whether you prefer your lips sheer and glossy or pigmented and matte there should be something for everyone here. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil – this is the first lip pencil that I’ve tried from MAC (apart from lip liner) and I’m really impressed with it. As the name suggests the finish is a very shiny gloss that gives an almost patent shine, it has the feel of a lip gloss but it’s not sticky. The colour is called Spontaneous, MAC describe it as a ‘soft plum with pearl’. It’s definitely a plummy shade, although I can’t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it’s very sheer it appears much more natural once it’s on the lips. It’s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you’re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm! The crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it. I love to apply MAC Patent Polish straight from the crayon, it’s quick and easy, and as it’s very light and sheer it’s easy to wipe away any mistakes and re-apply.

Conjugation, in the much-studied E. coli system is determined by plasmid genes, and is an adaptation for transferring copies of the plasmid from one bacterial host to another. It is seldom that a conjugative plasmid integrates into the host bacterial chromosome, and subsequently transfers part of the host bacterial DNA to another bacterium. Plasmid-mediated transfer of host bacterial DNA also appears to be an accidental process rather than a bacterial adaptation. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): How does conjugation take place?","completion":"Alright, let's imagine bacteria are like tiny little houses, and plasmids are like the letters they send to their neighbors. Conjugation is like a way for these houses to share their letters with each other. When two little houses (bacteria) decide to share their letters (plasmids), they build a tiny bridge between them called a pilus. With the help of this bridge, the letters can move from one house to the other. This is how conjugation takes place. Oftentimes, these letters aren't super important, but sometimes they can give the houses new skills or abilities, like helping them protect themselves from medicines we use to clean up the neighborhood. So, conjugation is a way for bacteria to share small parts of themselves, like letters, or plasmids, that might help them out in certain situations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: what is Polyester in packaging PET I found the following answer on Google: The majority of the world's PET production is for synthetic fibers (in excess of 60%), with bottle production accounting for around 30% of global demand. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no.","completion":"Yes, the statement you found on Google is correct. However, I would like to provide more detailed information to help you better understand Polyester in packaging PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate). Polyester is a broad term that comprises a large family of polymers with a similar structure. In the context of packaging, the term \\"Polyester\\" typically refers to polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which is a popular thermoplastic polymer resin. PET is known for its versatility and is used in various applications due to its lightweight, strength, transparency, and resistance to moisture and gases. As the Google search result mentions, approximately 60% of the PET production worldwide is for synthetic fibers, and around 30% is for bottle production. This leaves a smaller percentage for other applications, such as packaging materials, engineering resins, and films. Here's a more detailed breakdown of PET's uses: 1. Synthetic fibers: PET is widely used in the textile industry for producing synthetic fibers like polyester. This material has desirable properties such as wrinkle resistance, quick-drying ability, and low moisture absorbency, which makes it ideal for apparel, home furnishings, automotive interiors, and industrial applications. 2. Bottle production: PET's properties make it suitable for producing rigid containers, especially bottles. The 30% PET production share for bottles consists mostly of single-use containers for food and beverages, such as water, soda, juice, and condiments. PET bottles are lightweight, shatter-resistant, and provide an effective barrier for gases and moisture, ensuring the contents' freshness and quality. 3. Food packaging materials: PET is also used in food packaging materials like trays, clamshell containers, and film wraps. Its protective features make it a suitable option for fresh produce, pre-packaged meals, and baked goods. Furthermore, PET is an FDA-approved material for food contact applications, ensuring its safety in food packaging. 4. Engineering resins: PET's high strength, dimensional stability, and resistance to wear make it an attractive material for engineering applications. This includes parts for automotive applications, electrical components, and other consumer products. 5. Films and sheets: Transparent or semi-transparent PET films and sheets are also produced for various purposes, such as flexible food packaging, photographic film, and electronic components. In summary, the information you found is accurate, but it is essential to understand that PET is a versatile material with a wide range of applications. While synthetic fibers and bottle production form the majority of its usage, PET also plays a significant role in food packaging materials, engineering resins, and films for diverse industries."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN) -- It's called the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, and weeks before authorities say he got on a plane with a bomb, Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab was in it. The vast government databank, known as TIDE, is administered by the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center. It contains information about hundreds of thousands of people, the majority of them foreign nationals, who are suspected of having terrorist leanings. An FBI official said AbdulMutallab was included in TIDE after his father warned the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria of his son's hard-line beliefs and possible ties to militant Islamists. To understand how he could have been under the government's scrutiny and still make it onto a U.S.-bound plane with an explosive, you have to understand the way the government's watch list system works. TIDE is just the start. The FBI uses the raw information contained in the TIDE databank to determine whether to put the subject onto the government's terror watch list, known as the Terrorism Screening Data Base. That list contains the names and aliases of about 400,000 people, but AbdulMutallab didn't make the cut. According to Chad Kolton, a spokesman for the FBI's Terror Screening Center, there wasn't enough hard evidence to back up AbdulMutallab's father's fears, and so he wasn't placed on the terror list. The bureau's own Web site spells out the criteria for inclusion in the screening database, saying that \\"only individuals who are known or reasonably suspected to be or have been engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism are included.\\" Based on the article and the following list of answers, write a list of questions. 1. not enough 2.

Фосфолипаза C Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"Phospholipase C Phospholipase C (PLC) is a key enzyme in the field of cellular signaling. It is involved in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into two important secondary messengers: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). These secondary messengers play essential roles in various cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. PLC consists of a large family of enzymes that are divided into six major classes, which include PLC-β, PLC-γ, PLC-δ, PLC-ε, PLC-ζ, and PLC-η, each with multiple isoforms. These PLC enzymes share conserved domains and possess unique regulatory properties. They can be activated by a variety of mechanisms, such as receptor activation, G-protein binding, or phosphorylation. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) is responsible for releasing calcium ions from intracellular stores, which in turn regulate various cellular processes such as muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression. Diacylglycerol (DAG) activates protein kinase C (PKC), a family of serine/threonine kinases that regulate numerous intracellular signaling pathways and cellular events, including cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis. Dysregulation of PLC enzymes has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancers, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying PLC function and regulation is crucial for developing targeted therapeutics to treat these diseases. In summary, phospholipase C is a critical enzyme that functions in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and generates vital secondary messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). These secondary messengers are indispensable for various cellular processes, making PLC a significant player in maintaining cellular function and signaling."},{"prompt":"Q: What explains why two different species cannot occupy the same niche in the same place for very long?

Context: The last action of the war was on the part of the Catalan barons of Roussillon and Cerdagne, which had been assigned to France as surety for war subsidies. The French were only slowly expelled. On 1 February 1473, John entered Perpignan to the joy of its citizens. He placed Catalan garrisons in the castles of Bellegarde, Collioure, and Salses. The French, angered by the abridgement of the treaty of Bayonne, counter-attacked a few weeks later, but some Castilian troops under Prince Ferdinand successfully resisted. John began negotiations that led to a truce in July and a treaty at Perpignan on 17 September. John recognised the treaty of Bayonne in return for French recognition of his sovereignty in the disputed provinces. John agreed to pay 300,000 écus, and Roussillon and Cerdagne were proclaimed \\"neutral\\" until the payment was made. John returned to Barcelona triumphant, but failed to raise the necessary funds. In the summer of 1474 the French conquered Roussillon and March 1475 Perpignan fell to them. The French raided the Empordà as far as Girona in 1476, and John, his allies tied up by their own wars, could not even oppose them. In October 1478 he ceded the two provinces to France until he could redeem them with cash. Revolts against his authority flared in Aragon and Valencia, which had stayed out of the civil war, and he failed to put them down. He did succeed in quashing a revolt in Sardinia.

WHITE HOUSE — An audio recording was released Monday depicting children desperately crying and begging for their parents after being separated from them by U.S. immigration authorities at its southwestern border, sparking new outrage against the Trump administration and its new \\"zero-tolerance policy\\" towards illegal immigrants. The nearly eight-minute long recording was released by ProPublica, an independent, investigative news site. ProPublica says an unidentified whistleblower passed on the recording to a civil rights attorney, who gave it to the website. Among the disturbing sounds heard on the recording was a child identified by ProPublica as a six-year-old girl from El Salvador begging authorities in Spanish to call her aunt to pick her up from the detention center. At one point in the audio, a man identified as a Border Patrol agent said in Spanish over the cries of scores of children: \\"Well, we have an orchestra here. What's missing is a conductor.\\" President Donald Trump defended his administration's policy of forcibly separating children from parents at the U.S. border with Mexico on Monday, saying “The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility.\\" Trump, speaking in the White House East Room during a National Space Council meeting, warned that “what’s happening in Europe … we can’t allow that to happen to the United States – not on my watch.” Earlier in the day, on the Twitter social media platform, the president inaccurately linked migration in Germany to a rising crime rate. (Actually, the latest German government statistics show reported crimes at the lowest level in 30 years.) Nearly 2,000 children were sent to mass detention centers or foster care from mid-April to the end of May, according to government officials. The regular White House briefing was delayed several times Monday amid the furor as officials huddled with Trump in the West Wing. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders finally introduced Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen...

Start with the given equation: 2020 = -29*y + 1034 2. Subtract 1034 from both sides of the equation to move the constant term to the other side: 2020 - 1034 = -29*y + 1034 - 1034 3. Simplify the equation after subtraction: 986 = -29*y 4. To isolate y, divide both sides of the equation by -29: 986 / -29 = (-29*y) / -29 5. Simplify the equation after division: y = -34 So the solution to the equation 2020 = -29*y + 1034 is y = -34."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What region are both Adenophora and Pterostyrax native to?

Movie title: Hit and Run Movie plot: The film opens as Mary Murdock (Laura Breckenridge), a young student, leaves a lively party at a club in New Jersey one night. She hits a bad bump driving home drunk on a dark road. Later, hearing noises in the garage, she finds a bleeding man, mangled and impaled on her jeep's bumper. Not calling 911, she tries to help, but he suddenly attacks. Panicked, she hits him with a golf club. After that, she buries his body in a shallow grave in the woods off Clover Rd. The next day, Mary covers up the crime (before parents return from a weekend trip); she scrubs off the blood but doesn't get the dent fixed (a suspicious cop at the auto shop scares her off, then she detours for her grandmas parrots at airport cargo). Mary starts coming apart. Irrational, she crashes on a tree to camouflage the small dent with a bigger dent. Later the news reveals the missing man is kindergarten teacher Timothy Emser (Kevin Corrigan), bipolar and unstable when he vanished. Strange things occur in Mary's house, making her feel toyed with by someone unseen; she descends into paranoia. It transpires that Rick (Christopher Shand), her boyfriend, gets involved in the cover up and goes to retrieve incriminatory evidence (a blanket) off the corpse, but is killed, replaced in Emser's grave. It becomes clear Emser survived. Unhinged, he returns to make Mary live through the same nightmare she inflicted on him. He stalks Mary many ways. The parrots squawk strange phrases, which alert Mary. At one point, she falls down the stairs, impaling a screw driver in her thigh. Emser surprise attacks, biting and stabbing her, and she passes out. In a reversal, when Mary revives, Emser has strapped her to the bumper with electric cords and Christmas lights and takes her on a sadistic, all-night \\"revenge drive\\".

Write a dialog with this premise \\"There is a conflict between Japan and Russia about Kuril Islands.\\".","completion":"In this dialog, I will represent the positions of both Japan and Russia regarding the Kuril Islands dispute. I'll create two characters - a Japanese diplomat (J.D.) and a Russian diplomat (R.D.) - to serve as vehicles for their respective countries' viewpoints. Step 1: Establishing a setting and beginning the conversation between the diplomats. Step 2: Outlining the issue of the Kuril Islands conflict. Step 3: Presenting the Japanese perspective on the issue. Step 4: Presenting the Russian perspective on the issue. Step 5: Exploring potential solutions or a compromise. --- Setting: A diplomatic meeting has been organized between Japan and Russia to discuss the long-standing territorial dispute over the ownership of the Kuril Islands. J.D.: Thank you for meeting with me today to discuss the ongoing conflict over the Kuril Islands. As you know, this has been a contentious issue for both of our countries for decades. R.D.: Indeed, it is important that our two countries come together to address this issue and find a resolution that can promote peace and harmony in our region. Step 2: Outlining the issue of the Kuril Islands conflict. J.D.: For some historical context, Japan maintains that its sovereignty over the four southernmost islands - Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan, and Habomai - was established in the 19th century. However, after World War II, the Soviet Union claimed control over these islands. R.D.: Yes, that's correct. The Soviet Union gained control under the Yalta Agreement in February 1945 and later, after Japan's surrender, added the islands to Soviet territory in accordance with the Potsdam Declaration. Step 3: Presenting the Japanese perspective on the issue. J.D.: Japan believes that the Soviet Union's actions violated the internationally accepted principles of territorial change following the end of World War II. We argue that the islands are an inherent part of Japanese territory and their seizure was a clear violation of our sovereignty. R.D.: I understand your concerns, but let's consider Russia's perspective on this matter too. Step 4: Presenting the Russian perspective on the issue. R.D.: The Russian Federation, as the successor state to the Soviet Union, has maintained control over the islands for over 70 years. We consider the post-WWII settlement as legitimate and binding, so the ownership of the Kuril Islands should not be in question. Moreover, there are residents on these islands who consider themselves Russian, and their rights need to be protected as well. Step 5: Exploring potential solutions or a compromise. J.D.: While our countries have not yet reached a resolution on this matter, we must find a way to ease tensions in the region and create a more cooperative environment. Has your government considered options such as joint economic activities on the islands, or any other forms of collaboration? R.D.: We are open to such possibilities and have even discussed a peace treaty in the past. However, resolving the territorial issue will require sincere negotiations and mutual understanding. A compromise that respects both sides' positions and historical ties to this region must be achieved, but it may take time. J.D.: Indeed, a delicate and thoughtful approach is necessary for this complex conflict. I look forward to further discussions and potential solutions that can bring our two nations closer to a resolution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

But very annoying. I had met a woman. Actually, at 19, she was still a girl. I lived in Pittsburgh. She lived in London, Ontario. She was, to put it bluntly, hotter than hell. On top of that, she’s one of the sweetest, nicest people you were ever going to meet. Needless to say, I was quite smitten, and quickly arranged to spend a week in London with her. When I showed up, she was wearing very interesting pajamas. At least for a few minutes. Unfortunately, my two cats, who had never spent a night in my home without me being there, were, less than impressed when I didn’t show up by 5 PM the day I left, despite having arranged for one of my parents to come over each day to feed them and make sure they had water, etc. Playing with them was optional, but neither would show themselves during that week. Nothing looked amiss on the first floor to Mom or Dad. The food was eaten, the water, apparently drunk, etc. When I got home and went upstairs I found something quite different. There was a trail of toilette paper strewn all over the hallway. My pillow was in the bedroom door and shredded. My alarm clock was on the floor. The power cord had been pulled from the wall and chewed through. There were several…uhmmm… “presents” in the middle of the bed, where they had pulled the sheets back. Some of them were still wet.

According to the clip's YouTube description, the two fishermen were about five miles off Point Loma when they first noticed some animals beneath their boat. It wasn't until the the orcas were very close that they realized exactly what they were dealing with. Once the men noticed that the animals were orcas, they took off in their 20-foot fishing boat, which easily could have been flipped by the whales. The fishermen say in the video description that the pod consisted of approximately 30 whales, although only a few can be seen in the clip. The whales chased the boat and continued to jumped out of the water as it sped off; a few times the whales even came just a few feet from the boat. Fortunately, the whales did not attempt to flip the boat, and the men made it back to land safely. Orca whales, which are actually from the dolphin family, travel and hunt in pods which can consist of up to thirty whales.

It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it.

Movie plot title: The Spy Who Loved Me Movie plot: British and Soviet ballistic-missile submarines are mysteriously disappearing. James BondâMI6 agent 007âis summoned to investigate. On the way to his briefing, he escapes an ambush by Soviet agents in Austria, killing their leader during a downhill ski chase. The plans for a highly advanced submarine tracking system are being offered in Egypt. There, he encounters Major Anya AmasovaâKGB agent Triple Xâhis rival to recover the microfilm plans.

A:","completion":"A: \\"Voi che sapete\\" is an aria sung by the character Cherubino in the opera \\"The Marriage of Figaro\\" (Le Nozze di Figaro) by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The opera, composed in 1786, is based on a libretto by Lorenzo Da Ponte, which in turn is adapted from the stage comedy \\"Le Mariage de Figaro\\" by Pierre Beaumarchais. In the opera, Cherubino is a young, lovesick page whose feelings for the Countess are expressed through this beautiful aria. The character Cherubino is a role typically performed by a mezzo-soprano or a soprano in a \\"breeches role,\\" which means that a female singer plays the part of a male character. This type of role is also known as a \\"trouser role\\" or \\"pants role.\\" Some of the famous mezzo-sopranos who have performed the role of Cherubino and sung the aria \\"Voi che sapete\\" include Frederica von Stade, Cecilia Bartoli, Susan Graham, and Joyce DiDonato, among many others. The aria \\"Voi che sapete\\" starts with Cherubino seeking advice from the Countess and Susanna – \\"Voi che sapete,\\" which translates to \\"You who know\\" – on the subject of love. Throughout the aria, Cherubino describes his feelings of passion, confusion, and longing, and asks the ladies to understand his situation and guide him. The Marriage of Figaro is a cornerstone of the standard operatic repertoire and is frequently performed today, making the character of Cherubino and the aria \\"Voi che sapete\\" beloved highlights of the opera for both singers and audiences alike.

A young idealistic schoolteacher named Ruth Kirke is transporting a group of war orphans from South China to Calcutta when their steamship Tollare is torpedoed and sunk in the Pacific. Along with sailor Timothy Blake, they are the only passengers to survive the enemy attack. They are picked up by the steamship Westonia and taken to San Francisco, where immigration officials inform Ruth that the orphans will be held until a 500 bond is posted for each child. With no money of their own, Ruth and Timothy go to the home of Commodore Thomas Spencer Holliday, the wealthy owner of their sunken cargo ship, who perished during the torpedo attack. When they appeal for financial assistance for the orphans, the commodore's family refuses. Desperate to help the children, Timothy tells the commodore's family that Ruth and the commodore were married aboard the Tollare before it was attacked. With the children's future at stake, Ruth reluctantly goes along with the deception. Ruth, Timothy, and the eight orphans move into the Holliday mansion, where they soon meet the commodore's grandson, Thomas Spencer Holliday III. When a sceptical Tom questions Ruth about how she became his grandmother, Ruth explains that her Christian mission was destroyed in a Japanese bombing raid, and that she was sent south with eight European children, entrusted with their safety.

Two years later he raturned to his home town and found a job at the police station. People had known about his bravery by then and they all liked the polite young man.

These functions include providing energy for daily activities, maintaining body temperature, supporting growth and repair, and sustaining essential biological processes. When you consume calories, your body either uses them for immediate energy or stores them for later use. If the body has met its immediate energy needs, it will store the excess calories for future use. This storage primarily occurs in the form of glycogen in the liver and muscles and as fat in adipose tissue. In cases of prolonged calorie surplus, the body can expand its fat stores, which may lead to weight gain.

When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. “It is the key to self improvement!”, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don’t quite practice what they preach. Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the label that came after Zappa discontinued his old one in 1973? Zappa then formed and toured with smaller groups that variously included Ian Underwood (reeds, keyboards), Ruth Underwood (vibes, marimba), Sal Marquez (trumpet, vocals), Napoleon Murphy Brock (sax, flute and vocals), Bruce Fowler (trombone), Tom Fowler (bass), Chester Thompson (drums), Ralph Humphrey (drums), George Duke (keyboards, vocals), and Jean-Luc Ponty (violin). By 1973 the Bizarre and Straight labels were discontinued. In their place, Zappa and Cohen created DiscReet Records, also distributed by Warner Bros. Zappa continued a high rate of production through the first half of the 1970s, including the solo album Apostrophe (') (1974), which reached a career-high No. 10 on the Billboard pop album charts helped by the No. 86 chart hit \\"Don't Eat The Yellow Snow\\". Other albums from the period are Over-Nite Sensation (1973), which contained several future concert favorites, such as \\"Dinah-Moe Humm\\" and \\"Montana\\", and the albums Roxy & Elsewhere (1974) and One Size Fits All (1975) which feature ever-changing versions of a band still called the Mothers, and are notable for the tight renditions of highly difficult jazz fusion songs in such pieces as \\"Inca Roads\\", \\"Echidna's Arf (Of You)\\" and \\"Be-Bop Tango (Of the Old Jazzmen's Church)\\". A live recording from 1974, You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 2 (1988), captures \\"the full spirit and excellence of the 1973–75 band\\". Zappa released Bongo Fury (1975), which featured a live recording at the Armadillo World Headquarters in Austin from a tour the same year that reunited him with Captain Beefheart for a brief period.

Question: Build a movie plot around this: What prize does Haber win in 1918? Nobel Prize Answer:","completion":"Title: The Prize of Irony Step 1: Introduce the Main Character The movie's protagonist is Dr. Fritz Haber, a brilliant German chemist renowned for his expertise in chemistry and scientific methodology. He is a complex character, as his discoveries have both beneficial and destructive consequences. Step 2: Establish the Setting and Context The plot revolves around World War I (1914-1918) in Germany. During this time, the country suffers from both internal division and external challenges from neighboring nations. Amidst the political turmoil and warfare, Haber remains dedicated to his research and longs for a great scientific breakthrough that could bring him prestige and accolades. Step 3: Setup the Central Conflict As the war intensifies, Haber finds himself torn between his loyalty to the German Empire and his commitment to scientific progress. Seeking to serve his nation, Haber uses his research in developing new methods of chemical warfare. However, he also grapples with the ethical implications of these creations. Step 4: Incorporate Subplots Intertwining subplots include Haber's strained relationship with his family, particularly his wife Clara (also a scientist), who staunchly opposes Haber's involvement in chemical weaponry. Furthermore, the political situation in post-war Germany affects Haber's career, and his scientific endeavors' ethical dilemmas cause division among his contemporaries. Step 5: Escalation The movie explores the far-reaching impact of Haber's discoveries, particularly the widespread use of chemical gas in warfare. As conflicts escalate, so do the devastating consequences of Haber's research, presenting profound moral questions about the cost of scientific achievement. Step 6: Climax In 1918, Haber learns he's been awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, recognizing his crucial work in synthesizing ammonia, a feat that allowed for the large-scale production of explosives and artificial fertilizers. The announcement of the award comes as both a moment of triumph and emotional turmoil for Haber, who must grapple with the knowledge that his work has wrought both great advancement and destruction. Step 7: Resolution Ultimately, Haber's internal struggle and the increasing condemnation from his peers and loved ones force him to reassess the value of his pursuits and examine the true meaning of human progress. As tensions and controversies continue to surround his work, the movie concludes with Haber stepping down from his prominent position, crippled by the moral weight of the Nobel Prize he once eagerly sought. Justification: By focusing on Haber's central conflict between scientific ambition and ethical responsibility, the movie plot explores the complexities of human nature and the price of progress. His Nobel Prize-winning achievement serves as a powerful catalyst for the movie's climax and resolution, allowing both acknowledgement of his contributions and critical examination of their consequences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: This article: St Kilda (Scottish Gaelic: Hiort) is an isolated archipelago situated 64 kilometres (40 mi) west-northwest of North Uist, in the North Atlantic Ocean. It contains the westernmost islands of the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. The largest island is Hirta, whose sea cliffs are the highest in the United Kingdom. Three other islands (Dùn, Soay and Boreray) were also used for grazing and seabird hunting. The islands are administratively a part of the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar local authority area.The origin of the name St Kilda is a matter of conjecture. The islands' human heritage includes numerous unique architectural features from the historic and prehistoric periods, although the earliest written records of island life date from the Late Middle Ages. The medieval village on Hirta was rebuilt in the 19th century, but illnesses brought by increased external contacts through tourism, and the upheaval of the First World War contributed to the island's evacuation in 1930. The story of St Kilda has attracted artistic interpretations, including Michael Powell's film The Edge of the World and an opera.Permanent habitation on the islands possibly extends back at least two millennia, the population probably never exceeding 180 (and certainly no more than 100 after 1851). The entire remaining population was evacuated from Hirta (the only inhabited island) in 1930. The islands house a unique form of stone structure known as cleitean. A cleit is a stone storage hut or bothy; whilst many are still to be found, they are slowly falling into disrepair. There are known to be 1,260 cleitean on Hirta and a further 170 on the other group islands. Currently, the only year-round residents are military personnel; a variety of conservation workers, volunteers and scientists spend time there in the summer months.The entire archipelago is owned by the National Trust for Scotland. It became one of Scotland's six World Heritage Sites in 1986, and is one of the few in the world to hold mixed status for both its natural and cultural qualities.... contains an answer for the question: What archipelago has the highest sea cliffs in the United Kingdom., what is it ?

Answer: Unicode has the explicit aim of transcending the limitations of traditional character encodings, such as those defined by the ISO 8859 standard, which find wide usage in various countries of the world but remain largely incompatible with each other. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"Answer: Traditional character encodings, such as those defined by the ISO 8859 standard, do not allow for extensive multilingual computer processing. These encodings were initially designed to represent the characters of a specific language or a group of languages with similar alphabets in a compact manner. Each encoding typically supports less than 256 characters, which is insufficient to cover the vast range of characters and scripts found in the world's languages. These limitations pose several challenges when processing text data in a globalized environment. Some of the issues with traditional character encodings include: 1. Incompatibility: Each character encoding is designed to represent a specific set of characters from one or multiple languages, but is generally incompatible with other character encodings. This can cause difficulties in transmitting and displaying text data across different platforms and systems. 2. Limited character representation: Traditional character encodings cannot adequately represent many languages, particularly those with large character sets such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. This hampers the processing of multilingual text and the development of software and applications in these languages. 3. Ambiguity: Some traditional character encodings assign different meanings to the same byte value, leading to potential ambiguities in text interpretation. This can result in data corruption and incorrect text rendering. 4. Difficulty in expansion: Traditional character encodings offer limited scope for adding new characters or scripts, as the maximum number of characters that can be represented is often constrained by the available code space (usually 8-bit, allowing for 256 characters). In order to overcome these limitations and enable seamless multilingual computer processing, Unicode was developed as a uniform encoding system. Unicode is designed to represent virtually all characters in every written language, enabling a consistent and unambiguous representation of text data from around the world. By using Unicode, developers can build applications that support multiple languages without having to navigate the complex landscape of traditional character encodings, facilitating more efficient and universal text processing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- It is always risky to make predictions about the Supreme Court's decisions based on what is or is not said by lawyers and justices at oral argument. It is also almost impossible to resist the temptation to hunt through the transcripts for clues and tea leaves. On Wednesday, the justices heard arguments in a case called Town of Greece v. Galloway, which involves a challenge to a small New York town's practice of opening its board meetings with short prayers, delivered by volunteers. A lower federal court ruled last year that the town of Greece's prayers -- but not necessarily all legislative prayers -- violate the First Amendment's rule against \\"establishments\\" of religion. A decision by the court to uphold the town board's prayers in Greece will probably not clear up all the questions about or patch up all the holes in the court's","completion":"doctrine on prayer and religious practices in governmental settings, but it may provide essential guidance to municipalities and other bodies looking to comply with the First Amendment without quashing religious expression altogether. In evaluating past prayer and religion-related court cases, such as Marsh v. Chambers (1983), which upheld opening prayers in state legislatures, and Lee v. Weisman (1992), which struck down clergy-led prayers at public-school graduations, the court has employed the \\"endorsement test.\\" This test asks whether the prayers leave the perception that the government endorses one religion over another or religion in general over non-religion, thereby violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Throughout the oral arguments, the justices wrestled with several issues: whether the town's prayers were overwhelmingly sectarian, how it could better achieve diversity in its prayer practices, and where the line between permissible and impermissible prayers could be drawn. As the case unfolds, various positions emerge among the justices. Some, like Justice Alito, indicate they could be sympathetic to the town's argument that it has made significant efforts to be inclusive, while others like Justice Kagan express concern about the town's predominantly Christian prayer practices. Justice Kennedy, often a swing vote on the court, raises the question of whether it is possible to formulate non-sectarian or non-proselytizing prayers that would satisfy the concerns of the challengers while preserving the town's tradition. Analyzing the various opinions and questions posed by the justices, it seems likely that the court will issue a decision that will balance the interests of maintaining religious diversity and inclusivity without trampling on the historical practice of legislative prayer. One possible outcome is that the court will uphold the town's prayers but require modifications to broaden the pool of volunteer prayer-givers and ensure that prayers are not predominantly sectarian or proselytizing, in line with the endorsement test. This middle-ground solution would provide a more clear-cut and manageable standard for other localities to follow, preventing confusion and potential discriminatory practices. Ultimately, the court's ruling in Town of Greece v. Galloway will reaffirm the delicate relationship between religious freedom and the prohibition on government endorsement of religion. While it may not resolve all the ambiguities surrounding prayer in public settings, it is likely to provide guidance to governments on how to strike a balance between upholding religious expression and respecting the diverse beliefs of their citizens."},{"prompt":"Ash was tested for a breast cancer gene, so Ash reduced their risk by getting a mastectomy.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"The answers to both questions cannot be answered by choosing either [a]. no or [b]. yes, as these questions require detailed information. Below, I will provide long and detailed answers to both questions asked: Question 1: How Common is HIV in the US? HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks the immune system. In the United States, HIV remains a significant public health issue. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 1.2 million people aged 13 and older in the US were living with HIV at the end of 2018. Each year, there are about 36,400 new HIV infections in the United States. Certain populations are disproportionately affected by HIV. For example, gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men made up about 69% of new HIV diagnoses in 2018. Moreover, African Americans and Hispanic/Latino individuals are also disproportionately affected, with African Americans accounting for 42% of new HIV diagnoses, and Hispanic/Latinos accounting for 27% in the same year. Efforts to reduce the number of new HIV infections and improve the health outcomes for people living with HIV have been increasingly emphasized in recent years, including the implementation of routine HIV testing, the promotion of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and better access to healthcare and support services. Question 2: How does HIV occur? HIV is a retrovirus that primarily affects the human immune system, specifically targeting CD4+ T-cells, which play a critical role in the body's immune responses. It is transmitted through the exchange of certain bodily fluids, including blood, semen, vaginal and rectal fluids, and breast milk. Here are the main ways through which HIV transmission can occur: 1. Sexual transmission: HIV can be transmitted through contact with infected semen or vaginal and rectal fluids during unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Using condoms, dental dams, and other barrier methods can significantly reduce the risk of transmission. 2. Mother-to-child transmission: HIV can be transmitted from an HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. Appropriate antiretroviral treatment and other preventive measures can significantly reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission. 3. Injection drug use: Sharing needles, syringes, or other injection equipment with someone infected with HIV can result in the transmission of the virus. Harm reduction strategies like needle exchange programs and the use of sterile injection supplies can help lower the risk of transmission. 4. Occupational exposure: Healthcare workers are at risk of exposure to HIV through needlestick injuries or contact with infected bodily fluids. Adherence to universal safety precautions, like wearing gloves and other personal protective equipment, can minimize this risk. 5. Blood transfusions and organ transplants: HIV can be transmitted through blood transfusions, organ/tissue transplants, or artificial insemination from an infected donor. However, since the early 1990s, improved screening procedures for blood and organ donations have made the risk of acquiring HIV through these routes extremely low in the United States. HIV does NOT spread through casual contact, air or water, saliva, sweat, tears, or closed-mouth kissing, sharing toilet seats, or through insects like mosquitoes. In conclusion, the answers to both questions cannot be reduced to a simple yes or no, as they require detailed information on the prevalence of HIV in the US and the methods of transmission for the virus."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does \\"Hydrogen is commonly used in power stations as a coolant in generators due to a number of favorable properties that are a direct result of its light diatomic molecules.\\" correctly answer the question of What are these properties?","completion":"The given statement provides an overview of hydrogen's application in power stations as a coolant in generators, mentioning that this usage stems from the favorable properties of its light diatomic molecules. However, it does not explicitly list or describe these properties. To answer the question, \\"What are these properties?\\", a more detailed and comprehensive response is needed. Hydrogen's beneficial properties for cooling power stations' generators are: 1. Light diatomic molecular structure: Hydrogen molecules consist of two hydrogen atoms (H2) that are bound together, making it the lightest molecule. This light molecular weight allows for greater mobility, lower density, and faster dissipation of heat, contributing to its efficiency as a coolant. 2. High specific heat capacity: Hydrogen has a high specific heat capacity (the amount of heat needed to change the temperature of one unit mass by one degree Celsius) compared to other gases. This means it can absorb a considerable amount of heat without its temperature rising excessively. This property enables hydrogen to effectively cool power stations' generators by efficiently removing excess heat. 3. Low viscosity: Hydrogen has a low viscosity compared to other gases, which means it flows easily with little resistance. This enables the smooth and rapid circulation of hydrogen around the generator components, further enhancing its cooling capabilities. 4. High thermal conductivity: Hydrogen possesses a high thermal conductivity (the ability to conduct heat), which facilitates the rapid transfer of heat from the generator components to the hydrogen gas itself. As a result, hydrogen can disperse heat quickly, maintaining a stable temperature within the power station's generators. 5. Low chemical reactivity: Hydrogen has low chemical reactivity with the materials commonly used in generator construction, such as copper or iron. This characteristic reduces the likelihood of corrosion or other chemical-related damage to the components, ensuring that the generators maintain their structural integrity and reliability. 6. Non-toxic and environmentally friendly: Hydrogen is a non-toxic and environmentally friendly gas, making it a safer and more sustainable choice for power station cooling systems. Additionally, when hydrogen escapes into the atmosphere, it does not contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, or have adverse effects on human health. In essence, the favorable properties of hydrogen as a coolant in power stations' generators are its light diatomic molecular structure, high specific heat capacity, low viscosity, high thermal conductivity, low chemical reactivity, and environmentally friendly nature. These characteristics make hydrogen an efficient and effective coolant that can maintain optimal temperatures within the generators while preserving their overall functionality and integrity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who signed a declaration stating that \\"I am leaving the McMurdo base to you\\"? Shackleton's February 1907 announcement that he intended to base his expedition at the old Discovery headquarters was noted by Scott, whose own future Antarctic plans were at that stage unannounced. In a letter to Shackleton, Scott claimed priority rights to McMurdo Sound. \\"I feel I have a sort of right to my own field of work,\\" he wrote, adding: \\"anyone who has had to do with exploration will regard this region primarily as mine\\". He concluded by reminding Shackleton of his duty of loyalty towards his former commander.Shackleton's initial reply was accommodating: \\"I would like to fall in with your views as far as possible without creating a position that would be untenable to myself\\". Edward Wilson, asked by Shackleton to mediate, took an even tougher line than Scott. \\"I think you should retire from McMurdo Sound\\", he wrote, advising Shackleton not to make any plans to work from anywhere in the entire Ross Sea quarter until Scott decided \\"what limits he puts on his own rights\\". To this Shackleton replied: \\"There is no doubt in my mind that his rights end at the base he asked for [...] I consider I have reached my limit and I go no further\\".The matter was unresolved when Scott returned from sea duty in May 1907. Scott pressed for a line of demarcation at 170° W—everything to the west of that line, including Ross Island, McMurdo Sound, and Victoria Land, would be Scott's preserve. Shackleton, with other concerns pressing on him, felt obliged to concede. On 17 May he signed a declaration stating that \\"I am leaving the McMurdo base to you\\", and that he would seek to land further east, either at the Barrier Inlet visited briefly during the Discovery Expedition, or at King Edward VII Land. He would not touch the coast of Victoria Land at all. It was a capitulation to Scott and Wilson, and meant forfeiting the expedition's aim of reaching the South Magnetic Pole which was located within Victoria Land.

There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. Please answer this question : Which group had their people inherit their condition? Answer:","completion":"Group A, which comprises individuals with myopia, is more likely to have inherited their condition.

First, let's add 1435 and 146 together, just like when we add up our toys or candies. So, 1435 + 146 = 1581. Now our equation looks like this: 0 = -31*i + 1581 Now, we need to find our missing toy, which is \\"i\\". To do that, let's get -31*i by itself on one side of the equation. We'll do this by moving 1581 to the other side. To move 1581 to the other side, we will subtract it from the whole puzzle, like when we give away some of our candies or toys. So, we'll have: -31*i = -1581 Now, our final step is to find what \\"i\\" is. To do this, we have to divide -1581 by -31, just like when we share our toys or candies with friends. So: i = -1581 / -31 When you divide -1581 by -31, you get: i = 51 Yay! We found the missing toy, and it is 51! Our \\"i\\" is like having 51 toys or candies.

The British people, or the Britons, are the citizens of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the British Overseas Territories, and the Crown dependencies. British nationality law governs modern British citizenship and nationality, which can be acquired, for instance, by descent from British nationals. When used in a historical context, \\"British\\" or \\"Britons\\" can refer to the Celtic Britons, the indigenous inhabitants of Great Britain and Brittany, whose surviving members are the modern Welsh people, Cornish people and Bretons. Although early assertions of being British date from the Late Middle Ages, the creation of the united Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707 triggered a sense of British national identity. Canada traces its statehood to the French, English and Scottish expeditions of North America from the late-15th century. France ceded nearly all of New France in 1763 after the Seven Years' War, and so after the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776, Quebec and Nova Scotia formed \\"the nucleus of the colonies that constituted Britain's remaining stake on the North American continent\\". British North America attracted the United Empire Loyalists, Britons who migrated out of what they considered the \\"rebellious\\" United States, increasing the size of British communities in what was to become Canada. In 1867 there was a union of three colonies with British North America which together formed the Canadian Confederation, a federal dominion. This began an accretion of additional provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom, highlighted by the Statute of Westminster 1931 and culminating in the Canada Act 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the parliament of the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, it is recognised that there is a \\"continuing importance of Canada's long and close relationship with Britain\\"; large parts of Canada's modern population claim \\"British origins\\" and the cultural impact of the British upon Canada's institutions is profound. It was not until 1977 that the phrase \\"A Canadian citizen is a British subject\\" ceased to be used in Canadian passports. The politics of Canada are strongly influenced by British political culture. Although significant modifications have been made, Canada is governed by a democratic parliamentary framework comparable to the Westminster system, and retains Elizabeth II as The Queen of Canada and Head of State. English is an official language used in Canada. What happened after 1776?","completion":"After 1776, when the United States declared its independence from Britain, many changes happened in North America. Britain focused on the territories that still belonged to them, like Quebec and Nova Scotia. These areas became more important for Britain's presence in North America. Many people who still wanted to be loyal to Britain, called United Empire Loyalists, moved from the United States to British territories, like Canada. This made the British communities in Canada larger. In 1867, three colonies - Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia - came together to form a new country called the Canadian Confederation, which was a part of the British Empire. Over time, more provinces and territories joined this Confederation, and Canada became more independent from the United Kingdom. By 1931, Canada was mostly governing itself, with the United Kingdom having less control over Canadian laws and decisions. This was made official in the Statute of Westminster. In 1982, the Canada Act was passed, which completely separated Canada's laws from the United Kingdom. Canada's culture and government still have strong ties to Britain, though. Many people in Canada have British backgrounds, and their government is similar to the British parliamentary system. English is also an official language in Canada, and Queen Elizabeth II is the Queen of Canada as well as the United Kingdom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Each day after work, Muna picks up Fadi from school and crosses through an Israeli checkpoint in order to get to their home in Bethlehem. She lives with her aging mother and has occasional visits from her brother Samer. One day after arriving home, Muna discovers that she has been awarded an American green card through the lottery.

While he is shooting, shy student Sam Merrick picks up the camera to take a look. Defensive and angry, George beats Sam up. Sam confides in both his protective older brother Rocky and his budding girlfriend, Millie, who urges Sam to take a higher road.Sam's older brother Rocky confides in his friends, Clyde and Marty, who are also familiar with George's reputation as a bully (he previously mocked Clyde for having two gay dads). While they agree that they need to stand up for Sam, they have different approaches. Clyde, who is sensitive and a bit of an outsider himself within the group, is more sympathetic and passive. Marty, who has issues with anger and trauma stemming from his father's suicide, his mother's apathy and his older brother's abuse, favors a more righteous form of revenge.Eventually, they hatch a plan with Sam to invite George on a fake birthday party for Sam, which George all-too eagerly accepts.

And not just a little bit. \\"Flash is a spaghetti-ball piece of technology that has lousy performance and really bad security problems,\\" he said, according to biographer Walter Isaacson in his book published earlier this month. On Wednesday, Adobe announced it will no longer be developing Flash, its media-player tool, for mobile devices. More than a few bloggers have noted the news would have been vindication for the late Apple co-founder, who felt betrayed by Adobe more than a decade ago. In a post on the Adobe blog, company vice-president Danny Winokur said Flash has enabled the Web's richest content for a decade. \\"However, HTML5 is now universally supported on major mobile devices, in some cases exclusively,\\" he said, apparently a nod to Apple's iPhone, iPad and iPod. \\"This makes HTML5 the best solution for creating and deploying content in the browser across mobile platforms.\\" HTML5 is the emerging Web language that many developers are using. The Apple vs. Adobe standoff over Flash has been one of the tech world's most visible, and at times nasty, disputes. As the company shifts away from developing software for smartphones and tablets, it is impossible to ignore the part that Apple's steadfast refusal to use Flash on its popular mobile products may have played in the decision. Under Jobs, who died October 5 after a long battle with cancer, the iPhone became the industry's leading smartphone and the iPad emerged to virtually dominate the tablet space. While there are more phones running Google's Android software (many of them pointedly advertising their Flash compatibility), no products captured the public's imagination, and attention, quite like Apple's. As such, when Jobs blasted Flash, people listened. And blast it he did. He called it \\"buggy,\\" a battery hog and a product created by lazy developers. \\"Allowing Flash to be ported across platforms means things get dumbed down to the lowest common denominator,\\" Jobs said, according to Isaacson. \\"We spend lots of effort to make our platform better and the developer doesn't get any benefit if Adobe only works with functions that every platform has.\\" Adobe fired back. Last year, the company bought multiplatform ads which, perhaps appropriately, flashed this message: \\"We love Apple ... . What we don't love is anybody taking away your freedom to choose what you create, how you create it, and what you experience on the Web.\\" According to the biography, Jobs' longstanding animus toward Adobe helped form his vision for Apple's tightly controlled mobile environment. In 1999, he was flatly denied when he asked Adobe to create a version of its popular Adobe Premiere digital-graphics software for the Mac. Adobe also wouldn't rewrite Photoshop for the Mac's operating system, even though Macs were popular with designers. \\"My primary insight when we were screwed by Adobe in 1999 was that we shouldn't get into any business where we didn't control both the hardware and the software, otherwise we'd get our head handed to us,\\" Jobs said, according to Isaacson. The two companies go back together even further. Apple invested in Adobe in 1985 and they worked together early on. But Jobs, who in Isaacson's book comes off sometimes as vindictive and brusque as he was innovative and inspirational, told Isaacson that Adobe went downhill after founder John Warnock retired. \\"The soul of Adobe disappeared when Warnock left,\\" he said. \\"He was the inventor, the person I related to. It's been a bunch of suits since then, and the company has turned to crap.\\" On Wednesday, Adobe said its upcoming release of Flash Player 11.1 for Android and the BlackBerry PlayBook will be the platform's final mobile update. Moving forward, Winokur said, Adobe plans to work with \\"key players in the HTML5 community, including Google, Apple, Microsoft and RIM.\\" Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Steve Jobs, the late co-founder of Apple, had a strong dislike for Adobe Flash, referring to it as a \\"spaghetti-ball piece of technology\\" with poor performance and security issues. In October, Adobe announced it would no longer be developing Flash for mobile devices, as HTML5 has now become universally supported on major mobile devices, including Apple products. The Apple vs. Adobe standoff over Flash had been a heated dispute in the tech world. Jobs criticized Flash for being \\"buggy,\\" a battery hog, and a product created by lazy developers, while Adobe fought back, defending the freedom of choice when it comes to content creation. Adobe's move away from Flash for smartphones and tablets can be seen as influenced by Apple's refusal to use it on their popular mobile devices. Jobs' experience with Adobe also deeply influenced his vision for Apple's controlled mobile environment, which aimed to control both hardware and software to avoid being dependent on any other company."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The statement has been released by the United Nations to mark UN Disaster Reduction Day. More people are made homeless by environmental disasters than by war,according to the research by the Red Cross. That reality is proved by the earthquake in Pakistan. The widely publicized disaster has brought aid from the global community,according to Janos Bogardi,director of the United Nations University Institute for Environment and Human Security. \\"If we can move swiftly in and give them a new start where they are,then they may stay in the area. Otherwise,they become environmental refugees. Environmentalrelated migrations are most acute in SubSaharan Africa,but they also affect millions of people in Asia and India. Meanwhile,the United States is witnessing increased pressure from victims of mismanaged and worsening soil and water conditions in Mexico and Latin America.\\" he says. Janos Bogardi says these refugees suffer from the impact of gradual environmental change--global warming,sea level rise,air and water pollution and more intense storms,floods and droughts that degrade the land.

I wish the reviews and summaries had been more clear about the subject matter of the book. Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"The tone of the product review can be characterized as slightly negative. There are several reasons for this: 1. The reviewer states that the book was not useful for their personal situation, as they are at the beginning stage of divorce, and the book focuses on the time period after one or both parties have entered into new relationships. This implies that their expectations were not met upon reading the book, which contributes to their dissatisfaction. 2. The reviewer mentions that they wish the reviews and summaries had been more clear about the subject matter of the book. This indicates that they feel misled or disappointed with the information provided about the book before making the purchase. The lack of clear information led them to invest time and possibly money into something that did not meet their needs, which can be frustrating. 3. However, the reviewer does point out that the book might be useful in the future once their situation changes, which adds an element of balance to the review. This slight positive comment shows that they are not entirely dismissive of the book, but it does not negate their overall dissatisfaction with it. In conclusion, the tone of the product review is mainly negative, but does have a hint of positivity due to the possibility of it being useful at a later stage in the reviewer's life.

Joseph and Mary lived with their son Joseph, Jr. and his family in a small house while theirs was being built. Mary Priestley was primarily responsible for the design of the couple's new home and her family inheritance may have helped finance it, but she died before it was completed. By 1797, Joseph's laboratory was completed—the first part of the home to be finished. It was the first laboratory that \\"he had designed, built, and outfitted entirely himself\\" and was probably the first \\"scientifically-equipped laboratory\\" in the United States. Joseph continued his scientific and scholarly work in his new laboratory, identifying carbon monoxide (which he called \\"heavy inflammable air\\"). In 1798 Joseph Jr., his wife, and their children moved into the new house with Joseph Priestley. The house also held Priestley's library, which contained about 1600 volumes by his death in 1804 and was one of the largest in America at the time. The Priestley family held Unitarian church services in the drawing room and Joseph educated a group of young men until the local Northumberland Academy that he helped found was completed.The house proper was completed in 1798, with a Mr. Jones of Northumberland employed acting as master carpenter. Built in an 18th-century Georgian style, the \\"balance and symmetry\\" of the architecture signaled \\"subdued elegance\\". The house was accented with Federalist highlights, such as \\"the fanlights over the doors and the balustrades on the rooftop belvedere and main staircase\\", marking it as distinctly American.

Team N had no viral infections, while Team W had many people with HIV among its members. Obviously, team N had fewer health issues. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which team had more people receiving interferon? Hint: While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development. Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it can be inferred that Team W, which had many people with HIV among its members, had more individuals receiving interferon as a treatment. This deduction is made due to several reasons. First, the development of antiviral drugs like interferon has been focused on treating viral infections. Since HIV is a viral infection, individuals on Team W would likely be administered this medication for treatment. On the other hand, Team N had no viral infections among its members, so they would not require interferon for treatment. Furthermore, the paragraph states that the development of antiretroviral drugs (ART) has increased rapidly in response to the AIDS epidemic. HIV, or the human immunodeficiency virus, can lead to AIDS if left untreated. Given that Team W had a significant number of individuals with HIV, it is reasonable to assume that they required antiretroviral therapy, which includes interferon treatment, to manage their condition. In conclusion, Team W, with its higher prevalence of HIV-positive individuals, had more people receiving interferon due to their need for antiviral and antiretroviral treatments. While interferon was the first antiviral drug developed, the past twenty years have seen a rapid development of antiretroviral drugs to combat viral diseases like HIV/AIDS, further supporting the idea that Team W had a higher demand for medications like interferon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is thought that trick-or-treating comes from an old English custom. On All Souls Day, poor people went begging and promised to say prayers in exchange for food. Apple bobbing, still a favorite Halloween game, was originally an ancient ceremony honoring the harvest time. A jack-o'-lantern is placed on porches and windows to tell children that treats are available. The legend was that a man named Jack could enter heaven because he played tricks on the devil. As punishment, he had to wander the earth carrying a lantern waiting to be judged fit to get into heaven. People believed that Halloween marked the connection between the world of the living and the world of the dead. This meant that ghosts would _ the earth on this night.

Darwin presented natural selection as a scientifically testable mechanism while accepting that other mechanisms such as inheritance of acquired characters were possible. His strategy established that evolution through natural laws was worthy of scientific study, and by 1875, most scientists accepted that evolution occurred but few thought natural selection was significant. Darwin's scientific method was also disputed, with his proponents favouring the empiricism of John Stuart Mill's A System of Logic, while opponents held to the idealist school of William Whewell's Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, in which investigation could begin with the intuitive truth that species were fixed objects created by design. Early support for Darwin's ideas came from the findings of field naturalists studying biogeography and ecology, including Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1860, and Asa Gray in 1862. Henry Walter Bates presented research in 1861 that explained insect mimicry using natural selection.

Burner A is currently not turned on, and burner B is set to \\"medium.\\" Steve was planning on cooking some fried eggs for lunch, but is currently distracted by an article in the newspaper that was deliver to his door. Hint: Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. A hot surface warms the air above it causing it to expand and lower the density and the resulting surface air pressure. The resulting horizontal pressure gradient moves the air from higher to lower pressure regions, creating a wind, and the Earth's rotation then causes deflection of this air flow due to the Coriolis effect. The simple systems thus formed can then display emergent behaviour to produce more complex systems and thus other weather phenomena. Large scale examples include the Hadley cell while a smaller scale example would be coastal breezes. Answer:","completion":"The air above burner B is warmer. In the given scenario, Steve's kitchen has two burners - burner A and burner B. Burner A is currently not turned on, meaning it is not producing heat. On the other hand, burner B is set to \\"medium,\\" which means it is producing heat. The paragraph explains that surface temperature differences can cause pressure differences. When a hot surface, such as burner B, warms the air, this air then expands. This expansion leads to lower density and decreased surface air pressure. In other words, the air above a warmer surface has a lower pressure compared to the air above a cooler surface. Furthermore, the paragraph explains that the horizontal pressure gradient moves the air from areas of higher pressure to lower pressure, creating wind. Earth's rotation can also cause a deflection in this air flow due to the Coriolis effect. This phenomenon can cause the formation of complex systems and weather phenomena. In this case, burner B is currently on and producing heat which warms the air above it, while burner A is not turned on and is not warming the air above it.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Mike is studying for his zoology class. Today, he is studying about reptiles and amphibians. He found it easy to understand their differences by categorizing them. For that, he classified reptiles as class A and amphibians as class B. Which class of animals would have weaker separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams, class A or class B? Hint: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...","completion":"Based on the information provided, Class B animals (amphibians) would have a weaker separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams as compared to Class A animals (reptiles). Amphibians, which include frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts, have a less efficient circulatory system as compared to reptiles. Their circulatory system is only partially divided, consisting of a three-chambered heart with two atria and one ventricle. This allows some mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the single ventricle, which then gets pumped to both the lungs and body tissues. This results in a less efficient transport of oxygen throughout the body. On the other hand, reptiles have a more advanced circulatory system with a heart that is partially or completely divided into separate chambers, depending on the species. This septum in the heart allows for more complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, leading to more efficient oxygen transport and gas exchange in reptiles. As mentioned in the hint, reptiles also have a more efficient respiratory system which uses their lungs to draw air by expanding their chest walls, further emphasizing their improved oxygen transportation. In conclusion, Class B animals (amphibians) have a weaker separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams due to their less advanced circulatory and respiratory systems compared to Class A animals (reptiles)."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who was survived by his third wife, as well as his daughter, Galina, and son, Maxim?, using the article: In 1964 Shostakovich composed the music for the Russian film Hamlet, which was favourably reviewed by The New York Times: \\"But the lack of this aural stimulation – of Shakespeare's eloquent words – is recompensed in some measure by a splendid and stirring musical score by Dmitri Shostakovich. This has great dignity and depth, and at times an appropriate wildness or becoming levity\\".In later life, Shostakovich suffered from chronic ill health, but he resisted giving up cigarettes and vodka. Beginning in 1958 he suffered from a debilitating condition that particularly affected his right hand, eventually forcing him to give up piano playing; in 1965 it was diagnosed as poliomyelitis. He also suffered heart attacks the following year and again in 1971, and several falls in which he broke both his legs; in 1967 he wrote in a letter: \\"Target achieved so far: 75% (right leg broken, left leg broken, right hand defective). All I need to do now is wreck the left hand and then 100% of my extremities will be out of order.\\"A preoccupation with his own mortality permeates Shostakovich's later works, among them the later quartets and the Fourteenth Symphony of 1969 (a song cycle based on a number of poems on the theme of death). This piece also finds Shostakovich at his most extreme with musical language, with twelve-tone themes and dense polyphony throughout. He dedicated the piece to his close friend Benjamin Britten, who conducted its Western premiere at the 1970 Aldeburgh Festival. The Fifteenth Symphony of 1971 is, by contrast, melodic and retrospective in nature, quoting Wagner, Rossini and the composer's own Fourth Symphony. Shostakovich died of lung cancer on 9 August 1975. A civic funeral was held; he was interred in Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow. Even before his death he had been commemorated with the naming of the Shostakovich Peninsula on Alexander Island, Antarctica., Despite suffering from Motor Neurone Disease (or ALS) from as early as the 1960s, Shostakovich insisted upon writing all his own correspondence..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The last name of the person who was survived by his third wife, as well as his daughter, Galina, and son, Maxim, is Shostakovich.

He cocked his head. “What do you mean?” I had no idea—on a conscious level—what I was asking for, just that I felt in a desperate sense that the self I knew was slipping away. An inability to recognize myself either in my writing or in reflecting upon my own actions was taking over. And then…? I didn't care. I wanted to kiss girls. Which is fine—just not something I ordinarily do. I wanted to drink, smoke. Again, fine—but not something I ordinarily do. “Do I seem…okay?” I asked a colleague at work. A woman I barely knew. Insanely, I thought that since she worked with disabled students, many of whom struggled with mental illness, she would know mania when she saw it. This was a rather foolish assumption—especially since she's an educator, not a psychiatrist, especially with how skilled I am at wearing the mask of calm, the face of sanity. “You seem great, Julie. Cheery. Professional as always.” I let her reassurance placate me. Wanted to be placated. Yet, within months I lost my job. And not only that, but a chance at a scholarship, two really important long term friendships—relationships I'd enjoyed since high school.

Insert the memory stick into the slot.; * The slots for the ram stick are located on the back of your computer case, or within the case itself. Find the gnu motherboard connector located in the back of your computer.;","completion":"After locating the memory slots on the motherboard, you will need to assess the situation based on the options provided: 1. If you see the slots lined up in a row of 4 to 8 with some potentially empty, it indicates that you have identified the correct memory slots on your motherboard. Before proceeding, take note of the number of memory slots and the number of installed memory modules. This observation will help you determine the RAM type and the expansion options available. 2. In case you need to replace an existing memory stick, carefully unscrew the memory module from the motherboard using a Phillips-head screwdriver by turning the screws counterclockwise. Make sure to handle the memory module with care to avoid any damage to it. Keep the old memory stick in a safe place or slot it into a designated slot behind the RAM slot to prevent misplacement or damage. 3. Before installing the new memory stick, ensure that you have the right RAM type for your system by confirming its compatibility with your motherboard. Gently press the key on your mouse to insert the index card into the RAM slot for alignment purposes. Now, correctly align the notches on the memory stick with those on the slot and gently push down on both ends until you hear a click. This indicates that the memory stick has been securely inserted into the slot. 4. If you still haven't located the RAM stick slots, look for them on the back of your computer case or inside the case itself. You should be able to identify the 'gnu' motherboard connector at the back of your computer, which will help you find the memory slots. Once you have located the RAM stick slots, follow the instructions in the previous steps to replace or install the new RAM modules. After successfully placing the new memory stick into the slot, it's time to reassemble your computer case. Secure the case door back in place and fasten all the screws. Turn on the power switch at the back of your computer case and power up your computer.

Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, blood poisoning in his foot put him in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced.

Read this article and answer this question In the United States, conscription began in 1917 and was generally well received, with a few pockets of opposition in isolated rural areas. The administration decided to rely primarily on conscription, rather than voluntary enlistment, to raise military manpower for when only 73,000 volunteers enlisted out of the initial 1 million target in the first six weeks of the war. In 1917 10 million men were registered. This was deemed to be inadequate, so age ranges were increased and exemptions reduced, and so by the end of 1918 this increased to 24 million men that were registered with nearly 3 million inducted into the military services. The draft was universal and included blacks on the same terms as whites, although they served in different units. In all 367,710 black Americans were drafted , compared to 2,442,586 white . Forms of resistance ranged from peaceful protest to violent demonstrations and from humble letter-writing campaigns asking for mercy to radical newspapers demanding reform. The most common tactics were dodging and desertion, and many communities sheltered and defended their draft dodgers as political heroes. Many socialists were jailed for \\"obstructing the recruitment or enlistment service\\". The most famous was Eugene Debs, head of the Socialist Party of America, who ran for president in 1920 from his prison cell. In 1917 a number of radicals and anarchists challenged the new draft law in federal court, arguing that it was a direct violation of the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the draft act in the Selective Draft Law Cases on January 7, 1918. What happened first, the Selective Draft Law Cases or Eugene Debs' run for president?","completion":"The first event to happen was the Selective Draft Law Cases. Here is the step-by-step reasoning: 1. The Selective Draft Law Cases took place on January 7, 1918, as stated in the passage. 2. Eugene Debs ran for president in 1920 from his prison cell, as mentioned in the article. Since January 7, 1918, comes before 1920, the Selective Draft Law Cases happened first."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was a low-scoring affair due to the freezing rain pelting the field for much of the game. On their opening drive, the Browns drove down to the Bills' one-yard line but could not get into the end. Kicker Phil Dawson kicked a 19-yard field goal in the first quarter. In the second quarter, Ryan Fitzpatrick connected with David Nelson on an 11-yard pass for the game's only touchdown, giving the Bills a 7-3 lead. Dawson hit another field goal to pull the Browns within one, but a Rian Lindell 30-yard field goal gave the Bills a 10-6 lead at the half. Several turnovers in the second half stopped the Browns from making progress down the field, and another Lindell field goal in the fourth quarter sent the Browns to a 13-6 loss. The lone high point for the Browns was Peyton Hillis, who became the first white running back to rush for over 1,000 yards in a season in 25 years. With the loss, the Browns fell to 5-8 and were eliminated from playoff contention. This marks the eighth consecutive season in which the Browns failed to make the playoffs, a franchise record.

Select from: (I) unacceptable. (II) acceptable.","completion":"(II) acceptable. A linguist would find the sentence \\"She could not have been working\\" to be an acceptable English sentence grammatically. To understand why, we can analyze the sentence structure and parts of speech: 1. \\"She\\": The subject of the sentence is \\"She,\\" which is a pronoun that refers to a female person. In English grammar, pronouns can function as the subject, and \\"She\\" is an appropriate pronoun in this context. 2. \\"could not\\": This construction is known as a modal verb, which indicates possibility, ability, or permission. In this case, \\"could\\" suggests ability or possibility, and the addition of \\"not\\" negates it, meaning that it is not possible or the subject is not able (or is not allowed) to do the action described. Modal verbs, also known as auxiliary verbs, accompany the main verb of the sentence and provide additional information about the action. 3. \\"have been\\": This is another auxiliary verb construction, which adds further information about the action. The auxiliary verb \\"have\\" is used in perfect tense constructions, while \\"been\\" is the past participle of \\"be.\\" The present perfect continuous tense (also known as present perfect progressive) is formed by combining the present tense of \\"have\\" (or \\"has\\" for third person singular) with \\"been\\" and the present participle of the main verb. 4. \\"working\\": This is the main verb and the action of the sentence. \\"Working\\" is the present participle of the verb \\"work,\\" which denotes a continuous action. In summary, the sentence \\"She could not have been working\\" is a negative sentence in the present perfect continuous tense. The meaning of the sentence is that it was not possible (or the subject was not able) for the female person to be engaged in a continuous action (working) at a specific time or during a period in the past. The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable, as it follows the rules and conventions of English syntax and tense formation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The British boss of Indian car giant Tata Motors jumped to his death from a Bangkok hotel room following a blazing row with his wife, it emerged yesterday. Karl Slym was handed a three-page letter by his wife Sally detailing a ‘family problem’ on Saturday night after she became so enraged she stopped speaking to him. In the early hours of Sunday the managing director clambered out of the tiny window of his room on the 22nd floor of the luxury Shangri-La Hotel and jumped, landing on the staff accommodation block.

It is believed that the couple had been experiencing marital troubles and that the content of the three-page letter likely revolved around these issues. Thai police believe that the content of the letter could have played a significant role in Mr. Slym's decision to leap from the hotel room. Following the tragic incident, Tata Motors released a statement expressing their deep condolences to the family and stating their shock at the sudden loss of their managing director. \\"Karl Slym was a highly respected leader who was instrumental in the ongoing growth and development of the company,\\" the statement read. \\"His untimely death leaves a significant void in the organization, and we will all miss his leadership and vision.\\" The circumstances leading to Mr. Slym's tragic death caused a considerable outpour of support from both within and outside the company. Tata Motors' chairman, Cyrus Mistry, described Slym as a \\"valued colleague, a trusted advisor, and an inspiring leader\\" who made an indelible mark in the automotive industry. Colleagues and friends also took to social media to share their memories of Karl Slym and to offer condolences and support to the grieving family. As the news of Karl Slym's death sent shockwaves through the corporate world, particularly in the automotive industry, many began to question the future of Tata Motors. Under Slym's leadership, the company had made significant strides in driving innovation and expansion into new markets. However, with the sudden loss of their leader, Tata Motors now faced the challenge of finding an equally capable successor to continue Slym's vision and maintain their competitive edge. As authorities continued their investigation into the circumstances of Slym's death, his wife Sally was questioned by the police, as per standard procedure in such cases. Initial findings indicated that it was not a homicide, and no foul play was suspected. The medical examiner's office confirmed that Slym's injuries were consistent with a fall from a significant height, lending further credibility to the belief that he jumped to his death. A month after the tragedy, Tata Motors announced the appointment of a new managing director to take up the mantle left vacant by Slym's passing. The new leader was selected after a thorough evaluation of potential candidates, both internal and external, who could carry forward Slym's strategic direction and maintain Tata Motors' growth trajectory. Additionally, the company took measures to ensure that mental health and employee well-being are accorded greater importance within the organization, establishing programs to help employees seek assistance in times of personal crises. As the dust settled and Tata Motors continued to forge ahead under new leadership, the automotive world took a moment to reflect on the life and accomplishments of Karl Slym. His role in transforming Tata Motors will be remembered, and his untimely death serves as a sobering reminder of the importance of addressing mental health issues and fostering a supportive environment in the corporate world where individuals can seek help when facing personal difficulties."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"To remove a lug nut off of your tire, you should follow these steps, taking into consideration safety, efficiency, and the right tools for the job. Below are two methods for accomplishing this goal, followed by the recommended and most sensible way. Method 1: Using a Lug Wrench 1. Park on a level surface: Find a flat and solid surface to safely park your vehicle. This ensures stability when working on it. Make sure to engage the parking brake and place wheel chocks on the wheels that are not being lifted to prevent any rolling. 2. Loosen the lug nuts: Before lifting the vehicle, slightly loosen each lug nut on the tire you want to remove. Do not remove them yet; only loosen them enough so that you can easily unscrew them later. To loosen the lug nuts, use a lug wrench (also known as a tire iron) that comes with your vehicle or a suitable aftermarket wrench. Remember to turn the lug nuts counterclockwise to loosen them. 3. Lift the vehicle: Locate the jacking points on your vehicle by referring to the owner's manual. Place the jack under the appropriate jacking point and slowly pump or crank it until the tire is off the ground. Ensure the jack is secure and the vehicle is stable before proceeding. 4. Remove lug nuts and tire: Now that the lug nuts have been loosened and the vehicle is lifted, fully unscrew the lug nuts and set them aside safely. In case of stubborn lug nuts, you can use a breaker bar or a pipe extension on the lug wrench for extra leverage. After removing all lug nuts, carefully remove the tire. Method 2: Using an Impact Wrench 1. Park on a level surface: As mentioned previously, you should park the vehicle on a flat and solid surface to ensure stability. Engage the parking brake and use wheel chocks to prevent any rolling. 2. Loosen the lug nuts: In this method, use an impact wrench—an electric or air-powered tool—to quickly and easily remove the lug nuts. Connect the impact wrench to an air compressor or power outlet and select the appropriate size socket for the lug nuts. Gently press the trigger and turn the lug nuts counterclockwise to loosen them. 3. Lift the vehicle: Follow the same process to lift the vehicle using the jack in the correct jacking point, as described in Method 1. 4. Remove lug nuts and tire: Once the vehicle is properly lifted and stable, continue to use the impact wrench to fully remove the lug nuts, and then remove the tire. Recommended and Most Sensible Way: If you're not a professional or do not own an impact wrench, the most sensible and accessible way to remove a lug nut from your tire is by using the lug wrench method. Most vehicles come equipped with a lug wrench, and this method is suitable for occasional tire changes. However, if you frequently work on vehicles or need to change tires often, investing in an impact wrench is a time-saving and efficient approach."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It was formed by a merger of French Aérospatiale-Matra Missiles (of EADS, now Airbus Group), Italian Alenia Marconi Systems (now Leonardo) and British Matra BAe Dynamics (of BAE Systems) in December 2001. In 2015 the company had 10,000 employees. In 2015, MBDA recorded orders for €5.2bn and an order book of €15.1 bn. MBDA works with over 90 armed forces worldwide. - Radar is an object-detection system that uses radio waves to determine the range, angle, or velocity of objects. It can be used to detect aircraft, ships, spacecraft, guided missiles, motor vehicles, weather formations, and terrain. A radar system consists of a transmitter producing electromagnetic waves in the radio or microwaves domain, a transmitting antenna, a receiving antenna (often the same antenna is used for transmitting and receiving) and a receiver and processor to determine properties of the object(s). Radio waves (pulsed or continuous) from the transmitter reflect off the object and return to the receiver, giving information about the object's location and speed. Radar was developed secretly for military use by several nations in the period before and during World War II. The term \\"RADAR\\" was coined in 1940 by the United States Navy as an acronym for RAdio Detection And Ranging or RAdio Direction And Ranging. The term \\"radar\\" has since entered English and other languages as a common noun, losing all capitalization. - British Aerospace Dynamics Limited (BADL or BAe Dynamics) was a division of British Aerospace. - Alenia Marconi Systems (AMS) was a major European integrated defence electronics company and an equal shares joint venture between BAE Systems and Finmeccanica until its dissolution on May 3, 2005. - The Battle of Britain (German: \\"die Luftschlacht um England\\", literally \\"Air battle for England\\") was a combat of the Second World War, when the Royal Air Force (RAF) defended the United Kingdom (UK) against the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) attacks from the end of June 1940. It is described as the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces. The British officially recognise its duration as from 10 July until 31 October 1940 that overlaps with the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, while German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard it as a campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941. - Active radar homing (ARH) is a missile guidance method in which a missile contains a radar transceiver (in contrast to semi-active radar homing, which uses only a receiver) and the electronics necessary for it to find and track its target autonomously. NATO brevity code for an air-to-air active radar homing missile launch is Fox Three. - Brimstone is an air - launched ground attack missile developed by MBDA for Britain 's Royal Air Force . It was originally intended for \`\` fire - and - forget '' use against mass formations of enemy armour , using a millimetric wave ( mmW ) active radar homing seeker to ensure accuracy even against moving targets . Experience in Afghanistan led to the addition of laser guidance in the dual - mode Brimstone missile , allowing a \`\` spotter '' to pick out specific targets when friendly forces or civilians were in the area . The tandem shaped charge warhead is much more effective against modern tanks than older similar weapons such as the AGM - 65G Maverick , while the small blast area minimises collateral damage . Three Brimstones are carried on a launcher that occupies a single weapon station , allowing a single aircraft to carry many missiles . After a protracted development programme , single - mode or \`\` millimetric '' Brimstone entered service with RAF Tornado aircraft in 2005 , and the dual - mode variant in 2008 . The latter has been extensively used in Afghanistan and Libya . An improved Brimstone 2 was expected to enter service in October 2012 , but problems with the new warhead from TDW and the ROXEL rocket motor put back the planned date to November 2015 . MBDA is working on the targeting of swarms of small boats under the name Sea Spear .

Context: Coming off a road win over the Cowboys, the Redskins traveled to Lincoln Financial Field for a Week 5 NFC East duel with the Philadelphia Eagles. In the first quarter, the Redskins trailed early as RB Brian Westbrook scored on a 9-yard TD run and the Eagles DeSean Jackson returned a punt 68 yards for a touchdown. In the second quarter, Washington responded with Shaun Suisham kicking field goals of 41, 48, and 50 yards. In the third quarter, the Redskins took the lead on a trick play as WR Antwaan Randle El threw an 18-yard TD pass to TE Chris Cooley. In the fourth quarter, the Redskins increased their lead when Clinton Portis scored on a 4-yard TD run. Afterwards, the Eagles were unable to rally, only managing a 23-yard field goal by kicker David Akers. Question: How many yards, to one decimal place, on average were Shaun Suisham's field goals in the second quarter? Answer:","completion":"To find out the average yards of Shaun Suisham's field goals in the second quarter, we need to add the yards of each field goal he made and then divide the total by the number of field goals. So, Shaun Suisham made three field goals of 41 yards, 48 yards, and 50 yards. First, let's add the yards together: 41 + 48 + 50 = 139 yards Now, let's divide the total yards by the number of field goals (3): 139 yards / 3 field goals = 46.3 yards So, on average, Shaun Suisham's field goals in the second quarter were 46.3 yards long."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You can buy gum at pretty much every corner store. Chewing gums can be used to make bubbles, but they won't be as big, and they'll usually pop too easily. Hypothesis: It has been said that chewing gum bubbles are easy to pop.","completion":"Yes, we can draw the following hypothesis from the context: Hypothesis: Chewing gum bubbles are easier to pop as compared to bubblegum bubbles. The context indicates that although it is possible to create bubbles with chewing gum, they tend to not be as large and are generally less durable than bubbles made with bubblegum. This is because bubblegum is specifically formulated to be more elastic and better suited for bubble-blowing purposes, whereas chewing gum is primarily meant for the enjoyable experience of chewing and flavor release. In further detail, the key difference between bubblegum and chewing gum lies in the ingredients and properties of the two. Bubblegum typically contains higher levels of a particular type of polymer, which gives it enhanced pliability and elasticity, allowing it to be stretched and blown into larger bubbles without easily bursting. Chewing gum, on the other hand, tends to have a denser and more brittle texture, making it less ideal for creating large and stable bubbles. Furthermore, the process of how gum is formulated can also contribute to these characteristics. For instance, bubblegum often includes ingredients, such as synthetic rubbers and plasticizers, which impart elasticity and flexibility, allowing the gum to be manipulated into various shapes with ease. Chewing gum, however, is largely designed for prolonged chewing and the release of flavors, which means that it may focus more on providing a satisfying texture and taste, instead of prioritizing the ability to blow bubbles. In conclusion, the hypothesis drawn from the context suggests that chewing gum bubbles are indeed easier to pop compared to bubblegum bubbles, primarily due to the differences in ingredients, formulation and intended purpose of the two types of gum. Bubblegum is specifically designed for blowing bubbles, while chewing gum is formulated to offer a pleasant chewing experience and flavor release. As a result, bubbles made with chewing gum tend to be less stable and resilient than those created using bubblegum."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Many educators today are looking for evidence to support the case for homework, but are coming up empty-handed. Mary Jane Cera is the academic administrator for the Kino School, and she maintains a no-homework policy across all grades. The purpose of the policy is to make sure learning remains a joy, not a thing that discourages social time and creative activity. At the Kino school, Cera says children often choose to take their favorite parts of school home. \\"A lot of what we see kids doing is practicing music with their friends, and taking experiments home to show their parents,\\" she says. Surveys of Kino graduates suggest that the early control they are given over their education continues to serve them well into college. \\"One of the reasons that we continue to assign much homework is our obsession with tests, although we can agree on the importance of kids doing better on tests through proper homework to some degree,\\"says author Alfie Kohn. In his book The Homework Myth, Kohn points out that no study has ever found a relation between homework and academic achievement and that if kids have no choice in the matter of homework, they're not really exercising judgment, and are instead losing their sense of self-control. However, many supporters of homework argue that life is filled with things we don't like to do, and that homework teaches self-discipline, time management and other non-academic life skills. Wherever the homework debate goes next, it's worth taking a moment to examine if we're doing the right thing about our children's education. The good news is -- it's never too late to start.

In the UK, what is the name of the pedestrian crossing with traffic lights that go green only when no more pedestrians are detected on the crossing by infrared detectors and mats?","completion":"In the UK, the name of the pedestrian crossing with traffic lights that go green only when no more pedestrians are detected on the crossing by infrared detectors and mats is the Puffin Crossing. Puffin stands for \\"Pedestrian User-Friendly Intelligent Crossing.\\" Puffin Crossings were introduced in the 1990s to improve safety and efficiency for pedestrians and road users alike. They are designed to be more responsive and adaptive to the current traffic and pedestrian conditions. Puffin Crossings have advanced features that differentiate them from other types of pedestrian crossings in the UK, such as zebra, pelican, and toucan crossings. The primary characteristics of Puffin Crossings are: 1. Smart Sensors: Unlike the older pelican crossings, puffin crossings are equipped with infrared detectors and pressure mats. These sensors detect when pedestrians are waiting to cross and when they are in the process of crossing. This real-time information allows the system to adjust the traffic light timings more accurately, ensuring that vehicles only proceed when the crossing is clear of pedestrians. 2. Nearside Signal Display: In Puffin Crossings, the pedestrian signal display is located close to the pedestrian waiting area (on the same side as the pedestrian), which means that users do not need to look across the road to see the signal status. This helps pedestrians to monitor the oncoming traffic while observing the status of the traffic lights. 3. No Flashing Amber Light: Unlike pelican crossings, puffin crossings do not have a flashing amber phase for traffic signals. When the green pedestrian light turns off (signaling pedestrians to stop crossing), the traffic lights change directly from red to green. This eliminates the potential confusion resulting from the flashing amber light and reduces the risk of collisions between pedestrians and road users. 4. Extended Crossing Time: The infrared detectors and pressure mats at puffin crossings can identify slower-moving pedestrians, such as elderly people or individuals with mobility issues. The system allows for extra crossing time by holding the red traffic light for a longer period, which ensures that all pedestrians can safely cross the road before the traffic signal turns green for vehicles. Overall, Puffin Crossings provide a safer and more efficient crossing experience for both pedestrians and road users. The intelligent features of these crossings help prevent accidents and promote a more coordinated flow between pedestrians and motorists in urban environments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's break down each sentence to understand the similarities and differences: Sentence 1: In addition to her own dowry, Cecily brought her new husband the station of her daughter, Katherine, who, together with William Hastings and Katherine, had six children: 1. The focus of this sentence is on Cecily and her dowry. 2. Cecily has a daughter named Katherine. 3. Katherine and William Hastings have six children together. Sentence 2: In addition to her own dowry, Katherine brought her new husband the station of her daughter, Cecily, who had six children, together with William Hastings and Katherine: 1. The focus of this sentence is on Katherine and her dowry. 2. Katherine has a daughter named Cecily. 3. Cecily, William Hastings, and Katherine have six children together (though the sentence structure is a bit ambiguous, making it unclear if Katherine is included or if the children are Cecily and William Hastings'). While both sentences convey information about dowries and the relationships between Cecily, Katherine, and William Hastings, there is a difference in perspective. The first sentence emphasizes Cecily's role and her relationship with her daughter Katherine, while the second sentence emphasizes Katherine's role and her relationship with her daughter Cecily. Furthermore, one significant difference lies in the relationships between the individuals mentioned. In the first sentence, Cecily is Katherine's mother, whereas, in the second sentence, Katherine is Cecily's mother. This difference suggests that they are not direct paraphrases, although they mention the same names and relationships."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

On a busy Friday morning in Manhattan, nine pedestrians suffered bullet or fragment wounds after police unleashed a hail of gunfire at a man wielding a .45 caliber pistol who had just killed a former co-worker. The officers unloaded 16 rounds in the shadow of the Empire State Building at a disgruntled former apparel designer, killing him after he engaged in a gunbattle with police, authorities said. Three passersby sustained direct gunshot wounds, while the remaining six were hit by fragments, according to New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. All injuries were caused by police, he said Saturday. One officer shot nine rounds and another shot seven. Police identified the gunman as Jeffrey Johnson, 58, who was apparently laid off from his job as a designer of women's accessories at Hazan Import Co. last year. Johnson, who served in the U.S. Coast Guard in the mid-1970s, had two rounds left in his pistol. It holds eight, Kelly said. Police identified the slain co-worker as Steven Ercolino, 41, who had apparently filed a prior complaint against his assailant, claiming that he thought Johnson would eventually try to kill him. Both men had filed harassment complaints against each other in April 2011, Kelly added. Ercolino was listed as a vice president of sales at Hazan Import Corp., according to his LinkedIn profile. \\"It's not something that should happen to a loving person like that,\\" said his brother, Paul. \\"He's going to be so missed by everybody.

Help as much as you can. Q:Article: Before my first summer vacation at college, my roommate Ted asked to me to work with him on his father's farm in Argentina. The idea of spending two months in Argentine was exciting. Then I began having second thoughts. I had never been far from New England, and I had been homesick my first few weeks at college. What would it be like in a strange country? What about the language? The more I thought about it, the more the idea worried me. In the end I turned down the invitation. As soon as Ted asked somebody else to go, I began kicking myself. I had turned down something I wanted to do because I was scared, and had ended up feeling depressed. That unhappy summer taught me a valuable lesson out of which I developed a rule for myself: do what makes you anxious; don't do what makes you depressed. At the end of my senior year, I began to think about becoming a writer. But my professor was urging me to aim at teaching. I hesitated. The idea of trying to live by writing was a lot scarier than spending a summer in Argentina. Back and forth I went, making my decision, unmaking it. Suddenly I realized that every time I gave up the idea of writing, that downhearted feeling went through me. Giving up on what I really wanted to do depressed me. Right then I learned another lesson. To avoid that kind of depression meant having to bear a certain amount of worry and concern. When I first began writing articles, I was frequently required to interview big names. Before each interview I would get butterflies in the stomach and my hands would shake. One person I particularly admired was the great composer Duke Ellington. On the stage and on television, he seemed the very model of confidence. Then I learned Ellington still got stage fright. If the highly honored Ellington, who had appeared on the bandstand some 10,000 times over 30years, had anxiety attacks, who was I to think I could avoid them? I went on doing those frightening interviews. Then I realized to my astonishment that I was even looking forward to the interviews....

Prepare for the session: After you've booked your session, you'll need to prepare. This includes arriving in comfortable attire suitable for water sports, applying high-formula sunblock if you'll be flyboarding in the sun, and drinking enough water prior to your session to stay adequately hydrated. Justification: Proper preparation is essential in any physical activity, more so in an extreme sport like flyboarding. Ensuring you have the right attire, appropriate protection from the sun and are well-hydrated will contribute to a safer and more enjoyable session. 2. Attend a safety briefing and training: Usually, the instructors will conduct a safety briefing and preliminary training.

Write an article based on this summary: – With thousands of rape kits languishing untested in Texas, one state lawmaker devised a clever solution: crowdfunding. Rep. Victoria Neave came up with the idea after learning that many rape investigations were going nowhere because there was no money to analyze evidence collected from victims, NPR reports. The Dallas Democrat filed a bill that would ask Texans to pony up 1 or more when they stop into the DMV to renew or apply for drivers licenses. The donations would mirror those collected for veterans and other organizations, except they would be used to test DNA evidence collected in reported rapes, such as semen, hair, and fibers. If the measure passes—it's cleared the House and is set for a Senate vote—Neave says it could generate 1 million a year \\"and end the backlog of untested rape kits.\\" The price tag for testing a rape kit can hit 2,000, per NPR, leaving many police departments in Texas and other states balking at the expense. Neave told the New York Times in March that it's tough enough for women to muster the \\"courage\\" to report rape. When they do, she adds, \\"we owe it to them\\" to ensure the physical evidence is properly tested. It's unclear how many untested kits are in Texas, though estimates sit at about 20,000, the Daily Beast reported last month. Not everyone is impressed with the idea. \\"It's really horrifying that ... evidence testing for survivors is reliant on charitable donations by the public,\\" says Kristen Lenau, a victims' advocate. \\"We believe the onus to test this evidence is on the state and local governments.\\" (For one rape victim, even finding a rape kit was an ordeal.)","completion":"Title: Crowdfunding Proposed to Address the Untested Rape Kit Backlog in Texas Introduction: Thousands of rape kits go untested in Texas due to the lack of funding for the analysis of evidence collected from victims. In response to this issue, Texas State Rep. Victoria Neave has proposed a creative solution: crowdfunding. Neave's plan entails collecting donations from citizens when they visit the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to apply for or renew their driver's licenses. The Proposal: According to NPR, the idea behind Neave's proposal is that for many rape investigations, no progress is made due to a lack of funds to analyze vital evidence associated with the case. Thus, the Democratic lawmaker from Dallas has filed a bill encouraging Texans to donate 1 or more when they make a transaction at the DMV. The crowdfunding campaign format would resemble those that collect funds for veterans and other organizations, but the money would be directed towards testing DNA evidence gathered from reported rape cases, such as hair, semen, and fibers. Possible Impact: The bill has already been cleared by the House and is awaiting a vote in the Senate. If passed, Neave estimates that it could generate around 1 million per year, which would help address the backlog of untested rape kits. The cost for testing a single rape kit can reach 2,000, according to NPR, deterring many police departments in Texas and other states from pursuing the expense. Importance of Addressing the Issue: Neave told the New York Times in March that reporting rape already requires considerable courage from women. Therefore, she believes that \\"we owe it to them\\" to ensure the physical evidence in their cases is thoroughly tested. Although the exact number of untested rape kits in Texas is uncertain, the Daily Beast has estimated it to be around 20,000. Criticism: Not everyone is impressed with Neave's proposal. Kristen Lenau, a victims' advocate, finds it horrifying that \\"evidence testing for survivors is reliant on charitable donations by the public.\\" Lenau argues that the responsibility to test this evidence lies with state and local governments. Conclusion: Efforts to address the backlog of untested rape kits highlight the need for adequate funding for law enforcement agencies to conduct efficient and effective investigations. It remains to be seen whether Neave's crowdfunding proposal will pass in the Senate and what impact it could have on Texas's backlog of untested rape kits. Although crowdfunding may provide a temporary solution, it is essential to consider the long-term responsibility of state and local governments to ensure justice for survivors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the information provided, we can't calculate the percentage increase without that data. However, I can address if the answer you provided is relevant to the question. The quoted text appears to describe three different types of investments that the college may utilize for its endowment: 1. Unitised Scheme: This is a unit trust investment vehicle, which pools money from various sources such as colleges, faculties, and departments. The purpose of this type of investment is to generate long-term returns. 2. Non-Core Property: This portfolio includes approximately 120 properties that the college has deemed not core to its academic mission. These properties serve as operational and developmental investments in the portfolio. 3. Strategic Asset Investments: These investments consist of the college's shareholding in companies such as Imperial Innovations and other restricted equity holdings. While the quoted text provides an overview of the different types of investments that may make up the college's endowment, it doesn't answer the specific question about the percentage increase in the endowment's market value from 2014 to 2015. As mentioned earlier, to answer that question, we would need the actual endowment market values for those years. In summary, while the provided text sheds some light on how the endowment is invested, it doesn't contain the necessary information to calculate the percentage increase in endowment market value from 2014 to 2015.

Ma had put a stack of clean clothes at the foot of the bed for me. I dressed without caring what I put on. The only important items were my cowboy boots and my Roy Rogers belt with two holsters for cap guns, even though I only had one cap gun left, and its trigger was broken. When I used the toilet, I sat on the front edge of the seat, watching the water beneath me, and scooted off as soon as I was done. I had seen a cartoon in a book at Grandpa Abner's that showed a fish leaping out of a toilet bowl and a woman staring at it with big eyes. I thought that was funny and I knew it was impossible, but I didn't think there was any reason to take chances. Ma called, \\"Little Bit has to use the bathroom.\\" I yelled, \\"I'm almost done.\\" Ma called, \\"Are you off the toilet?\\" I yelled, \\"Yes!\\" Ma opened the door and brought Little Bit in.

The sun has a weaker or stronger force of gravity than the moon? The answer is:","completion":"The sun has a stronger force of gravity than the moon. This is due to the fact that the sun has a significantly greater mass than the moon. The force of gravity between two objects is determined by their masses and the distance between their centers. This relationship is described by the gravitational force formula: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2 Where F is the gravitational force, G is the gravitational constant (~6.674 x 10^-11 N m²/kg²), m1 and m2 are the masses of the objects, and r is the distance between their centers. In the case of the sun and the moon, the sun's mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, while the moon's mass is about 7.342 x 10^22 kg.

Article: Siberia is a huge territory in Russia. It is more than half of Russia and is 4,000 miles wide. Most of this area is a forest with animals and birds. In autumn, the forests in Siberia are full of mushrooms and berries . Many people like picking mushrooms, but that is not as simple as you might think. Old people who live in the villages know places where you can pick lots of mushrooms. Some mushrooms grow in colonies. If you find one, you only need to look around because nearby you'll find more of them. However, when picking mushrooms, it is important not to choose the wrong kind.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What are the differences between an iPod and other mp3 players? Can we assemble and install a MP3 player or iPod by ourselves? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Select from the following. (a). no; (b). yes;","completion":"(a). No, the questions are not the same. They address different aspects of MP3 players and iPods. The first question asks about the differences between an iPod and other MP3 players, while the second question asks if it's possible to assemble and install an MP3 player or iPod by ourselves. Regarding the answer to the first question, the differences between an iPod and other MP3 players can be categorized into several aspects: design, functionality, compatibility, and ecosystem. 1. Design: The iPod, developed by Apple, is known for its sleek and minimalistic design. The iconic white headphone and the click wheel are associated with the iPod brand. Many other MP3 players, on the other hand, may come in various designs and colors. Some may have a simple and clean design, while others may be more colorful or have distinct features that set them apart from the iPod. 2. Functionality: The iPod and other MP3 players both primarily serve as portable music players. However, Apple has introduced several iPod models over the years that have different features, such as the iPod Touch, which comes with a touch screen, internet access, and support for various apps. Other MP3 players generally don't have these additional features. 3. Compatibility: In terms of file format compatibility, some non-iPod MP3 players support a wider range of audio file formats like FLAC, OGG, or WMA, while iPods mostly work well with their proprietary AAC format and MP3. Using iTunes, Apple encourages users to manage their content and sync it with their device. In contrast, most other MP3 players can be managed using various software or even by directly accessing the device's storage through Windows Explorer, which offers more flexibility. 4. Ecosystem: Perhaps the most notable difference is the ecosystem that surrounds the iPod. Apple has built a comprehensive ecosystem through its iTunes store and its integration with other Apple devices and services. This makes managing and syncing music across devices easier if you are using multiple Apple products. On the other hand, other MP3 players do not have a specific ecosystem like Apple, but they can be compatible with various types of software and streaming platforms. As for the second question, it is not very feasible for an individual to assemble and install an iPod or MP3 player by themselves. These devices are generally manufactured in factories where several small and precise components are carefully assembled through automated processes or by specialized technicians. It would be challenging for an individual without proper knowledge, materials, and tools to assemble an iPod or MP3 player from scratch. However, if you are referring to installing a specific MP3 player or iPod software on your computer, then yes, it is possible for an individual to do so. In the case of the iPod, you would install the iTunes software, whereas other MP3 players may require their manufacturer's software or simply plug-and-play through USB. This process is generally simple and can be done with instructions available online."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: I loved the little guy from the day she brought him home. She carried him wrapped in a sweatshirt from the shelter at the corner where she'd been saying for months she was going to go.

He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath.

Sean studied about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. Gabe studied about other influencing factors. Which student read more about a greater frequency of collisions? Hint: Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases. Answer:","completion":"Sean read more about a greater frequency of collisions, as he studied the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. When the temperature is raised, reactant particles move faster, resulting in a higher rate of collisions. Furthermore, these collisions occur with a greater force, making them more likely to overcome the activation energy barrier and lead to the formation of products.

News article: WASHINGTON (AP) — After his press secretary blasted it as an example of rampant government overreach, President Donald Trump signed a bill into law Monday that could eventually allow internet providers to sell information about their customers' browsing habits. The bill scraps a Federal Communications Commission online privacy regulation issued in October to give consumers more control over how companies like Comcast, AT&T and Verizon share that information. Critics have argued that the rule would stifle innovation and pick winners and losers among internet companies. The regulation was scheduled to take effect later this year, but Congress used its authority under the obscure Congressional Review Act to wipe it from the books. With a Republican president in the White House, the GOP-controlled Congress has turned to the 20-year-old law to scrap numerous regulations that Republicans say are costly, burdensome or excessive, many of which were finalized in the closing months of Democrat Barack Obama's presidency. Internet companies like Google don't have to ask their users for permission before tracking what sites they visit, a discrepancy that Republicans and industry group have blasted as both unfair to companies and confusing to consumers. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said last week that the president's support for the bill was part of a larger effort \\"to fight Washington red tape that stifles American innovation, job creation and economic growth.\\" \\"The president pledged to reverse this type of federal overreach in which bureaucrats in Washington take the interest of one group of companies over the interest of others,\\" picking the winners and losers, he said. Supporters of the privacy measure argued that the company that sells an internet connection can see even more about consumers, such as every website they visit and whom they exchange emails with, information that would be particularly useful for advertisers and marketers. Undoing the regulation leaves people's online information in a murky area. Experts say federal law still requires broadband providers to protect customer information — but it doesn't spell out how or what companies must do, which is what the online privacy rule aimed to do. The absence of clear privacy rules means companies that supply internet service, and who can monitor how consumers use it, can continue to mine that information for use in their own advertising businesses. Consumer advocates also worry that the companies will be a rich target for hackers. Ajit Pai, the agency chairman appointed by Trump, has said he wanted to roll back the broadband privacy rules. Pai and other Republicans want a different federal agency, the Federal Trade Commission, to police privacy for both broadband companies like AT&T and internet companies like Google. Broadband providers don't fall under the trade commission's jurisdiction, and advocates say that agency historically has been weaker than the communications commission. Trump signed three other bills Monday, including one that eliminates a rule that prohibited the use of tactics like baiting and shooting bears from the air on the National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska. ___ The bills are S.J. Res 34 and H.J. Res 69 ___ Associated Press writers Kevin Freking in Washington and Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report. ___ Follow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap ||||| WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday signed a repeal of Obama-era broadband privacy rules, the White House said, a victory for internet service providers and a blow to privacy advocates. Republicans in Congress last week narrowly passed the repeal of the privacy rules with no Democratic support and over the strong objections of privacy advocates. The signing, disclosed in White House statement late on Monday, follows strong criticism of the bill, which is a win for AT&T; Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc. The bill repeals regulations adopted in October by the Federal Communications Commission under the Obama administration requiring internet service providers to do more to protect customers’ privacy than websites like Alphabet Inc’s Google or Facebook Inc. The rules had not yet taken effect but would have required internet providers to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, children’s information and web browsing history for advertising and marketing. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai praised the repeal in a statement late on Monday for having “appropriately invalidated one part of the Obama-era plan for regulating the internet.” Those flawed privacy rules, which never went into effect, were designed to benefit one group of favored companies, not online consumers.” Pai said the FCC would work with the Federal Trade Commission, which oversees websites, to restore the “FTC’s authority to police internet service providers’ privacy practices.” Republican FCC commissioners have said the Obama rules would unfairly give websites the ability to harvest more data than internet service providers. The action is the latest in a string of reversals of Obama administration rules. On Monday, the FCC reversed a requirement that Charter Communications Inc extend broadband service to 1 million homes that already have a high-speed provider. On Friday, Comcast, Verizon AT&T; Inc said they would voluntarily not sell customers’ individual internet browsing information. Verizon does not sell personal web browsing histories and has no plans to do so but the company said it has two advertising programs that use “de-identified” customer browsing data, including one that uses “aggregate insights that might be useful for advertisers and other businesses.” The American Civil Liberties Union said last month Congress should have opposed “industry pressure to put profits over privacy” and added “most Americans believe that their sensitive internet information should be closely guarded.” President Trump speaks in the East Room of the White House. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts Trade group USTelecom Chief Executive Jonathan Spalter in a statement praised Trump for “stopping rules that would have created a confusing and conflicting consumer privacy framework.” Last week, 46 Senate Democrats urged Trump not to sign the bill, arguing most Americans “believe that their private information should be just that.” Republicans later this year are expected to move to overturn net neutrality provisions that in 2015 reclassified broadband providers and treated them like a public utility - a move that is expected to spark an even bigger fight. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"The President, Mr. Trump, signed a bill that may allow internet providers to sell information on what people do online. This removes a rule that was supposed to protect people's privacy by controlling how companies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon share this information. Some people think that undoing the rule will help businesses grow, while others are worried about people's privacy. With no clear rules, internet service companies might continue to use this information for their own businesses, like advertising, and it might be a target for bad people (hackers) trying to steal this information."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Premise: West of Puerta del Sol is the city's 18th-century expansion engineered by the Bourbon monarchs. In the premise, we learn about the city's expansion during the 18th century. The Bourbon monarchs were responsible for this development, and it took place in the west of Puerta del Sol. This statement conveys the idea that the Bourbon monarchs played a significant role in expanding the city and were instrumental in its growth during that time. Hypothesis: The Bourbon monarchs resisted expansion. The hypothesis, conversely, claims that the Bourbon monarchs were opposed to expansion. This statement suggests that they tried to restrict or prevent the city's growth rather than promoting it. It is the exact opposite of the idea presented in the premise where the Bourbon monarchs were responsible for the city's expansion during the 18th century. Conclusion: Based on the analysis of the two statements, the premise and the hypothesis contradict each other instead of entailing one another.

November 14, 2016, marked one such rare occurrence: an extra-super moon that hadn't been seen since 1948, and that will not grace our skies again until November 25, 2034. The Super Supermoon While a regular supermoon occurs when the full moon coincides with its perigee - the point at which it swings closest to Earth during its orbit - the extra-super moon of November 14 boasted an even more spectacular display. This additional feature was owed to the fact that the moon attained ultimate fullness within two hours or so of perigee. According to NASA, this unique alignment caused the moon to appear up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than normal, which is why it was dubbed as an \\"extra-super moon.\\" This phenomenon was recognized by ScienceAlert as the \\"one astronomical event\\" you had to see in 2016.

Meanwhile, those residing in the western part of the country could catch the spectacle at 5:52am local time on November 14. This rare celestial happening was indeed a sight to behold and held a special place in the hearts of astronomical enthusiasts around the world.

Background: A comet tail—and coma—are features visible in comets when they are illuminated by the Sun and may become visible from Earth when a comet passes through the inner Solar System. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. Paragraph: This year thee comets would be of interest, comet A, comet B, and comet C. Comet A and comet B would enter the inner solar system. But comet C would not enter the inner solar system.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: In what reaction will the formation of organomagnesium halide fail if water is present? Context: There are many important organozinc compounds. Organozinc chemistry is the science of organozinc compounds describing their physical properties, synthesis and reactions. Among important applications is the Frankland-Duppa Reaction in which an oxalate ester(ROCOCOOR) reacts with an alkyl halide R'X, zinc and hydrochloric acid to the α-hydroxycarboxylic esters RR'COHCOOR, the Reformatskii reaction which converts α-halo-esters and aldehydes to β-hydroxy-esters, the Simmons–Smith reaction in which the carbenoid (iodomethyl)zinc iodide reacts with alkene(or alkyne) and converts them to cyclopropane, the Addition reaction of organozinc compounds to carbonyl compounds. The Barbier reaction (1899) is the zinc equivalent of the magnesium Grignard reaction and is better of the two. In presence of just about any water the formation of the organomagnesium halide will fail, whereas the Barbier reaction can even take place in water. On the downside organozincs are much less nucleophilic than Grignards, are expensive and difficult to handle. Commercially available diorganozinc compounds are dimethylzinc, diethylzinc and diphenylzinc.

What are the keywords in the following sentence: climbing hills on the blue trail","completion":"In order to identify the keywords in a sentence, we need to discern the words that carry the most significant meaning or those that stand out due to their relevance in understanding the overall context. In the provided sentence, \\"climbing hills on the blue trail\\", the keywords are as follows: 1. \\"Climbing\\" - This is the primary action being performed in the sentence. As a keyword, it helps identify what activity is being done. 2. \\"Hills\\" - This is the primary object or environment where the activity is occurring. The mention of 'hills' gives us an idea of the geographic or physical situation that is being dealt with, and hence acts as a vital keyword in understanding the context of the sentence. 3. \\"Blue Trail\\" - This is a specific detail that denotes the exact location or path where the action is happening. \\"Blue trail\\" could be referring to a specific trail known by that name, or could metaphorically be referring to a path or direction that is characterised by a certain attribute (in this case 'blue'). So, in either of the scenarios 'blue trail' is a keyword, providing crucial information about the whereabouts or the circumstances linked to the action. These are the keywords in the sentence because each provides vital information that frames the overall meaning and context. Without these keywords, it would be challenging to grasp what activity is being proposed, where it’s happening, and under what circumstance or conditions. Together, these words guide the comprehension of the entire sentence by depicting an image of someone climbing hills on a path or a direction known as the blue trail."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I remember that you told me you were called Cigarette because of your features. You have seen me through difficult times, happy times and just about every stage of my life. You have always been here when I need you. Some of my family and friends didn't like you so much, but I've always been on your side. I thought you were a great friend, and I _ you at all times, especially when I was not very happy. It's hard for me to tell you this, but in the past few months, I have been seriously thinking about ending our relationship. I think that I've just been too dependent on you, and I feel that at the age of 35 I should start being more independent. I thought about just maybe seeing you once in a while, but I don't think that would work. Eventually, I'd start relying on you all the time again. I feel the only way to end our relationship is to end it forever. I've always included you in everything I've done. But next week, I'm going on a trip, and I've decided not to take you along. I feel this would be a good time to break up. I will be gone for a whole week without you and if I can make it on my own for that week, I know I can make it forever.

JURIST seeks to encourage teaching, learning, and scholarship within the legal community and in the general community. - Saint Thomas Aquinas (1225 7 March 1274), was an Italian Dominican friar, Catholic priest, and Doctor of the Church. He was an immensely influential philosopher, theologian, and jurist in the tradition of scholasticism, within which he is also known as the Doctor Angelicus and the Doctor Communis. The name \\"Aquinas\\" identifies his ancestral origins in the county of Aquino in present-day Lazio. - A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theology or science. The term \\"philosopher\\" comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"philosophos\\") meaning \\"lover of wisdom\\". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC). - Scholasticism is a method of critical thought which dominated teaching by the academics (\\"scholastics,\\" or \\"schoolmen\\") of medieval universities in Europe from about 1100 to 1700, and a program of employing that method in articulating and defending dogma in an increasingly pluralistic context. It originated as an outgrowth of and a departure from Christian monastic schools at the earliest European universities. The first institutions in the West to be considered universities were established in Italy, France, Spain, and England in the late 11th and the 12th centuries for the study of arts, law, medicine, and theology, such as Schola Medica Salernitana, the University of Bologna, and the University of Paris. It is difficult to define the date at which they became true universities, although the lists of studia generalia for higher education in Europe are a useful guide, held by the Catholic Church and its various religious orders. - Adam Pulchrae Mulieris , also called Adam de Puteorumvilla , was a Paris master who studied under Peter of Lamballe , who flourished in the first half of the 13th century . Little is known of his life . He has been described as one of the \`\` metaphysicians of light '' ( Robert Grosseteste was another ) . He was a contemporary of William of Auvergne , Bishop of Paris , and his works are cited by Richard de Fournival , Gerard of Abbeville and Thomas Aquinas . The origin of his name is unknown . The only book seriously attributed to him is Memoriale Rerum Difficilium , also known as De Intelligentiis . This was originally attributed to Witelo . It was published as Adam 's in 1908 but in the 1930s the question of this attribution was re-opened . - Trouvère, sometimes spelled trouveur , is the Northern French (langue d'oïl) form of the langue d'oc (Occitan) word \\"trobador\\". It refers to poet-composers who were roughly contemporary with and influenced by the troubadours (composers and performers of Old Occitan lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages) but who composed their works in the northern dialects of France. The first known \\"trouvère\\" was Chrétien de Troyes (\\"fl\\". 1160s-1180s) (Butterfield, 1997) and the \\"trouvères\\" continued to flourish until about 1300. Some 2130 \\"trouvère\\" poems have survived; of these, at least two-thirds have melodies. - Canonization is the act by which the Catholic Church and Anglican Communion declare that a person who has died was a saint, upon which declaration the person is included in the canon, or list, of recognized saints. Originally, people were recognized as saints without any formal process. Later, different processes, such as those used today in the Eastern Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Church, were developed. - Robert Grosseteste ( 9 October 1253) was an English statesman, scholastic philosopher, theologian, scientist and Bishop of Lincoln. He was born of humble parents at Stradbroke in Suffolk. Upon his death, he was almost universally revered as a saint in England, but attempts to procure a formal canonization failed. A. C. Crombie calls him \\"the real founder of the tradition of scientific thought in medieval Oxford, and in some ways, of the modern English intellectual tradition\\". - Mendicant orders refers primarily to certain Christian religious orders that have adopted a lifestyle of poverty, travelling, and living in urban areas for purposes of preaching, evangelization, and ministry, especially to the poor. At their foundation these orders rejected the previously established monastic model of living in one stable, isolated community where members worked at a trade and owned property in common, including land, buildings and other wealth. By contrast, the mendicants avoided owning property, did not work at a trade, and embraced a poor, often itinerant lifestyle. They depended for their survival on the goodwill of the people to whom they preached. - Gerard of Abbeville (1220-1272) was a theologian from the University of Paris. He formally became a theologian in 1257 and from then was known as an opponent of the mendicant orders, particularly in the second stage of the conflict, taking part in a concerted attack that temporarily affected their privileges. - The Bishop of Lincoln is the ordinary of the Church of England Diocese of Lincoln in the Province of Canterbury. - The University of Paris, metonymically known as the Sorbonne (its historical house), was a university in Paris, France. Appearing around 1150 as a corporation associated with the Notre Dame de Paris cathedral school, it was the second-oldest modern university in Europe. Chartered in 1200 by King Philip II (Philippe-Auguste) of France and recognised in 1215 by Pope Innocent III, it was often nicknamed after its theology collegiate institution, College of Sorbonne, founded about 1257 by Robert de Sorbon. - Doctor of the Church (Latin \\"doctor\\" \\"teacher\\") is a title given by the Catholic Church to saints whom they recognize as having been of particular importance, particularly regarding their contribution to theology or doctrine. - Richard de Fournival or Richart de Fornival (1201 ?1260) was a medieval philosopher and trouvère perhaps best known for the \\"Bestiaire d'amour\\" (\\"The Bestiary of Love\\"). - Oxford is a city in the South East region of England and the county town of Oxfordshire. With a population of 159,994 it is the 52nd largest city in the United Kingdom, and one of the fastest growing and most ethnically diverse. The city is situated from London, from Bristol, from both Southampton and Birmingham and from Reading. - A friar is a member of one of the mendicant orders founded since the twelfth or thirteenth century; the term distinguishes the mendicants' itinerant apostolic character, exercised broadly under the jurisdiction of a superior general, from the older monastic orders' allegiance to a single monastery formalized by their vow of stability. The most significant orders of friars are the Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians and Carmelites. What object entity has the relation of 'occupation' with the subject 'adam pulchrae mulieris'?

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Teacher:In this task you are expected to write an SQL query that will return the data asked for in the question. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Let's assume the table has a column named \`authorized_by\` which contains the \`employee_id\`. 3. Write the SQL query to select the required data: You need to count the number of document destructions authorized by each employee. So, you can use the COUNT() function with the GROUP BY statement: \`\`\`sql SELECT authorized_by AS employee_id, COUNT(*) as destruction_count FROM destruction_records GROUP BY authorized_by; \`\`\` This query selects the \`authorized_by\` column as \`employee_id\` and counts the number of destructions for each employee by using the COUNT(*) function.

But most are there to catch the trains that enter and leave from the station. It is the largest train station in the world. There are 67 train tracks, all of them underground. The main part of the building has large, arched windows, a jeweled four-sided clock and ticket windows. Grand Central has been seen in many movies through the years. Dan Brucker is with the New York Transit Authority, which operates the station. Dan Brucker has worked for the transit authority at Grand Central for 30 years.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1 and Question 2 are not asking the same thing. They are asking for completely different information related to hedge funds. Let me break down the two questions for you: Question 1: What % ROI do top hedge funds average? This question is asking for the average percentage Return on Investment (ROI) of top hedge funds. ROI is a metric used to evaluate the efficiency of an investment, and it is calculated by dividing the profit from an investment by the cost of the investment. In the context of hedge funds, it refers to how well a fund's investment strategies are performing, generating gains on the assets under management. It is important to note that the ROI of top hedge funds can vary greatly depending on factors such as market conditions, investment strategy, and the fund manager's expertise. Historically, top hedge funds have averaged anywhere from 10% to 20% annually, with some even reporting much higher figures. However, these figures change from year to year, and there is no guarantee that every top hedge fund will achieve this level of performance in any given year. Question 2: Who are the top 100 women in hedge funds?

Write an article using the following points: The U.S. economy is roaring and the Russian economy is sagging. President Obama is in an approval slump, but Vladimir Putin is seeing a popular surge. Article:","completion":"Title: A Comparative Analysis of U.S. and Russian Economies amid Leadership Approval Ratings Introduction: The Global Economic Scene In the complex web of international politics and economics, two superpowers often find themselves at the forefront of discussions: the United States of America and the Russian Federation. Despite their fluctuating relations and varying approaches to governance, these two nations hold significant sway over the global stage. In recent years, a noteworthy development has emerged, as the U.S. economy soars and the Russian economy lags. Interestingly, the leaders of these countries, President Barack Obama and President Vladimir Putin, have experienced contrasting approval ratings, with Putin gaining popularity and Obama's approval levels dipping. This article delves into the reasons and implications of this multifaceted phenomenon. The U.S. Economy: A Roaring Comeback In the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, the U.S. economy experienced considerable challenges that jeopardized its stability and growth. However, through concerted efforts and strategic policy implementation, the U.S. has managed to establish a solid economic recovery. Factors that contributed to this success include consistent job growth, low unemployment rates, and strong consumer confidence. The resilience and adaptability of the country's industries, workforce, and financial markets also played a significant role in bouncing back from the recession. In addition, policy measures like the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing and a commitment to fiscal responsibility aided the nation on a sustainable upward trajectory. The Russian Economy: A Sinking Ship? While the U.S. economy flourishes, the Russian economy appears to be experiencing some turbulence. Factors contributing to the spiraling Russian economy include a significant decrease in oil prices, international sanctions following the country's annexation of Crimea, and a lack of diversified industries. As a result, Russia has witnessed a decline in its Gross Domestic Product (GDP), increased inflation, and a weaker national currency, the ruble. Consequently, the country's standard of living has been adversely impacted, leading to a deterioration of growth prospects and increased financial vulnerability. Leadership Approval Ratings: The Obama and Putin Divide Amid the contrasting economic performances, an intriguing development persists regarding the approval ratings of the respective leaders of the United States and Russia. President Barack Obama experienced a slump in his approval rating, with possible reasons including the divisive nature of U.S. politics, general dissatisfaction with the rate of economic recovery, and concerns over healthcare reform. On the other hand, President Vladimir Putin has seen a surge in popularity, with many Russians attributing the country's ability to hold on to a semblance of stability in the face of adversity to Putin's strong, resolute leadership style. This has earned Putin a reputation for defending the nation's interests, particularly in response to perceived encroachments from the West. Implications and Future Prospects The United States' booming economy coupled with a dwindling Russian economy can impact the global balance of power. As the U.S. economy strengthens, investments and spending will likely increase, allowing American influence to expand across the globe. Moreover, a stronger economy can bolster the country's military capabilities, reinforcing its international dominance as a superpower. On the other hand, the Russian economy's vulnerability could lead to an increased reliance on foreign investments, dwindling resources, and potential economic stagnation. The sagging economy might limit Russia's ability to invest in military advancements and modernize its infrastructure. However, Putin's high approval ratings could serve to push an agenda that seemingly prioritizes the consolidation of power. As a result, the global community must remain cautious and vigilant in monitoring the progression of these trends. Conclusion: Unraveling Tides of Change Ultimately, the U.S. and Russian economic dynamics and the approval ratings of their leaders exemplify the complexities inherent in the global political and economic landscape. While on the surface, these issues may seem unrelated, they present important insights into the intricacies of international relations, the impact of economic performances on political popularity, and the nature of power dynamics. As the world continues to evolve, staying attuned to these ever-shifting tides of change is essential in navigating future challenges and opportunities."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
