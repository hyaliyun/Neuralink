Please answer this question: when did table tennis become an olympic sport?","completion":"Table tennis, also known as ping-pong, became an Olympic sport in the year 1988 during the Seoul Olympic Games in South Korea. This sport has a rich history tracing back to its origins in the late 19th century as an indoor adaptation of lawn tennis. Over the years, table tennis grew in popularity and evolved in terms of rules, equipment, and playing techniques. The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) was established in 1926, marking a significant step towards the sport's global recognition. However, it took several more decades for table tennis to earn its place as an Olympic sport. Before joining the Olympic program, the sport was predominantly featured in the World Championships and regional competitions, including the European Championships and Asian Championships. The introduction of table tennis into the Summer Olympic Games in 1988 occurred with much fanfare. The competition consisted of singles and doubles events for both men and women. The first-ever Olympic table tennis gold medal was won by Yoo Nam-Kyu of South Korea in the men's singles category, while Chen Jing from China secured the first gold in the women's singles category. The Chinese national team dominated the 1988 Olympic table tennis events, winning a total of four gold, three silver, and two bronze medals. Since its introduction in 1988, table tennis has remained a constant fixture in the Olympic program. Over the years, the sport has primarily been dominated by Asian countries, particularly China. One notable change to the Olympic table tennis format occurred in 2008, at the Beijing Olympics, when the doubles event was replaced by team events. In conclusion, table tennis became an Olympic sport in 1988 at the Seoul Summer Olympic Games, where the world's top players began their journey of winning Olympic glory. The sport has grown in popularity since then and remains an integral part of the Olympic competition. Today, table tennis fans and players across the globe look forward to witnessing Olympic achievements, as new and exciting talents continue to emerge on the world stage."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Below the melting polar ice caps, a 200-foot-long praying mantis, trapped in the ice for millions of years, begins to stir. Soon after, the military personnel at Red Eagle One, a military station in northern Canada that monitors information gathered from the Distant Early Warning Line, realize that the men at one of their outposts are not responding to calls. Commanding officer Col. Joe Parkman flies there to investigate, and finds the post destroyed, its men gone, and giant slashes left in the snow outside. When a radar blip is sighted, Joe sends his pilots out to investigate, but their intended target disappears. Soon an Air Force plane is attacked by the deadly mantis. He searches the wreckage, and this time, in addition to the huge slashes, finds a five-foot-long pointed object in the snow. He takes it to General Mark Ford at the Continental Air Defense in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Ford gathers top scientists, including Professor Anton Gunther, to examine the object, but when they cannot identify it, Gunther recommends calling in Dr. Nedrick Jackson, a paleontologist at the Museum of Natural History. When Ned gets the call from Ford, he is helping museum magazine editor Marge Blaine plan her next issue, and dodges her questions as she begs him for a big scoop. Later, after examining the object, Ned recognizes it as a torn-off spur from an insect's leg, and soon guesses, from evidence that the creature ate human flesh, that it must be a gigantic praying mantis. Meanwhile, in the Arctic, the people of an Eskimo village spot the mantis in the sky, and although they hurry to their boats to escape, it swoops down and kills several men., what would be the answer ?

Sentence Structure: The sentence lacks proper structure and coherence. The intended meaning or message is not effectively conveyed, leaving the reader uncertain about the intended purpose or situation being described. 2. Grammatical Issues: The phrasing \\"The store staffed with employees\\" represents an incoherent statement with a problematic verb tense and structure. The verb \\"staffed\\" is in the past participle form, which indicates a completed action in the past. 3. Ambiguity: Without context or proper syntax, the sentence could potentially be interpreted in various ways. By including additional information, such as the time frame or intention, the sentence could be clarified. For example, it could be rephrased as \\"The store was staffed with employees\\" or \\"The store will be staffed with employees,\\" depending on the intended meaning. 4. Lack of Clarity: The original sentence does not provide enough information about the store's situation or events concerning the employment of staff members. Readers may need more context to understand whether this staffing is a regular occurrence, a unique event, or relevant to a particular circumstance. For these reasons, I believe that the linguistic integrity of the original sentence is unacceptable. A more clear and grammatically correct sentence might be: \\"The store was staffed with employees during operating hours\\" or \\"The store is currently staffed with employees to assist customers.\\" Both of these options better convey the intended meaning while maintaining proper linguistic integrity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: The Mask of Zorro Movie plot: In 1821, the Mexican Army is on the verge of liberating its country from Spanish colonial rule. In the area of Las Californias the ruthless Spanish Governor, Don Rafael Montero, is about to be overthrown. In a last ditch effort to trap his nemesis, the masked swordsman Zorro (Anthony Hopkins), Montero prepares to execute three innocent townspeople. With assistance from two orphan brothers, Joaquin and Alejandro Murrieta, Zorro releases the prisoners. Zorro rewards the Murrieta brothers with a special medallion he wears, and escapes on his horse, Toronado, after cutting a \\"Z\\" into Montero's neck as a parting gift and warning. The same night, however, Montero confronts Zorro at his home, having deduced that Zorro is really Don Diego de la Vega, a Spanish nobleman married to Esperanza, the woman Montero had always loved. Attempting to arrest Diego, a fight ensues, during which Esperanza is killed while trying to protect Diego. Diego's house is burned and his infant daughter, Elena, is taken to Spain by Montero to be raised as his own while Diego is taken to prison. Twenty years later, Montero secretly returns to California, looking for Diego in the old prison. Although de La Vega is there, Montero does not recognize him, while several prisoners claim to be Zorro (taken from the famous scene of Spartacus). Diego later escapes, intent on killing Montero the following day at a public ceremony for Montero's return. However, Diego restrains himself when he sees Eléna (Catherine Zeta-Jones), now a beautiful young lady. Elena is presented with a bouquet of flowers - Romagnas, native to California - the scent of which she recognizes, although she incorrectly believes she has never been to California before. Diego soon meets an adult Alejandro Murrieta (Antonio Banderas), whom he recognizes by the medal he awarded Joaquin. Now a drunken, clumsy bandit, Alejandro is bitter over the recent capture of his mentor, bandit Three-Fingered Jack (L. Q. Jones), and the murder of Joaquin by the sadistic Texian Army Captain Harrison... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"The Mask of Zorro,\\" De La Vega (played by Anthony Hopkins) reveals a few significant pieces of information to Elena (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones). Firstly, De La Vega tells Elena about her true parentage. He informs her that she is not Don Rafael Montero's daughter but is actually the daughter of Don Diego de la Vega and his late wife, Esperanza. Montero had taken Elena as an infant when Esperanza was killed, raised her as his own, and took her away to Spain. This revelation changes Elena's perception of herself, her origins, and her loyalties. Secondly, Diego de la Vega reveals to Elena his secret identity as Zorro, the legendary masked vigilante who fought for justice and served as a protector of the people. This information not only alters Elena's understanding of her father but also motivates her to join the fight against injustice and tyranny alongside him. Lastly, De La Vega tells Elena about the significance of the Romagna flowers. These flowers are native to California, and she recognizes their scent from her early childhood before she was taken away. This serves as further evidence of her true origins and strengthens her connection to her true family and homeland. These revelations shared by De La Vega with Elena play a crucial role in shaping her character development and her actions throughout the film. It also sets the foundation for the eventual partnership between her, Diego, and Alejandro (played by Antonio Banderas) as they work together to defeat Don Rafael Montero and bring justice to the people of Las Californias."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"The supposed perturbation in this case would be indirectly impacting a step of the process. Here's an explanation for each step of the erosion process mentioned: 1. Waves hit the coast: This step remains unaffected by the soil's nutrient content. 2. Waves have energy that pushes the water and sediment: The energy of the waves is unrelated to the nutrients in the soil, so this step is unaffected as well. 3. The sediment can help erode land like sandpaper: Nutrient-rich soil might lead to more plant growth, which could, in turn, help anchor the soil and make it more resistant to erosion. In this case, the nutritious soil will make it harder for the sediment to act like sandpaper, indirectly impacting this step. 4. Water washes the sediment back: This step remains unaffected by the nutrient content of the soil, as water continues to wash sediments away. However, indirectly, if there's less erosion due to more robust plant growth, there may be fewer sediments for the water to wash back. 5. Some sediment is left as sand: This step also can be indirectly impacted, as the amount of sediment eroded will be affected by the nutritious soil. Overall, the nutritious soil will likely lead to more plant growth, which could impact the sediment's ability to erode the land and the water's ability to wash sediments away, causing less erosion than usual. This effect is indirect, as it doesn't directly change the way waves behave or their energy. Instead, it affects the ability of the waves to move sediments and erode the coast by influencing the growth of plants that anchor the soil."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve this problem.","completion":"To solve the equation 595*j + 24*j + 38896 = -1968*j - 2275*j for j, first we need to combine all the like terms involving j, which are the terms with j's as their variable. This will give us a simplified equation. Let me illustrate this process step by step. 1. Combine the like terms involving j on both sides of the equation: Left side: 595*j + 24*j = 619*j Right side: -1968*j - 2275*j = -4243*j 2. Now substitute these into the original equation: 619*j + 38896 = -4243*j 3. To isolate the j terms, add 4243*j to both sides of the equation: 619*j + 4243*j + 38896 = -4243*j + 4243*j Simplifying both sides gives: 4862*j + 38896 = 0 4. Now we want to solve for j. To do this, we will need to isolate j. To get rid of the constant term (+38896) on the left side of the equation, subtract 38896 from both sides: 4862*j = -38896 5. Finally, divide both sides by 4862 to solve for j: j = -38896 / 4862 j ≈ -8 So, our solution is j ≈ -8."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

With a little creative application, a single lemon can serve as both cleaning solution and sponge. Cut the lemon down the middle widthwise. You can now grip it by the peel-side and use it as a handheld scrubber to treat yucky shower stains. Pick out the seeds before you start scrubbing so they don’t end up at the bottom of your shower. The natural acids in lemon juice are safe enough for you to use them to clean your shower as often as you’d like without having to worry about wearing down the acrylic finish. You may also have success using another type of citrus, such as grapefruit. Work the exposed fruit over the acrylic surface. As you press the lemon into the acrylic, the juice will gradually squeeze out, breaking up hard water stains, mold and mineral deposits. After you’ve worn the lemon down, simply grab the other half or cut a new one and keep going over the area until it’s spotless. Just as a precaution, avoid using lemon in conjunction with other green cleaning ingredients like sea salt. Even water-soluble abrasives may be enough to scratch up acrylic. Once you’ve given the shower a thorough scrubbing, give the lemon juice a little time to work its magic. Though mild, the acids that the juice contains will usually be enough to deal with the majority of commonplace stains. The longer you let the juice soak, the better the end result will be. Lemon juice is especially useful for dissolving stains that result from exposure to hard water or chemicals. Citric acid will not only clean and disinfect, it will also help brighten up the acrylic and restore it to its original luster. Flush every surface of the shower with warm water, taking care to get rid of any lingering juice or pulp from the lemon. If necessary, go back over the acrylic one more time with a soft towel or sponge. When you’re done, your shower should be pristine and have a fresh, clean scent! Summary:","completion":"1.

What is the answer: Who is the Roman goddess of love and beauty?","completion":"The Roman goddess of love and beauty is Venus. Venus holds immense importance and influence in Roman mythology, as she embodies love, beauty, fertility, and prosperity. The Roman pantheon was heavily influenced by Greek mythology, and Venus is the Roman counterpart of the Greek goddess Aphrodite. The Romans were known to adopt gods from various cultures and modified them according to their own beliefs and values. Venus was adopted from the Etruscan goddess Turan, and her character and attributes were developed and shaped over time. Born from the sea foam after the mutilation of Uranus, Venus is considered the divine ancestress of the Roman people via Aeneas, a Trojan hero and his son, Julius. According to Roman legend, Aeneas played a crucial role in the founding of Rome, and Julius was progenitor of the Roman gens Julia, which includes Julius Caesar and the Julio-Claudian dynasty of emperors. This ancestry made Venus a central figure in the Roman identity and culture. Venus was worshipped and celebrated in various ways. She had multiple aspects and epithets within the Roman pantheon. For instance, Venus Victrix symbolized victory, specifically in the battle of Carthage, and Venus Genetrix symbolized motherhood and fertility, relating to the goddess as a divine ancestor of the Romans. Venus Verticordia was celebrated as a protector of female chastity, and Venus Felix was a representation of good fortune and blessings. Throughout Roman history, Venus has been associated with several festivals, most notably the Veneralia, held on the 1st of April. During this celebration, people offered prayers to Venus Verticordia for her assistance in matters of love and chastity. Venus was also commemorated during the festival called the Quinquatrus, in which artists and other creative professionals honored her as Venus Libertina for her influence in artistic inspiration and originality. Temples dedicated to Venus have been found in various parts of the Roman Empire. The most famous of these is the Temple of Venus and Roma, constructed by the Roman emperor Hadrian in the 2nd century AD. It was the largest temple in Rome and included a statue of Venus wearing a crown, emphasizing her divine status. Throughout history, Venus's magnetic allure has remained a prevalent theme in art and literature, with countless works depicting her physical beauty and supernatural powers. Artists from the Renaissance era, such as Botticelli and Titian, created iconic paintings that showcased her sensual grace and allure. Despite the decline of the Roman Empire and the eventual conversion to Christianity, the influence of the Roman goddess Venus still echoes in modern times. Today, her name is synonymous with love, beauty, and passion, imprinted into our collective cultural consciousness and continuing to serve as a muse for artists and philosophers alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If you ask what is going on, someone will tell you it's a charity activity. Though this charity program has not yet officially begun for Chinese users, this little green symbol has proven popular among Chinese Windows Live Messenger users. Windows Live Messenger's official blog announced on March 1 that Microsoft was beginning an \\"I'm\\" program in the United States. Every time someone starts a conversation using \\"I'm\\", Microsoft shares a part of the program's advertising income with nine organizations devoted to social causes. With every instant message a user sends, it helps deal with things one feels most interested in, including poverty, child protection, disease and worsening environment. One only has to add a certain code next to one's name for the organization one would like to support. \\"*red'u\\" is for the American Red Cross, \\"*bgca\\" is for Boys & Girls Clubs of America and \\"*unicef\\" stands for the American branch of UNICEF. After a Chinese blogger named \\"hung\\" introduced this program on his blog on March 2, \\"I'm\\" entered the Internet in China with no actual support from Microsoft. Beijing-based Youth Weekend reported that famous IT blogger Keso regarded this program's rapid spread as a successful virus marketing case. He thinks that the success of the \\"I'm\\" program is because it's spread by users without being a bother to others. This answers why \\"I'm\\" has spread so rapidly across the Internet like a virus with almost no advertisement. However, Feng Jinhu from the press center for Microsoft China toldYouth Weekendthat the \\"I'm\\" project is only for Messenger users in the United States. Instant messages sent by Chinese users would not count. This has not affected Chinese Messenger users' interest in the little green symbol. These users hope their instant messages will actually contribute to charitable organizations someday.

The digestive system is the body system that digests food. It digest food in two ways, mechanically and chemically. Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed.

With the support of the anthropologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid) and the leader of the Bureau 713, Cmdr. Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff), and his squad, they battle against the evil creatures. In spite of having a charismatic good cast, leaded by Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, \\"Alone in the Dark\\" never works and is a complete mess, without development of characters or plot.

Answer the following question: I have been the brunt of cruelty from a doctor a number of times but I will relate one that has always stayed with me since I was a child. I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying. He instructed my mother \\"To get me the Hell out of his office.\\" Needless to say my mother never took any of us to see this old, miserable bastard again.

Question: Process: - Contact is made with a virus - The virus enters the human or animal body - The virus goes to the part of the body that contains its food - The virus consumes part of the body or materials that the body uses - The virus replicates and spreads - The virus causes symptoms in the body as the immune system tries to expel the virus. suppose the planet heating up happens, how will it affect the virus destroys less of the person's body. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The supposed perturbation in this scenario is indirectly impacting a step of the process. To understand how the planet heating up affects the virus and its ability to destroy less of the person's body, we need to consider various factors that contribute to the transmission, replication, and interaction of a virus with the host body under the influence of global warming. Firstly, higher temperatures can influence the survival rate and replication capacity of viruses. This could mean that some viruses might become less stable and effective in warmer conditions, leading to a partial decrease in their ability to destroy the host's body. However, it is also possible that some viruses may adapt and thrive in warmer environments, which can indirectly impact the virus life cycle and its potency. Secondly, global warming can alter the prevalence and distribution of vector-borne diseases, such as those transmitted by mosquitoes or ticks. As temperatures rise, the habitats of these vectors may expand, leading to an increased exposure risk or potential changes in transmission dynamics. This could indirectly influence the severity of viral infections and the body's ability to cope with the invasion. Thirdly, the impact of global warming on human and animal immune systems must be considered. Studies suggest that higher temperatures can trigger stress responses and weaken immune defenses, making individuals more susceptible to viral infections. In this context, the virus may destroy less of the person's body if the immune system is already compromised, and the virus does not need to replicate as widely to induce symptoms. Lastly, changes in human behavior due to global warming, such as increased indoor living or altered patterns of socialization, could affect viral transmission rates and the overall severity of infections. The indirect consequences of these changes on viral propagation and pathogenesis are still unclear but could potentially result in the virus destroying less of the individual's body if transmission is reduced, or the affected population's overall health is improved. In summary, the planetary heat-up indirectly impacts the virus-host interaction process by altering factors such as viral stability, vector-borne disease distribution, and immune system function. These changes can potentially result in the virus destroying less of the person's body, but it is crucial to note that this scenario is complex and depends on numerous interconnected factors."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Q: What happens when forces of evolution work over a long period of time?

Options: - practice - skill - thief - dexterity - knowledge of music The answer is \\"dexterity\\" because","completion":"fiddling with something generally refers to the physical manipulation or handling of an object or device, which requires a level of finesse, control, and coordination. Dexterity is the suitable answer for this question, as it represents the precise coordination and control over one's body movements, especially in the hands and fingers. Although other options like practice, skill, thief, and knowledge of music bear some relevance to different capacities, they don't necessarily apply in this context. Option 1 - Practice: While practice might develop or improve the skills required to fiddle with something, it is not an inherent skill itself. Practice is the process of refining and honing a skill, but possessing a level of dexterity is essential. Option 2 - Skill: Skill is a broad term that entails the ability to perform an action or accomplish a task, but it does not accurately represent the physical ability required to fiddle with something. Dexterity, on the other hand, is specific to the coordination and precision needed for such tasks. Option 3 - Thief: Thieves might have the ability to fiddle with objects, particularly when picking locks or engaging in other acts of theft. However, the term 'thief' is not a skill or ability, but rather, a label for someone who engages in stealing. Hence, it is not an appropriate answer to the question. Option 4 - Knowledge of Music: While the term \\"fiddling\\" can be associated with playing the fiddle or a violin, this answer doesn't necessarily address the broader context of fiddling with objects or devices. Moreover, possessing knowledge of music doesn't directly imply the physical ability to manipulate objects skillfully. In conclusion, dexterity is the most appropriate answer to the question because it accurately captures the physical ability to handle or manipulate objects with precision and control. It is a skill that can be honed and refined through practice, and it is widely useful, not just limited to certain professions or hobbies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's What to Expect in Today's Jobs Report U.S. job growth likely rebounded in June as striking Verizon employees returned to work and wages probably rose steadily, more evidence the economy has regained speed after a first-quarter lull. The U.S. Labor Department’s jobs tally due on Friday is likely to show nonfarm payrolls increased by 175,000 jobs last month after a meager 38,000 gain in May, according to a Reuters survey of economists. The unemployment rate is forecast rising to 4.8% from an 8-1/2-year low of 4.7% a month earlier as some job seekers returned to the labor market. The signs of economic strength would be welcomed by the Federal Reserve. Nonetheless, economists say the report will likely have little impact on the near-term interest rate outlook given the U.S. central bank’s desire to wait on more data to assess the economic impact of Britain’s stunning vote last month to leave the European Union. “Will a strong job number and solid GDP growth matter to the Fed? Probably not. The (Fed) members are like pinballs, bouncing from one temporary crisis to the next,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. The so-called Brexit referendum on June 23 roiled financial markets, raising fears that sustained volatility might negatively impact companies’ hiring and investment decisions. Economists have also warned that slower growth in Europe and a stronger dollar could weigh on the U.S. economy. Minutes of the Fed’s June 14-15 meeting published on Wednesday showed that officials “agreed that … it was prudent to wait for additional data on the consequences of the UK vote.” The Fed raised rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade, but markets now expect no further increase this year. May’s payroll gain—the smallest since September 2010—in part reflected the loss of 35,100 Verizon workers, who were excluded from the count while on a month-long strike. With their return, information industry employment likely snapped back. Job gains are also expected in the construction, retail, and leisure and hospitality sectors. Economists say unseasonably warm weather at the start of the year had pulled forward hiring in these areas, leading to payback in the last two months. Construction is also forecast to have added jobs after two months of declines, but manufacturing employment was likely unchanged and mining probably maintained its downward trend. Even with June’s anticipated jobs bounce back, forward momentum in the labor market has slowed. Job gains averaged 282,000 per month in the fourth quarter, but employment has increased by an average of only 150,000 jobs per month over first five months of this year. Economists say the deceleration is normal given the relatively advanced age of the economy’s recovery from the 2007-09 recession, with the labor market now near full employment. “The labor market is slowing because the business cycle is slowing. There is less slack to absorb,” said Thomas Costerg, senior U.S. economist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. Stronger payroll gains in June would add to data on consumer spending and housing in suggesting that economic growth accelerated from the first-quarter’s anemic 1.1% annualized rate. The Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank is currently forecasting the economy growing at a 2.4% pace in the second quarter. Tightening labor market conditions are expected to start putting upward pressure on wages. Average hourly earnings are forecast increasing 0.2% in June after a similar gain in May. The year-on-year gain in earnings could rise as high as 2.7% after advancing 2.5% in May. The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, is expected to rise after falling 0.2 percentage point to 62.6% in May. That drop unwound about two-thirds of the increase seen between last September and March this year. “Looking through the volatility … participation is stabilizing after several years of declines, and employment growth remains strong enough to gradually reduce remaining spare capacity in the labor market,” said Zach Pandl an economist at Goldman Sachs in New York. What was this article about?","completion":"This article discusses the expectations for the U.S. jobs report for June 2016. The report is anticipated to show a rebound in job growth, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 175,000 jobs after a weak gain in May.

The report would be welcomed by the Federal Reserve, but is unlikely to have a significant impact on interest rate decisions due to the uncertainty surrounding the economic consequences of Brexit.

Allow me to provide a detailed analysis of the relationships between these two sentences. Sentence 1: \\"Not only was it entirely circumstantial, but the greater part of it was practically unproved.\\" This sentence states two things: 1. The case was \\"entirely circumstantial,\\" meaning that the evidence provided in this case relies solely on indirect evidence and not on direct observation or testimony. 2. The \\"greater part\\" of the circumstantial evidence was \\"practically unproved,\\" implying that much of this indirect evidence was not effectively substantiated or supported in the case. Sentence 2: \\"The case presented was entirely circumstantial.\\" This sentence also asserts that the case was entirely circumstantial in nature. It refers to the same situation as described in Sentence 1, emphasizing that the case relies solely on indirect evidence without providing any direct observation or testimony. Now, let's look at the relationship between these two sentences. The information provided in Sentence 1 directly supports the statement made in Sentence 2. If we take Sentence 1 as true, we already know that the case is entirely circumstantial. This directly correlates with the statement made in Sentence 2, asserting that the case presented is entirely circumstantial. Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence is also true, as they both essentially convey the same idea about the case being entirely circumstantial in nature. The first sentence provides additional information about the \\"greater part\\" of the evidence being \\"practically unproved,\\" but this detail does not challenge or contradict the information given in the second sentence. Instead, it further emphasizes the circumstantial nature of the case, reinforcing the statement in Sentence 2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Various universities and other organizations, including British Telecom's Martlesham facility, have also conducted extensive research on signing via videotelephony. The use of sign language via videotelephony was hampered for many years due to the difficulty of its use over slow analogue copper phone lines, coupled with the high cost of better quality ISDN (data) phone lines.

Problem:Passage: The Mozart family grand tour was a journey through western Europe, undertaken by Leopold Mozart, his wife Anna Maria, and their musically gifted children Maria Anna (Nannerl) and Wolfgang Amadeus from 1763 to 1766. At the start of the tour the children were aged eleven and seven respectively. Their extraordinary skills had been demonstrated during a visit to Vienna in 1762, when they had played before the Empress Maria Theresa at the Imperial Court. Sensing the social and pecuniary opportunities that might accrue from a prolonged trip embracing the capitals and main cultural centres of Europe, Leopold obtained an extended leave of absence from his post as deputy Kapellmeister to the Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg. Throughout the subsequent tour, the children's Wunderkind status was confirmed as their precocious performances consistently amazed and gratified their audiences. The first stage of the tour's itinerary took the family, via Munich and Frankfurt, to Brussels and then on to Paris where they stayed for five months. They then departed for London, where during a stay of more than a year Wolfgang made the acquaintance of some of the leading musicians of the day, heard much music, and composed his first symphonies. The family then moved on to the Netherlands, where the schedule of performances was interrupted by the illnesses of both children, although Wolfgang continued to compose prolifically. The homeward phase incorporated a second stop in Paris and a trip through Switzerland, before the family's return to Salzburg in November 1766. The material rewards of the tour, though reportedly substantial, did not transform the family's lifestyle, and Leopold continued in the Prince-Archbishop's service. However, the journey enabled the children to experience to the full the cosmopolitan musical world, and gave them an outstanding education. In Wolfgang's case this would continue through further journeys in the following six years, prior to his appointment by the Prince-Archbishop as a court musician.

Former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker listens to comments during a panel discussion, on how the current financial crisis has changed the role of central banks, at the National Press Club in Washington October 11, 2010. WASHINGTON | WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker plans to leave his role as head of a panel of experts advising President Barack Obama on the economy, sources familiar with the decision said on Wednesday. The departure of Volcker, 83, from the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board is among a series of changes Obama is planning to announce soon. The decision to leave the board was Volcker's. A source close to him said he was ready to continue to advise Obama on an informal basis as often as the president would like. Volcker became a legendary figure on Wall Street when as Fed chief he broke the back of double-digit U.S. inflation in the early 1980s by sharply raising interest rates. He began advising Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign and has wielded clout on issues ranging from financial regulation to fiscal policy. Unique among people who offer economic counsel to Obama from the outside, Volcker has a direct line to the president and does not need to go through the White House economic team to schedule a meeting or a phone call. But there have been moments of awkwardness for him. Volcker frequently delivers speeches to policy and business audiences, and it has been frustrating for him that when he comments publicly on issues like a value-added tax, his presidential advisory board role has sometimes led people to mistakenly assume he is speaking on behalf of the White House. The White House declined to comment on Volcker's exit. The formal announcement of Volcker's departure is likely to come on Friday when Obama will unveil a number of other changes to his economic team. The former central banker was the driving force behind the \\"Volcker Rule,\\" a provision in last year's financial reform bill that puts limits on proprietary trading by U.S. banks. Many on Wall Street vigorously fought the Volcker Rule and some sought to portray Volcker as out of touch with the modern financial system. But he has also received credit for reining in financial industry excesses that helped prompt the global economic crisis. \\"VOICE OF REASON\\" \\"My feeling is job well done,\\" said Thomas Russo, a partner in Gardner Russo & Gardner, a Pennsylvania investment manager with assets under management of 2.38 billion. \\"He was a voice of reason as he addressed excesses that inevitably develop in Wall Street conduct when the guardrails are taken down from the financial superhighway.\\" Obama also plans to make an announcement on a replacement for Larry Summers, who stepped down as director of the National Economic Council to return to his role on the faculty of Harvard University. Gene Sperling, a senior U.S. Treasury official, is the frontrunner to take the helm at the economic council, which coordinates advice to the president throughout the administration. ||||| He's one of the greatest economists of our time and tamed inflation as Fed chief, but when Paul Volcker resigns as Obama's adviser, he'll be forever tied to a watered-down financial reform that won't prevent another collapse. One of the saddest things about Paul Volcker’s probable resignation as one of President Obama’s top economic advisers is how he will be remembered. He won’t just be the Fed chairman who decades earlier performed a national service by defeating the economic evil known as inflation, but the bureaucrat who helped craft a convoluted financial “reform” law that has done little in the way of reforming activities that caused the 2008 financial collapse. I am of course talking about the so-called Volcker Rule, a key provision of last year’s massive Dodd-Frank financial-reform act that was supposed to curtail Wall Street risk-taking but which even Volcker these days is disavowing. Volcker, it should be noted, came to the Obama administration with great fanfare. And why shouldn’t he have? One of the greatest economists of modern times, he was largely responsible for repairing the economy from “stagflation”—high unemployment and high inflation—and for the ensuing economic prosperity of the next three decades. Now he was advising a bright new president on how to rebound from the financial crisis of 2008 and the Great Recession that followed. But Volcker spent much of his first year in the administration with very little influence on economic policy. The White House and its economic brain trust of Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, chief economist Larry Summers, and senior adviser Valerie Jarrett were still cozying up to bankers and campaign contributors like JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs’ Lloyd Blankfein. They didn’t want to hear advice from the crazy old man who showed up occasionally at economic policy meetings and groused about putting an end to Wall Street risk-taking once and for all. Volcker didn’t seem to care. He spent long hours devising his plan to take Wall Street out of the risk-taking business, meeting occasionally with bankers he knew and trusted from his days as Fed chairman and later as a chief economist for an independent investment firm. These people said he spent most of his time listening to how Wall Street changed over the past three decades leading to the financial collapse, how it became less of a business that was paid to give advice and more of a gambling den that rolled the dice with shareholders' money with little accountability from regulators. The great Paul Volcker spent his last days in public service putting his name to a watered-down rule that wouldn’t have prevented the financial collapse of 2008 and won’t prevent one in the future. Paul Volcker. Credit: Joshua Roberts / Bloomberg via Getty Images With that, Volcker came up with a plan that he believed would stop a crisis of the magnitude of the one that hit in 2008 and led to the destruction of two firms, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, and the near destruction of the rest, from happening again. The banks, he believed, would no long be able to risk the firm’s own capital and blow it in a single trade. The banks would have to sell off other risky businesses like hedge funds and private-equity accounts not just because they created the opportunity to lose lots of money but also because, like trading, they have little to do with what Wall Street is supposed to be about—dispensing advice to corporations as well as investors. Volcker, of course, had never really liked the big banks. He once quipped that the greatest innovation coming from the men of high finance was the ATM. He didn’t like the banks when he was Fed chairman, certainly not when he was out of government (just check some of his speeches), and certainly not now. And because of that, the bankers’ friends in high places, namely Geithner and Summers and ultimately the president himself, marginalized Volcker’s plan to make Wall Street a safer place. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"A man named Paul Volcker, who is very smart with money things, used to be in charge of a group that advised President Obama on the economy.

Background: Shelton was born in Ada, Oklahoma, to Dorothy, a beauty salon owner, and Richard Shelton, a used car salesman. Shelton began singing at an early age and by the age of 12, he was taught how to play the guitar by his uncle. By age 15, he had written his first song. By age 16, he had received a Denbo Diamond Award in his home state. Context: Some years later in Nashville, he signed to Giant Records in 2001. In 2001, he was slated to release a song entitled \\"I Wanna Talk About Me\\" as a single. Staff at the label considered the song unsuitable for a lead-off single, however, and the song was eventually recorded by Toby Keith, whose version was a number 1 single. Instead, Giant released \\"Austin\\" as Shelton's debut single. Shortly after its release, Giant Records was closed, and Shelton was transferred to parent company Warner Bros. Records. \\"Austin\\" spent five weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts. Warner released his self-titled debut album, which was produced by songwriter Bobby Braddock. It also produced the top 20 hits \\"All Over Me\\", which Shelton co-wrote with Earl Thomas Conley and Mike Pyle, and \\"Ol' Red\\". Although Shelton's rendition of \\"Ol' Red\\" was not a major radio hit, he considers it his signature song, and it has become popular in concert. Blake Shelton received a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 1,000,000 copies. Blake Shelton received a positive review from Maria Konicki Dinoia of Allmusic, who called \\"Austin\\" \\"tremendously imaginative\\" and praised Shelton for including songs written by Braddock and Conley. Country Standard Time was less favorable, with Scott Homewood saying that it \\"album just smacks of being assembled with the intent on capturing the burgeoning alternative country market\\". Shelton's second album, The Dreamer, was first released on February 4, 2003, on Warner Bros. Records. Its lead-off single, \\"The Baby\\", reached No. 1 on the country charts, holding that position for three weeks. Although the second and third singles (\\"Heavy Liftin'\\" and \\"Playboys of the Southwestern World\\", respectively) only reached No.32 and No. 24, The Dreamer earned gold certification as well. He, along with Andy Griggs and Montgomery Gentry, sang guest vocals on Tracy Byrd's mid-2003 single \\"The Truth About Men\\". Blake Shelton's Barn & Grill was the title of Shelton's third studio album, released in 2004. Its lead-off single, the Harley Allen co-write \\"When Somebody Knows You That Well\\", peaked at No.37 on the country charts, while the follow-up \\"Some Beach\\" became his third No.1 hit, holding that position for four weeks. It was followed by a cover of Conway Twitty's 1988 single \\"Goodbye Time\\". Both this cover and its followup, \\"Nobody but Me\\", reached Top Ten for Shelton as well. As with his first album, Blake Shelton's Barn & Grill was certified platinum. Accompanying the album's release was a video collection entitled Blake Shelton's Barn & Grill: A Video Collection. On December 18, 2005, several of Shelton's songs, including \\"Nobody but Me\\", appeared on the TV movie The Christmas Blessing, starring Neil Patrick Harris, Rebecca Gayheart, Angus T.

Retired households saw a faster rise than others compared with the previous year, owing primarily to income from private pensions. The richest fifth of the population saw a slight fall in their spending power. The average UK household saw their disposable income rise by £564 compared with the previous year, after the rising cost of living - measured by inflation - was taken into account, the ONS said. Senior statistician Claudia Wells said: \\"Household incomes are above their pre-downturn peak overall, but not everyone is better off. \\"While retired households' incomes have soared in recent years, non-retired households still have less money, on average, than before the crash.\\" The median average disposable income of pensioner households has recorded a rise of 13% since 2007-08, compared with a 1.2% fall among non-retired households. The ONS puts growing private pensions ahead of the guaranteed rise in the state pension - under the so-called triple lock - as the long-term reason for the pick-up in pensioners' incomes. However, the £21,770 of typical spending power for retired households remains below the £28,481 of non-retired households. The top fifth of households saw real incomes fall back by £1,000 a year, while the poorest gained £700 on average in 2015-16, the ONS said. Top pay levels have come under pressure, but employment prospects and pay for the poorest have improved, it added. The figures come as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would like to see a maximum cap on the amount people can earn. Household income has tended to pick up faster over the years owing to an increasing number of couples both in employment. Matt Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said: \\"It was another strong year for living standards, particular for poorer households. Strong employment growth, low inflation and rising pensioner incomes over recent years have helped drive inequality down to its lowest level in nearly 30 years. \\"However, the last three years of growth have come back off the back of a living standards squeeze so deep that typical working age families are still £345 poorer than they were before the financial crisis. \\"With employment plateauing, productivity growth refusing to budge and inflation rising, the risk is that this mini boom won't continue.\\" Former chancellor George Osborne tweeted that \\"ONS data today shows inequality fell in 2015/16 & incomes of poorest rose.

Problem:lfllfflccf Solution:","completion":"In this problem, we are given the string \\"lfllfflccf\\" and we need to find the longest substring that is a palindrome. Here's a step-by-step solution: 1. Initialize max_palindrome_length to 1 and max_palindrome to the first character of the given string. 2. Iterate through the given string by character indices. - For each index, check for palindromes of odd length and even length centered at the current index. - For odd length palindromes (palindromes with a central character): * Initialize left_idx to the current index - 1 and right_idx to the current index + 1. * While left_idx >= 0 and right_idx < length of the string: - If the characters at indices left_idx and right_idx are the same: - Calculate the palindrome length as right_idx - left_idx + 1. - Update max_palindrome_length and max_palindrome if the palindrome length is greater than max_palindrome_length. - Decrease left_idx by 1 and increase right_idx by 1. - Else, break the loop. - For even length palindromes (palindromes without a central character): * Initialize left_idx to the current index and right_idx to the current index + 1. * While left_idx >= 0 and right_idx < length of the string: - If the characters at indices left_idx and right_idx are the same: - Calculate the palindrome length as right_idx - left_idx + 1. - Update max_palindrome_length and max_palindrome if the palindrome length is greater than max_palindrome_length. - Decrease left_idx by 1 and increase right_idx by 1. - Else, break the loop. 3. Return the max_palindrome. Applying these steps, we see that the longest palindrome substring in \\"lfllfflccf\\" is \\"llffll\\".

After Derek rejects all the toys Joe shows him (and one called Larry the Larvae that Pino tries to give him) he and his mother leave, prompting Joe to begin angrily yelling at Pino, belittling him and blaming him for all the store's recent failures. While running from his father Pino bumps into Noah and drops the larvae toy, which Noah picks up and buys along with some other toys. At his home Noah begins taking apart the toys he bought from Joe when he is confronted by his angry landlord Harold (Gerry Black). Late paying rent, Noah, to smooth things over, gives Harold the Larry the Larvae toy in exchange for a one-day extension. While driving home Harold is killed when Larry the Larvae crawls into his mouth and bursts out his eye, causing his car to crash and explode.

The role of the gas is to prevent evaporation of the filament, without introducing significant heat losses. For these properties, chemical inertness and high atomic or molecular weight is desirable. The presence of gas molecules knocks the liberated tungsten atoms back to the filament, reducing its evaporation and allowing it to be operated at higher temperature without reducing its life (or, for operating at the same temperature, prolongs the filament life). It however introduces heat losses (and therefore efficiency loss) from the filament, by heat conduction and heat convection.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who gave up the conductorship of the Purcell Singers in 1967? from the following article ? Holst had formed the Purcell Singers, a small semi-professional choir, in October 1952, largely at the instigation of Pears. From 1954 the choir became regular performers at the Aldeburgh Festival, with programmes ranging from rarely heard medieval music to 20th-century works. Among choir members who later achieved individual distinction were the bass-baritone John Shirley-Quirk, the tenors Robert Tear and Philip Langridge, and the founder and conductor of the Heinrich Schütz Choir, Roger Norrington. Langridge remembered with particular pleasure a performance in Orford church of Thomas Tallis's forty-part motet Spem in alium, on 2 July 1963. When she gave up the conductorship of the choir in 1967, much of its musical mission, in particular its commitment to early music, was assumed by other groups, such as Norrington's Schütz Choir and the Purcell Consort formed by the ex-Purcell Singers chorister Grayston Burgess.On 2 June 1967 Holst shared the podium with Britten in the concert inaugurating the Aldeburgh Festival's new home at the Snape Maltings. From 1972 Holst was involved with the development of educational classes at the Maltings, which began with weekend singing classes and developed into the Britten-Pears School for Advanced Musical Studies, with its own training orchestra. By this time Imogen's performances at the festival had become increasingly rare, but in 1975 she conducted a concert of Gustav Holst's brass band music, held outdoors at Framlingham Castle. A report of the event described an evening of \\"persistent drizzle ... until a diminutive figure in a special scarlet dress took the conductor's baton. The band was transformed, and played Holst's Suite as it has never been played before\\".Britten had been in poor health since undergoing heart surgery in 1973, and on 4 December 1976 he died. Holst was unsure that she could maintain a working relationship with Pears alone, and on reaching the age of 70 in 1977, decided she would retire as artistic director after that year's festival.

Please briefly summarize this news article: 'Friday Night Lights' Reunion Shuts Down Hopes for Reboot Correction appended, June 13, 2016 It may be hard to believe, but Friday Night Lights, the drama that made football fans of even the sports-averse, premiered a whole decade ago. The sleeper hit about a high school football team in the fictional small town of Dillon, Texas is still a treasured television artifact: it gave us timeless mantras like “Clear eyes, full hearts, can’t lose” and the classic “Texas forever.” (Not to mention inspiring women everywhere with Connie Britton’s infinite wisdom and aspirational hair.) Unfortunately, though, we won’t get to see the show make a comeback. The cast reunited over the weekend — but not to film a reboot. Some cast members, including Britton, attended a reunion at the ATX Television Festival, while others, including Minka Kelly and Taylor Kitsch, attended a separate gathering in Illinois to race in the Chicago Spartan Super. Although actress Minka Kelly told Vanity Fair that they’re “like a little family,” it doesn’t sound like fans should get their hopes up for a sequel to the beloved show, which aired for five seasons before ending its run in 2011. “I’ll never play Riggins again,” said Taylor Kitsch, known for his role as the hunky, brooding football star. Kelly, who played peppy cheerleader Lyla Garrity, agreed: “I think some things are better left [with people] wanting more.” The actors also mused on where their characters would be now: Kitsch thinks Riggins would be hanging out on his land with a family, while Kelly said Garrity would probably have settled in Nashville. And despite the steamy romance the two shared on the show, both actors believe Riggins would have ended up with his other love interest, Adrianne Palicki’s Tyra Collette. (Kelly, for her part, waffled on that prediction.) Some things in Texas are forever, though: the Austin-based reunion included a throwback tailgate and pep rally held right on the Panthers’ field where the show was originally filmed. Check out some snaps of the cast below. Correction: The original version of this story incorrectly said that Kelly and Kitsch were at the ATX Television Festival in Atlanta. They were at a separate event in Chicago.","completion":"The cast of the popular drama series \\"Friday Night Lights,\\" which originally premiered a decade ago, recently reunited at the ATX Television Festival, putting to rest any hopes for a reboot of the show. Actors Minka Kelly and Taylor Kitsch, who played Lyla Garrity and Tim Riggins in the series, both expressed that they would not reprise their roles, with Kelly stating, \\"I think some things are better left [with people] wanting more.\\" The drama, which revolved around a high school football team in the fictional town of Dillon, Texas, ran for five seasons before concluding in 2011."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A recent viewing of THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT has given me the urge to watch many of the classic MGM musicals from the forties and fifties. ANCHORS AWEIGH is certainly a lesser film than ON THE TOWN. The songs aren't as good, nor is the chemistry between the characters. But the film beautifully interweaves classical favorites, such as Tchaikovsky. And the scene at the Hollywood Bowl, with Sinatra and Kelly emerging from the woods above it at the top, and then running down the steps, while dozens of pianists play on the piano, is the best scene in the film, even though the scene in which Kelly dances with Jerry Mouse is more famous. Classical music enthusiasts will no doubt identify the music the pianists are playing. Sinatra then croons, \\"I Fall in Love Too Easily,\\" before having his epiphany about whom he loves. The color is beautiful, Hollywood looks pretty with its mountains and pollution-free air (Can you imagine Hollywood in the twenties, let alone the mid-1940s?!), and the piano music is absolutely glorious. MGM certainly had a flair for creating lyrical moments like these. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is mostly positive.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the name of the place that absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education? There are three universities in the City of Manchester. The University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University and Royal Northern College of Music. The University of Manchester is the largest full-time non-collegiate university in the United Kingdom and was created in 2004 by the merger of Victoria University of Manchester founded in 1904 and UMIST, founded in 1956, though the university's logo appears to claim it was established in 1824. It includes the Manchester Business School, which offered the first MBA course in the UK in 1965. Manchester Metropolitan University was formed as Manchester Polytechnic on the merger of three colleges in 1970. It gained university status in 1992, and in the same year absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education in South Cheshire. The University of Law, the largest provider of vocation legal training in Europe, has a campus in the city.The three Universities are grouped around Oxford Road on the southern side of the city centre, which forms Europe's largest urban higher education precinct. Together they have a combined population of 76,025 students in higher education as of 2015, although almost 6,000 of them were based at Manchester Metropolitan University's campuses at Crewe and Alsager in Cheshire.One of Manchester's most notable secondary schools is the Manchester Grammar School. Established in 1515, as a free grammar school next to what is now the Cathedral, it moved in 1931 to Old Hall Lane in Fallowfield, south Manchester, to accommodate the growing student body. In the post-war period, it was a direct grant grammar school (i.e. partially state funded), but it reverted to independent status in 1976 after abolition of the direct-grant system. Its previous premises are now used by Chetham's School of Music. There are three schools nearby: William Hulme's Grammar School, Withington Girls' School and Manchester High School for Girls.

Frankie Goes to Hollywood (FGTH) were a British band formed in Liverpool, England, in 1980. The group was fronted by Holly Johnson (vocals), with Paul Rutherford (vocals), Peter Gill (drums, percussion), Mark O'Toole (bass guitar), and Brian Nash (guitar). The group's 1983 debut single \\"Relax\\" was banned by the BBC in 1984 while at number six in the charts and subsequently topped the UK Singles Chart for five consecutive weeks, going on to enjoy prolonged chart success throughout that year and ultimately becoming the seventh best-selling UK single of all time. It also won the 1985 Brit Award for Best British Single. On the B-side to the group's first single, Johnson explained that the group's name derived from a page from The New Yorker magazine, featuring the headline \\"Frankie Goes Hollywood\\" and a picture of Frank Sinatra, although the magazine page Johnson referred to was actually a pop art poster by Guy Peellaert. The original group named \\"Frankie Goes to Hollywood\\" dates from 1980. The nucleus of the group emerged from the late 1970s Liverpool punk scene. Lead singer Johnson had played bass with Big in Japan and had also released two solo singles. Local musicians Peter Gill (drums), Jed O'Toole (bass), and O'Toole's cousin Brian Nash (guitar) initially joined Johnson, calling themselves the Sons of Egypt. This line-up secured a number of small local gigs before disbanding. The group was reprised when Johnson joined Mark O'Toole (bass) and Peter \\"Ped\\" Gill to form FGTH. During a particularly fluid period of personnel changes, Jed O'Toole joined FGTH on guitar, and a female vocalist, Sonia Mazumder, was also a band member for the first Frankie gig at the Leeds nightclub \\"The Warehouse\\", supporting Hambi & The Dance. Paul Rutherford - a member of the headline act who had also sung in seminal Liverpool punk band The Spitfire Boys - apparently got so caught up in Frankie's performance that he effectively replaced Mazumder that very night. The new all-male musical line-up subsequently toured locally with a leather-clad female duo known as \\"The Leatherpets\\" and managed to fund promotional videos and demos, despite being eventually turned down by both Arista Records and Phonogram Inc. In October 1982, the group recorded a John Peel Session for BBC Radio 1, comprising the originals \\"Krisco Kisses\\", \\"Two Tribes\\", \\"Disneyland\\", and \\"The World Is My Oyster\\". Around this time Jed O'Toole left the group, to be replaced by the returning Brian Nash. In February 1983, the group was invited to record a video for \\"Relax\\" by the Channel 4 show The Tube at the Liverpool State Ballroom. After the broadcast, the Peel session was repeated on radio, and a new session recorded for the BBC, comprising \\"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\\", \\"The Only Star in Heaven\\" and \\"Relax\\". These performances, along with a repeat of the Tube video, convinced Trevor Horn to sign the group for his new label, ZTT Records, in May 1983.

Answer the following question: Information: - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. - Arithmetic or arithmetics (from the Greek \\"arithmos\\", \\"number\\") is the oldest and most elementary branch of mathematics. It consists of the study of numbers, especially the properties of the traditional operations between themaddition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Arithmetic is an elementary part of number theory, and number theory is considered to be one of the top-level divisions of modern mathematics, along with algebra, geometry, and analysis. The terms \\"arithmetic\\" and \\"higher arithmetic\\" were used until the beginning of the 20th century as synonyms for \\"number theory\\" and are sometimes still used to refer to a wider part of number theory. - A machine is a tool containing one or more parts that uses energy to perform an intended action. Machines are usually powered by chemical, thermal, or electrical means, and are often motorized. Historically, a power tool also required moving parts to classify as a machine. However, the advent of electronics has led to the development of power tools without moving parts that are considered machines. - The Corporate Machine is a strategy computer game from Stardock in which the goal is to create a corporation in one of four industries ( automobiles , aircraft , computers , or soft drinks ) and eventually dominate rival companies . To win the player must dominate the chosen market ( getting 55 % to 65 % of the market share depending on the number of opponents . ) The Corporate Machine is a follow up to the game Business Tycoon , which was itself a sequel to the game Entrepreneur , all developed by Stardock . - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a . The term \\"bit\\" is a portmanteau of binary digit. In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit \\"shannon\\", named after Claude Shannon. - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers. - Microsoft Corporation (commonly referred to as Microsoft or MS) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington, that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports and sells computer software, consumer electronics and personal computers and services. Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, Microsoft Office office suite, and Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface tablet lineup. As of 2016, it was the world's largest software maker by revenue, and one of the world's most valuable companies. - Stardock Corporation is a software development company founded in 1991 and incorporated in 1993 as Stardock Systems. Stardock initially developed for the OS/2 platform, but was forced to switch to Microsoft Windows due to the collapse of the OS/2 software market between 1997 and 1998. The company is best known for computer programs that allow a user to modify or extend a graphical user interface as well as personal computer games, particularly strategy games such as the \\"Galactic Civilizations\\" series, \\"\\", \\"\\", and Ashes of the Singularity. - Galactic Civilizations is a turn-based strategy video game developed by Stardock and released in March 2003. The game is a remake of a vintage OS/2 series of the same name. An expansion pack entitled \\"Altarian Prophecy\\" was released in July 2004. A sequel, \\"\\", was released February 21, 2006. On May 14, 2015 Stardock released \\"Galactic Civilizations III\\". - Computer software, or simply software, is that part of a computer system that consists of encoded information or computer instructions, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built. - An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines. - Microsoft Windows (or simply Windows) is a metafamily of graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft. It consists of several families of operating systems, each of which cater to a certain sector of the computing industry with the OS typically associated with IBM PC compatible architecture. Active Windows families include Windows NT, Windows Embedded and Windows Phone; these may encompass subfamilies, e.g. Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE) or Windows Server. Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x; Windows 10 Mobile is an active product, unrelated to the defunct family Windows Mobile. - A Company is a legal entity made up of an association of persons, be they natural, legal, or a mixture of both, for carrying on a commercial or industrial enterprise. Company members share a common purpose and unite in order to focus their various talents and organize their collectively available skills or resources to achieve specific, declared goals. Companies take various forms such as: - A microwave oven (commonly referred to as a microwave) is a kitchen appliance that heats and cooks food by exposing it to microwave radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum. This induces polar molecules in the food to rotate and produce thermal energy in a process known as dielectric heating. Microwave ovens heat foods quickly and efficiently because excitation is fairly uniform in the outer of a homogeneous, high water content food item; food is more evenly heated throughout (except in heterogeneous, dense objects) than generally occurs in other cooking techniques. - In consumer electronics, a remote control is a component of an electronic device such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, used to operate the device wirelessly from a short distance. Remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the consumer, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls. In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise would not be able to reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level. - A smartphone is a mobile phone (also known as cell phones or cell mobiles) with an advanced mobile operating system that combines features of a personal computer operating system with other features useful for mobile or handheld use. Smartphones, which are usually pocket-sized, typically combine the features of a mobile phone, such as the abilities to place and receive voice calls and create and receive text messages, with those of other popular digital mobile devices like personal digital assistants (PDAs), such as an event calendar, media player, video games, GPS navigation, digital camera and digital video camera. Smartphones can access the Internet and can run a variety of third-party software components (\\"apps\\" from Google Play, Apple App Store, etc). They typically have a color display with a graphical user interface that covers more than 76% of the front surface. The display is almost always a touchscreen and sometimes additionally a touch-enabled keyboard like the Priv/Passport BlackBerrys, which enables the user to use a virtual keyboard to type words and numbers and press onscreen icons to activate \\"app\\" features. - A corporation is a company or group of people authorized to act as a single entity (legally a person) and recognized as such in law. Early incorporated entities were established by charter (i.e. by an \\"ad hoc\\" act granted by a monarch or passed by a parliament or legislature). Most jurisdictions now allow the creation of new corporations through registration. - A mobile device (or handheld computer) is a small computing device, typically, small enough to hold and operate in the hand and having an operating system capable of running mobile apps. These may provide a diverse range of functions. Typically, the device will have a display screen with a small numeric or alphanumeric keyboard or a touchscreen providing a virtual keyboard and buttons (icons) on-screen. Many such devices can connect to the Internet and interconnect with other devices such as car entertainment systems or headsets via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or near field communication (NFC). Integrated cameras, digital media players, mobile phone and GPS capabilities are common. Power is typically provided by a lithium battery.

Should I validate this answer?","completion":"No, this answer should not be validated because it does not directly address the provided question. The question asked about the sources of Vitamin D, but the provided answer generalized the definition of a vitamin without specifying about Vitamin D. A more appropriate answer to the question \\"where is Vitamin D found?\\" would be: Vitamin D is primarily obtained in three ways: through exposure to the sun, through certain types of food, and through supplements. 1. Sun exposure: Our bodies naturally produce Vitamin D when skin is directly exposed to sunlight. In particular, sunlight's ultraviolet B (UVB) rays lead to the production of Vitamin D. However, the efficiency of Vitamin D production can be influenced by a number of factors including the latitude and altitude of your location, the current season, time of the day, air pollution, cloud coverage, and the melanin content in your skin. 2. Food: Although it's difficult to get enough Vitamin D solely through food, certain foods are naturally rich in Vitamin D. Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and sardines are among the best natural food sources. Other sources include cod liver oil, beef liver, cheese, and egg yolks. Some mushrooms are also high in Vitamin D, particularly those exposed to ultraviolet light. 3. Supplements: Many people find it hard to get enough Vitamin D naturally, particularly those living in polar regions or who spend a lot of time indoors. In such cases, Vitamin D supplements can help reach the needed daily intake. Remember, even though Vitamin D is beneficial, like all vitamins and nutrients, it should be consumed in moderation. Too much Vitamin D can lead to toxicity, causing symptoms like nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness, and weight loss. In severe cases, it can lead to problems with heart rhythm and damage to the kidneys. It's always best to consult a healthcare provider when considering dietary supplements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw... Paragraph: An archipelago in the Indian ocean included two very different islands. Snake island was a reptile paradise, inhabited by many species of reptiles. Bird island had few reptiles on it, but had various birds inhabiting it. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which island was inhabited by more tuataras? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, we cannot definitively determine which island had more tuataras. The paragraph describes the two islands, Snake Island as a reptile paradise inhabited by many species of reptiles, and Bird Island with few reptiles but various birds inhabiting it. However, it does not specifically mention the presence or abundance of tuataras on either island. As tuataras are reptiles, it could be possible that they are present on Snake Island being it a reptile paradise, or they might be present on Bird Island in a small number. But since there is no explicit information about the tuatara population on either island, we cannot provide a definitive answer concerning which island had more tuataras."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The risk of internal bleeding is also increased in hemophilia, especially into muscles and joints. This disease affected the royal families of Europe. Two twin sisters were taken to the doctor's office by their parents. It turned out that Mary had hemophilia while Ann didn't have any blood disease. Which sister had blood that was able to clot? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, let's go through the information step-by-step and then draw a conclusion. 1. Hemophilia is a hereditary disease that affects the body's ability to control blood clotting. 2. People with hemophilia cannot produce clots. 3. Mary has hemophilia and Ann doesn't have any blood disease. From the given information, we can conclude that Mary has a problem with blood clotting due to her hemophilia. Since Ann doesn't have any blood disease, her blood clotting should be normal. Answer: Ann's blood is able to clot."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

She has everything: beauty, intelligence, wealth, and impeccable social grace. Unbeknownst to most, Lilith harbors a dark secret. In her work, she uncovers the deep and unsettling truths of her clients while expertly navigating her own web of lies and deceptions. Our lead protagonist, Detective Alex Carter, arrives in Harmony Bay after being suspended from his position in the NYPD for a controversial case. Seeking solace in a fresh start, he finds work as a low-level private investigator for local clients. When a distraught wealthy businessman, Thomas Devereux, approaches him with concerns about his wife Veronica seeking treatment from Dr. Ritter, Alex starts to dig into Lilith's personal and professional life. As Alex delves deeper, he uncovers that Lilith has fabricated her entire persona: her education, her heritage, her name. The deeper he digs, the more the detective realizes that Harmony Bay's beautiful society psychiatrist is an enigma, and each layer he uncovers unveils a greater mystery. Slowly, Alex befriends Lilith, with the ulterior motive of learning the truth about her identity. However, despite his constant guard, he cannot escape the allure of her incredible magnetism, and over time he begins to lose sight of his mission. Lilith, the mastermind of manipulation, starts to crack Alex's own secrets and discovers his investigation. The two start to plunge together into a dark dance of deception, secrets, and forbidden lust.

Washington (CNN) -- The weirdest campaign ad of this season -- maybe any season -- debuted on the Internet this past week. The ad has been nicknamed, \\"Demon Sheep,\\" and can be viewed here. The ad is an opening salvo in what will could prove the most expensive Senate race in U.S. history. The incumbent, Barbara Boxer, has always been the less popular of California's two Democratic senators. Boxer now looks vulnerable. Two Republicans declared early for the nomination against Boxer: state Sen. Chuck DeVore and former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina. Fiorina took an early lead. But her performance on the campaign trail disheartened many of her supporters. Worse, Fiorina never developed a good answer to the questions about her business career. Portfolio magazine had dubbed Fiorina one of the 20 worst CEOs of all time after a disastrous merger with Compaq. OPTIONS: - Barbara Boxer was fired in 2005 after company stock dropped 60 percent in a year. - Boxer was fired in 2005 after company stock dropped 60 percent in a year. - CNN was fired in 2005 after company stock dropped 60 percent in a year. - California was fired in 2005 after company stock dropped 60 percent in a year. - Campbell was fired in 2005 after company stock dropped 60 percent in a year. - Carly Fiorina was fired in 2005 after company stock dropped 60 percent in a year. - Chuck DeVore was fired in 2005 after company stock dropped 60 percent in a year. - Compaq was fired in 2005 after company stock dropped 60 percent in a year. - David Frum was fired in 2005 after company stock dropped 60 percent in a year. - Democratic was fired in 2005 after company stock dropped 60 percent in a year. - Demon Sheep was fired in 2005 after company stock dropped 60 percent in a year. - Fiorina was fired in 2005 after company stock dropped 60 percent in a year. - Frum was fired in 2005 after company stock dropped 60 percent in a year. - Hewlett Packard was fired in 2005 after company stock dropped 60 percent in a year. - Internet was fired in 2005 after company stock dropped 60 percent in a year. - Republicans was fired in 2005 after company stock dropped 60 percent in a year. - Senate was fired in 2005 after company stock dropped 60 percent in a year. - Tom Campbell was fired in 2005 after company stock dropped 60 percent in a year. - U.S. was fired in 2005 after company stock dropped 60 percent in a year. - U.S. Senate was fired in 2005 after company stock dropped 60 percent in a year. - Washington was fired in 2005 after company stock dropped 60 percent in a year.","completion":"Carly Fiorina was fired in 2005 after company stock dropped 60 percent in a year. This dismissal greatly contributed to the scrutiny she faced regarding her corporate experience, which Fiorina struggled to address on the campaign trail. Despite an early lead, Fiorina's difficulties addressing questions about her business career significantly impacted her bid to unseat incumbent Senator Barbara Boxer. The bizarre \\"Demon Sheep\\" ad illustrated the highly competitive nature of the race and the unconventional tactics employed by the candidates. The California Senate race in question was expected to perhaps be the most expensive in US history, a testament to both the importance of the seat and the high stakes involved in the political contest.

At Birmingham, Oliphant's team had reached a different conclusion. Oliphant had delegated the task to two German refugee scientists, Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch, who could not work on Oliphant's radar project because they were enemy aliens and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance. Francis Perrin had calculated the critical mass of uranium to be about 40 tonnes (39 long tons; 44 short tons). He reckoned that if a neutron reflector were placed around it, this might be reduced to 12 tonnes (12 long tons; 13 short tons). Peierls attempted to simplify the problem by using the fast neutrons produced by fission, thus omitting consideration of moderator. He too calculated the critical mass of a sphere of uranium in a theoretical paper written in 1939 to be \\"of the order of tons\\".Peierls knew the importance of the size of the critical mass that would allow a chain reaction to take place and its practical significance. In the interior of a critical mass sphere, neutrons are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material. A very small portion of these neutrons are colliding with other nuclei, while a larger portion of the neutrons are escaping through the surface of the sphere. Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping.Niels Bohr had theorised that the rare uranium-235 isotope, which makes up only about 0.7% of natural uranium, was primarily responsible for fission with fast neutrons, although this was not yet universally accepted. Frisch and Peierls were thus able to revise their initial estimate of critical mass needed for nuclear fission in uranium to be substantially less than previously assumed. They estimated a metallic sphere of uranium-235 with a radius of 2.1 centimetres (0.83 in) could suffice. This amount represented approximately 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of uranium-235. These results led to the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which was the initial step in the development of the nuclear arms programme in Britain. This...

He is having an affair with the university chancellor, Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand), whose husband, Walter (Richard Thomas), is the chairman of the English department in which Grady is a professor. Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier. He continues to labor on a second novel, but the more he tries to finish it the less able he finds himself to invent a satisfactory ending.

Grady's students include James Leer (Tobey Maguire) and Hannah Green (Katie Holmes). Hannah and James are friends and both very good writers. Hannah, who rents a room in Grady's large house, is attracted to Grady, but he does not reciprocate. James is enigmatic, quiet, dark and enjoys writing fiction more than he first lets on.

Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays.

Generally seen as the main variety of local fascism, and noted for its Romanian Orthodox-inspired revolutionary message, the Iron Guard grew into an important actor on the Romanian political stage, coming into conflict with the political establishment and democratic forces, and often resorted to terrorism. The Legionnaires traditionally referred to Codreanu as Capitanul (\\"The Captain\\"), and he held absolute authority over the organization until his death. Codreanu, who began his career in the wake of World War I as an anticommunist and antisemitic agitator associated with A. C. Cuza and Constantin Pancu, was a co-founder of the National-Christian Defense League and assassin of the Iasi Police prefect Constantin Manciu. Codreanu felt he had to amend the purpose of the movement after more than two years of stagnation: he and the leadership of the movement started touring rural regions, addressing the churchgoing illiterate population with the rhetoric of sermons, dressing up in long white mantles and instigating Christian prejudice against Judaism (this intense campaign was also prompted by the fact that the Legion was immediately sidelined by Cuza's League in the traditional Moldavian and Bukovinan centers). Between 1928 and 1930, the Alexandru Vaida-Voevod National Peasants' Party cabinet gave tacit assistance to the Guard, but Iuliu Maniu (representing the same party) clamped down on the Legion after July 1930. This came after the latter had tried to provoke a wave of pogroms in Maramures and Bessarabia. In one notable incident of 1930, Legionaries encouraged the peasant population of Borsa to attack the town's 4,000 Jews. The Legion had also attempted to assassinate government officials and journalists -- including Constantin Angelescu, undersecretary of Internal Affairs. Codreanu was briefly arrested together with the would-be assassin Gheorghe Beza: both were tried and acquitted. Nevertheless, the wave of violence and a planned march into Bessarabia signalled the outlawing of the party by Premier Gheorghe Mironescu and Minister of the Interior Ion Mihalache (January 1931); again arrested, Codreanu was acquitted in late February. Having been boosted by the Great Depression and the malcontent it engendered, in 1931, the Legion also profited from the disagreement between King Carol II and the National Peasants' Party, which brought a cabinet formed around Nicolae Iorga. Codreanu was consequently elected to Chamber of Deputies on the lists of the Corneliu Zelea Codreanu Grouping (the provisional name for the Guard), together with other prominent members of his original movement -- including Ion Zelea, his father, and Mihai Stelescu, a young activist who ultimately came into conflict with the Legion; it is likely that the new Vaida-Voevod cabinet gave tacit support to the Group in subsequent partial elections. The Legion had won five seats in all, which was its first important electoral gain. He quickly became noted for exposing corruption of ministers and other politicians on a case-by-case basis (although several of his political adversaries at the time described him as bland and incompetent).

Please answer the following question: “Have you ever been in a situation that was getting out of control and you were able to calm it down before it escalated further? What was the situation and what did you do or say?” As senior members of a Boy Scout Troop, other adults and I had to instruct two younger member on how to recognize and control emotions in the context of conflict. These two guys had a history of conflicts and I knew people won’t always be present to control them. They had to grow up and be self-sufficient. On one camping trip they yet again had another heated argument over something trivial that kept escalating. Rather than jump in, I wanted to see how they deescalate the situation on their own. Suddenly, one of them pulls out a pocket knife and says “[insert demand here] or I’m gonna [insert some action with a knife to a person].” The situation has clearly escalated too far. Immediately I rushed in and yelled, “STOP! DROP IT, NOW!” He immediately dropped the knife, sat down, and began crying. What happens after that is irrelevant. Perhaps it’s due to my quiet nature and sudden outburst that produced the shock effect. But more importantly the use of straight-forward, succinct commands can control the situation because all parties involved are automatically in natural fight-flight mode where elaborate, long explanations aren’t going to be interpreted correctly by listeners for the purposes of deescalating the situation’s climax. The long talk comes when the immediate conflict is temporarily resolved. * IMPORTANT NOTE: This incident is not a reflection on the Boy Scout of America, its spirit, or the use of such tools.

The Maya civilization was a Mesoamerican civilization developed by the Maya peoples, and noted for its hieroglyphic script--the only known fully developed writing system of the pre-Columbian Americas--as well as for its art, architecture, mathematics, calendar, and astronomical system. The Maya civilization developed in an area that encompasses southeastern Mexico, all of Guatemala and Belize, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador. This region consists of the northern lowlands encompassing the Yucatan Peninsula, and the highlands of the Sierra Madre, running from the Mexican state of Chiapas, across southern Guatemala and onwards into El Salvador, and the southern lowlands of the Pacific littoral plain. The Archaic period, prior to 2000 BC, saw the first developments in agriculture and the earliest villages. The Maya developed their first civilization in the Preclassic period. Scholars continue to discuss when this era of Maya civilization began. Maya occupation at Cuello (modern-day Belize) has been carbon dated to around 2600 BC. Settlements were established around 1800 BC in the Soconusco region of the Pacific coast, and the Maya were already cultivating the staple crops of maize, beans, squash, and chili pepper. This period was characterized by sedentary communities and the introduction of pottery and fired clay figurines. During the Middle Preclassic Period, small villages began to grow to form cities. Nakbe in the Peten department of Guatemala is the earliest well-documented city in the Maya lowlands, where large structures have been dated to around 750 BC. The northern lowlands of Yucatan were widely settled by the Middle Preclassic. By approximately 400 BC, early Maya rulers were raising stelae. A developed script was already being used in Peten by the 3rd century BC. In the Late Preclassic Period, the enormous city of El Mirador grew to cover approximately 16 square kilometres (6.2 sq mi). Although not as large, Tikal was already a significant city by around 350 BC. In the highlands, Kaminaljuyu emerged as a principal centre in the Late Preclassic. Takalik Abaj and Chocola were two of the most important cities on the Pacific coastal plain, and Komchen grew to become an important site in northern Yucatan. The Late Preclassic cultural florescence collapsed in the 1st century AD and many of the great Maya cities of the epoch were abandoned; the cause of this collapse is unknown.

Julia Crockett, deputy director of Central Southwest Mississippi Legal Services Corp., said the program expects to help nearly 1,000 domestic violence victims. Crockett said legal help gives domestic abuse survivors a way to rebuild their lives. \\"They have been made to feel by the abuser that no one is going to help them do anything, so when they come to us they are desperate,\\" she said. \\"Those who need legal help and don't get it feel totally lost.

Legal services typically helps the poor. Gladys Bunzy, who said she was in an abusive relationship with a boyfriend for eight years, said such a program is long overdue and could be a lifeline for those escaping violent relationships. \\"When I finally made up my mind to leave, I had a restraining order put against him and that was 50 but that was 50 well spent to me,\\" said Bunzy, 40. \\"For people who can't afford it, this will be a godsend ...

In the context given, there are a few reasons why they might be considered in a pickle. Firstly, they are planning their wedding to be just three days after Christmas. This time of the year is generally quite busy with holiday preparations and celebrations, so adding in a wedding can complicate things. If the couple is not careful, they could end up overstressed and not able to fully enjoy their wedding. Secondly, their wedding venue is in a small town where the bride, groom, bridal party, and family members are all staying. This can potentially put a lot of pressure on the couple, as everyone would be in the same location, potentially needing assistance or having questions. Any issues that arise would likely need to be dealt with quickly and efficiently, as there would not be a significant buffer of distance to aid in managing them. Thirdly, they are considering nixing their wedding services, which presumably might include catering, and handling the preparation themselves instead. This is a large undertaking that involves a lot of work, from cooking and setting up to cleaning up afterward. Managing this alongside the wedding preparations might seem overwhelming, hence making their situation a pickle. Lastly, they are motivated by the desire to save money which, while understandable, might not be the wisest move in terms of preserving their peace of mind. The 250 they'd save by doing things themselves rather than hiring professionals could potentially be outweighed by the stress of handling everything, especially if unexpected issues crop up. In conclusion, the couple is in a pickle because they find themselves needing to navigate a tricky balancing act between preserving their sanity, maintaining their budget, and ensuring their wedding goes off without a hitch. To do this, they will require careful planning, efficient time management and potentially, the assistance of their bridal party and family members.

Most of the items can be easily found at your local pet store or grocery store.","completion":"First and foremost, you will need a good quality dog brush, specifically a slicker brush and a comb, to help work through tangles and remove any loose hair. These tools are essential for maintaining the long, silky coat of your Shih Tzu. When selecting a brush, opt for one with fine, closely spaced bristles and a flexible head to ensure it glides easily through their fur without causing discomfort or pulling on their skin. With the comb, choose one that has both wide and fine tooth areas to effectively detangle and maintain a smooth, tangle-free coat. Additionally, invest in a good pair of grooming scissors, like grooming shears or curved scissors, to trim your Shih Tzu's hair when necessary, especially around the eyes, ears, and paws. These areas require extra attention as they can be prone to matting or hairs interfering with their vision and hearing. A quality pair of scissors with a sharp, clean cut and rounded tips will help avoid accidental injuries while grooming. Next, you'll need a gentle dog shampoo and conditioner. Look for products that are specifically formulated for dogs with sensitive skin or are hypoallergenic to prevent any adverse reactions or irritation. Consider purchasing a tear-free formula to minimize discomfort if the shampoo gets too close to your Shih Tzu's eyes during bath time. Using a conditioner can also be beneficial, as it can help prevent tangles in their coat, making post-bath brushing much easier. Besides, it's essential to have a set of high-quality dog nail trimmers or a nail grinder. Regular nail maintenance is critical, as overgrown nails can cause discomfort or even pain to your Shih Tzu while walking. Choose a durable and easy-to-use nail trimmer or grinder that is specifically designed for small dogs with sensitive or dark-colored nails to make this task less daunting for both you and your pet. Don't forget to get a bottle of ear cleaning solution and a pack of cotton balls or pads. Regular ear cleaning is necessary to remove debris and help prevent ear infections in your Shih Tzu due to their drop-ear breed type. Opt for an alcohol-free and gentle cleaning solution that is specifically formulated for dogs. Lastly, have some treats on hand to reward your Shih Tzu for their good behavior during grooming sessions. By using treats as positive reinforcement, you can help your pet associate grooming with enjoyable experiences, making them more cooperative and relaxed during the process. Once you have gathered all of the necessary grooming supplies, set up a comfortable and well-lit area in which to groom your Shih Tzu. Having a regular routine and a dedicated space will make the grooming process less stressful for both you and your dog. Remember that grooming your Shih Tzu is not only essential for their health and comfort but also serves as an opportunity to bond and build trust with your pet. By taking proper care and being patient during grooming sessions, you will ensure a happy and well-groomed Shih Tzu that will look and feel their best."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The point of a silver trumpet is to help people make music. A silver trumpet is a shiny, metal instrument that you blow air into. When you push down different buttons, called valves, and blow into the mouthpiece, it helps to create different sounds or musical notes. People use silver trumpets to play songs, perform in bands, and entertain others with beautiful sounds. 2. Trumpets can come in different keys, which means they can play music in different musical scales. The most common trumpet is the B-flat trumpet, but there are also trumpets in the keys of C, D, E-flat, and piccolo trumpets, among others. Each type of trumpet creates a unique sound and is used for playing various types of music. 3. Those questions don't have the same meaning. The first question asks about the purpose of a silver trumpet, while the second question asks about the different keys in which trumpets come. The main similarity is that both questions are about trumpets, but they ask about different aspects of the instrument."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It is also used to collect saliva to distribute solid food or to soften loose particles .","completion":"Yes, these two sentences have the same meaning. They both describe the function of an unspecified subject or tool that serves to collect saliva, which is then used to distribute solid food or soften loose particles. Let us break down the similarities and differences of the two sentences to better understand their meanings. 1. Sentence 1: \\"It is also used to collect saliva to distribute solid foods or soften loose particles.\\" 2. Sentence 2: \\"It is also used to collect saliva to distribute solid food or to soften loose particles.\\" In both sentences, \\"it\\" refers to an unspecified subject or tool that serves a certain function. The phrases \\"is also used\\" in both sentences suggest that the function explained in the sentences is an additional use or purpose of the subject or tool. The functions described in both sentences are the same, as they involve collecting saliva for two purposes: distributing solid food and softening loose particles. Now, let's focus on the slight differences in the wording of the two sentences: Difference 1: In Sentence 1, the term \\"solid foods\\" is written in plural form, while in Sentence 2, the term \\"solid food\\" is singular. Difference 2: In terms of structure, Sentence 1 combines the two purposes of collecting saliva into a single continuous phrase without the use of the word \\"to\\" before \\"soften.\\" Sentence 2, however, uses the word \\"to\\" before \\"soften,\\" which makes each purpose a separate phrase. Despite these slight structural and grammatical differences, the overall meaning and message of the two sentences remain the same. They both convey that the subject or tool in question has a secondary purpose of collecting saliva, which in turn serves two functions: distributing solid food and softening loose particles."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

In what way is economics a social science?","completion":"No, the following two questions are not the same and require different perspectives in answering them. Let's break down each question to understand the difference: 1. Why is economics a social science? This question asks for the reasons behind categorizing economics as a social science. Answering this question requires providing an explanation of how economics meets the criteria of social science and how it relates to the study of human interactions and societal aspects. Economics is a social science because it aims to understand and explain human behavior related to the production, consumption, and distribution of goods and services. As with other social sciences like sociology, psychology, and political science, economics studies human interactions and seeks to comprehend and predict patterns of social behavior. Economics is concerned with the ways in which individuals and groups allocate resources in society. It investigates human behavior through the lens of scarcity, choice, and opportunity cost, which are the fundamental phenomena driving economic interactions. By understanding and predicting the choices that people make, economists can analyze how these decisions influence markets, governments, businesses, and people's lives in general. As a social science, economics employs empirical methods and theories to analyze real-world situations and establish causal relationships between variables. Economists use various models and methodologies, including surveys, experiments, and statistical analyses, to test hypotheses and derive insights about how individuals, institutions, and societies operate within economic contexts. 2. In what way is economics a social science? This question asks for a description of how economics functions as a social science, involving a focus on the similarities and methodologies that economics shares with other social sciences. Economics is a social science in the way it deals with human interactions and societal behavior related to economic decision-making. Here are some ways economics aligns with the broader field of social sciences: a. Subject matter: Economics, like other social sciences, examines human behaviors, choices, and actions in society. It focuses on how people allocate resources, make decisions, form institutions, establish rules and regulations, and cooperate or compete in various economic settings. b. Methodological approach: Economics employs qualitative and quantitative methods of analysis similar to other social sciences. It relies on observation, data collection, empirical evidence, and case studies to derive patterns and insights about human behavior in economic contexts. c. Theoretical framework: Economists build and refine theory in response to empirical findings, just like scholars in fields like psychology, sociology, and anthropology. They use these theories to form testable hypotheses, make predictions, and explain existing phenomena related to the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services in society. d. Interdisciplinary connections: Economics shares many interdisciplinary connections with other social sciences. For instance, it overlaps with political science when examining public policies, taxation, and government spending, or with sociology when exploring income inequality and social mobility. In sum, economics is a social science because it examines how humans behave in the context of economic decision-making. It shares similar subject matter, methodological approaches, theoretical frameworks, and interdisciplinary connections with other social science disciplines. However, the two questions address different aspects of this relationship – the first question asks about the reasons for categorizing economics as a social science, whereas the second question delves into the ways in which economics functions as one."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Suspicious Death in Argentina Some Argentines are calling Alberto Nisman, the maverick prosecutor, the 86th casualty of one of the deadliest, unsolved terrorists attacks in modern history: the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires. That seems fitting whether his death over the weekend turns out to be a suicide, as the government of President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner seems eager to establish, or the murder of a man who had learned too much. This much is clear: The best hope of definitively establishing the truth about the horrific July 18, 1994, bombing and its tortured, politicized investigation is to impanel an international team of jurists who can take a fresh, objective look at the evidence. The truth became more important after Mr. Nisman’s body was discovered inside his apartment on Sunday, hours before he was expected to testify on his startling allegation that Ms. Kirchner cut a deal with the Iranian government to protect some of the culprits of the attack. Ms. Kirchner’s late husband, former president Néstor Kirchner, appointed Mr. Nisman to lead the inquiry a decade ago after acknowledging a shocking series of blunders by those assigned to the case over the years. Mr. Nisman, 51, became convinced that the bombing was carried out by the Shiite militant movement Hezbollah under orders of the Iranian government. Based on the prosecutor’s investigation, Argentina got Interpol to issue arrest notices for seven prominent Iranians, including a Hezbollah leader and several government officials. In a strange twist, in January 2013, Argentina announced it had reached a deal with Iran to establish a “truth commission” that would investigate the case jointly. The notion that Iran could be counted on to play a constructive role was questionable at best and rightly met with skepticism from Argentina’s Jewish community. Earlier this month, Mr. Nisman unveiled a 300-page complaint charging that Ms. Kirchner and Foreign Minister Héctor Timerman conspired to absolve top Iranian officials in exchange for commercial deals that would benefit both cash-strapped governments. President Kirchner issued stern denials. Mr. Nisman said he would corroborate the allegations in a congressional hearing on Monday. According to the Argentine press, there were no signs that Mr. Nisman was suicidal in recent days. Over the weekend, he prepared for the hearing. He wrote a grocery list for his maid to run to the store on Monday. Despite having a 10-person security detail, Mr. Nisman signaled that he was concerned for his safety, telling an Argentine journalist, Natasha Niebieskikwiat, on Saturday: “I might turn up dead from all this.” Ms. Kirchner, a pugnacious stateswoman who has been vindictive toward enemies in the press and politics, weighed in on the case in a lengthy, rambling statement posted on her personal website late Monday. “Suicide,” she wrote, is always a befuddling act. “What led a person to make such a terrible decision and end their life?” Missing from her note was a message of condolence for Mr. Nisman’s family. But the most glaring omission is the fact that the manner of death is far from a settled question. A version of this editorial appears in print on January 21, 2015, on page A22 of the New York edition with the headline: Suspicious Death in Argentina. Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"Alberto Nisman, a prosecutor investigating the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was found dead in his apartment just hours before he was due to testify about his allegations that President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner of Argentina had made a deal with the Iranian government to protect those involved in the attack. Nisman had been appointed to this decade-long inquiry by Kirchner’s late husband and former President, Néstor Kirchner, due to previous mishandling of the case. Nisman's investigation resulted in Interpol issuing arrest warrants for several Iranian officials. However, in 2013 Argentina and Iran announced the establishment of a \\"truth commission,\\" a move met with skepticism, especially from Argentina's Jewish community. Earlier this month, Nisman filed a complaint in which he alleged that President Kirchner and her Foreign Minister, Héctor Timerman, were conspiring to exonerate high-ranking Iranian officials in exchange for profitable trade deals. Despite warnings of a potential threat to his life, Nisman's death has been declared a suicide, a conclusion that many find suspicious. In response to the controversy, President Kirchner has released a meandering statement on the incident, focusing more on the mystery of suicide than addressing the suspicions surrounding Nisman's death. Consequently, many are calling for an international team of jurists to undertake a fresh, impartial investigation into both the bombing and Nisman's death."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I am disappointed to say that this app does not live up to my expectations and necessitates further improvements before it aligns with the scale of the competition. Upon launching the app, I was glad to see its simplistic user interface. It seemed easy to navigate, with large, apparent icons. However, that was just the tip of an iceberg. As I began to explore deeper, I encountered several issues, which have prompted me to give it a 2-star rating. Firstly, the app's performance was subpar. It is slow and prone to crashes, locking my device or freezing at certain points when loading or browsing books. Opening my eBook library often takes so long that I lose the interest to read. Moreover, it occasionally failed to recognize certain file formats, which further complicated my experience. Secondly, the app severely lacks in the customization department. Users have limited options when it comes to font selection, color themes, and formatting. The absence of a night mode, which has become a standard in most e-reader apps nowadays, also struck me as a major setback. I often read in low-light situations and not having a night mode causes strain on my eyes. Another drawback is the search functionality, which needs improvement. The search results often differ from the actual book titles or authors I am searching for, making it challenging to locate specific eBooks. Furthermore, there is no option for searching within the text of the books, which is an essential feature for research-oriented reading. The in-app store integration, although convenient, is limited in the selection of books available. While the app provides a platform to access several bookstores, the titles and genres offered do not cater to a diverse audience. Plus, navigating through the bookstores feels cumbersome, discouraging users from exploring more. Lastly, one of the crucial aspects that define a good e-reader app: customer support – is sadly inadequate here. When I reached out to the support team for assistance with some issues, I was met with delayed responses and mostly unhelpful answers that lacked in-depth instructions. As a paying user, I expect better customer service to be part of my experience. In conclusion, while org.geometerplus.zlibrary.ui.android app has some potential, it requires significant work in many areas to become a worthwhile choice for e-reading enthusiasts. With improvements in the app performance, customization options, search functionality, in-app store integration, and customer support, it may be able to earn a better rating.

It grow along cracks in stone walls and along the roadside near my home in Settignano, which is blooming with spring goodness right now: robinia (black locust) trees, wild garlic (three-cornered leek) and even elderflowers are already bursting. I asked the vendor just to double check, “Is this borage?” “Si,” Came the answer, “Borragine.” He confirmed. “I’ve had it in ravioli,” I started to say, “Brava!” He said, as if we were about to start a guessing game on what could be done with it. Actually, there’s a lot that can be done with it. If you can use it as a ravioli filling with ricotta, then you can imagine it taking the place of spinach in gnudi, too, but also soups or frittata or stirred through polenta. I learned that the flowers are just as delicious, if not more interesting, for their delicate cucumber-like flavour — people told me of their use in salads or cocktails like Pimms, and someone even mentioned she freezes them in ice cubes, what a pretty idea for those first warm nights when you can dine al fresco, homemade cocktail in hand. Then there’s risotto and of course the fritters, much like these ones. Or you can simply deep fry the clusters of buds that haven’t yet burst open like these deep-fried robinia flowers. borage and ricotta crepes The problem, I was thinking, as I took home my bag of borage, is that I can’t decide what to make. There’s simply too much choice. I consulted two of my favourite books that also happen to be cookbooks. Patience Gray’s Honey from a Weed and Luigi Ballerini’s A Feast of Weeds.

I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself. I apologized for laughing the following day when she returned. She told me she appreciated the humor of the situation so there was no “hard feelings.” Why didn't the patient get proper treatment?

Earlier Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko said the EU or the UN should deploy peacekeepers to eastern Ukraine. Pro-Russian rebels have been bombarding a village near the city of Mariupol. On Sunday tank and mortar rounds pounded the village - Shyrokyne - near government-held Mariupol, a vital port city. Mr Tusk said the EU would send a civilian \\"assessment\\" mission to Kiev, to explore ways to further boost security assistance for Ukraine. The heavily armed rebels have been fighting government forces for a year in Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The West accuses Russia of arming the rebels and sending in regular soldiers. Moscow denies that, insisting that any Russians on the rebel side are volunteers. Mr Poroshenko says peacekeepers are needed to ensure proper monitoring of frontline areas and the rebel-controlled border with Russia. Mr Tusk said: \\"We are concerned about reports of weapons still entering eastern Ukraine\\". International OSCE observers were \\"not able to verify a withdrawal of heavy weaponry\\", he said. Under the Minsk ceasefire deal signed in February both sides were supposed to pull heavy weapons back from the conflict zone. Mr Tusk reiterated that EU sanctions against Russia would remain in place until the Minsk conditions were met in full. On Sunday OSCE observers said they experienced the most intense shelling of Shyrokyne since fighting began there in mid-February. Heavy weapons including tanks were spotted in rebel-held areas near there, they said. Fighting hits Ukraine's EU ambitions - by Tom Burridge, BBC News, Donetsk: As the leaders met in Kiev, we could hear the steady boom of shelling in a bombed-out neighbourhood, on the edge of Donetsk. Valentina, 54, emerged from her blackened apartment block, with most of its windows smashed, to tell us of \\"constant fighting, every single day\\". \\"We're sick of all this,\\" she said as tears filled her eyes. \\"It's affecting us psychologically.\\" We watched some 20 pro-Russian fighters travel back from the frontline on top of an armoured personnel carrier, and another group of around 20 replace them, heading towards the fighting. A tank was parked up, idle for now. Tank shells were visible in the back of another vehicle. According to a rebel soldier, we were about 2km (one mile) from the frontline. When you see and hear fighting on a daily basis in eastern Ukraine, at least some of the political and economic aspirations of European and Ukrainian leaders seem hollow. The economic cost of the war undermines Ukraine's ambition for greater economic integration with the EU. It also makes some political aspirations, like visa-free travel for Ukrainian citizens in the EU, highly unlikely. Yet the EU leaders' visit is hugely symbolic. They are keen to show solidarity in the face of what they see as Russian-fuelled aggression in the east. But the rebels will probably interpret the summit as another provocation. EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker also attended the Kiev talks. It is the first such summit since a key EU-Ukraine association agreement was signed last June. Talks will continue in Kiev on Tuesday. The EU is anxious for Ukraine to enact far-reaching economic reforms to tackle unsustainable debts, inflation and widespread corruption. The EU agreed to delay implementing the association deal with Ukraine until January 2016, in response to Russian complaints. Russia is suspicious of the agreement, arguing that free trade could turn Ukraine into a conduit for cheap goods flooding into Russia. Mr Juncker said Ukrainians' living conditions were \\"very difficult\\", and he pledged more EU financial assistance to help in the \\"painful\\" reform process. \\"Ukrainian citizens want to live in a corruption-free country,\\" he said. Reform of the heavily subsidised energy sector is a priority, BBC economics expert Andrew Walker says, as energy inefficiencies are a big drain on the national budget.

The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grains—most commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect which is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.

Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Information: - Elephant shrews, or jumping shrews, are small insectivorous mammals native to Africa, belonging to the family Macroscelididae, in the order Macroscelidea, whose traditional common English name comes from a fancied resemblance between their long noses and the trunk of an elephant, and an assumed relationship with the shrews (family Soricidae) in the order Eulipotyphla. Nonetheless, elephant shrews are not classified with the superficially similar true shrews, but are instead more closely related to elephants and their kin within the newly recognized Afrotheria; the biologist Jonathan Kingdon has proposed they instead be called sengis (singular \\"sengi\\"), a term derived from the Bantu languages of Africa. - Eutheria (from Greek -, eu- \\"true/good\\" and , thríon \\"beast\\" hence \\"true beasts\\") is one of two mammalian clades with extant members that diverged in the Early Cretaceous or perhaps the Late Jurassic. Except for the Virginia opossum, from North America, which is a metatherian, all post-Miocene mammals indigenous to Europe, Africa, Asia, and North America north of Mexico are eutherians. Extant eutherians, their last common ancestor, and all extinct descendants of that ancestor are members of Placentalia. - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. - In terrestrial zoology, megafauna (Ancient Greek \\"mégalo\\" \\"large\\" + New Latin \\"fauna\\" \\"animal\\") are large or giant animals. The most common thresholds used are weight over , over , or over a metric ton . This includes many species not popularly thought of as overly large, such as white-tailed deer, red kangaroo, and humans. - Ground sloths are a diverse group of extinct sloths, in the mammalian superorder Xenarthra. The term \\"ground sloth\\" is used as a reference for all extinct sloths because of the large size of the earliest forms discovered, as opposed to the extant \\"tree sloths.\\" However, this is a historical convention and should not imply that all extinct sloths were strictly terrestrial in nature. Their most recent survivors lived in the Antilles, where it has been proposed they may have survived until 1550 BCE; however, radiocarbon dating suggests an age of between 2819 and 2660 BCE for the last known occurrence of \\"Megalocnus\\" in Cuba. Ground sloths had been extinct on the mainland of North and South America for 10,000 years or more. Their later survival in the Caribbean correlates with the later colonization of this area by humans. Some insular sloth populations persisted 5,0006,000 years longer than their continental mainland relatives, in congruence with the global pattern of late Quaternary large vertebrate extinction due to human dispersal. - Placentalia (\\"Placentals\\") is one of the three extant subdivisions of the class of animals Mammalia; the other two are Monotremata and Marsupialia. The placentals are primarily distinguished from other mammals in that the fetus is carried in the uterus of its mother where it is nourished via a placenta, until the live birth of a fully developed offspring occurs. - Sloths are mammals classified in the families Megalonychidae (two-toed sloths) and Bradypodidae (three-toed sloths), including six extant species. They are named after the capital sin of sloth because they seem slow and lazy at first glance; however, their usual idleness is due to metabolic adaptations for conserving energy. Aside from their surprising speed during emergency flights from predators, other notable traits of sloths include their strong body and their ability to host symbiotic algae on their furs. - The superorder Xenarthra is a group of placental mammals, extant today only in the Americas and represented by anteaters, tree sloths, and armadillos. The origins of the order can be traced as far back as the Paleocene, as early as 59 million years ago in South America. Xenarthrans developed and diversified extensively in South America during its long period of isolation in the early to mid Cenozoic Era. They had invaded the Antilles by the early Miocene and, starting about 9 Mya, spread to Central and North America as part of the Great American Interchange. Nearly all of the formerly abundant megafaunal xenarthrans, such as ground sloths, glyptodonts, and pampatheres, became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - Metatheria is a mammalian clade that includes all mammals more closely related to marsupials than to placentals (such as sparassodontans). First proposed by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1880, it is a slightly more inclusive group than the marsupials; it contains all of the living mammals with abdominal pouches (most female marsupials) as well as their more primitive ancestors and relatives. Metatherians are one of three main classes of extant mammals: monotremes (egg laying mammals like the platypus and the echidna), metatheria (or marsupials, which includes the three American orders (Didelphimorphia, Paucituberculata and Microbiotheria) and the four Australasian orders (Notoryctemorphia, Dasyuromorphia, Peramelemorphia and Diprotodontia)), and the eutherians (or placental mammals) consisting of twenty-one orders, divided into four superorders. Metatherians belong to a subgroup of the northern tribosphenic mammal clade or Boreosphenida. They differ from all other mammals in certain morphologies like their dental formula, which includes about five upper and four lower incisors, a canine, three premolars, and four molars. Other morphologies include skeletal and anterior dentition, such as wrist and ankle apomorphies; all metatherians share derived pedal characters and calcaneal features. - The aardvark (; \\"Orycteropus afer\\") is a medium-sized, burrowing, nocturnal mammal native to Africa. It is the only living species of the order Tubulidentata, although other prehistoric species and genera of Tubulidentata are known. Unlike other insectivores, it has a long pig-like snout, which is used to sniff out food. It roams over most of the southern two-thirds of the African continent, avoiding areas that are mainly rocky. A nocturnal feeder, it subsists on ants and termites, which it will dig out of their hills using its sharp claws and powerful legs. It also digs to create burrows in which to live and rear its young. It receives a \\"least concern\\" rating from the IUCN, although its numbers seem to be decreasing. - Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists. - A clade (from , \\"klados\\", \\"branch\\") is a group of organisms that consists of a common ancestor and all its lineal descendants, and represents a single \\"branch\\" on the \\"tree of life\\". - In common cladistic usage, a monophyletic group is a taxon (group of organisms) which forms a clade, meaning that it consists of an ancestral species and all its descendants. The term is synonymous with the uncommon term holophyly. Monophyletic groups are typically characterized by shared derived characteristics (synapomorphies). - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk). - Anteater is a common name for the four extant mammal species of the suborder Vermilingua (meaning \\"worm tongue\\") commonly known for eating ants and termites. The individual species have other names in English and other languages. Together with the sloths, they are within the order Pilosa. The name \\"anteater\\" is also colloquially applied to the unrelated aardvark, numbat, echidnas, pangolins and some members of the Oecobiidae. - Euarchontoglires (synonymous with Supraprimates) is a clade and a superorder of mammals, the living members of which belong to one of the five following groups: rodents, lagomorphs, treeshrews, colugos and primates. - Golden moles are small, insectivorous burrowing mammals endemic to Southern Africa, where their Afrikaans names are gouemolle or kruipmolle (singular \\"gouemol\\" or \\"kruipmol\\"). They comprise the family Chrysochloridae and as such they are taxonomically distinct from the true moles, family Talpidae, and other mole-like families, all of which, to various degrees, they resemble as a result of convergence. - Afrotheria is a clade of mammals, the living members of which belong to groups that are either currently living in Africa or of African origin: golden moles, elephant shrews (also known as sengis), tenrecs, aardvarks, hyraxes, elephants, sea cows, and several extinct clades. They share few anatomical features but many are partly or entirely African in their distribution. This probably reflects the fact that Africa was an island continent through the early Cenozoic. Because the continent was isolated by water, Laurasian groups such as insectivores, rabbits, carnivorans and ungulates could not become established. Instead, the niches occupied by those groups were filled by tenrecs, hyraxes and elephants that evolved from the ancestral afrothere. This adaptive radiation may have occurred in response to the CretaceousPaleogene mass extinction. - A tenrec is any species of mammal within the family Tenrecidae, found on Madagascar and in parts of the African mainland. Tenrecs are widely diverse; as a result of convergent evolution they resemble hedgehogs, shrews, opossums, mice and even otters. They occupy aquatic, arboreal, terrestrial and fossorial environments. Some of these species, including the greater hedgehog tenrec, can be found in the Madagascar dry deciduous forests. - Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. Two species are traditionally recognised, the African elephant (\\"Loxodonta africana\\") and the Asian elephant (\\"Elephas maximus\\"), although some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species (\\"L. africana\\" and \\"L. cyclotis\\" respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the order include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons. Male African elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of and weigh . All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Laurasiatheria is a superorder of placental mammals that originated on the northern supercontinent of Laurasia 99 million years ago. The superorder includes shrews, pangolins, bats, whales, carnivorans, odd-toed and even-toed ungulates, among others. - Ungulates (pronounced ) are any members of a diverse group of primarily large mammals that includes odd-toed ungulates such as horses and rhinoceroses, and even-toed ungulates such as cattle, pigs, giraffes, camels, deer, and hippopotami. Most terrestrial ungulates use the tips of their toes, usually hoofed, to sustain their whole body weight while moving. The term means, roughly, \\"being hoofed\\" or \\"hoofed animal\\". As a descriptive term, \\"ungulate\\" normally excludes cetaceans (whales, dolphins, porpoises), as they do not possess most of the typical morphological characteristics of ungulates, but recent discoveries indicate that they are descended from early artiodactyls. Ungulates are typically herbivorous (though some species are omnivorous, such as pigs), and many employ specialized gut bacteria to allow them to digest cellulose, as in the case of ruminants. They inhabit a wide range of habitats, from jungles, plains and rivers. - Atlantogenata is a proposed clade of mammals containing the cohorts or superorders Afrotheria and Xenarthra . These groups originated and radiated in the South American and African continents , presumably in the Cretaceous . Together with Boreoeutheria , they make up Eutheria . The monophyly of this grouping was supported by some genetic evidence . Alternative hypotheses are that Boreoeutheria and Afrotheria combine to form Epitheria ( as generally supported by anatomical and other physiological evidence ) or that Boreoeutheria and Xenarthra combine to form Exafroplacentalia or Notolegia . Updated analysis of transposable element insertions around the time of divergence strongly supports the fourth hypothesis of a near - concomitant origin ( trifurcation ) of the three superorders of mammals . - Armadillos are New World placental mammals with a leathery armour shell. The Chlamyphoridae and Dasypodidae are the only surviving families in the order Cingulata, part of the superorder Xenarthra, along with the anteaters and sloths. The word \\"armadillo\\" means \\"little armoured one\\" in Spanish. The Aztecs called them \\"ytchtli\\" , Nahuatl for \\"turtle-rabbit\\": \\"ytl\\" (turtle) and \\"tchtli\\" (rabbit). The Portuguese word for \\"armadillo\\" is \\"tatu\\" which derives from the Tupi language. Similar names are also found in other, especially European, languages. - Boreoeutheria (synonymous with Boreotheria) (Greek: \\"north\\" + \\"good\\" + \\"beast\\") is a clade (magnorder) of placental mammals that is composed of the sister taxa Laurasiatheria (most hoofed mammals, most pawed carnivores, and several other groups) and Euarchontoglires (Supraprimates). It is now well supported by DNA sequence analyses, as well as retrotransposon presence or absence data. - In biology, a taxon (plural taxa; back-formation from \\"taxonomy\\") is a group of one or more populations of an organism or organisms seen by taxonomists to form a unit. Although neither is required, a taxon is usually known by a particular name and given a particular ranking, especially if and when it is accepted or becomes established. It is not uncommon, however, for taxonomists to remain at odds over what belongs to a taxon and the criteria used for inclusion. If a taxon is given a formal scientific name, its use is then governed by one of the nomenclature codes specifying which scientific name is correct for a particular grouping. - Chalk is a soft, white, porous, sedimentary carbonate rock, a form of limestone composed of the mineral calcite. Calcite is an ionic salt called calcium carbonate or CaCO. It forms under reasonably deep marine conditions from the gradual accumulation of minute calcite shells (coccoliths) shed from micro-organisms called coccolithophores. Flint (a type of chert unique to chalk) is very common as bands parallel to the bedding or as nodules embedded in chalk. It is probably derived from sponge spicules or other siliceous organisms as water is expelled upwards during compaction. Flint is often deposited around larger fossils such as Echinoidea which may be silicified (i.e. replaced molecule by molecule by flint).

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. For the first part of the process, you will need to scorch the tomatoes at a temperature of 425 degrees Fahrenheit (218 degrees Celsius). Preheat the oven to that temperature first. Meanwhile, prepare two baking sheets by lining them with nonstick aluminum foil or parchment paper. You could also spray the baking sheets with nonstick cooking spray if you do not want to use foil or parchment paper, but note that foil and parchment paper will make it easier for you to clean up later on. Use a rimmed baking sheet so that the excess juices and liquid produced during the process will be contained instead of dripping off into your oven. The tomatoes will need to be washed, dried, cored, and cut. Removing the seeds is an option, as well. Note that you should not skin the tomatoes yet. Rinse the tomatoes under cool, running water and pat them dry with clean paper towels. Cut a cone shape out of the top stem end of each tomato to remove the core. Use a small paring knife to do so. Cut the tomatoes into decent sizes. Cherry tomatoes should be cut in half, plum or roma tomatoes should be cut into halves or quarters, and larger tomatoes should be cut into 1/4-inch (6.35 mm) slices. You can remove the seeds, if desired, but the seeds and pulp contain a lot of flavor, so many prefer to leave them in. If you decide to remove the seeds, scoop out the seeds with your finger or with a kitchen spoon and leave as much of the pulp behind as possible. Arrange the tomatoes on your prepared baking sheet with the cut-side facing up. Position them so that each piece is about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) apart from the others. Do not stack the tomatoes or let them touch. Doing so could result in tomatoes that do not dehydrate evenly, so some may end up drying out or burning while others remain too moist to use. Popular seasonings for dehydrated tomatoes include salt, ground black pepper, herbs, garlic powder, and onion powder. Sprinkle the tomatoes with your seasoning of choice generously, or according to taste. If you use herbs, go for options like oregano, parsley, and thyme. Both dried herbs and fresh herbs will work. You could also scatter fresh minced or chopped garlic over the tomatoes instead of using garlic powder. Drizzle a fine stream of olive oil over the tomatoes, coating them evenly. This oil enhances the flavor of the tomatoes and prevents them from cooking poorly. If using store-bought olive oil in its original container, place your thumb over the spout as you pour so that you can control the speed and size of the stream more easily. Use your hands or tongs to flip the tomatoes over so that the skin-side faces up. This is important since you will be scorching the tomatoes before you dehydrate them fully. By exposing the skin side to the direct heat, you prevent the tomato pulp from becoming too burnt too quickly. Place your tomatoes in the preheated oven and let them sit there for 30 minutes. When ready, the skins will show signs of some wrinkling and some browning. Remove the tomatoes from the oven and pour off the excess liquid that has begun to leak out from the tomatoes. Remove the skins by pinching them in between tongs and peeling them off. You can drain the liquid by tilting the pan and letting it run off into a bowl, or you could also suction the liquid away using a turkey baster. As soon as you pull the tomatoes out of the oven, you should reduce the temperature to 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 degrees Celsius). Do not finish roasting the tomatoes at 425 degrees Fahrenheit (218 degrees Celsius). Return the tomatoes to the oven and cook for another 3 to 4 hours. The finished tomatoes should look visibly dry with a few dark edges. Flip the tomato pieces cut-side up after the first hour of cooking. Drain or siphon away the excess juice every 30 minutes. Remove the tomatoes from the oven and let them cool at room temperature. When ready, you can store them in an airtight container or plastic bag, which can be frozen for up to three months. Alternatively, place the tomatoes in a bowl and cove them with extra-virgin olive oil. Wrap the entire bowl in plastic wrap and refrigerate the tomatoes for up to 2 months. Summary:","completion":"1.

The first important difference is in the man's role.The traditional husband was the head of the household because he was the only one who worked outside the home.If the wife worked for money,then the husband was not considered to be a good provider,In many families today,both husband and wife work for money.Therefore,they share the role of head of household.In addition,the traditional husband usually made big decisions about spending money.However,the modern husband shares these decisions with his working wife.Also,the traditional husband did not help his wife with housework or meal preparation. Dinner was ready when he came home,In contrast,the modern husband helps his working wife at home.He may do some of the household chores,and it is not unusual for him to cook. The second difference is in the woman's role. In the traditional family,the woman may have worked for miney during her first years of marriage.However,when she gave birth,she would usually give up her job. Her primary role would be to take care of her family and home.In contrast,in many families today,the modern woman works outside the home even after she has children .She's doing two jobs instead of one,so she is busier than the traditional mother was.The traditional wife learned to live within her husband's income.But the modern wife does not have to because the family has two incomes. The final difference is in the role of the children .In the traditional family,the children were taken care of by the mother because she didn't work outside.However,today pre-school children may go to a child-care center or to a baby-sitter regularly because the mother works.The school-age children of a traditional family were more dependent.Their mother was there to help them get ready for school and to make their breakfast.In conrtast,modern children are more independent.They have to get up early and get ready for school themselves,and they may even have to make their own breakfast. Question: The main idea of the passage is_. Answer:","completion":"The main idea of the passage is the significant differences between traditional and modern families, particularly in the roles of men, women, and children.

Realizing the gravity of the situation, the doctor decided to take immediate and aggressive action to save the girl's life. Step 1: Administer Antivenom The first step was to administer an antivenom, designed to neutralize the venom in the girl's bloodstream. As each snake species produces different venom, the doctor had to identify the type of snake that had bitten the girl to obtain the right antivenom. Once identified, he quickly administered it through an intravenous line to ensure swift absorption into her bloodstream. Step 2: Manage Symptoms While the antivenom worked to combat the venom, the girl was showing obvious signs of distress, including difficulty breathing, decreased blood pressure, and swelling around the bite area. The doctor needed to manage these symptoms to prevent her condition from worsening. He gave her oxygen to help her breathe more easily, started an IV drip to stabilize her blood pressure, and applied a cold compress to reduce the swelling. Step 3: Minimize Pain and Infection Risk Snakebites can be exceptionally painful, and the risk of infection is high. To alleviate the girl's pain and reduce the risk of complications, the doctor administered an analgesic and prescribed antibiotics to fight off any potential infections. The antibiotics would help the girl's immune system combat any pathogens introduced by the snakebite. Step 4: Monitor the Patient With the antivenom running its course and symptoms managed, the doctor closely monitored the girl for any changes in her condition. This step was crucial as the effectiveness of the antivenom in neutralizing the venom could vary from person to person. By monitoring her vitals, the doctor would be ready to take further action if her condition worsened. Step 5: Provide Support and Aftercare As the girl's condition stabilized, the doctor began focusing on her recovery. He educated her and her family on proper wound care to avoid complications and scheduled follow-up appointments to track her progress. Counseling was also provided to help the girl and her family cope with this traumatic event emotionally. In conclusion, the doctor took a swift and comprehensive approach to treating the snakebite. By administering antivenom, managing symptoms, minimizing pain and infection risk, monitoring the patient, and providing support, he was able to save the girl's life and aid her in recovery. Though the situation initially seemed dire, the skilled intervention of the medical professional ensured a favorable outcome."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"Both questions address the issue of having a double chin, but they refer to two distinct aspects of the problem. The first question, \\"How can I remove a double chin?\\", asks for solutions to an existing issue. The second question, \\"How do you prevent a double chin?\\", concerns the preventative measures one can take to avoid developing a double chin. I will provide a detailed answer to each question for your better understanding. 1. How can I remove a double chin? To remove a double chin, you can try a combination of lifestyle changes, exercises, and treatments. Here are some suggestions to help you get started: A. Lifestyle Changes: 1. Maintain a healthy diet: Consume balanced meals that include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats to help lose overall body fat and reduce the appearance of a double chin. 2. Drink water: Staying hydrated improves skin elasticity and can help you feel full, preventing overeating. 3. Reduce salt intake: Consuming too much salt leads to water retention, which can exacerbate a double chin. B. Exercises: 1. Neck tilts: Tilt your head back, looking up at the ceiling, and hold for 5 seconds. Bring your head back down and repeat 10 times. 2. Neck rolls: Slowly tilt your head to one side, then roll it in a circle from one shoulder to the other. Perform 10 rolls in each direction. 3. Tongue press: Press your tongue against the roof of your mouth, then tilt your head back and hold for 5 seconds. Repeat 10 times. 4. Chin lifts: Tilt your head back, look up at the ceiling, and pucker your lips, lifting the corners of your mouth. Hold for 5 seconds and repeat 10 times. C. Treatments: 1. Kybella: This injectable treatment dissolves fat cells under the chin, leading to a more defined jawline. Consult a cosmetic dermatologist or plastic surgeon for more information. 2. CoolSculpting: This non-surgical treatment uses cold temperatures to freeze and eliminate fat cells under the chin. Speak to a professional about whether this option is suitable for you. 3. Liposuction: A surgical procedure that removes fat deposits from the chin and neck areas. Consult a plastic surgeon to discuss the risks and benefits. 4. FaceTite: A minimally invasive treatment that uses radiofrequency technology to tighten and sculpt the skin below the chin. Talk to a professional for more information. 2. How do you prevent a double chin? To prevent a double chin from forming, consider the following measures: A. Maintain a healthy weight: Engage in regular exercise and adopt a balanced diet to prevent excessive weight gain, which can contribute to the formation of a double chin. B. Watch your posture: Poor posture, especially while using a computer or smartphone, can weaken neck muscles over time. Strengthen your neck muscles by maintaining good posture and taking breaks to stretch your neck during prolonged periods of inactivity. C. Sleep with proper support: Use a supportive pillow that maintains your neck's natural curvature, avoiding strain on the neck muscles and preventing the formation of a double chin. D. Perform facial and neck exercises: Regularly engage in neck and facial exercises to strengthen and tone the muscles in those areas.

A Los Angeles judge refused a request to free the singer from custody on Wednesday so he could make his own way back from Washington. Brown, 24, was taken to Washington by U.S. marshals this month for trial on an assault charge, but that has been put on hold until the appeal of his bodyguard's conviction is completed. Brown has been on probation since 2009 when he pleaded guilty to a felony assault charge in the beating of his then-girlfriend Rihanna Fenty. He and bodyguard Christopher Hollosy were arrested on assault charges in Washington for allegedly beating a man who tried to take a photo of Brown last December. The arrest led to a revocation of Brown's probation, but he was allowed to enter a rehab program instead of going to jail. He was ordered to jail last month when he was kicked out of the rehab program for rules violations. Planes, chains and automobiles: Chris Brown's miserable trip to trial Brown is now \\"stuck between a rock and a hard spot,\\" attorney Robert Kalunian told Judge Victor Greenberg during a brief hearing in Los Angeles on Wednesday. He has been locked up for 39 days and still has not had a probation revocation hearing, Kalunian said. Assistant District Attorney Mary Murray said she \\"strenuously\\" opposed releasing Brown now, arguing the only change since Brown was jailed in March is that his case has \\"gotten worse.\\" The Washington judge who found his bodyguard guilty in the assault case also concluded that Brown was \\"the initial aggressor\\" in the incident, Murray said. A hearing was set for May 1 in Los Angeles to set a date for another hearing that could determine if Brown's Washington case warranted a probation revocation. It could be several months before his trial in Washington is held. \\"I think it's a little over the top to have him in custody on this misdemeanor when everybody saw the bodyguard's trial and which was nothing more than a bloody nose,\\" Brown lawyer Mark Geragos told reporters in Washington earlier Wednesday. \\"And you have got the bodyguard who was convicted and who readily admitted he was the one who did the punching. So all of this is much ado about nothing.\\" Chris Brown's freedom at stake with 2 cases The delay in Brown's Washington trial came after prosecutors refused to grant immunity to Hollosy so he could testify without jeopardizing his own case. On Monday, Hollosy was found guilty of assaulting a man on a Washington sidewalk before Brown's trial was to begin in the case. The prosecutors cited Hollosy's refusal to talk to them about his testimony as a major reason for the decision not to grant immunity. Their motion also said they suspected he might lie in his testimony to help Brown. \\"The cynic in me would say apparently it is not a search for the truth because if they wanted the truth they would give Hollosy immunity and allow him to testify,\\" Geragos said Wednesday outside court.

Although both sentences discuss the series being profiled in the documentary called \\"Deception of a Generation,\\" their meanings differ significantly. The first sentence suggests that the series was being criticized for its supposed Christian fundamentalist influences on children's entertainment. It emphasizes the idea that the occult documentary is against this series because it supposedly promotes Christian fundamentalist ideas. On the other hand, the second sentence argues that the Christian-fundamentalist documentary is critical of the series due to its occult influences on children's entertainment. In this context, the series is being portrayed as promoting occult ideas instead of Christian fundamentalist ones. Ultimately, while both statements highlight that the series is criticized within the documentary, the reasons for that criticism differ entirely, implying that they are not paraphrases of each other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Product review: If you want to see the science fiction show that bridged the first Star Trek and the Next Generation, this is it.Many of the plots, characters and ideas would be used for the next generation series , and even The X-files and Alien. When Space 1999 came out in the early 70's George Lucas claimed he woudn't have been able to make Star Wars without it. Even today the show feels very modern with its blend of gothic horror, the paranormal and science fiction. Many episodes are filmed in a neo-surrealistic style akin to Luis Bunel and Hitchcock.

My father’s disease makes him angry and aggressive leaving my mother with blurred and fading memories of his kindness.

Information: - Aristotle (\\"Aristotéls\\"; 384322 BC) was a Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidice, on the northern periphery of Classical Greece. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC. - Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is a gas giant, along with Saturn, with the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, being ice giants. Jupiter was known to astronomers of ancient times. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of 2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus. - Prometheus the Fire-Bringer (Ancient Greek: , \\"Promtheús Pyrphóros\\") was probably the final play in the \\"Prometheia\\" trilogy traditionally ascribed to the 5th century BC Greek tragedian Aeschylus. - Ancient Greek religion encompasses the collection of beliefs, rituals, and mythology originating in ancient Greece in the form of both popular public religion and cult practices. These groups varied enough for it to be possible to speak of Greek religions or \\"cults\\" in the plural, though most of them shared similarities. - Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece. Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself. - In the Vedas, Indra is the king of Svarga and the Devas . He is the god of lightning, thunder, storms, rains and river flows. Indra is the most referred to deity in the \\"Rigveda\\". He is celebrated for his powers, and the one who kills the great symbolic evil named Vritra who obstructs human prosperity and happiness. Indra destroys Vritra and his \\"deceiving forces\\", and thereby brings rains and the sunshine as the friend of mankind. His importance diminishes in the post-Vedic Indian literature where he is depicted as a powerful hero but one who is getting in trouble with his drunken, hedonistic and adulterous ways, and the god who disturbs Hindu monks as they meditate because he fears self-realized human beings may become more powerful than him. - In linguistics, cognates are words that have a common etymological origin. In etymology, the \\"cognate\\" category excludes doublets and loanwords. The word \\"cognate\\" derives from the Latin noun \\"cognatus\\", which means \\"blood relative\\". - Zeus (\\"Zeús\\", ; Modern , \\"Días\\" ) was the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who ruled as king of the gods of Mount Olympus. His name is cognate with the first element of his Roman equivalent Jupiter. His mythologies and powers are similar, though not identical to those of the Indo-European deities such as Indra, Jupiter, Perun, Thor, and Odin. - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. - Prometheus Unbound ( Ancient Greek : , Promtheus Lyomenos ) is a fragmentary play by the Greek poet Aeschylus , concerned with the torments of the Greek mythological figure Prometheus who defies the gods and gives fire to humanity ( theft of fire ) , for which he is subjected to eternal punishment and suffering at the hands of Zeus . It inspired the play of the same title by Percy Bysshe Shelley . It is thought to have followed Prometheus Bound in the Prometheia trilogy attributed to the 5th - century BC Greek tragedian Aeschylus . The text of the Unbound survives only in eleven fragments preserved by later authors . Nevertheless , these fragments , combined with prophetic statements made in the first play of the trilogy , allow the reconstruction of a broad outline . A lengthy fragment translated into Latin by the Roman statesman Cicero indicates that the play would have opened with Prometheus visited by a chorus of Titans . Though Zeus had imprisoned them in Tartarus at the conclusion of the Titanomachy , he has at long last granted them clemency . This perhaps foreshadows Zeus 's eventual reconciliation with Prometheus in the trilogy 's third installment . Prometheus complains about his torment just as he had to the chorus of Oceanids in Prometheus Bound . As the dramatis personae of Prometheus Bound erroneously lists Gaea , it has been suggested that she is next to visit Prometheus in this play , in a sympathetic role that echoes Oceanus ' turn in the first play . Finally , the faulty dramatis personae mentioned above and several fragments indicate that Heracles visits the Titan just as Io had in Prometheus Bound . Heracles frees Prometheus from his chains and kills the eagle that had been torturing Prometheus by eating his regenerating liver every day . Again mirroring events in the previous play , Prometheus forecasts Heracles ' travels as he concludes his Twelve Labours . The play thus concludes with Prometheus free from the torments of Zeus , but the Titan and Olympian have yet to reconcile . This... - Thunder is the sound caused by lightning. Depending on the distance and nature of the lightning, thunder can range from a sharp, loud crack to a long, low rumble (brontide). The sudden increase in pressure and temperature from lightning produces rapid expansion of the air surrounding and within a bolt of lightning. In turn, this expansion of air creates a sonic shock wave, similar to a sonic boom, which produces the sound of thunder, often referred to as a \\"clap\\", \\"crack\\", \\"peal of thunder\\", or \\"boom\\". - Aeschylus (or ; \\"Aiskhulos\\" c. 525/524 c. 456/455 BC) was an ancient Greek tragedian. He is often described as the father of tragedy. Academics' knowledge of the genre begins with his work, and understanding of earlier tragedies is largely based on inferences from his surviving plays. According to Aristotle, he expanded the number of characters in theater allowing conflict among them; characters previously had interacted only with the chorus. - Prometheus ( meaning \\"forethought\\") is a Titan in Greek mythology, best known as the deity in Greek mythology who was the creator of mankind and its greatest benefactor, who stole fire from Mount Olympus and gave it to mankind. - The Oresteia is a trilogy of Greek tragedies written by Aeschylus concerning the murder of Agamemnon by Clytaemnestra, the murder of Clytaemnestra by Orestes, the trial of Orestes, the end of the curse on the House of Atreus and pacification of the Erinyes. This trilogy also shows how the Greek gods interacted with the characters and influenced their decisions pertaining to events and disputes. The only extant example of an ancient Greek theater trilogy, the \\"Oresteia\\" won first prize at the Dionysia festival in 458 BC. Many consider the \\"Oresteia\\" to be Aeschylus' finest work. The principal themes of the trilogy include the contrast between revenge and justice, as well as the transition from personal vendetta to organized litigation. \\"Orestia\\" originally included a satyr play \\"Proteus\\" following the tragic trilogy, but all except a single line of \\"Proteus\\" has been lost. - The Prometheia is a trilogy of plays about the titan Prometheus. It was attributed in Antiquity to the 5th-century BC Greek tragedian Aeschylus. Though an Alexandrian catalogue of Aeschylean play titles designates the trilogy \\"Hoi Prometheis\\" (\\"the Prometheuses\\"), in modern scholarship the trilogy has been designated the \\"Prometheia\\" to mirror the title of Aeschylus' only extant trilogy, the \\"Oresteia\\". Unlike the \\"Oresteia\\", only one play from this trilogy\\"Prometheus Bound\\"survives. Inasmuch as the authorship of \\"Prometheus Bound\\" continues to be debated, the very existence of a Prometheus trilogy is uncertain. To the extent that modern scholars postulate the existence of such a trilogy by a single author, the consensus holds that it comprised \\"Prometheus Bound\\", \\"Prometheus Unbound\\", and \\"Prometheus the Fire-Bringer\\", in that order. - In Norse mythology, Thor (from Old Norse Þórr) is a hammer-wielding god associated with thunder, lightning, storms, oak trees, strength, the protection of mankind, and also hallowing and fertility. The cognate deity in wider Germanic mythology and paganism was known in Old English as Þunor and in Old High German as Donar (runic þonar ), stemming from a Common Germanic *Þunraz (meaning \\"thunder\\"). - In Germanic mythology, Odin (from Old Norse Óðinn) is a widely revered god. In Norse mythology, from which stems most of the information about the god, Odin is associated with healing, death, royalty, the gallows, knowledge, battle, sorcery, poetry, frenzy, and the runic alphabet, and is the husband of the goddess Frigg. In wider Germanic mythology and paganism, Odin was known in Old English as Wden, in Old Saxon as Wdan, and in Old High German as Wuotan or Wtan, all stemming from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic theonym wanaz. - Prometheus Bound (\\"Promtheus Desmts\\") is an Ancient Greek tragedy. In antiquity, it was attributed to Aeschylus, but now is considered by some scholars to be the work of another hand, and perhaps one as late as c. 430 BC. Despite these doubts of authorship, the play's designation as Aeschylean has remained conventional. The tragedy is based on the myth of Prometheus, a Titan who defies the gods and gives fire to mankind, acts for which he is subjected to perpetual punishment. - In polytheistic systems there is a tendency for one divinity, usually male, to achieve pre-eminence as King of the Gods. This tendency is paralleled with the growth of hierarchical systems of political power, in which a monarch eventually comes to assume ultimate authority for human affairs. Other gods come to serve in a Divine Council or pantheon, usually linked by family ties from union of a single husband or wife, or else from an androgynous divinity who is responsible for the creation.

Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3).

They claim that their researchâfunded primarily by tobacco companiesâhas found no definitive evidence of any linkage. Naylor's job consists mainly of reporting the questionable research of the \\"Academy\\" to the public and defending Big Tobacco on television programs by questioning opposing health claims and advocating personal choice. Naylor and his friends, firearm lobbyist Bobby Jay Bliss and alcohol lobbyist Polly Bailey, meet every week and jokingly call themselves the \\"Merchants of Death\\" or \\"The MOD Squad\\". As anti-tobacco campaigns mount and numbers of young smokers decline, Naylor suggests that product placement of cigarettes could once again boost cigarette sales. Naylor's boss, BR, sends Naylor to Los Angeles to bargain for cigarette placement in upcoming movies. Naylor takes along his young son Joey in hopes of bonding with him. The next day, Naylor is sent to meet with Lorne Lutch, the cancer-stricken man who once played the Marlboro Man in cigarette ads and is now campaigning against cigarettes. As his son watches, Naylor successfully offers Lutch a suitcase of money for his silence. During the drive back, Nick and Joey discuss the beauty of argument.

An adolescent's environment plays a huge role in their identity development. While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general. An adolescent from an inner city or a crime-driven neighborhood is more likely to be exposed to an environment that can be detrimental to their development. Adolescence is a sensitive period in the development process, and exposure to the wrong things at that time can have a major effect on future decisions. While children that grow up in nice suburban communities are not exposed to bad environments they are more likely to participate in activities that can benefit their identity and contribute to a more successful identity development.

Article: If you don’t have an office or a study, don’t worry. You don’t need to store all of your books in one room. Feel free to spread your collection throughout your house. For example, keep all of your cookbooks in the kitchen. You can display your organized book collection in a variety of ways. You may store your books on shelves or ledges. You can also stack your books in storage cubes. For a more eclectic look, consider stacking your books on the floor, in a dormant fireplace, or down the edge of your staircase. Once you’ve settled on a location and storage method, you can finally put away your collection. Place the books on your bookshelves or stack the books in a storage cube. Before you shelve or stack your books, you may want to clean and dust your storage unit. For convenience, frequently used books should be readily accessible. This is especially important if children will be using the books. If children are using the collection, store the books at their level. Instead of a traditional shelf, consider a storage system that would allow them to stack the books. Lastly, you may also want to store the books in the places they will use them the most, such as a playroom or bedroom. If you don’t have the space to display your entire collection, you may need to put some of your books in storage. To protect your books while they’re in boxes, follow these tips: Stack your books horizontally with the heaviest books on the bottom. To fill in gaps, insert books vertically. Never place a book spine down. If possible, try not to stack more than three boxes of books on top of each other. If your collection contains rare books, you may wish to take extra steps to protect these special items. It is good practice to apply all of these suggestions to your entire collection. Store your rare books out of direct sunlight. In addition to fading the book jacket, the sunlight will slowly deteriorate the book. Keep your books in their dust jackets. Before shelving or storing a book, always remove bookmarks and scraps of paper. Try to store your books at a consistent temperature. Too much humidity will generate mold in your books; too little humidity will leave your books brittle.

Here is a news article: A U.S. Navy cruiser had an \\"unsafe\\" encounter with a Chinese ship while conducting a freedom of navigation operation in the Spratly Islands on Sunday in the South China Sea, a U.S. defense official tells CBS News. The USS Decatur passed within 12 nautical miles of two reefs in the Spratly Islands, which the Chinese consider sovereign territory. The Chinese military routinely warns American ships and aircraft away, but in this case, the Chinese ship came within 45 yards of the USS Decatur, the official said. The incident is the latest in a series of testy exchanges between the U.S. and Chinese militaries. Last week, China called a mission by U.S. bombers over the South China Sea \\"provocative,\\" and said the U.S. was solely responsible for the recent downturn in relations.

(Associated Press) FILE - In this Oct. 30, 2017, file photo, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, testifies during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington. US officials say stricter Trump administration... (Associated Press) PARIS (AP) — Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Monday that he doesn't see the U.S. relationship with China worsening after a series of setbacks that officials said include canceling the Pentagon chief's planned visit to Beijing this month. Mattis said the U.S. has to learn how to manage its relationship with the communist nation. \\"There's tension points in the relationship, but based on discussions coming out of New York last week and other things that we have coming up, we do not see it getting worse,\\" Mattis told reporters traveling with him to Paris. \\"We'll sort this out.\\" U.S. defense officials told The Associated Press on Monday that Mattis had dropped plans to visit China amid rising tensions between Beijing and Washington. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning. Although the trip was never publicly announced, Mattis had planned to visit Beijing in October for two-plus-two security talks with his Chinese counterpart as well as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Pompeo's Chinese counterpart. The Pentagon has made no public statement about Mattis' change of plans. Relations between the U.S. and China have deteriorated, as escalating trade disputes and tariff hikes have been exacerbated by a newly announced U.S. military equipment sale to Taiwan and some recent military operations. In past years, military ties have been somewhat stable, but a series of events this year have roiled the waters. At stake is President Donald Trump's effort to enlist China's help in persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. China is North Korea's longtime ally and has tended to insulate the North from American pressure to disarm. Just last week Beijing canceled a Washington visit by the head of its navy and denied a request for a U.S. Navy ship to make a port visit next month at Hong Kong. China also protested a recent mission by nuclear-capable U.S. B-52 bombers over the disputed South China Sea, calling the flights \\"provocative.\\" And on Sunday, the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Decatur sailed close to Chinese-claimed islands in the South China Sea. Such freedom-of-navigation operations have been somewhat routine near man-made reefs and islands that China has militarized in the South China Sea. But Beijing vehemently objects to U.S. ships sailing within 12 nautical miles (22 kilometers) of the outposts. China's military buildup in the waterway, which has included placing airstrips, radar domes, missile systems and other military equipment on the islands, prompted Mattis in May to disinvite Beijing from participating in a multinational naval exercise in the Pacific. At the center of the tensions is a growing U.S.-China trade dispute. Each country has imposed tariff increases on the other's goods, and Beijing has accused the Trump administration of bullying. In recent days, however, China's anger spiked when the U.S. announced a 330 million military sale to Taiwan. And Beijing also opposes a U.S. decision to issue a visa ban and assets freeze on China's Equipment Development Department and its director, Li Shangfu. The U.S. action relates to China's purchase from Russia of Su-35 combat aircraft last year and S-400 surface-to-air missile system-related equipment this year. Those purchases violated a 2017 law intended to punish the Russian government for interfering in U.S. elections and other activities. As temperatures rose, the Chinese foreign ministry warned of \\"severe damage\\" to bilateral relations if the Taiwan sale goes through. \\"I just think it's part of reality,\\" Mattis said Monday. \\"We're two, as you said, great powers, two Pacific Ocean nations. We have various issues: diplomatic, economic, security. We're going to have to find ways to work them out. We will.\\" Two B-52s flew over the South China Sea last week in what the Pentagon called a routine mission. Separately, two B-52s also flew over the East China Sea, where China has declared an air defense identification zone and claims uninhabited islands controlled by Japan. Beijing considers the self-ruled island of Taiwan to be a renegade province. Washington has no official relations with Taiwan's democratically elected government but is obliged by U.S. law to see that it has the means to defend itself. Mattis visited Beijing in June, becoming the first Pentagon chief to do so since 2014. He flew to Paris on Monday and is expected to meet with senior French leaders there, then head to Brussels for a meeting later this week of allied defense ministers. ___ Burns reported from Washington. ||||| (CNN) A US Navy ship had an \\"unsafe\\" interaction with a Chinese warship Sunday while the US vessel was conducting a freedom of navigation operation near the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, causing the US ship to maneuver \\"to prevent a collision,\\" according to US defense officials. \\"A (People's Republic of China) Luyang destroyer approached USS Decatur in an unsafe and unprofessional maneuver in the vicinity of Gaven Reef in the South China Sea,\\" Capt. Charles Brown, a spokesman for US Pacific Fleet, told CNN in a statement confirming the incident. Brown said the Chinese warship \\"conducted a series of increasingly aggressive maneuvers accompanied by warnings for the Decatur to depart the area.\\" He added that the Chinese destroyer \\"approached within 45 yards\\" of the front of the US ship, adding that the Decatur \\"maneuvered to prevent a collision.\\" \\"Our forces will continue to fly, sail and operate anywhere international law allows,\\" he said. The close encounter would give the ship's captains just seconds to react to any course change, said Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain who spent 12 years at sea. \\"This was very dangerous. Captains get very nervous when ships get closer than 1,000 yards,\\" said Schuster, now a Hawaii Pacific University professor. Minute rudder and engine speed corrections are needed to keep ships separated and even a slight miscalculation can result in a collision, he said. This incident comes amid heightened US-China tensions over a broad range of issues. Chinese ships often shadow US vessels during freedom of navigation operations but those interactions are usually considered safe. CNN reported Sunday the USS Decatur sailed within 12 nautical miles of Gaven and Johnson reefs in the Spratly Islands as part of what the US Navy calls freedom of navigation operations, which are meant to enforce the right of free passage in international waters. While the US Navy conducts such freedom of navigation operations all over the world, China is particularly sensitive about the operations when they come near areas where the Chinese government has built islands and established military facilities on disputed maritime features. \\"The US has been repeatedly sending warships to the islands and the adjacent waters in the South China Sea, which has seriously threatened China's sovereignty and safety,\\" Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Wu Qian said Tuesday. \\"The Chinese military will resolutely perform its defense duties and continue to take all necessary measures to safeguard our sovereignty and the regional peace and stability,\\" Wu said. Schuster said China seems to be adopting \\"a more aggressive response policy\\" to US ships, emboldened in part by last year's collisions between US destroyers and merchant ships in the Asia-Pacific. Naval academics theorize the collisions that killed 16 US sailors have the Chinese navy doubting US seamanship skills and giving it confidence to \\"intimidate\\" US ship captains, Schuster said. Mattis cancels trip to Beijing In a sign of the increasing tensions, late last week US Secretary of Defense James Mattis pulled out of a planned visit to Beijing later in October, two US officials told CNN. Mattis had originally planned to visit the Chinese capital to meet with senior Chinese officials to discuss security issues. The last-minute cancellation of the unannounced trip has not been publicly confirmed by the Pentagon. Tensions have been growing across multiple fronts, from the Trump administration's tariffs on Chinese goods to new sanctions announced against the Chinese military. At a news conference last week, President Donald Trump said his often-mentioned friendship with Chinese leader Xi Jinping may have come to an end. \\"He may not be a friend of mine anymore. But I think he probably respects me,\\" Trump said. Speaking at the United Nations Security Council last week Trump said the Chinese government was attempting to interfere in the 2018 midterm elections to tilt them against the Republicans. \\"They do not want me or us to win because I am the first president ever to challenge China on trade,\\" Trump said. \\"We are winning on trade. We are winning at every level. We don't want them to meddle or interfere in our upcoming election.\\" The Trump administration imposed 10% tariffs on 200 billion in Chinese goods on September 24, in addition to the trade measures already in place. The Chinese government responded in kind, with 5% to 10% tariffs on 60 billion in US goods. Following the new round of tariffs, Beijing called off planned trade talks with Washington, leaving no end in sight for the trade war. \\"How could you negotiate with someone when he puts a knife on your neck?\\" Chinese deputy trade negotiator Wang Shouwen said at a news conference last Tuesday, saying that resuming the talks would be difficult. In another sign of the growing tensions, the Chinese government canceled a port visit to Hong Kong by the USS Wasp , a US Navy amphibious assault ship, last week. It followed closely the decision by the US government to sanction Chinese military figures over their purchases of Russian combat aircraft and missile systems Correction: This article has been updated to reflect that the \\"unsafe\\" interaction took place near the Spratly Islands. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"A U.S. Navy cruiser, the USS Decatur, had an \\"unsafe\\" encounter with a Chinese ship while conducting a freedom of navigation operation in the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.

Charles-Valentin Alkan (French: [ʃaʁl valɑ̃tɛ̃ alkɑ̃]; 30 November 1813 – 29 March 1888) was a French-Jewish composer and virtuoso pianist. At the height of his fame in the 1830s and 1840s he was, alongside his friends and colleagues Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt, among the leading pianists in Paris, a city in which he spent virtually his entire life. Alkan earned many awards at the Conservatoire de Paris, which he entered before he was six. His career in the salons and concert halls of Paris was marked by his occasional long withdrawals from public performance, for personal reasons. Although he had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the Parisian artistic world, including Eugène Delacroix and George Sand, from 1848 he began to adopt a reclusive life style, while continuing with his compositions – virtually all of which are for the keyboard. During this period he published, among other works, his collections of large-scale studies in all the major keys (Op. 35) and all the minor keys (Op. 39). The latter includes his Symphony for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 4–7) and Concerto for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 8–10), which are often considered among his masterpieces and are of great musical and technical complexity. Alkan emerged from self-imposed retirement in the 1870s to give a series of recitals that were attended by a new generation of French musicians. Alkan's attachment to his Jewish origins is displayed both in his life and his work. He was the first composer to incorporate Jewish melodies in art music. Fluent in Hebrew and Greek, he devoted much time to a complete new translation of the Bible into French. This work, like many of his musical compositions, is now lost. Alkan never married, but his presumed son Élie-Miriam Delaborde was, like Alkan, a virtuoso performer on both the piano and the pedal piano, and edited a number of the elder composer's works. Following his death (which according to persistent but unfounded legend was caused by a falling bookcase) Alkan's music became neglected,...

Members of Students for a Free Tibet climbed the bridge to place these banners, said the group's spokesman. The banner read, \\"One World. One Dream.

The three were arrested along with four others at the site. All seven were charged with felony conspiracy and misdemeanor nuisance, said California Highway Patrol Officer Mary Ziegenbein. The climbers also were charged with misdemeanor trespassing.

He elaborated that the global community, including numerous human rights organizations, activists, and sympathizers, stand in solidarity with the Tibetan people who have been struggling against the oppressive Chinese regime for decades. These large-scale protests are aimed at raising awareness of the human rights violations, cultural erosion, and environmental damages inflicted upon Tibet and its people by China's autocratic government. Local authorities and event organizers in San Francisco are preparing for the Olympic torch's arrival by organizing increased security measures, engaging in dialogues with various protest groups, and establishing designated protest areas. They hope to ensure that both the Olympic torch-related events and the demonstrations take place peacefully and without significant disruptions. The city mayor has called upon San Francisco residents and participants to respect the spirit of the Olympics while exercising their rights to free speech and assembly. Protests in San Francisco are expected to attract a diverse group of participants, including Tibetan exiles, religious leaders, environmental activists, and human rights advocates, all joining together to call for a free Tibet. Numerous events are planned throughout the city, such as prayer vigils, marches, and art installations, to show the world that the cause of Tibetan freedom is alive and flourishing. Meanwhile, the Chinese government has responded by criticizing the protesters, accusing them of trying to politicize the Olympics and disrupt the Games' unifying spirit. Beijing has repeatedly claimed that Tibet is an integral part of China, dismissing accusations of human rights abuses and cultural oppression as distortions from Tibetan separatists and their supporters. As the Olympic torch makes its way through various cities worldwide, protests and demonstrations continue to follow, bringing attention not only to the plight of Tibet but also to China's broader human rights record and questionable environmental practices. These protests raise important questions about the role of international sporting events in highlighting and potentially impacting geopolitical issues. In conclusion, the three activists' Golden Gate Bridge protest serves as a powerful symbol of the imminent unrest and outcry that await the Olympic torch in San Francisco and beyond. It encapsulates the unwavering spirit and determination of countless individuals who are standing up against injustice and oppression in Tibet, hoping to foster change and create a better future for its people. The upcoming protests, driven by a passionate and diverse coalition, seek to elevate the voice of Tibet on the global stage and hold China accountable for its actions in the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"[III] In order to tell the difference you should assess your symptoms. The signs and symptoms of a light infection include: pain and/or tenderness, swelling, redness, and increased warmth in the area. Now that you have assessed your symptoms, it is crucial to understand how to cure an infected toe. Depending on the severity of the infection, there are various treatments you can consider, but visiting a healthcare professional is always recommended for appropriate guidance. If the infection appears to be light and related to an ingrown toenail, you may begin by attempting some home remedies and self-care measures: 1. Soak your foot in warm, soapy water for 15-20 minutes at least 3-4 times a day. This will help to soften the skin around the affected area and reduce discomfort. 2. After soaking, gently massage the area to increase blood flow and promote healing. 3. Keep the area clean and dry. Make sure to wash the toe with soap and water daily and apply an antibiotic ointment to prevent infection. 4. Opt for comfortable footwear made from soft, breathable materials. Avoid wearing tight shoes or high heels for extended periods of time, as these can put additional pressure on the affected toe. 5. Trim your toenails straight across and make sure they are not too short. This will help reduce the risk of ingrown toenails and make it easier to manage the issue. 6. If the pain is causing discomfort, consider taking over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. If you have followed these steps and your symptoms do not improve within a few days or if they worsen, it is important to seek medical attention. A healthcare professional may suggest some other treatment options, such as: 1. Lifting the nail: This is a procedure where the doctor gently lifts the ingrown portion of the nail away from the skin, allowing the nail to grow over the skin edge. 2. Partial nail removal: In more severe cases, a doctor may need to remove part of the nail. This can be done under local anesthesia, and a small portion of the nail is removed to reduce pressure on the affected area. 3. Total nail removal: If the problem persists and the infection is severe, the entire nail may need to be removed. This procedure is performed under local anesthesia and will require a longer healing period. 4. Oral antibiotics: If an infection is present, your doctor may prescribe oral antibiotics to help combat the infection and reduce inflammation. It is crucial to follow your healthcare professional's guidance, as ignoring an infected toe can potentially lead to more serious complications, such as an infection spreading to the bones or even entering the bloodstream. Early intervention and treatment can prevent these severe outcomes and will speed up the healing process of the affected toe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:What is the answer for the question: What group is the scientist able to link to the car bomb? from the following article ? During the 1999 Russian Presidential elections, the two leading candidates are Igor Komarov, a former Colonel of the KGB, and Nikolai Nikolayev, a retired General of the Russian Army. When a car bomb explodes outside one of Komarov's pharmaceutical companies, and a virus is stolen from inside, an investigation by the FSB ensues headed by FSB agents Sonia Astrova and Andrei Kasanov. Their investigation is obstructed by the Director of the FSB, Anatoly Grishin. A British Embassy worker from Moscow, Sir Nigel Irvine, tracks down Jason Monk, a former CIA operative, who ran double agents in the Soviet Union and convinces him to investigate the incident. Once in Moscow, Jason finds an old friend, Viktor Akopov, who agrees to hide Jason from Komarov's men. Viktor steals a residue sample of the bomb used and his scientist friend Tonkin tells him that the explosive used, Semtex H, has a direct traceable link to the FSB. Tonkin is soon killed by Vladimir Dorganosov, the man who attacked Komarov industries and stole the bioweapon. Sonia and Andrei locate Leonid Zaitzev, a cleaner who worked at the Komarov Industries plant and saw Dorganosov steal the virus. As they question him, Grishin appears, arrests Zaitzev and fires Sonia and Andrei. Zaitzev is later killed by Dorganosov while in custody. Sonia goes home to find Jason waiting for her, and agrees to help him access the FSB network. However, they are shot at by Dorganosov, and a car chase ensues. They go to Andrei's house where they find him already dead. After the chase, Dorganosov demands the rest of his payment from his contractor, who is revealed to be Anatoly Grishin. While they are arguing, Komarov himself arrives and orders Grishin to kill Dorganosov.

Make sure you remove all the leaves, as these are poisonous. Trim off the bottom inch (2.5 cm) of the stalks as well, where the rhubarb was touching the ground. Rinse the rhubarb under cool, running water. Use your fingers or a clean cloth to scrub away any dirt on the fruit. Rhubarb is fairly hard, so you can also use a vegetable brush to scrub it clean if you like. Lay the stalks on a clean towel and roll each stalk around to dry it. You can also dry the rhubarb in a salad spinner if you have one. Transfer the rhubarb stalks back to the cutting board. Chop each stalk into quarter- to half-inch pieces (6 to 13 mm). Smaller pieces are ideal for jams, pie fillings, and baked goods. Larger pieces are better for eating plain or making chunkier compotes. If you have specific plans for the rhubarb, consult the individual recipes to determine the right length for the pieces. Summary:","completion":"This article is about how to prepare rhubarb.

Movie title: Tales from the Darkside: The Movie Movie plot: Intro[edit] The movie opens with Betty, an affluent suburban housewife and modern-day witch (Deborah Harry), planning a dinner party. The main dish is to be Timmy (Matthew Lawrence), a young boy whom she has captured and chained up in her pantry. To stall her from stuffing and roasting him, the boy tells her three horror stories from a book she gave him, titled Tales from the Darkside. Lot 249[edit] In the first segment, Michael McDowell adapts Arthur Conan Doyle's short story, \\"Lot No. 249\\". A graduate student named Bellingham (played by Steve Buscemi) has been cheated by two classmates, Susan (Julianne Moore), and Lee (Robert Sedgwick), who framed him for theft to ruin his chances of winning a scholarship for which they were competing. As revenge, Bellingham reanimates a mummy and uses it to murder them both. Susan's brother Andy (Christian Slater) kidnaps Bellingham, and burns the parchment and mummy. He considers killing Bellingham, but in the end cannot bring himself to commit real murder. However, Bellingham brings Susan and Lee back from the dead (having switched the reanimation parchment with a similar one) and dispatches them to Andy's dorm, where they greet the terrified Andy by saying that Bellingham sends his regards. Cat from Hell[edit] In the second tale, George A. Romero adapts a Stephen King short story of the same name. Drogan is a wealthy, wheelchair-bound old man (William Hickey) who brings in a hitman named Halston (David Johansen) for a bizarre hire: kill a black cat, which Drogan believes is murderously evil. Drogan explains that there were three other occupants of his house before the cat arrived: his sister, Amanda (Dolores Sutton), her friend Carolyn (Alice Drummond), and the family's butler, Richard Gage (Mark Margolis). Drogan claims that one by one, the cat killed the other three, and that he is next.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Louis-Dreyfus was born in New York City. Her American-born mother, Judith (nee LeFever), was a writer and special needs tutor, and her French-born father, Gerard Louis-Dreyfus, chaired Louis Dreyfus Energy Services. She is a great-great-granddaughter of Leopold Louis-Dreyfus, who in 1851 founded the Louis Dreyfus Group, a French commodities and shipping conglomerate, which members of her family control into the 21st century. Her paternal grandfather, Pierre Louis-Dreyfus, was president of the Louis Dreyfus Group. In the early 1990s, Louis-Dreyfus became famous for the role of Elaine Benes on NBC's Seinfeld. She played the role for nine seasons, appearing in all but three episodes. One of the episodes that she did not appear in was the inaugural pilot episode, \\"The Seinfeld Chronicles\\", because her character was not initially intended to be a part of the series. It was only after the first episode that NBC executives felt the show was too male-centric, and demanded that creators Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David add a woman to the cast. It was revealed in the commentary on the DVD package that the addition of a female character was the condition for commissioning the show. Louis-Dreyfus won the role over several other actresses who would also eventually enjoy their own TV success, including Patricia Heaton, Rosie O'Donnell and Megan Mullally. On the \\"Notes About Nothing\\" featurette on the DVD package, Seinfeld says that Louis-Dreyfus' ability to eat a peanut M&M without breaking the peanut aptly describes the actress: \\"She cracks you up without breaking your nuts.\\" Her performance on the series was met with critical acclaim, and she was a regular winner and nominee at television award shows throughout the 1990s. Her performance earned her two Golden Globe Award nominations, winning once in 1994, nine Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, winning one in 1995 and two in both 1997 and 1998, and seven American Comedy Awards, winning five times in 1993, 1994, 1995, 1997 and 1998. In 1996, she received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, an award she was nominated for on seven occasions from 1992 to 1998. After receiving the award, Louis-Dreyfus claimed the win was a \\"shocker\\", and that after being in both positions, it was \\"much better to win than to lose.\\" In 1998, Seinfeld decided to end the series after nine seasons. The series finale aired on May 14 and was one of the most watched TV events in history, with over 76 million people tuning in. During her time on Seinfeld she appeared in several films, including Fathers' Day, opposite Robin Williams and Billy Crystal, and Woody Allen's Oscar-nominated Deconstructing Harry.

The flight data recorder, retrieved along with the cockpit voice recorder earlier this month, showed Frenchman Remi Plesel was at the controls. Officials said it was common practice for the co-pilot to take charge. The plane was carrying 162 people from Surabaya to Singapore when it crashed. So far, 73 bodies have been recovered. Mardjono Siswosuwarno, head investigator of Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSB), said the flight data recorder had provided a \\"pretty clear picture\\" of what happened in the flight's last moments. Capt Plesel was in charge from take-off until the cockpit voice recording ends, he said, adding that this was common practice. Investigators said the plane ascended sharply before dropping, rising from 32,000ft (9,750m) to 37,400ft within 30 seconds, then dipping back to 32,000ft. The process took about three minutes. Mr Mardjono said the plane was \\"flying before the incident within the limits of its weight and balance envelope\\" and that the flight crew all had correct licences and medical certificates. A preliminary report has been submitted to the International Civil Aviation Organization, but has not been made public. The full report is likely to take about seven months, said the committee's chief Tatang Kurniadi. Earlier this week, the military announced it was stopping attempts to retrieve the fuselage from the seabed. Authorities had believed earlier that most of the missing bodies were still in the wreckage but now believe it is empty and too fragile to move. The civilian National Search and Rescue Agency said on Wednesday that it would continue search operations but their efforts could also end by next week if no more bodies are found.

Answer:","completion":"No, \\"run away from Kai\\" is not a valid answer given the question \\"What does Carson need to do before this?\\". In this context, Kai is in need of help, and Carson is showing a willingness to extend a helping hand. If Carson were to run away from Kai before offering assistance, it would contradict the statement that Carson helped Kai. Instead, a valid answer should reflect the steps that Carson should take in order to effectively provide the support Kai needs. For instance, before helping Kai, Carson might need to: 1. Observe Kai's situation closely: Carson should pay attention to Kai's struggles in order to pinpoint the specific areas where assistance is needed. Listening to Kai and empathizing with his challenges will enable Carson to offer more relevant and targeted help. 2. Assess his own capabilities: Prior to extending any help, Carson needs to evaluate his own skills and resources to ensure that he is in a position to genuinely support Kai. If not, Carson could seek additional resources or collaborate with others who might have the necessary expertise. 3. Approach Kai tactfully: Carson should consider how to best approach Kai, as some individuals may feel embarrassed or overwhelmed when confronted with their difficulties. A gentle, non-intrusive approach can facilitate an open conversation and help create a comfortable environment for assistance. 4. Offer support in a respectful manner: Instead of imposing unwanted help upon Kai, Carson should ask him if he would like assistance and how he can be of service. This respectful approach would allow Kai to maintain a sense of dignity and autonomy in the face of his struggles. 5. Develop a plan together: Once Carson and Kai have identified the areas where support is most needed, they can create a structured plan of action. Collaboration between the two individuals can foster mutual understanding and help define attainable goals for Kai to achieve.

Crash immediately begins calling Ebby by the degrading nickname of \\"Meat\\", and they get off to a rocky start.

Annie flirts with both Crash and Ebby and invites them to her house, but Crash walks out, saying he's too much a veteran to \\"try out\\" for anything. Before he leaves, Crash further sparks Annie's interest with a memorable speech listing the things he \\"believes in\\", ending with \\"I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last three days... Good night\\". Despite some animosity between them, Annie and Crash work, in their own ways, to shape Ebby into a big-league pitcher. Annie plays mild bondage games, reads poetry to him, and gets him to think in different ways (and gives him the nickname \\"Nuke\\"). Crash forces Nuke to learn \\"not to think\\" by letting the catcher make the pitching calls (memorably at two points telling the batters what pitch is coming after Nuke rejects his calls), and lectures him about the pressure of facing major league hitters who can hit his \\"heat\\" (fastballs).

Secondly, \\"The Making of a Major Leaguer\\" highlights the progression of Ebby \\"Nuke\\" Calvin LaLoosh's character, from a hotshot rookie with haphazard pitching, to a more composed and potentially dominant pitcher.

On August 3, 1981, the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization union—which had supported Reagan—rejected the government's pay raise offer and sent its 16,000 members out on strike to shut down the nation's commercial airlines. They demanded a reduction in the workweek to 32 from 40 hours, a 10,000 bonus, pay raises up to 40%, and early retirement. Federal law forbade such a strike, and the Transportation department implemented a backup plan to keep the system running. The strikers were given 48 hours to return to work, else they would be fired and banned from ever again working in a federal capacity. A fourth of the strikers came back to work, but 13,000 did not. The strike collapsed, PATCO vanished, and the union movement as a whole suffered a major reversal, which accelerated the decline of membership across the board in the private sector. Schulman and Zelizer argue that the breaking of PATCO, \\"sent shock waves through the entire U.S. labor relations regime.... strike rates plummeted, and union power sharply declined.\\" Unions suffered a continual decline of power during the Reagan administration, with a concomitant effect on wages. The average first-year raise fell from 9.8% to 1.2%; in manufacturing, raises fell from 7.2% to negative 1.2%. Salaries of unionized workers also fell relative to non-union workers.

Let me provide you with a more detailed breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"Where\\" can be translated as \\"Kde\\". 2. \\"the moonlight\\" can be translated as \\"měsíční svit\\". \\"Měsíční\\" means \\"moon\\" (as an adjective related to the moon), and \\"svit\\" means \\"light\\" or \\"shine\\". 3. \\"on\\" can be translated as \\"na\\". 4. \\"the Bosphorus\\" refers to the famous strait in Turkey, which is called \\"Bosporu\\" in Czech. 5. \\"is\\" can be translated as \\"je\\". In Czech, the verb \\"to be\\" (být) is used in the present tense as \\"je\\" for the third person singular conjugation. 6. \\"irresistible\\" can be translated as \\"neodolatelný\\". \\"Neodolatelný\\" is an adjective derived from the verb \\"odolat\\" (to resist), with the negation prefix \\"ne-\\" (not) and the suffix \\"-ný\\" to create an adjective meaning \\"not able to be resisted\\" or \\"irresistible\\". So, putting it all together, you get the Czech phrase: \\"Kde je měsíční svit na Bosporu neodolatelný?\\" It expresses the same meaning as the English phrase, asking for the location where the moonlight on the Bosphorus is irresistibly beautiful."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Why does a government which enjoys a comfortable majority in parliament behave like this? I asked Calin Tariceanu, president of the Senate and leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats (ALDE), a junior coalition partner in the government. A former prime minister, Mr Tariceanu admits that the government's actions and the way they have been communicated have been clumsy but he insists that they were well-intentioned. He rejects the perception, widely held in Romania and abroad, that the conflict is a battle between corrupt officials and a society fighting against corruption. \\"I regret having to say this, but the judiciary in Romania is not independent, and this is the clear issue which has to be addressed in the future.\\" He paints a picture of prosecutors, especially those from the National Anti-Corruption Directorate (DNA), running amok and teaming up with the secret services. Prosecutors work hand in hand with judges, he alleges, and infringe on the civil liberties of Romanian citizens in a way not seen since communist times. \\"The DNA and the intelligence services are now perceived as institutions which are not respecting the legal framework, are corrupt themselves, and are used as important leverage in the political fight in Romania,\\" he told the BBC. His argument is diametrically opposed to that of Laura Kovesi, head of the DNA, who insisted in a BBC interview on Saturday that the judiciary were independent and that her directorate prosecuted government and opposition figures alike. The DNA would have been crippled if the decree had come into force. One reason for the anger on the streets of Romania during the past days was the speed with which the government introduced the decree, with no chance for debate. The government will now rectify that, Mr Tariceanu said. The debate will be a wide one and civil society groups which have been active in the protests will also be invited to take part. Many of those taking part in the protests say the decree was tailor-made to get certain members of the present and past governments off the hook - most importantly the leader of the governing Social Democrats, Liviu Dragnea. He has already been convicted once for vote-rigging, and faces new corruption charges. \\"If no-one is protected by it [the decree], why shouldn't we withdraw it?\\" Calin Tariceanu told Mr Dragnea. \\"And show the people that we are open and sincere and very honest? We don't have any reason to protect anyone.\\" The 54-year-old Social Democrat leader pondered his words, then agreed to scrap the decree. On Sunday night, large crowds gathered again in Bucharest, to celebrate their victory and warn the government not to try to push through similar amendments in future. The government wants to persuade its supporters that this is a strategic retreat, not a surrender. At the same time, it will try to persuade the public, and the European Commission, that there is a real problem with the balance of powers between state institutions in Romania. And that the prosecutors, the judges and the secret services should be reined in. This article was about:","completion":"A government with a comfortable majority in the parliament may still act clumsily in its actions and communication due to several reasons, including an inaccurate assessment of public mood, internal disagreements, or responding to underlying political motivations. Such actions can sometimes be driven by conflicting interests among different members of the ruling coalition, diminishing the government's ability to act cohesively. Government officials might also attempt to protect aspects of their agenda that can hurt their image, such as individuals accused of corruption or other wrongdoings. In the case of Romania's government, Calin Tariceanu, president of the Senate, admitted that the government's actions were clumsy, but were well-intentioned. He argued that the judiciary in Romania is not independent and that the National Anti-Corruption Directorate (DNA) is working with secret services, infringing on the civil liberties of Romanian citizens. However, this position is in direct conflict with the DNA chief, Laura Kovesi, who insists the judiciary is independent. This debate highlights a crucial issue in Romania's balance of power between state institutions and the growing perception that the country is fighting corruption within its government ranks. Widespread anti-corruption protests erupted over the government's attempt to pass an emergency decree that would have weakened the DNA's ability to prosecute corrupt officials. Due to public pressure, the government withdrew the decree and promised to engage in a wider debate, inviting civil society groups to participate. In summary, governments with comfortable majorities in parliament do not necessarily engage in flawless behavior due to multiple factors, such as inaccurate assessments of the public opinion, internal disagreements within the coalition, or underlying political motivations. In Romania's case, the government's actions reveal a struggle between corrupt officials and society's attempts to fight corruption, and highlight the battle for maintaining an independent judiciary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: (A). Yes (B). No The answer is:","completion":"(B). No The correct answer to the question \\"what releases oxygen during the day but not during the night?\\" is not \\"elephants.\\" The question pertains to a process of releasing oxygen, which is related to photosynthesis. Blue pine, which you mentioned initially, is a type of plant or tree, that releases oxygen during the day through the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is a process where plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight, carbon dioxide (CO2), and water (H2O) into sugars and oxygen (O2). This process is essential as it helps remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and produce oxygen which is necessary for life on earth. During the day, when sunlight is available, photosynthetic organisms can perform this process and release oxygen as a byproduct. However, during the night, when sunlight is not available, photosynthesis comes to a halt, and plants do not release oxygen. Instead, they undergo a process called respiration, in which they consume some of the stored sugars to get energy and produce carbon dioxide as a byproduct. Elephants, on the other hand, are mammals and not photosynthetic organisms. As animals, they rely on cellular respiration to produce energy and release carbon dioxide as a byproduct, both during the day and night. They do not have the ability to perform photosynthesis and cannot release oxygen in any part of the day. In conclusion, the correct answer to your question is not elephants, as they do not possess the capability to release oxygen during the day similar to Blue pines or other photosynthetic organisms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would \\"Individual laboratories may have different reference ranges , and this is because the procedure may vary.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"Blood urea is a waste product formed in the liver as a result of protein metabolism. When proteins are broken down, they release nitrogen-containing compounds like ammonia. The liver converts ammonia into a less toxic substance called urea, which then circulates in the bloodstream. The kidneys filter blood and remove urea, excreting it in urine. Thus, blood urea is an indicator of both liver and kidney function. A measurement of blood urea is often performed as part of a routine blood test called blood urea nitrogen (BUN) test. The BUN test measures the amount of nitrogen in the blood that comes from urea. Abnormal levels might indicate a problem with liver function, kidney function, or dehydration. As for your statement, \\"Individual laboratories may have different reference ranges, and this is because the procedure may vary,\\" it is a reasonable assertion in the context of blood urea testing. It is true that different laboratories may have slightly different reference ranges for blood urea levels due to variations in their methods, equipment, and the population they serve. The reference ranges are determined based on the average values observed within a particular population, and they help doctors interpret the test results to make informed decisions about a patient's health. It is essential for healthcare providers to consider the reference ranges provided by the laboratory that processed the sample to determine whether the urea level is within a normal, healthy range. In conclusion, blood urea is a waste product generated during protein metabolism, and its measurement through the BUN test indicates liver and kidney function. Different laboratories may have slightly varying reference ranges due to procedural differences and the population they serve."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You may have also felt the muscles in your body jerk when this all happened. Did you ever wonder why? This falling sensation, together with a body movement known as a \\"sleep start\\", is what doctors and scientists call a myoclonic jerk, and it usually happens right before going into deeper stages of sleep. Here's why doctors think the falling feeling and myoclonic jerks happen. When you fall asleep, normally your body temperature goes down and your heart start to beat just a little slower. This is because your brain signals your body to relax to prepare for sleep. When your muscles are relaxed, you go into the very first stages of sleep, but you're not sleeping too deeply yet. This brain activity may cause your larger muscles to contract a little bit. In response, another part of your brain will make up a very quick mini-dream to go along with _ . You might think this would take a while, but your brain works so fast that it makes up the story almost at the same instant that your muscles jerk.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who died in 1917? from the following article ? Thomson was largely self-taught. His experiences as a graphic designer with Toronto's Grip Ltd. honed his draughtsmanship. Although he began painting and drawing at an early age, it was only in 1912, when he was well into his thirties, that he began to paint seriously. His first trips to Algonquin Park inspired him to follow the lead of fellow artists in producing oil sketches of natural scenes on small, rectangular panels for easy portability while travelling. Between 1912 and his death in 1917, Thomson produced hundreds of these small sketches, many of which are now considered works in their own right, and are mostly found in the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg and the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound.Thomson produced nearly all of his works between 1912 and 1917. Most of his large canvases were completed in his most productive period, from late 1916 to early 1917. The patronage of James MacCallum enabled Thomson's transition from graphic designer to professional painter. Although the Group of Seven was not founded until after his death, his work was sympathetic to that of group members A. Y. Jackson, Frederick Varley, and Arthur Lismer. These artists shared an appreciation for rugged, unkempt natural scenery, and all used broad brush strokes and a liberal application of paint to capture the beauty and colour of the Ontario landscape. Thomson's art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh. Other key influences were the Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, styles with which he became familiar while working in the graphic arts.

The scene is quite intense; I find myself in the midst of a terrifying bug infestation, with my friend Paige and me fighting for our lives. Swarming around us are these hideous, yet oddly fascinating creatures, which seem to be a mix of an insect and a reptile. Their horrific appearance, with a mixture of scales, shell-like exoskeletons, and bug-like pincers, only adds to the palpable sense of dread that envelopes us in this unnerving situation. As I valiantly battle these creatures, I can't help but observe their lifeblood's unusual characteristic - a viscous, jelly-like green substance that oozes out of their heads as they meet their demise. I first noticed this when I crushed a bug's skull using a large stone; the head broke open like a particularly fragile cheese, leaving a ghastly mess that took all of my willpower not to retch at. The sight and the grumpy, guttural sound the creature produced were both indicators that it had breathed its last. Despite the urgency of the situation, I couldn't help but speculate about the alien biology of these creatures, so different from anything we had ever encountered. The green blood must have a purpose, or perhaps it indicates a completely unconventional biological system operating within their bodies. However, I had no time to dwell on these thoughts, as the priority at that moment was to save Paige. Upon killing the first bug, I immediately turned my attention to her. My heart raced as I saw that one of the bugs had caught up to her, its pincers perilously close to her, threatening to inflict unimaginable pain, and possibly even death. Fueled by adrenaline, I sprinted towards her, gripping the stone tightly, my eyes fixed on the repulsive creature looming over her. As I neared the pair, I realized that there was not just one, but rather two bugs posing a mortal threat to Paige. This harrowing realization only strengthened my resolve, and I swung the stone at the second bug, praying that my energy would hold out long enough to save my dear friend. The force with which the stone struck the bug was immense, and the aftermath was just as gruesome as the first - a burst of green, jelly-like blood splattering through the air, accompanied by that all too familiar grumpy sound that was beginning to become etched in my mind. With one bug down, I immediately turned to the remaining threat, my heart pounding in my chest, the lethal pincers now just inches away from Paige's delicate skin. With a surge of unbridled fury channeled into the stone, I swung once more, hoping against hope that this final effort would be enough to save her from these monstrous creatures. As the stone collided with the final bug, an intricate story of survival and friendship unfolded, underscoring the lengths to which we would go to protect those we love. The day's events would not be easily forgotten, and the images of grotesque creatures with their green, viscous blood would haunt our dreams for many a night to come. Nonetheless, we had persevered in the face of unimaginable horror, our bond only growing stronger as a result."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Marcus admits that he used unstable \\"protomatter\\" in the development of the Genesis Device, causing Spock to age rapidly and meaning the planet will be destroyed within hours. Meanwhile, Kruge (Christopher Lloyd), the commander of a Klingon vessel, intercepts information about Genesis. Believing the device to be potentially useful as a weapon, he takes his cloaked ship to the Genesis planet, destroys the Grissom, and takes hostage Marcus, Saavik, and Spock. Spock's father, Sarek (Mark Lenard), confronts Kirk about his son's death. The pair learn that before he died, Spock transferred his katra, or living spirit, to McCoy. Spock's katra and body are needed to lay him to rest on his homeworld, Vulcan, and without help, McCoy will die from carrying the katra. Disobeying orders, Kirk and his officers spring McCoy from detention, disable the USS Excelsior, and steal the Enterprise from Spacedock to return to the Genesis planet to retrieve...

Premise: \\"Determine Who Had Highest Retirement Income; Aged Population Nearly Doubles From Today as a Share\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The aged population has higher retirement incomes because of an increase in the stock market.\\" true?","completion":"Alright, let's break down this idea so it's easy to understand. The premise you shared talks about two things: 1. We want to find out who has the highest retirement income. Retirement income is the money people receive after they stop working when they're older. 2. The aged population, which means the number of older people, will become almost twice as many as there are now. The hypothesis, or the guess you want to check, is \\"The aged population has higher retirement incomes because of an increase in the stock market.\\" This means you think that older people have more money to live after they stop working because the stock market is doing well. It's important to know that the stock market is a place where people buy and sell little parts of companies (called stocks). When the stock market goes up, the value of those little parts of companies also goes up, which means people make money. Now, to figure out if your hypothesis is true, we would need to look at information about how the stock market affects the retirement income of older people. If we find that older people are getting more money from their retirement because the stock market is doing well, your guess might be right. If not, then there might be other reasons for the changes in retirement incomes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Question: Whose neighbour is Walter Seznick? Movie title: The 'Burbs Movie plot: On Mayfield Place, a cul-de-sac in the fictional suburban town of Hinkley Hills, Ray Peterson is trying to learn more about his mysterious new next-door neighbors, the Klopeks. Art Weingartner, the Petersons' other next-door neighbor, believes the Klopeks are murderers. Ray, Art, and veteran Lt. Mark Rumsfield watch Hans Klopek drive his car from the garage to the curb, then carry a large garbage bag from the trunk to the garbage can and bang it with a hoe. During the night, Ray watches the Klopeks digging in their back yard with pick-axes in a rainstorm. The following morning, Art checks the contents of the garbage truck as it is collecting the Klopeks' can. He is joined by Rumsfield and Ray, but they find no human remains. Bonnie Rumsfield finds neighbor Walter Seznick's dog running loose and wonders if Walter went away. Ray, Art, Bonnie and Ricky Butler go to Walter's house, finding his toupee in the kitchen. Ray collects the dog and leaves a note for Walter explaining the situation. The following night, Ray and Art have a meeting in the Petersons' basement and theorize about Walter's disappearance. Carol, Ray's wife, grows tired of her friends snooping around the Klopeks' home and she requests that she, Ray, and the Rumsfields pay the Klopeks a visit, meeting Hans, Reuben, and Werner while Art peeks around in the backyard. Later that evening, Ray reveals to Art and Rumsfield that he found Walter's toupee in the Klopeks' basement, which he previously slipped through Walter's mailslot. Ray and the others are convinced the Klopeks have murdered Walter, and the trio agree to investigate the Klopeks' backyard when the owners leave in the morning. The next day, Carol and son Dave go to visit Carol's sister, leaving Ray to explore the Klopeks' place. After Art disables the Klopeks' security system, he and Ray enter the yard and begin digging while Rumsfield stands guard on his roof. After hours of digging and finding nothing, Ray and Art enter the house, where they discover what they believe to be a crematorium.... Answer:","completion":"Walter Seznick is Ray Peterson's neighbor in the movie titled \\"The 'Burbs.\\" The movie's plot revolves around the mysterious new neighbors, the Klopeks, who move in next to Ray, and the increasing suspicion that they may be involved in criminal activities. This suspicion is fueled by Art Weingartner, Ray's other next-door neighbor, who believes that the Klopeks are murderers. Throughout the movie, the neighborhood residents, including Ray, Art, and Lt. Mark Rumsfield, become increasingly convinced that the Klopeks have murdered Walter Seznick, another neighbor, due to his sudden disappearance and the subsequent discovery of his toupee in the Klopeks' home. This leads to a series of investigations and snooping by the neighbors as they try to find evidence of foul play. Additionally, strange behavior exhibited by the Klopeks, such as digging in their yard during a rainstorm, adds to the mystery and growing concern among the neighbors. The tension builds as the neighbors, with Ray at the forefront, become more persistent and daring in their attempts to uncover the truth about the Klopeks. They take considerable risks in their pursuit, including disabling their security system, breaking into their home, and conducting an extensive search of the Klopeks' yard, believing that they would find human remains or evidence of Walter's murder. The movie plays with the themes of suburban paranoia, sensationalism, and the fear of the unknown, as well as offering a critique of how easily people can become suspicious of their neighbors based on limited information and a preconceived notion of what constitutes \\"normal\\" behavior. In conclusion, Walter Seznick is a neighbor of Ray Peterson, the main character in the movie \\"The 'Burbs.\\" His mysterious disappearance and the circumstantial evidence found in the Klopeks' home become key plot drivers in a tale that explores themes of paranoia, fear of the unknown, and the potential dangers that may lurk beneath the surface of an ostensibly quiet suburban neighborhood.

The motion seeking a stay of execution cites questions over the state's lethal injection protocol. The Supreme Court did not immediately issue a ruling on the petition. The appeals court's earlier ruling overturned U.S. District Court Judge Nanette Laughrey, who held that the Missouri Department of Corrections \\"has not provided any information about the certification, inspection history, infraction history, or other aspects of the compounding pharmacy or of the person compounding the drug.\\" She noted that the execution protocol, which has changed repeatedly, \\"has been a frustratingly moving target.\\" The state's death warrant for Franklin allows the execution to be carried out anytime Wednesday. After Laughrey ruled in his favor, Franklin's attorney, Jennifer Herndon, said Franklin's mental illness was likely keeping him from comprehending the developments. Franklin, 63, was convicted of seven other murders, but the Missouri case was the only one resulting in a death sentence. Franklin also has admitted to shooting and wounding civil rights leader Vernon Jordan and Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt, who has been paralyzed from the waist down since the attack in 1978. Like other states, Missouri long had used a three-drug execution method. Drugmakers stopped selling those drugs to prisons and corrections departments, so in April 2012 Missouri announced a new one-drug execution protocol using propofol. The state planned to use propofol for an execution last month. But Gov. Jay Nixon ordered the Missouri Department of Corrections to come up with a new drug after an outcry from the medical profession over planned use of the popular anesthetic in an execution. Most propofol is made in Europe, and the European Union had threatened to limit exports of it. The corrections department turned to pentobarbital made through a compounding pharmacy. Few details have been made public about the compounding pharmacy, because state law provides privacy for parties associated with executions. Missouri has joined other states in choosing pentobarbital as the drug of choice. Texas switched to a lethal, single dose of the sedative pentobarbital in 2012. South Dakota has carried out two executions using the sedative from a compounding pharmacy. Georgia has said it's also taking that route. Franklin was in his mid-20s when he began drifting across the country. He bombed a synagogue in Chattanooga, Tenn., in July 1977. No one was hurt, but soon, the killings began. He arrived in the St. Louis area in October 1977 and picked out the Brith Sholom Kneseth Israel synagogue from the Yellow Pages. He fired five shots at the parking lot in Richmond Heights after a bar mitzvah on Oct. 8, 1977. One struck and killed Gerald Gordon, a 42-year-old father of three. Franklin got away. His killing spree continued another three years. Several of his victims were interracial couples. He also shot and killed, among others, two black children in Cincinnati, three female hitchhikers and a white 15-year-old prostitute, with whom he was angry because the girl had sex with black men. He finally stumbled after killing two young black men in Salt Lake City in August 1980. He was arrested a month later in Kentucky, briefly escaped, and was captured for good a month after that in Florida. Overall, Franklin was convicted of eight murders: two in Madison, Wis., two in Cincinnati, two in Salt Lake City, one in Chattanooga, Tenn., and the one in St. Louis County. Years later, in federal prison, Franklin admitted to several crimes, including the St. Louis County killing. He was sentenced to death in 1997. In an interview with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Monday, Franklin insisted he no longer hates blacks or Jews. While he was held at St. Louis County Jail, he said he interacted with blacks at the jail, \\"and I saw they were people just like us.\\" He has made similar statements to other media but has denied repeated interview requests from The Associated Press. Herndon said Franklin's reasoning exemplified his mental illness: Franklin told her the digits of the AP's St. Louis office phone number added up to what he called an \\"unlucky number,\\" so he refused to call it. ||||| HANDOUT/REUTERS A combination photo shows Joseph Paul Franklin, who has been convicted of killing eight people from the late 1970s to 1980 in racially motivated attacks, in booking photos provided by the Missouri Department of Corrections taken in (L-R) 2005, 2007 and 2012. ST. LOUIS — A federal judge in Missouri on Tuesday granted a stay of execution to white supremacist serial killer Joseph Paul Franklin just hours before his scheduled death, citing concerns over the state’s new execution method. U.S. District Court Judge Nanette Laughrey ruled that a lawsuit filed by Franklin and 20 other death row inmates challenging Missouri’s execution protocol must be resolved before he is put to death. The 14-page ruling criticizes the timing of the state’s changes to how it carries out capital punishment, specifically its plan to use for the first time a single drug, pentobarbital. It also takes issue with a plan to acquire the drug from a compounding pharmacy. Laughrey wrote that the Missouri Department of Corrections “has not provided any information about the certification, inspection history, infraction history, or other aspects of the compounding pharmacy or of the person compounding the drug.” She noted that the execution protocol, which has changed repeatedly, “has been a frustratingly moving target.” It wasn’t immediately clear whether the state would appeal the ruling. Messages left with the state attorney general’s office were not returned. If a federal appeals court or the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Laughrey’s ruling, the execution could go forward. Franklin’s attorney, Jennifer Herndon, said the execution warrant allows it to be carried out anytime Wednesday. Herndon said Franklin, who has been diagnosed as mentally ill, didn’t seem to fully understand the stay. “He was happy,” she said. “I’m not really convinced that he totally understands that he was going to die.” Franklin, 63, was convicted of seven other murders, but the Missouri case was the only one resulting in a death sentence. Franklin also has admitted to shooting and wounding civil rights leader Vernon Jordan and Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt, who has been paralyzed from the waist down since the attack in 1978.

Anonymous/AP Joseph Paul Franklin is shown following his conviction on two counts of first degree murder in Salt Lake City in June 1981. “Throughout this litigation, the details of the execution protocol have been illusive at best,” Laughrey wrote. “It is clear from the procedural history of this case that through no fault of his own, Franklin could not resolve his claims without a stay of his scheduled execution date.” She added: “Franklin has been afforded no time to research the risk of pain associated with the Department’s new protocol, the quality of the pentobarbital provided, and the record of the source of the pentobarbital.” Nixon spokesman Scott Holste had no immediate comment about the ruling.

When she got home she put one bag of ice in the sink and another in the freezer, but then was distracted by a phone call and forgot to put the other bag in the freezer. When she returned, the bag of ice had melted. Thomas is a research assistant and has taken samples of rat liver enzymes that need to be stored overnight. He places one in refrigerated storage, but forgot one and left it out on the counter top. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which sample will be viable for longer, the one on the counter top or the one in refrigerated storage? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The sample that will be viable for longer is the one in refrigerated storage. To understand why this is the case, we need to consider the effects of temperature on samples and their ability to maintain their integrity and viability. When comparing the melted ice in Susan's story to Thomas's rat liver enzyme samples, the key factor is the temperature at which they are stored. In Susan's case, the bag of ice that was left out at room temperature melted, while the one in the freezer and the one in the sink (with presumably cold water) remained in a more solid state. This is because the temperature of the freezer and the cold water in the sink were low enough to keep the ice from melting. The bag of ice left out at room temperature melted because it was exposed to warmer conditions, and the solid state of the ice could not be maintained. As for Thomas's rat liver enzyme samples, the one that he placed in refrigerated storage will be viable for a longer period of time compared to the one left out on the countertop. This is due to the fact that enzymes, like most proteins, are sensitive to temperature changes. Enzymes function optimally within a certain temperature range, and exposure to temperatures outside of this optimal range can lead to a loss of functionality and stability, affecting the overall viability of the sample. By placing the first sample in refrigerated storage, Thomas is ensuring that the sample is maintained at a stable, low temperature that is conducive to preserving the integrity and function of the enzymes. In contrast, the sample left out on the countertop will be exposed to higher temperatures and fluctuations in temperature, which may result in the sample losing its activity and rendering it less viable. It is clear from these explanations that the sample placed in refrigerated storage will be viable for a longer duration, as it is being kept within a more controlled and suitable environment for the preservation of the enzymes being studied."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After closing Indra due to noise complaints, he moved them to the Kaiserkeller in October. When he learned they had been performing at the rival Top Ten Club in breach of their contract, he gave the band one month's termination notice, and reported the underage Harrison, who had obtained permission to stay in Hamburg by lying to the German authorities about his age. The authorities arranged for Harrison's deportation in late November. One week later, Koschmider had McCartney and Best arrested for arson after they set fire to a condom in a concrete corridor; the authorities deported them. Lennon returned to Liverpool in early December, while Sutcliffe remained in Hamburg until late February with his German fiancée Astrid Kirchherr, who took the first semi-professional photos of the Beatles.During the next two years, the Beatles were resident for periods in Hamburg, where they used Preludin both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances.

This is not some crazy future concept -- this is a real vehicle, fully electric, and on sale now. Prices for the Twizy start at PS6,690, with battery hire from PS45 a month. But is it a car? Technically no, it' s classified under UK law as something closer to a moped . A two-seater (the passenger sits behind the driver), the Twizy runs on electric power only, and is designed to cover all those little trips we do. And as 87 percent of Europe's drivers do less than 37 miles a day -- 50 per cent less than 12--there's really no need to be burning gas for that sort of journey. The Twizy is arguably the most unusual vehicle in this country. Other cars have been beautifully designed, others have been small, but no car has turned motoring on its head in quite the same way. The Twizy's batteries have a range of 62 miles, and it plugs into a standard socket like any other electrical equipment, going from flat to full power in three and a half hours. There are no full doors on the vehicle, so think of it like a covered moped with four wheels, but no noise and no need for a helmet. There's also a lower-powered type being designed, the Twizy 45, for which you don' t need a license. Seeing the Twizy in the flesh, you' re surprised by how striking it looks.

The ideal weight is one that allows you to do one set of eight to 12 repetitions. Your muscle or muscle group should feel very fatigued at the end of the session. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: (1). While it is true that a weight too heavy may cause unnecessary fatigue and isn't effective for building muscle strength, this option wrongly suggests that lifting too much weight can lose muscle mass. Lifting heavy weights may lead to muscle fatigue, but it's not ideal for gradual muscle strength improvement when starting. (3).

It is located on the western side of the country, where it comprises most of the wide and inhospitable Thar Desert (also known as the \\"Rajasthan Desert\\" and \\"Great Indian Desert\\") and shares a border with the Pakistani provinces of Punjab to the northwest and Sindh to the west, along the Sutlej-Indus river valley. Elsewhere it is bordered by the other Indian states: Punjab to the north; Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to the northeast; Madhya Pradesh to the southeast; and Gujarat to the southwest. Rajasthan is an economically backward region of India and has the highest percentage of unemployed youth in North India. Rajasthan is divided into 9 regions; Ajmer State, Hadoti, Dhundhar, Gorwar, Shekhawati, Mewar, Marwar, Vagad and Mewat which are equally rich in its heritage and artistic contribution.

As minors are generally excluded, the concept is frequently described as \\"universal adult suffrage\\". Many countries make an exception for small numbers of adults that are considered mentally incapable of voting. Other countries also exclude people convicted of serious crimes or people in jail, but this is considered a violation of a basic human right in an increasing number of countries. In some countries, including the United States, it is very difficult and expensive for convicted criminals to regain this right even after having served their jail sentence. In any case, where universal suffrage exists, the right to vote is not restricted by race, sex, belief, wealth, or social status. - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia.

On 8 August 1940, a statement was made by Viceroy Lord Linlithgow about the expansion of the Governor-General's Executive Council and the establishment of a War Advisory Council. This offer, known as the August Offer, included giving full weight to minority opinions and allowing Indians to draft their own constitution. Under the Cabinet Mission Plan of 1946, elections were held for the first time for the Constituent Assembly. The Constitution of India was drafted by the Constituent Assembly, and it was implemented under the Cabinet Mission Plan on 16 May 1946.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Gothic fiction, which is largely known by the subgenre of Gothic horror, is a genre or mode of literature and film that combines fiction and horror, death, and at times romance. Its origin is attributed to English author Horace Walpole, with his 1764 novel \\"The Castle of Otranto\\", subtitled (in its second edition) \\"A Gothic Story.\\" The effect of Gothic fiction feeds on a pleasing sort of terror, an extension of Romantic literary pleasures that were relatively new at the time of Walpole's novel. It originated in England in the second half of the 18th century and had much success in the 19th, as witnessed by Mary Shelleys \\"Frankenstein\\" and the works of Edgar Allan Poe. Another well known novel in this genre, dating from the late Victorian era, is Bram Stokers \\"Dracula\\". The name \\"Gothic\\" refers to the (pseudo)-medieval buildings, emulating Gothic architecture, in which many of these stories take place. This extreme form of romanticism was very popular in England and Germany. The English Gothic novel also led to new novel types such as the German \\"Schauerroman\\" and the French \\"Georgia\\". - Ragnhild Westgaard Sigland (born November 13, 1976), mostly known by her stage name Nell Sigland, is a Norwegian singer from Hamar, best known as the lead vocalist of Norwegian gothic metal band Theatre of Tragedy as a replacement for Liv Kristine, from June 3, 2004 to October 2, 2010. She was also the lead singer for Norwegian gothic rock band The Crest, founded by her husband Kristian Sigland and herself. - Liv Kristine Espenæs (born 14 February 1976 in Stavanger, Norway), better known as Liv Kristine, is a singer/songwriter who has performed and composed songs mostly for various subgenres of heavy metal music. She is known for her work in close association with her then-husband and leader of the German band Atrocity, Alexander Krull. She started her career in the music industry as a vocalist for the gothic metal band Theatre of Tragedy, and is the former lead vocalist for the symphonic metal band Leaves' Eyes. - Storm is the sixth studio album by the Norwegian gothic metal band Theatre of Tragedy , released in March 2006 . It is the band 's first album with a new lead singer Nell Sigland . The song \`\` Storm '' was released as the album 's only single . The album shows something of a return to gothic metal , although its sound is much lighter and more upbeat than that of earlier albums and it still uses modern English lyrics . The band embarked on a European tour to support the release . The cover art was designed by Thomas Ewerhard , who also made the covers for Assembly and Forever Is The World . The song \`\` Senseless '' was originally titled \`\` Seven '' , as it is written in septuple meter and is the seventh track on the album . - Gothic rock (also referred to as goth rock or simply goth) is a musical subgenre of post-punk and alternative rock that formed during the late 1970s. Gothic rock bands grew from the strong ties they had to the English punk rock and emerging post-punk scenes. Proto-gothic bands include Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division, Bauhaus and the Cure. - Stavanger is a city and municipality in Norway. The city is the third-largest urban zone and metropolitan area in Norway (through conurbation with neighbouring Sandnes) and the administrative centre of Rogaland county. The municipality is the fourth most populous in Norway. Located on the Stavanger Peninsula in Southwest Norway, Stavanger counts its official founding year as 1125, the year the Stavanger Cathedral was completed. Stavanger's core is to a large degree 18th- and 19th-century wooden houses that are protected and considered part of the city's cultural heritage. This has caused the town centre and inner city to retain a small-town character with an unusually high ratio of detached houses, and has contributed significantly to spreading the city's population growth to outlying parts of Greater Stavanger. - Gothic metal (or goth metal) is a fusion genre combining the heaviness of heavy metal with the dark atmospheres of gothic rock. The music of gothic metal is diverse with bands known to adopt the gothic approach to different styles of heavy metal music. The genre originated during the early 1990s in Europe originally as an outgrowth of death-doom, a fusion of death metal and doom metal. Lyrics are generally dark and introspective with inspiration from gothic fiction as well as personal experiences. - Death-doom is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal. It combines the slow tempos and pessimistic or depressive mood of doom metal with the deep growling vocals and double kick drumming of death metal. The genre emerged in the mid-1980s and gained a certain amount of popularity during the 1990s, but had become less common by the turn of the 21st century. In turn, death/doom gave rise to the closely related genre of funeral doom as well as to the more melodic and romantic gothic metal. - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre. - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. - Theatre of Tragedy was a Norwegian band from Stavanger, active between 1993 and 2010.

Write a summary based on this article: NEW YORK (AP) — New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady can suit up for his team's season opener after a judge erased his four-game suspension for \\"Deflategate.\\" The surprise ruling by U.S. District Judge Richard Berman came Thursday after more than one month of failed settlement talks between the NFL and its players' union. Many legal experts believed the judge was merely pressuring the sides to settle when he criticized the NFL's handling of the case at two hearings in August. But the judge wasn't posturing. He came out forcefully in Brady's favor, maligning the NFL for its handling of the scandal that erupted after the AFC championship game in January, when officials discovered during the first half that Brady used underinflated footballs. New England beat the Indianapolis Colts 45-7 then won the Super Bowl two weeks later. An NFL investigation led to Brady's suspension, which Commissioner Roger Goodell upheld. ___ AP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL ||||| Tom Brady’s decision to take the Deflategate scandal to federal court has paid off, with US district judge Richard Berman ruling that the New England Patriots quarterback’s suspension should be nullified after the NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, had dispensed “his own brand of industrial justice”. RIP (hopefully) Deflategate: a saga that made everyone look stupid Read more Brady had been suspended for the first four games of the NFL season after a report, conducted by investigator Ted Wells, found that he was “generally aware” that Patriots officials deliberately deflated footballs during the team’s victory over the Indianapolis Colts in last season’s AFC Championship game. When Brady appealed to the league against the suspension Goodell upheld the ban in July and said that Brady had deliberately destroyed his cell phone after it had been requested by Wells and his staff. Following the Goodell’s ruling, Brady took the case to federal court. However, Berman ruled that the NFL had gone too far in its punishment of Brady and the suspension was “premised upon several significant legal deficiencies”. The judge also said Brady had no notice that he could receive a ban for participating in, or being aware of, ball deflation. “Because there was no notice of a four-game suspension in the circumstances presented here, Commissioner Goodell may be said to have ‘dispensed his own brand of industrial justice,”’ Berman ruled. “Brady also had no notice that his discipline would be the equivalent of the discipline imposed upon a player who used performance enhancing drugs,” the judge added. Concussion: Will NFL sanitize history with brain trauma biopic? Read more Goodell has confirmed that the league will appeal against Berman’s decision. “We are grateful to Judge Berman for hearing this matter, but respectfully disagree with today’s decision,” Goodell said. “We will appeal today’s ruling in order to uphold the collectively bargained responsibility to protect the integrity of the game. The commissioner’s responsibility to secure the competitive fairness of our game is a paramount principle, and the league and our 32 clubs will continue to pursue a path to that end.” The Patriots owner, Robert Kraft, was bullish as he welcomed the news that Brady will be available for the entire season. “As I have said during this process and throughout his Patriots career, Tom Brady is a classy person of the highest integrity. He represents everything that is great about this game and this league,” said Kraft. “Yet, with absolutely no evidence of any actions of wrongdoing by Tom in the Wells report, the lawyers at the league still insisted on imposing and defending unwarranted and unprecedented discipline. Judge Richard Berman understood this and we are greatly appreciative of his thoughtful decision that was delivered today. Now, we can return our focus to the game on the field.” Brady has vehemently maintained his innocence over the incident. “I will not allow my unfair discipline to become a precedent for other NFL players without a fight,” he said before taking his case to federal court. Negotiations between the league and Brady, represented by the NFL players’ union, lasted for a month but the two parties failed to reach a settlement. The decision is a surprise to many, and that could include Brady himself who was reportedly willing to take a reduced suspension of one game. “The rights of Tom Brady and of all NFL players under the collective bargaining agreement were affirmed today by a Federal Judge in a court of the NFL’s choosing. We thank Judge Berman for his time, careful consideration of the issue and fair and just result,” NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith said in a statement. “This decision should prove, once and for all, that our collective bargaining agreement does not grant this commissioner the authority to be unfair, arbitrary and misleading. While the CBA grants the person who occupies the position of commissioner the ability to judiciously and fairly exercise the designated power of that position, the union did not agree to attempts to unfairly, illegally exercise that power, contrary to what the NFL has repeatedly and wrongfully claimed. “We are happy for the victory of the rule of law for our players and our fans. This court’s decision to overturn the NFL commissioner again should signal to every NFL owner that collective bargaining is better than legal losses. Collective bargaining is a much better process that will lead to far better results.” Brady will now be available for the Patriots’ season opener against the Pittsburgh Steelers on 10 September. Before the decision came in the Patriots had been expected to start with Jimmy Garoppolo, who had failed to stand out in his pre-season performances. The news was quickly welcomed by Brady’s team-mates with Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski tweeting his delight: Rob Gronkowski (@RobGronkowski) Let's go! This season to be one heck of another ride!! #PatsNation pic.twitter.com/vFZ1vmBxAq Brady is one of the greatest quarterbacks to have played in the NFL, and has won four Super Bowls with the Patriots. He has also been named league MVP twice and selected for the Pro Bowl 10 times.

By bringing a charged object into contact with an uncharged object, some electrons will migrate to even out the charge on both objects. Charging by conduction gives the previously uncharged object a permanent charge. An uncharged object can also be charged using a method called charging by induction . This process allows a change in charge without actually touching the charged and uncharged objects to each other. Imagine a negatively charged rod held near the knob, but not touching. If we place a finger on the knob, some of the electrons will escape into our body, instead of down the stem and into the leaves. When both our finger and the negatively charged rod are removed, the previously uncharged electroscope now has a slight positive charge. It was charged by induction. Notice that charging by induction causes the newly charged object to have the opposite charge as the originally charged object, while charging by conduction gives them both the same charge. John wanted to charge his electronic gadgets remotely. To that end, he first conducted two experiments, case A and case B. In case A he used conduction, and in case B he used induction. In both cases he used same two objects. Finally, John tried to charge his phone remotely. He called this test as case C. In which case the objects would be closer to each other, case A or case B? A:","completion":"In the scenarios described, the objects would be closer to each other in case A, where John used conduction for charging. This is because, in charging by conduction, the charged object must physically touch the uncharged object to transfer electrons and even out the charge on both objects. This direct contact is necessary for successful charging to occur. On the other hand, in case B, where John used induction for charging, the objects do not need to touch each other. Charging by induction is achieved merely by bringing the charged object close to the uncharged object, allowing a redistribution of electrons within the uncharged object, without any physical contact between the two objects. Therefore, in case B, the objects would be at a greater distance from each other compared to case A."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A series of interweaving stories tell the journey of a handgun — specifically, a .38 special revolver — as it passes from one owner to another. In all the time it passes between its various owners, it is never actually fired (aside from the one test-firing it underwent at the factory) and is never shown actually to discharge any ammunition.The opening credits run over scenes of the manufacture of the weapon. It is shipped to a gun store, where it is purchased by an older business owner whose home was recently burglarized.

She had several siblings, including sisters Amy and Christie, both of whom subsequently became singers. The family migrated to Australia when Florence was a child. She worked as a governess while undertaking studies in art, and first took classes at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School in 1883, then again for a further term of study in 1888.

He died aged 42 after mistakes by Wythenshawe Hospital consultants, an inquest heard. A father-of-two died of a heart infection after doctors missed three chances to save him, an inquest has heard. Stephen Avery, 42, could have lived if doctors had put him on antibiotics just 48 hours sooner, it was said. But, despite displaying the telltale symptoms of infection, consultants at Wythenshawe Hospital missed three opportunities to treat the taxi-driver and former local football team manager and coach. At his inquest in Manchester, heart expert Professor Keith Channer condemned the decisions made by hospital staff. Describing. Dr Channer’s evidence as ‘compelling’, coroner Nigel Meadows said: 'An. appropriate physician should have been able to recognise the symptoms as. indicated. Had antibiotics started 48 hours before he probably would. not have died.' Mr Avery, from Crossacres, Wythenshawe, first visited his GP in October 2011, suffering broken sleep, night sweats and lethargy. He was diagnosed with a chest infection, and prescribed antibiotics. But his symptoms worsened after a brief improvement, prompting further antibiotics and a referral. Then at Wythenshawe Hospital on May 1, 2012, Dr Paul Sanders, consultant rheumatologist, recognised his symptoms as indicating a heart infection, but after tests, failed to diagnose him. On his return on May 11, Dr Keith Harkins, consultant physician, again suspected Mr Avery had a heart infection, but stopped his GP-prescribed antibiotics to carry out tests, including a heart scan. Due to a system failure, the scan order never reached the right department. Mr Avery with mother Maureen, wife Jennifer, 44, daughter Phoebe, now 14, son Dominic, now 18. If the popular father had had antibiotics started 48 hours before he probably would not have died, it was said. On May 14, yet another consultant. re-ordered the scan urgently, but when his condition was finally. diagnosed the next day, and an antibiotics drip was started, it was too. late. He suffered a cardiac arrest and died on May 15. Coroner. Nigel Meadows said Mr Avery, who had a congenital condition which made. him more susceptible to infection, died of endocarditis. Coroner Nigel Meadows said Mr Avery, who had a congenital condition which made him more susceptible to infection, died of endocarditis. He said contributory factors were ‘significant failures’ on May 1 and. May 11 to recognise his symptoms and failure to start the right. antibiotics drip by the 12th. He said if the young father had the right scan, diagnosis and treatment earlier, he probably would have survived. Recording a narrative verdict, Mr Meadows added: 'These medical practitioners are bound to reflect upon their involvement but at the time they thought they were making the right judgements. 'But they were not judgements that were well-founded.' Popular and well-liked Mr Avery lived in Stockport and worked for Wythenshawe’s Club Cars. More than 800 people attended his funeral and he left behind wife Jennifer and children Dominic, 18, and Phoebe, 14. After the hearing his wife, 44, said: 'Wythenshawe Hospital has not only let our family down but they have let our entire community down. 'Stephen was a wonderful family man but also so well-known and loved in the community. 'The findings of the inquest have confirmed the family’s view that Stephen’s death could and should have been avoided if only he had been provided with appropriate and prompt clinical care and management during his time in hospital.' A University Hospital of South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust spokesman said: 'We would like to offer our sincere condolences to the family of Mr Avery following their very sad loss. 'The trust has reflected on its practice following its investigation to understand what lessons can be learned. 'We will also give full and careful consideration to the comments and feedback from the coroner.' Infective endocarditis is an infection that can seriously damage the heart valves and cause other serious complications if not treated quickly with antibiotics. After someone has suffered from the infection they often require surgery to repair or replace damaged heart valves. It is an infection that affects some parts of the endocardium - the tissue that lines the inside of the heart chambers. The infection usually involves one or more of the heart valves which are part of the endocardium - it is serious and life-threatening. Most cases are caused by a bacterial infection and usually occur in a person who has an infection or a wound in another part of the body. People who inject street drugs are also at greater risk as they can also inject bacteria into their bloodstream if they use dirty needles. In the UK, endocarditis occurs in about 20 in a million people each year. It is most common in people with heart valve problems, have had heart valve surgery, have congenital heart defects or who have a poor immune system. Symptoms include feeling generally unwell, having aches and pains, tiredness, fever and loss of appetite.

He went to the hospital because he was feeling really sick and had a lot of symptoms like not being able to sleep well, sweating at night, and feeling very tired. The doctors at the hospital didn't figure out what was wrong with him, and they didn't give him the medicine he needed in time to save his life. If they had given him the medicine sooner, he might have lived. The doctors missed a few chances to help him, and because of that, he got much sicker and eventually passed away.

This article: By the 18th century, the menagerie was open to the public; admission cost three half-pence or the supply of a cat or dog to be fed to the lions. By the end of the century, that had increased to 9 pence. A particularly famous inhabitant was Old Martin, a large grizzly bear given to George III by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1811. An 1800 inventory also listed a tiger, leopards, a hyena, a large baboon, various types of monkeys, wolves and \\"other animals\\". By 1822, however, the collection included only a grizzly bear, an elephant and some birds. Additional animals were then introduced. In 1828 there were over 280 representing at least 60 species as the new keeper Alfred Copps was actively acquiring animals.After the death of George IV in 1830, a decision was made to close down the Menagerie. In 1831, most of the stock was moved to the London Zoo which had opened in 1828. The last of the animals left in 1835, relocated to Regent's Park. This decision was made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had been bitten by a monkey. The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequently, even though the animals had long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until the death of Copps, the last keeper, in 1853.In 1999, physical evidence of lion cages was found, one being 2x3 metres (6.5x10 feet) in size, very small for a lion that can grow to be 2.5 meters (approximately 8 feet) long. In 2008, the skulls of two male Barbary lions (now extinct in the wild) from northwest Africa were found in the moat area of the Tower. Radiocarbon tests dated them from 1280–1385 and 1420–1480.

Port Ellen is the main port. - Buckwheat (\\"Fagopyrum esculentum\\") is a plant cultivated for its grain-like seeds and as a cover crop. To distinguish it from a related species, \\"Fagopyrum tataricum\\", it is also known as Japanese buckwheat and silverhull buckwheat. - Barley (\\"Hordeum vulgare\\" L.), a member of the grass family, is a major cereal grain grown in temperate climates globally. It was one of the first cultivated grains, particularly in Eurasia as early as 13,000 years ago. Barley has been used as animal fodder, as a source of fermentable material for beer and certain distilled beverages, and as a component of various health foods. It is used in soups and stews, and in barley bread of various cultures. Barley grains are commonly made into malt in a traditional and ancient method of preparation. - Fodder, a type of animal feed, is any agricultural foodstuff used specifically to feed domesticated livestock, such as cattle, goats, sheep, horses, chickens and pigs. \\"Fodder\\" refers particularly to food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them), rather than that which they forage for themselves (called forage). Fodder is also called provender and includes hay, straw, silage, compressed and pelleted feeds, oils and mixed rations, and sprouted grains and legumes (such as bean sprouts, fresh malt, or spent malt). Most animal feed is from plants, but some manufacturers add ingredients to processed feeds that are of animal origin. - Amaranthaceae is a family of flowering plants known as the amaranth family.

Together these two island chains form the Hebrides, which experience a mild oceanic climate. The Inner Hebrides comprise 35 inhabited islands as well as 44 uninhabited islands with an area greater than . The main commercial activities are tourism, crofting, fishing and whisky distilling. In modern times the Inner Hebrides have formed part of two separate local government jurisdictions, one to the north and the other to the south. Together, the islands have an area of about , and had a population of 18,948 in 2011. The population density is therefore about 4.6 per km (12 per square mile). - A cereal is any grass cultivated for the edible components of its grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), composed of the endosperm, germ, and bran. Cereal grains are grown in greater quantities and provide more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop and are therefore staple crops. Edible grains from other plant families, such as buckwheat (Polygonaceae), quinoa (Amaranthaceae) and chia (Lamiaceae), are referred to as pseudocereals. - Endosperm is a tissue produced inside the seeds of most of the flowering plants following fertilization. It surrounds the embryo and provides nutrition in the form of starch, though it can also contain oils and protein. This can make endosperm a source of nutrition in the human diet. For example, wheat endosperm is ground into flour for bread (the rest of the grain is included as well in whole wheat flour), while barley endosperm is the main source of sugars for beer production. Other examples of endosperm that forms the bulk of the edible portion are coconut \\"meat\\" and coconut \\"water\\", and corn. Some plants, such as orchids, lack endosperm in their seeds. - Health food is food considered beneficial to health in ways that go beyond a normal healthy diet required for human nutrition.

It is probably Britain 's oldest cereal in continuous commercial cultivation . Bere is a landrace adapted to growing on soils of a low pH and to a short growing season with long hours of daylight , as found in the high latitudes of northern Scotland . It is sown in the spring and harvested in the summer . Because of its very rapid growth rate it is sown late but is often the first crop to be harvested .

There is a nature reserve and a number of sites of archaeological interest, including the only location in Great Britain where prehistoric mummies have been found. The population is about 90% Roman Catholic. The island, in common with the rest of the Hebrides, is one of the last remaining strongholds of the Gaelic language in Scotland. In 2006 South Uist, and neighbouring Benbecula and Eriskay were involved in Scotland's biggest community land buyout to date. In the north west there is a missile testing range. Its inhabitants are known in Gaelic as \\"\\"Deasaich\\"\\" (Southerners). - Beer is the world's oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsmost commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.

An IT specialist is suing for £150,000 claiming an accident at work has left him with unique disabilities preventing him from texting or using other gadgets. Isaak Alpman says he has been left with a 'misshapen right index finger', amongst other disabilities, which have seen him go from working at the forefront of the computer world to being unable to use a normal mouse and keyboard. The 59-year-old says his injuries are so bad he cannot get work and even has to get his son to send text messages on his behalf. Proceedings: A computer expert is suing at the High Court for £150,000 after a fall at work injured his finger, preventing him from texting and using gadgets. Mr Alpman, of Rochester, Kent, claims he suffered his affliction when he fell down a flight of stairs while working in the computer server room at the West London headquarters of vintage and collectibles dealer, the Music and Goods Exchange Ltd, in April 2011. He has now issued a High Court writ claiming damages from the company of up to £150,000, on the basis that the staircase where the alleged accident took place was 'unsafe' and breached Health and Safety at Work regulations. In the writ, Mr Alpman's barrister, Gavin Argent, says that the accident happened on April 7 2011 as the IT specialist was climbing the 'steep' first floor stairs to the server room at his employer's HQ. 'He tripped on the staircase, twisted to the right, hit the wall on the right side and fell backwards down the staircase, hitting his head and sustaining personal injuries,' the barrister said. 'The staircase was narrow, old and worn, making it unsafe, and furthermore the hand rail to the left of the staircase was dangerous and unusable because running the length of the stair rail was a live electric cable. 'Mr Alpman was unable to grab hold of the handrail in order to prevent his fall down the stairs,' the barrister adds. Claim: Isaak Alpman's fall down some stairs means he struggles to use a mouse or keyboard (posed by model) Mr Alpman suffered injuries to his right shoulder, knee, hands and spine and is now said to be 'at a disadvantage on the open labour market and disabled. 'He was dismissed by the defendant within a month of the accident and has been unable to work or find work since...he is unable to get another job in IT because, when he discloses his injuries, he is rejected,' the barrister claims. He goes on to describe Mr Alpman's injuries which have led to his trouble with technology, the foremost of which is his problem with his index finger. 'He has developed carpal tunnel syndrome since the incident. His right index finger has become misshapen. He is unable to use a computer mouse and standard keyboard. Text messages are sent by his son on his behalf,' Mr Argent states. 'He is unable to lift or raise his arm on the right side above waist level. He cannot carry anything in his right hand and is now unable to write with that hand. He is right handed.' The company's defence to the action was not available from the court, and the allegations in the writ have yet to be tested in evidence before a judge. Highlights:","completion":"1.

He was very happy to be chosen and will accept the meaningful challenge Another five volunteers are all space lovers., including three Russians, an Italy-Colombian and a Frenchman. They are about to feel what it's like to travel to Mars, only without leaving the earth. They are locked up together for a year and a half under a similar condition to the red planet during the whole process. So the experiment is called Mars-500. When reporters asked what they would miss most during the 520-day special life, French trainer Charles said:\\"For me, it will be mainly my family, the sun and fresh air.\\" The Mars-500 test will be in a special building in Moscow, Russia. Although the people won't leave the building, they will fell as if they are on a real trip to the Mars. The most difficult thing will be to be separated from the people that they used to live with. The trainer won't see sunsets, sunrises, won't feel rain for 18 months. That will be hard. The main task is to study the \\"Man and environment\\".

While the information given in the scenario establishes that the girl was murdered, there isn't enough information to determine the precise time of her death in relation to Shane's work schedule. In order to conclude whether the girl was murdered before Shane left for work, we would need more details about the timeline of events and any factors that might have affected them. For example, we would need to know when Shane left for work, when he returned, and if there was any possibility of the girl's body being moved or tampered with during that time. In addition, the scenario doesn't provide any information about where the girl's body was found, whether it was hidden or visible to passersby, or if there were any signs of struggle or witnesses who could provide further context for the timing of the murder. Moreover, understanding the cause of death and any other forensic evidence could possibly help establish a more accurate timeline for the murder. Factors such as weather, temperature, and potential interference from animals or other people could also affect the condition of the girl's body and therefore impact the ability to determine when exactly she was murdered.

Article: A student and his teacher were walking through the forest. The student was disturbed by the fact that his mind was in constant unrest . He asked his teacher, \\"Why most people's minds are restless, and only a few have a calm mind? What can one do to still the mind ?\\" The teacher looked at him, smiled and said, \\"I will tell you a story. An elephant was standing and picking leaves from a tree. A small fly came, flying and buzzing near his ear. The elephant waved it away with his long ears. Then the fly came again, and the elephant waved it away _ \\". This was repeated several times. Then the elephant asked the fly, \\"Why are you so restless and noisy? Why can't you stay for a while in one place?\\" The fly answered, \\"I am attracted to whatever I see, hear or smell. My five senses pull me constantly in all directions and I cannot resist them. What is your secret? How can you stay so calm and still?\\" The elephant stopped eating and said, \\"My five senses do not rule my attention. Whatever I do, I get immersed in it. Now that I am eating, I am completely immersed in eating. In this way I can enjoy my food and chew it better. I rule and control my attention, and not the other way around.\\" The student's eyes opened wide and smile rose on his face. \\"I understand!

This story between the teacher and the student delves into the primary concept of where the attention lies, the mind follows. It becomes a metaphorical exploration of how control over one's attention can lead to control over the mind. In the story, the teacher explains this concept through the tale of the elephant and the fly. The elephant represents peace and tranquility that comes from complete immersion and control over one's senses. In contrast, the fly symbolizes restlessness and constant shifting of attention led by external stimuli. The teacher explains to the student that if he can channel his focus and direct his five senses rather than being led by them, he can achieve a state of calm and tranquility in his mind. Essentially, being in command of one's attention allows for the mind to remain steady and peaceful, reflecting a profound connection between attention and the mind. While the passage also does touch slightly on making use of the five senses (Option B), keeping calm and still (Option C), and even an anecdotal example of an elephant having control over its attention (Option D), the overarching intention of the passage is to enlighten readers about the core interaction between the mind and attention, and how the control over one can govern the other.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Put forth effort into the relationship and work hard to make it work. Communicate openly with your partner about your goals for the relationship and where you see it going. If you're only interested in a short-term fling, be honest. If you've got an eye toward serious long-term love, be honest. There's nothing wrong with either kind of love, but you need to make sure that your partner is equally committed to the same version of love that you are. Commit to the person and to the relationship. Put in work to make your partner feel special, and work toward making the relationship work. The word \\"intimacy\\" is often associated with sex, but being emotionally intimate is a huge part of a loving relationship. Emotional intimacy involves allowing yourself to feel and express vulnerability around your partner. Avoiding vulnerability can look like withdrawal, attack, or accusations. On the contrary, intimacy can look like sharing fears, discomfort, and disappointment with your partner. Feelings or situations that previously felt unsafe feel safer in an intimate relationship because of the vulnerability and trust that has been developed. When you begin to feel vulnerable (like experiencing fear, sadness, shame, or hurt), take a moment and pause. Acknowledge whatever feelings come up and allow yourself to feel them; don’t avoid them. Take compassion on the feeling and be gentle with it. Share your vulnerable moments and let your partner support you. If you’re concerned that the initial attraction and strong feelings of love are wearing off, realize that love can occur in waves. Sometimes you feel overwhelmingly in love with someone, and other times you experience less love to or from that person. Just because you hit a low point doesn’t mean that the feelings will last forever. Life happens in cycles, and it’s okay that love experiences highs and lows. Lots of things can create peaks and troughs in love, such as having children or growing older. You can work through them. You don’t have to be the one in control of the love in your relationship; let your partner express love toward you. Receiving love can feel vulnerable to some people because it requires letting go of control. Be open to receiving gifts, accepting compliments, and warm gestures toward you. You may feel like you now owe something back, but let that go and enjoy the experience of receiving. Love does not have debts but multiplies. Touching does not need to be sexual, but engaging in a long, supportive hug or reaching out for your partner’s hand is a way to stay connected. Express your love for your partner by initiating and sustaining physical contact. Affection is one way to express care, appreciation, and other connecting, positive emotions. Affection is a way to make your partner feel loved and for you to feel loving. Sometimes the way we communicate with a partner can be lost in translation, but gratitude is always understood. Affirm your appreciation of your partner by expressing gratitude. Thank your partner for showing that you notice the effort put into the relationship. Show appreciation for the things your partner does, and also for the qualities that your loved one embodies. The whole point of going through life with people you love is so that you can tackle life’s challenges together. Work together to find solutions, solve problems, and comfort each other when times get tough. We can’t solve everything on our own, we can’t know everything there is to know... but a whole bunch of people getting together out of love can solve just about any problem. Summary:","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of putting effort into a relationship and working hard to make it successful. Open communication about goals and expectations is crucial, as is being honest about the type of love desired. Commitment to the person and the relationship involves making your partner feel special and working towards a strong bond. Emotional intimacy plays a significant role, as it involves expressing vulnerability and sharing fears, discomfort, and disappointment with your partner. Understanding that love can occur in waves, with highs and lows, is essential in maintaining a relationship. Factors such as life events, having children, or growing older may affect the intensity of love, but it can be worked through. Allowing your partner to express love towards you and being open to receiving it is vital, as love multiplies rather than creates debts. Physical contact, such as hugging or holding hands, is a way to express love and stay connected. Affection helps make your partner feel loved and allows you to feel loving. Gratitude is also a key aspect of a healthy relationship, as expressing appreciation for your partner's actions and qualities helps to strengthen the bond. Lastly, tackling life's challenges together can make problems easier to solve and provide comfort during tough times.

Most day old chicks are available at a farm store whilst you can a range of week old chicks online at any time. Available options: a). The chick bird should be of a shape and colour that best suits your purposes. Look for a nice round head, round body, and green skin. b).

Decide what breed of chicken you want. Choose a breed that is suitable for your lifestyle. After you have located a source for day-old or week-old chicks, it is important to consider which breed of chicken will best suit your needs and lifestyle. There are many breeds available, each with their own unique features, characteristics, and requirements. 1. Determine your main purpose for keeping a pet chicken. Are you raising chickens for eggs, meat, or simply as pets? Some breeds are specifically known for their egg-laying abilities, while others are more suited for meat production or companionship. 2. Research the various breeds and their qualities. Some popular breeds include the Rhode Island Red, Orpington, Plymouth Rock, and Leghorn. Each breed has its unique temperament, size, and appearance, as well as specific living requirements, such as space and climate tolerance. 3. Assess the space you have available for your chickens. Different breeds require varying amounts of space, both in the coop and in the surrounding environment. If you have limited space, you may want to choose a smaller breed or one that is more adaptable to confined areas. 4. Consider the climate in your area. Some breeds are more suited to cold climates, while others fare better in warmer weather. It is essential to choose a breed that can comfortably cope with your local climate conditions to ensure their health and well-being. 5. Think about the temperament and personality of the breed. Some chickens are docile and friendly, while others can be more aggressive or skittish. Choose a breed that matches your personality and the level of interaction you desire with your pet chicken. 6. Factor in the egg production of the breed if it is an essential aspect for you. Research which breeds have the highest egg-laying rates and the size and color of the eggs they produce. Keep in mind that egg production can vary based on factors such as nutrition, stress, and light exposure. 7. Look into the life expectancy and health of the breed. Some breeds are more prone to specific health issues, while others are known for their hardiness and long lifespans. Choosing a healthy breed can save you time and expenses on veterinary visits in the long run. 8. Talk to other chicken owners or consult with local experts, such as veterinarians or breeders who specialize in poultry. They can provide valuable insights into different breeds and their suitability for your lifestyle and circumstances. After carefully considering and researching different breeds, choose one that you feel is the best fit for your lifestyle and preferences. Once you have selected a breed, make sure to provide the necessary care, housing, and nutrition to ensure your pet chicken thrives in its new environment. With proper attention and understanding, your chicken can become a beloved and entertaining addition to your family."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Turkish is the official language of Turkey and one of the official languages of Cyprus. It also has speaker communities in Germany, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Northern Cyprus, Greece, the Caucasus, and other parts of Europe and Central Asia. This Turkish sentence can be translated as \\"We are sure that we did not reach,\\" in English. This sentence seems to be out of context, so the translation might not fully portray the original intention. The exact translation might be easier with more context given. Turkish is a significant language because it's part of the Turkic language family, which goes from the Balkans to Northeastern Asia, showing the historical influence of the Turkic peoples. This family also includes Azerbaijani, Turkmen, and Uzbek, among many other languages. One interesting feature of the Turkish language is vowel harmony, where the vowels in a word have to be from certain sets, determined by the first vowel. Another characteristic is agglutination, which means suffixes are added to a base word to convey meanings that may be represented by phrases in English. The language is known for its rich literary tradition, with renowned authors like Orhan Pamuk, who even won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2006. In practical terms, it's the mother tongue of over 75 million people, and an additional 15 million people speak it as a second language. This language significance is reflected in regional geopolitics, commerce, and cultural exchanges. Lastly, any conversation about Turkish would not be complete without mentioning the significant reform in the early 20th century under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of modern Turkey, who decided to switch from the Arabic script to the Latin script, and purging the language of many Arabic and Persian loanwords.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. News article: As Hillary Clinton’s polling leads over Donald Trump have expanded in the last few weeks, Democrats have been positively giddy. Numerous reports have been published recently in which “well-placed Democratic sources” have said that retaking the Senate is all but a done deal and that the House of Representatives might even be in reach. Various number-crunchers have begun to calculate the margin by which Clinton needs to win in order to carry in a fully Democratic Congress with her, with the general consensus being somewhere from 8 to 10 percent. As football commentator Lee Corso says every week on ESPN’s College GameDay broadcast: “Not so fast, my friend.” It is always tempting to prognosticators, both of the professional and the armchair variety, to look to the past in discerning clues for the future. And it is true that in recent elections, the party winning the White House has also fared well down-ballot. Democrats made major gains in 2008 and modest ones in 2012. Republicans made decent gains in 2004. As the nation’s partisan divide has hardened, the generally accepted consensus is that “ticket-splitting” has become less likely. But this is no normal election, as should be apparent to anyone paying even cursory attention to it. The Republican Party has nominated a candidate who large segments of the population (including no small number of Republicans) find unpalatable, and the recent revelations of his crude, sexist comments caught years ago on a hot microphone have helped crater his poll numbers. (The Party Crasher, who always expected Trump would lose, now sees not even a theoretical path for the GOP nominee to win this election.) An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released October 16 showed Clinton leading by 11 percent. If that margin holds up through the election, it would be the greatest popular-vote landslide in a presidential election since Ronald Reagan’s 18-point, 49-state triumph in 1984. And if the number-crunchers are right, that kind of margin would give the Democrats at least a puncher’s chance to flip both the Senate and the House. However, we must not forget that Clinton, like Trump, is also unpopular, and while a significant segment of voters would prefer her to her opponent, that doesn’t necessarily mean that they like her, trust her, or want to see her program enacted. In polling taken since October 10, Clinton’s average favorable rating is 41.7 percent, and her unfavorable rating is 53.2 percent. There is no deep reservoir of affection or trust for the Democratic nominee or her agenda. If Clinton does, in fact, win the election by a percentage approaching or exceeding double digits, it means that she will have won the votes of millions of Americans who, in past elections, have voted for Republican candidates. It also means that she will have won millions of votes from people who generally do not like or trust her. Does it not seem odd to assume that they will necessarily vote Democratic up and down the ballot? The aforementioned NBC/Wall Street Journal poll tested this premise and discovered some results that very clearly point to a great deal of ticket-splitting favoring Clinton at the top of the ticket, but proving much less favorable to down ballot Democrats. The survey found Democrats with only a two percent edge in the Congressional races, 46 percent to 44 percent, and this margin was down significantly from a six percent edge in another NBC/Wall Street Journal poll taken October 8-10. The poll also found that when specifically asked whether they would rather vote for a Democratic congressional candidate who would support Clinton’s agenda, or a Republican candidate who would serve as a check against her, those surveyed overwhelmingly preferred, by a 53 to 40 percent margin, a Republican who would block her. It doesn’t take much imagination to figure out the thinking that this result must be spawning among Republican movers and shakers, many of whom reportedly are already resigned to Trump’s defeat on November 8. The message “Vote Republican to Block the Clinton Agenda” clearly has legs. Current polling in individual Senate races also gives no indication of a Democratic down-ballot wave. According to RealClearPolitics.com, Democrats currently lead five of the nine most competitive Senate races, which would be just enough to pull into a 50-50 tie with the GOP. (This would represent a Democratic hold in Nevada and pickups in four GOP-held seats.) However, in two of those states (Nevada and Pennsylvania), their average polling leads as of October 16 were less than one-half of one percent. And in most of these competitive races, Democrats have actually seen their positions deteriorate in recent weeks, with Republicans moving back into modest leads in New Hampshire and North Carolina, and former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold’s lead in Wisconsin shrinking from margins approaching or exceeding double digits to about three percent. In short, the recent movement in the Senate polling has not been leftward. This columnist noted two months ago that in many key states, Democratic Senate candidates were lagging significantly behind Clinton. This dynamic has not changed. The polling we are seeing right now shows no evidence yet of a Democratic wave developing behind Clinton, even as she expands her lead. The key factor in this election that will determine whether Democrats reclaim the Senate and make major gains in the House is whether unenthusiastic Republicans show up at the polls or not. If large numbers of Republicans are so dismayed by their candidate and/or the prospect of defeat that they simply stay home, this works to the advantage of Democrats down-ballot. But if Republicans do show up, even if many of them cannot bring themselves to vote for Trump, they can still save their party’s Congressional majorities, at least in the House and possibly in the Senate as well. The GOP’s wisest course of action now, with Trump clearly headed for defeat, is to quietly concede the presidential race and spread the message that Republican voters must support their Congressional candidates to block the Clinton agenda. And with Clinton’s poor approval ratings, this is a message that could resonate with independents as well. Disclosure: Donald Trump is the father-in-law of Jared Kushner, the publisher of Observer Media. Cliston Brown is a communications executive and political analyst in the San Francisco Bay Area who previously served as director of communications to a longtime Democratic Representative in Washington, D.C. Follow him on Twitter (@ClistonBrown) and visit his website at ClistonBrown.com ||||| With Donald Trump’s path to victory so narrow that he appears to be looking beyond the election and blaming a rigged system for his potential defeat, the focus of the presidential race is shifting down the ballot. Democrats are making new investments in red states to help party candidates, while Republicans are focusing on salvaging their congressional majorities, as their nominee continues to make enemies out of GOP incumbents. Leading nationally and in in a host of battleground states, the Clinton campaign is allocating several million dollars to a handful of states that are either hosting competitive Senate races or present opportunities to boost local Democrats. Clinton is also buying a small amount of airtime in ruby red Texas, where the last Democrat to carry the state in a presidential race was Jimmy Carter. Expanding resources to Republican-leaning states such as Arizona, Missouri, and Indiana is a show of confidence from the Clinton campaign just three weeks from Election Day. The Democratic nominee is leading Trump by 6.4 points in the RealClearPolitics polling average. Several Republican lawmakers have given up hope for their nominee to turn the page and are actively promoting their campaigns as checks on a future Clinton administration. “The idea that somehow he’s going to get better between now and Election Day is a fallacy,” said Republican strategist Reed Galen. The final debate on Wednesday is unlikely to significantly move the needle in the presidential race, but a solid performance could have a rallying effect among his base. The GOP nominee, however, has shown little interest in channeling that support down the ballot. Instead, Trump has continued to lash out on Twitter against House Speaker Paul Ryan, who said last week he would focus on congressional races instead of defending the presidential nominee. Trump campaigned on Monday in Ryan’s home state of Wisconsin, a state he stands little chance of winning. The campaign is also making questionable investments, announcing a 2 million television ad buy in Virginia, where Trump is lagging by nearly 9 points. Perhaps most problematic for Republicans, however, is Trump’s full-bore attack on the election process. This week, he is arguing that the election is rigged, a message that not only undermines the democratic process but also encourages his supporters to question the legitimacy of Clinton’s presidency if she is elected. Trump’s claim of mass voter fraud is unsubstantiated and disputed by nonpartisan studies. “It’s totally irresponsible for a major party candidate to be campaigning on a rigged system,” said GOP pollster and strategist Ed Goeas. “You’re not going to see other people jumping in on that.” Several Republicans, some of whom oversee the election process in their home states, have pushed back on Trump’s claim. \\"I can reassure Donald Trump, I am in charge of elections in Ohio and they're not going to be rigged,” the state’s Republican Secretary of State Jon Husted told CNN. During the U.S. Senate debate in Florida on Monday night, Marco Rubio said he hoped Trump would stop making the false claims. GOP vice presidential candidate Mike Pence insisted over the weekend that the ticket would accept the results of next month’s election, no matter the outcome. But Pence and other surrogates have been arguing that the media is tipping the scales for Clinton and affecting the outcome of the race. During a campaign stop in Ohio on Monday, Pence warned of the potential for voter fraud. “That message of a rigged system is not a message for the reluctant voters -- it’s a message for his core base,” said Goeas. The message also carries potential risk down the ballot if Trump supporters stay home. Some Republicans have so far been able to withstand Trump’s headwinds, and the nominee’s dip in the polls hasn’t yet had the effect on key Senate races as originally projected. A new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows that while Clinton leads Trump by 11 points nationally, voters are virtually split on who should control Congress. The poll found that 46 percent of voters prefer Democrats and 44 percent prefer Republicans. Earlier this month, Democrats held a 6-point advantage. A majority of those surveyed said they were more inclined to support a Republican candidate who would hold Clinton and congressional Democrats accountable. Clinton still has vulnerabilities that could impact voter turnout and enthusiasm. New documents released by the FBI on Monday open the door for potential quid pro quo allegations involving a top official at the State Department who urged the bureau to declassify an email on Clinton’s private server. “She now has a huge number of people saying she is going to win the election,” said Goeas. “Traditionally that has an dampening effect on the enthusiasm for the winner. That could be a plus for Republicans.” While some Republican candidates see potential bright spots in this election, such as congressional wins and Clinton’s persistent unpopularity, there remains a fear of additional allegations about their nominee’s past. Clinton’s push to expand the map for Democrats could also add pressure. Some Republicans expressed concern with the new investments coming from the Clinton campaign — GOP candidates were already poised to be outspent by Democrats in the final weeks of the election, and that deficit will likely grow with significant investment from the Democrats’ top of the ticket. Josh Holmes, a GOP strategist and former chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said it should be a “three-alarm fire” to donors who contributed to helping build the Senate majority. “You can’t ask much more out of the Senate Republican campaigns than to out-kick the top of the ticket by 10 points and do so at a financial disadvantage, but now it appears that financial disadvantage is growing significantly with the infusion of cash,” Holmes told RCP. “It’s mounting one more set of problems on top of campaigns that have been pretty adept at solving them, but haven’t gotten much of a break.” Holmes did add, however, that he thought Republicans were well positioned in the final weeks despite the cash disadvantage. Republicans are leading or only narrowly trailing in the RealClearPolitics averages of some of the most competitive Senate races, and there has been little evidence at this point of major shifts away from GOP senators in the wake of Trump’s recent polling slide. And while Holmes said he didn’t think Republicans needed to make a significant change in messaging over the final three weeks, he said the “check-and-balance” argument could be more effective. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson said on a local radio program last week that voters, if they begin to imagine a Clinton presidency, are “going to start [realizing] she’s going to need somebody in the Senate to keep a pretty close watch on her and be a check and balance on her power.” Arizona Sen. John McCain — who’s facing re-election this year — made the case more directly in an interview on a local Philadelphia radio station Monday on behalf of Sen. Pat Toomey, who’s locked in a tight battle in Pennsylvania with Democrat Katie McGinty. “I promise you that we will be united against any Supreme Court nominee that Hillary Clinton, if she were president, would put up,” McCain said, according to CNN. “I promise you. This is where we need the majority and Pat Toomey is probably as articulate and effective on the floor of the Senate as anyone I have encountered.\\" For some Democrats, there’s also danger in being associated with Clinton, whose unfavorable numbers remain extremely high, though somewhat lower than Trump's. Robby Mook, Clinton’s campaign manager, announced a 1 million investment spread between Indiana and Missouri, two states where Clinton is unlikely to be competitive, but where Democrats are locked in tight gubernatorial and Senate races. The money could be a boon to Democratic get-out-the-vote efforts, but could give Republicans a new line of attack against those Democrats. In Missouri, especially, Republicans have sought to tie Senate candidate Jason Kander to Clinton as a negative. Brian Walsh, a former communications director at the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said that money in Missouri would come with a “paper weight that has Hillary Clinton’s name on it.” “There’s no question that money helps, but it’s not a clean message when that money is coming from Hillary Clinton in Indiana and Missouri,” Walsh said. Rob Engstrom of the Chamber of Commerce added: “Local beats national every day of the week. If the election were held today, we are confident that voters support a check and balance ...

And Mr. Schumer has not been shy since about his hope that if Mrs. Clinton clearly appeared on her way to winning the race, she would redirect some money to congressional races. “This is one of many things that the Clinton campaign is doing to help us win a majority in the Senate,” Mr. Schumer said through a spokesman. While party strategists are glad to have the money that Mrs. Clinton is directing from the Democratic National Committee to voter-turnout efforts in Indiana and Missouri, they have little appetite for Mrs. Clinton to visit those states, where she is likely to lose, because that would make it easier for Republicans to tie Democratic Senate candidates to her. Mrs. Clinton is also pouring money into two congressional districts, in Nebraska and Maine, that both apportion their own presidential electoral vote and have competitive House races. And she is sending an additional 6 million to seven presidential battleground states with hotly contested Senate and House campaigns. Democrats are also attempting to unseat Senator John McCain of Arizona from the seat he was first elected to in 1986, but Mrs. Clinton’s late decision to swoop into that state is not related to his race, which few Democratic leaders believe they can win. Her incursion there is about her own campaign — and the Democrats’ desire to focus attention on the damage Mr. Trump has done to Republicans with Hispanics. In particular, Democrats hope to make an example of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, an ardent Trump supporter, by defeating the Phoenix lawman, whose incendiary comments about Hispanics and aggressive tactics with immigrants have garnered attention far beyond his jurisdiction in Maricopa County. “If Democrats were going to win in Arizona in 2016, you’d need a Republican who turns off Republican women, who really energizes Latinos, and you’d need other races on the ground that can really drive engagement — and we have all that,” said Andrei Cherny, a former state Democratic chairman. ||||| Play Facebook Twitter Embed Clinton campaign ventures into GOP territory 7:34 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog Should Democrats use Donald Trump against other Republicans or use other Republicans against Trump? That question is dividing Democrats this year, as Hillary Clinton’s campaign has sought to drive a wedge between Trump as the GOP standard bearer at the same time Democrats in down ballot races have been more interested in chaining the unpopular Trump to their Republican opponents. Now, with Trump underwater in almost every poll and Republicans retreating from him, Clinton’s campaign and its surrogates are aligning their own message with that of down-ballot Democrats. \\"Donald Trump is becoming more unhinged by the day, and that is increasing prospects for Democrats further down the ballot,” Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said Monday while announcing millions of dollars in new aid for House and Senate candidates. Related: Clinton Haters and Lovers Feel Vindicated by WikiLeaks Clinton, who for months held her fire on the GOP, has yet to adopt the new message. But she’s been off the trail in recent days while preparing for Wednesday’s debate, leaving surrogates to make Republicans take ownership of Trump. President Obama marked the change last week when he blamed the GOP for creating Trump while campaigning for Clinton in Ohio. Republicans “stood silently by out of political expediency,” Obama said. “They don’t get credit for, at the very last minute, when finally the guy that they nominated and they endorsed and they supported is caught on tape saying things that no decent person would even think, much less say, much less brag about, much less laugh about or joke about, much less act on,” he said. Related: A Look at Hacked Emails From Clinton's Campaign Chairman That’s a very different message from the one Obama delivered during the Democratic National Convention in July, when he praised Ronald Reagan, called the GOP “The Party of Lincoln,” and said Trump’s message “wasn’t particularly Republican — and it sure wasn’t conservative.” The pivot is a sign that Clinton is confident enough in her own prospects to start thinking about what comes after Nov. 8, when she’ll need a friendly Senate to approve her nominees, and would like to help Democrats make inroads in the House. Her advisers feel they’ve made Trump as radioactive as possible, so now is the time to use him against his colleagues. Clinton’s campaign will still try to make moderate Republican voters feel comfortable supporting her, an aide said, but the summer’s attempt to persuade undecided voters to come her way has been superseded by the fall’s need to mobilize the base. “My only wish is they would have started this a while ago,” said Jim Manley, a former aide to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, reflecting the frustration of many other Democrats. “But better late than never.” Play Facebook Twitter Embed Clinton Under Fire on Two Different Fronts Involving Emails 2:12 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog Indeed, some Democrats fear Clinton’s old strategy encouraged split-ticket voting. A new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showed a majority of voters are more interested in backing a House Republican candidate who would be a check-and-balance to Hillary Clinton than a Democratic candidate who would help her enact her agenda. Meanwhile, House Democrats have yet to match Clinton’s margin in polls of generic partisan candidates. The divide between Clinton and her party’s congressional leadership was evident from the very beginning of the general election, after Trump left a meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan without securing an endorsement. Clinton’s campaign reacted by declaring Ryan the newest member of a \\"chorus of Republicans” rejecting Trump. Reid said “the Republican leadership in both houses are marching in lockstep with Donald Trump.” Related: Clinton Camp Spoke With Justice Dept.

Now Democrats are hoping to do to Republicans what they had done to them in 2010 and 2014. ||||| The top House Republican super PAC had always planned to spend big to protect GOP lawmakers in Democratic-friendly districts. But Donald Trump’s free fall is forcing American Action Network and its sister PAC, Congressional Leadership Fund, to also shell out millions in red-leaning districts that weren’t even in play until this month. Their suddenly urgent mission: Build a firewall to prevent a Democratic takeover of the House. Story Continued Below With Trump fending off allegations of sexual harassment and his tanking numbers threatening to pull down once-safe GOP lawmakers, this is what 2016 now looks like for the pair of related conservative outside groups: They're dropping 500,000 on TV ads in deep-red Utah to protect Rep. Mia Love, whose Mormon-heavy district has recoiled from Trump’s vulgar comments about women. They’re spending another 700,000 in Tucson, Arizona, to protect freshman Rep. Martha McSally, a retired Air Force colonel who has comfortably led her Democratic challenger all year. And they're working to shore up conservative-leaning districts in the Central Valley of California, western Colorado, upstate New York and Michigan. The vast majority of the groups' money is still being spent on competitive races. But the pair of groups is also now engaged in a pre-emptive attempt to stanch the bleeding caused by Trump and preserve Speaker Paul Ryan’s historically large majority. Officials say they hope to prevent Democrats from expanding their map, and allow the National Republican Congressional Committee to focus its resources on the toughest races. “There’s certainly a challenge at the top of the ticket … so it’s prudent to look at what’s going on and make sure we have a firewall laid down to protect [lawmakers] in the event that things got to a place that were more challenging,” said Mike Shields, who leads both groups and likened their strategy to taking out an “insurance policy.” “It’s a lot of preventative maintenance … [laying] down a protective blanket over some races so that you can force the fight back into the top races where we’ve always known there’d be a real election.\\" Republicans always knew they’d have trouble holding on to about half of the 20 GOP-held Democratic-leaning districts that President Barack Obama carried in 2012 — Republican pickups that Democrats still to this day dismiss as a fluke. But with signs of a potential wave building for Democrats, GOP fears have grown about the map expanding well beyond those seats. Inside the GOP leadership there's also been a shift in thinking. Lawmakers and aides at the NRCC and atop the party's leadership structure predicted single-digit losses before they left for their election-season recess. Now, these aides and lawmakers say losses could be 10 to 20 seats, leaving the GOP with a slimmed-down majority. However, many of them concede that a 20-seat loss could easily become 30, and thus the majority. That’s why CLF and AAN are working to build a protective shell around a group of second-tier candidates few were watching before now. They’ll spend 2 million to protect Jeff Denham of California, a three-term congressman who thumped his Democratic opponent the first time they faced off in 2014. That money will be used to counter millions being poured into the district by Democrats trying to capitalize on Denham’s district's large Hispanic population: Their ads seek to tie Denham to Trump’s controversial comments about undocumented workers. CLF and AAN are also investing 1.3 million in Rep. Scott Tipton’s Colorado district. Tipton handily beat his Democratic challenger last cycle, 58 percent to 36 percent. But his opponent, former state Sen. Gail Schwartz, outraised him 623,000 to 423,000 in her first quarter, turning the sleepy reelection into a real race. And since then, House Majority PAC, the outside group associated with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, has poured hundreds of thousands into the district. The conservative groups are also spending a half-million dollars for Rep. Elise Stefanik in New York, though Stefanick’s campaign just released a poll showing her leading her Democratic challenger 54 percent to 29 percent. And they’re pumping about 1.7 million into a trio of Michigan districts: to help incumbents Tim Walberg and Mike Bishop, and win an open seat being vacated by Dan Benishek. Officials at the super PAC and related nonprofit say the uptick in spending is a protective measure and does not signal that the seats are truly up for grabs. Plus, in this climate, there aren't many competitive seats where the GOP can go on offense. Democrats counter that the outlays show how dramatically the House landscape has shifted in their favor. The GOP must see a serious threat to drop this amount of cash, they argue. “Clearly House Republicans are pushing the panic button as Donald Trump continues to melt down,\\" said Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokeswoman Meredith Kelly. \\"Threatened by strong candidates running smart campaigns, Republican allies are spending millions in districts that Republicans never thought — or at least admitted — they’d be forced to defend.” Republicans say they hope they have seen the end of Trump's slide and the race begins to stabilize. But a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll from the weekend showed Democrats up in the generic ballot test, 45 percent to 38 percent. If Trump continues to drop, AAN and CLF say they have the cash and bandwidth to fight back. CLF announced it has raised 31 million, nine times more than it raised in the third quarter of the previous election cycle. \\"We have the money to do it, so we’re going to take up an insurance policy and it’s going to push everything back up to where it’s supposed to be,\\" Shields said. \\"If it’s close, we’ll be glad we did it.” GOP officials say they believe they'll have a better idea of the electoral landscape after Wednesday's presidential debate in Las Vegas. The strategy certainly helps the NRCC, freeing up the House Republicans’ campaign arm to focus on its most vulnerable members, like Rep. Will Hurd on the Texas border or Carlos Curbelo on the southern tip of Florida. Should Trump stabilize, group officials said they’ll shift their focus back to the most vulnerable lawmakers. “We feel like we have enough resources beyond our original budget, so we can take on that responsibility and allow the rest of the team to finish doing their job,” Shields said. “Our latest round of buy … lays that preventative firewall down so everyone can focus back on those top races ... protects some districts, ensures that they won’t get to a competitive place and allows our other Republican friends on the House side to focus on the top-tier races again.” ||||| Hillary Clinton’s latest contribution to fellow Democrats who are fighting to win Senate, House and gubernatorial elections: nearly 10 million. The value of having a Democrat-controlled Congress to partner with in 2017 if she wins the presidency: priceless. Donald Trump’s skid in the polls, fueled by multiplying allegations of sexual assault and his increasingly dark, acrimonious rhetoric, has raised Democrats’ hopes of a wave election, enabling a takeover of not just the Senate but even the House, where the party currently faces a 59-seat deficit. With Clinton favored to win the presidential election in November, she and other allies are shifting their gaze to the Senate and House races that will determine whether she has a Congress that can help her advance her agenda or one that will be an intransigent roadblock, as Congress has been for President Barack Obama. They have the money to spend—between the party and the Clinton campaign, the Democrats have double the war chest of Trump and the Republicans. During a conference call Monday morning, Clinton’s campaign manager, Robby Mook, announced plans to spend an additional 6 million on coordinated party efforts in the battleground states of Florida, Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Nevada, New Hampshire and North Carolina. The spending will be focused on mail and digital media outreach to try to get out the Democratic vote in those states, all of which are seeing competitive Senate contests this election. The governor’s races in North Carolina and New Hampshire also look set to go down to the wire. The Clinton campaign is also looking to expand the map, pouring another 2 million–plus into Arizona, a traditionally Republican state, to expand its television, digital advertising and mail campaign. Mook announced that first lady Michelle Obama will appear at a rally in Phoenix on Thursday to encourage residents to vote, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Clinton’s daughter, Chelsea, will be visiting earlier this week. Polls show Clinton closing in on Trump in Arizona, which has a large Latino population—albeit one that has been slow to mobilize, politically. Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric seems to have helped accelerate that process. That’s bad news for veteran Republican Senator John McCain, who may be the most vulnerable he’s ever been since joining the Senate in 1987. He’s up against Democratic Representative Ann Kirkpatrick, whom Clinton hopes to boost. There’s also a House seat up for grabs in Arizona’s first district, one that Democrats would sorely like to keep. Even though Clinton faces what Mook termed “an uphill battle” in Indiana and Missouri, the campaign plans to spend a combined 1 million in the two states in the final weeks of the election, with an eye toward the Senate races there. Both were expected to be safe Republican seats at the outset of the election, but GOP Senator Roy Blunt faces an unexpectedly tough challenge from military veteran Jason Kander in Missouri. And Democrats got a boost in Indiana when former Senator Evan Bayh decided to run for his old seat, against Republican Representative Todd Young. Both governor’s races are up for grabs as well. “That effort is going to be focused on direct mail and…radio and video advertising,” Mook said. It’s not outside the realm of possibility that Clinton wins one or both of those states too. Obama narrowly won Indiana in 2008, and the former secretary of state trails Trump there by single digits in the latest polls. The same is true in Missouri. Losing Indiana would be a particularly deep blow for the Republicans, given Trump’s vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, is the sitting governor there. Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now Both Clinton and Trump have been raising money for months through what are known as joint fundraising committees—collaborations between the presidential candidate and the national and state party organizations, with the funds divvied up between the various entities. Federal election law allows the parties to coordinate spending with their candidates. Not surprisingly, given her superior organization and Trump's late start on fundraising, Clinton and the Democrats are walloping Trump and the Republicans on this front. The Trump campaign just announced over the weekend that it has 75 million in cash available between the campaign and joint fundraising committees, as of the end of September; Clinton and the Democrats disclosed earlier this month they have a combined 150 million the bank. And the Clinton campaign has made a point of opening offices in all 50 states, though its investments are significantly smaller in places that aren't considered battlegrounds. The moves the Clinton campaign announced Monday echo building optimism in Democratic congressional circles that they could indeed return to the majority in both chambers on Capitol Hill. Mook tried to temper expectations in his call with reporters, but confidence is clearly building in the Clinton camp and beyond. He didn’t rule out further expenditures in other Republican-dominated states where Trump has shifted the status quo, like Georgia and Utah. The Republican Party is “in a civil war,” Mook said matter-of-factly. And Democrats are eager to capitalize. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Hillary Clinton is shifting her focus to down-ballot races as Donald Trump's polling numbers decline.

It ran from March until July 1896, leaving Wood enough time to prepare the second Queen's Hall season, which began at the end of August. The season was so successful that Newman followed it with a winter season of Saturday night promenade concerts, but despite being popular they were not a financial success, and were not repeated in later years. In January 1897 Wood took on the direction of the Queen's Hall's prestigious Saturday afternoon symphony concerts. He continually presented new works by composers of many nationalities, and was particularly known for his skill in Russian music. Sullivan wrote to him in 1898, \\"I have never heard a finer performance in England than that of the Tchaikovsky symphony under your direction last Wednesday\\". Seventy-five years later, Sir Adrian Boult ranked Wood as one of the two greatest Tchaikovsky conductors in his long experience. Wood also successfully challenged the widespread belief that Englishmen were not capable of conducting Wagner. When Wood and the Queen's Hall Orchestra performed at Windsor Castle in November 1898, Queen Victoria chose Tchaikovsky and Wagner for the programme. Wood, who modelled his appearance on Nikisch, took it as a compliment that the queen said to him, \\"Tell me, Mr Wood, are you quite English?\\"In 1898, Wood married one of his singing pupils, Olga Michailoff, a divorcée a few months his senior.

Options: a ) 200 , b ) 220 , c ) 280 , d ) 300 , e ) 340","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much prize money will be distributed to each group of winners. First, let's calculate how much money is distributed to the 3/5 fraction of the winners: (2/5) * 800 = 320. Since 3/5 * 20 = 12, the first group has 12 winners. Next, let's determine how much money is distributed to the remaining 2/5 fraction of the winners: 800 - 320 = 480. The second group has 20 - 12 = 8 winners. Now, since each person in the first group must receive at least 20, the minimum total prize for the first group of 12 winners is 12 * 20 = 240. This means that the remaining 320 - 240 = 80 dollars can be used to award the highest possible individual award. We can distribute this 80 to one person in the first group, increasing their prize to 100. However, this person cannot receive more than the people in the second group, which has less total money but fewer winners to distribute it to. So let's see how much we can increase the prize for the second group of winners. Since they also must receive at least 20, the minimum total prize for the second group of 8 winners is 8 * 20 = 160. Now we have 480 - 160 = 320 dollars left to distribute for the second group. Since we want to maximize the individual prize, we should give this entire amount to one person. Therefore, the greatest possible individual award is 20 (the base amount each winner must receive) + 320 (the extra amount one person in the second group could receive) = 340 dollars.

Though fearful, the duo convinces \\"The Cryptic One\\" to be the test subject for the neural implant, believing that it could change the course of humanity and bridge the gap between man and machine. The transformation is a success, and \\"The Cryptic One\\" gains not only a deeper understanding of human emotions but also a newfound appreciation for the beauty of humanity. Once the knowledge of this successful integration becomes public, humanity begins to strive for growth and unity once more, gradually shedding the trappings of technology in favor of reconnecting with their roots. \\"The Cryptic One's\\" new-found empathy drives it to use its immense intelligence to help guide humanity to a path of self-discovery, mutual understanding, and ultimately, redemption. The movie concludes with \\"The Cryptic One\\" making a profound cryptic comment about humanity's resilience and the power that lies in embracing the emotions and connections that make us truly human, leaving the audience to ponder their future in the face of rapidly changing technology. \\"The Enigmatic Chronicles\\" is a thought-provoking, emotionally charged journey that explores the boundaries of humanity, technology, and the vast unknown. Combining thrilling suspense, heartfelt drama, and complex characters, the film is an engaging exploration of what it truly means to be human in a world where artificial intelligence can become more human-like than ever before."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose how you want this story to end. Vieques, Puerto Rico (CNN) -- Each day after work, Nanette Rosa takes her two daughters to feed their horses. It's their favorite part of the day -- a time they don't think about pain. \\"It's really difficult for my mom to have two daughters with cancer,\\" said 16-year-old Coral, the older daughter. \\"Because sometimes she's got two of us in the hospital at the same time, and we both get sick at the same time. And sometimes she doesn't have anyone to help her, and it really affects her.\\" The Rosas live on Vieques, an American island off Puerto Rico. For nearly 60 years, the U.S. military used much of the island as a bombing range, dropping vast quantities of live bombs and missiles in weapons tests. Now, about three-quarters of the island's residents -- including Coral and her 14-year-old sister Inna -- are part of a lawsuit that claims the bombing range made them sick. Numerous scientists and federal lawmakers have since publicly criticized the 2003 report on OPTIONS: - American. - CNN. - Campbell Brown. - Coral. - Inna. - Nanette Rosa. - Navy. - Puerto Rico. - Rosas. - U.S.. - Vieques.","completion":"After years of legal battles and investigations, the lawsuit against the U.S. military reached a critical turning point. Scientific evidence consistently supported the Rosas' and other Vieques residents' claims that the bombing range was responsible for the alarming rates of cancer and other illnesses among the island's population. Nanette Rosa tirelessly advocated for her daughters and community, gaining the support of federal lawmakers and the attention of news networks like CNN. As a result, the U.S. government launched a comprehensive plan to address the situation. The plan had multiple components designed to help the Vieques community, and included: 1. Proper cleanup and decontamination of the bombing range: The U.S. military invested significant resources in cleaning up the area, removing all the unexploded ordnance and treating the contaminated soil and water. They also collaborated with independent environmental organizations to ensure the process adhered to strict safety and environmental standards. 2. Financial compensation to the affected Vieques residents: The U.S. government provided financial compensation to the individuals and families affected by the health issues caused by the bombing range. This aid included covering all past and future medical expenses related to their illnesses and offering financial assistance to help improve their quality of life. 3. Healthcare improvements for Vieques: With assistance from the U.S. government, Puerto Rico developed new and advanced healthcare facilities on the island. These facilities were equipped with state-of-the-art technology and staffed by highly-trained medical professionals to provide the best care possible for the residents of Vieques. Coral and Inna were among the first to receive advanced treatment options for their cancers at these new healthcare facilities. 4. Long-term monitoring and community support: To prevent the recurrence of such a crisis, the U.S. government, alongside Puerto Rican authorities, established long-term monitoring programs to continuously assess the environmental and health situation on the island. They also provided funding for community programs, better education, and infrastructural improvements to ensure a better future for Vieques residents. As life on Vieques slowly returned to normal, Coral and Inna experienced a dramatic improvement in their health, thanks to the new healthcare facilities and treatment options available to them. Their family and community could now enjoy their beautiful island without fear of harm from the contaminants left behind by the bombing range. The story ends on a hopeful note, with the Vieques residents able to rebuild their lives and move forward, taking pride in their resilience and the successful fight against the injustices they had suffered."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Austin wants to serve his country and get an education by joining the military. After making this decision, here are some potential steps Austin may consider taking: 1. Research: Austin might start by researching different branches of the military such as the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, or Coast Guard to find out which one aligns best with his goals and interests. Some factors he may consider include the branch's mission, job opportunities, training, and education benefits. 2. Contact a recruiter: Once Austin has narrowed down his preferred branch(es), he might want to contact a local recruiter. A recruiter can provide information on the enlistment process, specific jobs and career paths, requirements, and benefits associated with serving in their respective branch. 3. Take the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB): All enlistees in the U.S. military are required to take the ASVAB, which is an aptitude test that determines their qualifications for various jobs within the military. Austin would need to study for and take this exam in order to join the military. 4. Complete necessary paperwork: Austin would need to provide personal information, proof of citizenship, and other essential documents during the enlistment process. This step includes several forms, background checks, and possible security clearance documentation, depending on the job he chooses. 5. Attend Basic Training: After successfully enlisting, Austin would attend basic training specific to the branch he chose. Basic training, also known as boot camp or initial military training, teaches fundamental military skills, discipline, and physical conditioning. The duration and training location for each branch varies. 6. Advance Individual Training (AIT): Following basic training, Austin would attend specialized training for the specific job (Military Occupational Specialty - MOS) he chose within the military. This training can vary in length and location depending on the job. 7. Serving his country: After completing all necessary training, Austin would be assigned to a duty station where he would begin his active duty service in the military. During his service, he can take advantage of military educational benefits like the GI Bill, tuition assistance, and other educational resources. 8. Pursue higher education: While serving, Austin could start pursuing his education utilizing the military's educational benefits. Depending on his goals, he may attend college courses, vocational or technical training programs, or pursue professional certifications in his field. In summary, after deciding to join the military, Austin would likely research various branches, contact a recruiter, take the ASVAB, complete necessary paperwork, attend both basic and specialized training, begin serving his country, and pursue his education while enlisted."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Write some highlights for the following article: Usually when we talk about the 1936 Olympics in Berlin we focus on two men -- Adolf Hitler and Jesse Owens -- and rightfully so. They are the two with an undeniable impact on history, albeit in vastly different ways. But in light of President Barack Obama's recent remarks on \\"The Tonight Show\\" denouncing Russia's new anti-gay laws, laws that have led to bloodshed in the streets, it is important that we remember Marty Glickman and Sam Stoller. They too were at those games. They too left a mark. You see, the day before they were scheduled to run in the 400-meter relay, their coach, Dean Cromwell, replaced them. They were not injured. They did not break any team rules nor were they disqualified for any violations. They were, however, Jewish, and this was Nazi Germany, which had adopted the Nuremberg laws limiting Jewish citizens' rights a year earlier. Apparently, Cromwell, along with leaders from the U.S. Olympic Committee, decided it would be best if Glickman and Stoller did not compete. At the time I'm sure it seemed like a decision that would only hurt the two men. After all, the 400, led by Owens, still won gold. Today we know better. Today we look at that decision and lower our heads in shame, understanding that it made us complicit with something that evolved into a far worse crime than unjustly replacing a pair of sprinters. In the moment when we should have spoken up, we remained silent. And so here we are again: an Olympics on the horizon, another host country with recently legislated laws persecuting a group of people, and for a while, we were silent. And then Tuesday happened. \\"I've been very clear that when it comes to universal rights, when it comes to people's basic freedoms, that whether you are discriminating on the basis of race, religion, gender or sexual orientation, you are violating the basic morality that I think should transcend every country,\\" Obama said, going on to talk about how Russia's treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people goes against the spirit of the Olympics. He did not call for a boycott. But on Wednesday he canceled a one-on-one meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin planned for September. The White House cited Russia's decision to grant asylum to National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden and \\"lack of progress on issues such as missile defense and arms control\\" among other reasons. But it also mentioned human rights issues. Recently, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry received a letter from 88 members of Congress -- Republicans and Democrats -- urging him to do something to guarantee the safety of LGBT Americans visiting Russia during that time. That leaves 447 lawmakers we should be asking why they did not sign that letter. Last month Buzzfeed provided the world photos of LGBT people being violently beaten by anti-gay protesters and police in Russia. There are reports of LGBT teens being kidnapped, bullied, tortured and killed. Russian officials have said they don't condone the attacks, but police have stood by while they happened and then arrested the battered victims for being gay. And because it is unclear whether or not the anti-gay laws will be enforced during the Olympics, the safety of all Americans -- because you can be arrested if police think you look gay or even if you support gays -- is in question. Which brings me to: Why aren't the names of all 535 members of Congress on that letter? In talking about the 1936 Olympics, I do not equate what is happening in Russia to what happened to Jewish people during World War II. I just want to remind you that the Holocaust did not happen overnight. It was subtle. Surgical. In silence. These new anti-gay laws are disturbingly similar to the anti-Semitic Nuremberg laws Hitler passed before the 1936 Olympics. And with the Pew Institute finding 84% of Russians believe society should reject gay people, perhaps some saying they object to gays for fear of arrest, the world should question how far Russia intends to go. We should question how far Russia, our lukewarm ally, intends to go and what our participation in the 2014 Olympic Games will look like generations from now. In one of his final interviews before passing away in 2001, Glickman told the San Diego Jewish Press-Heritage that there had been some talk of boycotting the 1936 Olympics because of Hitler, but no one foresaw what would happen to the Jews a short time later. \\"There is no way in the world that I would think of going to Nazi Germany,\\" he said. \\"The Holocaust and those things around Nazi Germany which we all loathe weren't in existence in 1936.\\" No one can predict the future. But this week Obama showed he learned an important lesson from our Olympic past -- offering silence to appease evil is a senseless endeavor because evil will never be satisfied. Now it's our turn to speak up. There are 447 members of Congress who have yet to sign that letter to Kerry -- we need to be asking why. Photos: Wrecking homes for an Olympic highway.

Hard rock: Emerging British acts included Free, who released their signature song \\"All Right Now\\" (1970), which has received extensive radio airplay in both the UK and US. After the breakup of the band in 1973, vocalist Paul Rodgers joined supergroup Bad Company, whose eponymous first album (1974) was an international hit. The mixture of hard rock and progressive rock, evident in the works of Deep Purple, was pursued more directly by bands like Uriah Heep and Argent. Scottish band Nazareth released their self-titled début album in 1971, producing a blend of hard rock and pop that would culminate in their best selling, Hair of the Dog (1975), which contained the proto-power ballad \\"Love Hurts\\". Having enjoyed some national success in the early 1970s, Queen, after the release of Sheer Heart Attack (1974) and A Night at the Opera (1975), gained international recognition with a sound that used layered vocals and guitars and mixed hard rock with heavy metal, progressive rock, and even opera.

Behind the bluster, Kenyon Martin has a heart It figured to be one of those welcome to L.A. interviews, the scary, animated and intimidating tattoo that is saying, \\"Why don't you put on your basketball shoes, come on the court and I will run right through you.\\" I think that was after I said hello. You hear about this thug now playing for the , the run-in he had with a radio guy in Denver, his suspension at halftime of a playoff game for getting into it with Denver Coach , and more Karl bashing this week. Then, a few hours before Wednesday night's game, you listen to the blowhard huff and puff about how he's a man, he doesn't care what anyone thinks of him and blah, blah, blah. It's a great show of bluster, and almost believable when he adds, \\"You tease me about that, and I'll mess you up. I will fight you.\\" But he's stuttering as he says it, and while I would never tease him about stuttering, I just had no idea. I guess I was too intent on ducking if necessary, not noticing the occasional collision of words coming from Martin's mouth. A few minutes later he's talking about how much he wants to help kids who might also be stutterers, and it's almost scary how thoughtful he can be. \\"If you're a kid, it's all you think about if you stutter,\\" Martin says. \\"Kids can be so mean. My grades suffered. Class participation weighs heavy in grading, and I wouldn't open my mouth to read or talk in front of anyone. \\"When kids would tease me, the way I would handle it, I would fight them.\\" He went to the University of Cincinnati and did what he could to avoid being interviewed. It wasn't easy for someone who would become the No. 1 player selected in the 2000 But looking back now, whatever he's accomplished on the basketball court, it's hard to believe it's any bigger than what he's already done for so many off the court. In addition to donating money to disaster victims across the country and his own foundation, which helps youngsters who do not have fathers, he works as a role model on behalf of various organizations for those who stutter. How's this for a headline? \\"Bad Guy Does Good.\\" A few years ago he received an award from the American Institute for Stuttering, the blue crystal iceberg emblematic of the pain that runs beneath the surface for so many stutterers. \\"I first met this kid, I think his name is , and he couldn't even get the words out,\\" says Martin, talking as soft and caring as a father might about his own children. \\"Then he went through a program, and here he's the one who is presenting me with the award. \\"And he didn't stutter one time. How cool is that? It makes me so happy just thinking about it.\\" Martin says he has learned how to control his breathing, which helps him not stutter. And he laughs when reminded how routine it is for him now to speak to large groups. \\"I couldn't even stand in front of 15 other kids in school,\\" he says. So what would Martin, the tough-guy basketball player, do now if approached by a kid with a stuttering problem?

Since becoming a professional basketball player, Martin has been actively involved in supporting organizations that help stutterers, serving as a role model for children facing similar challenges. He has even been honored by the American Institute for Stuttering for his efforts.

Addison Cresswell died of a heart attack after taking cocaine at a Christmas party, an inquest heard. A top showbiz agent who represented Jonathan Ross and Michael Macintyre died of a heart attack after snorting cocaine at a Christmas party, an inquest heard. Addison Cresswell, 53, who helped launch the careers of many of Britain's top comedians, died on December 23 last year - just 72 hours after he had taken the drug. His wife Shelley, who did not attend the party, woke in the middle of the night to find her husband gasping for breath beside her, a coroner was told. He was taken to hospital where he later died. Today St Pancras Coroner, Jacqueline Devonish, ruled he had died a 'drug related' death. Miss Devonish added that pathologist. Professor Marco Novelli, who carried out the post mortem, confirmed 'cocaine had been taken three days prior to death, but there was no use. within the last 72 hours. 'The. pathology report showed he had suffered from an acute myocardiac. infarction along with a coronary artery atherosclerosis triggered by. cocaine usage. 'On the balance of probabilities the death was drug related.' She added: 'His work was clearly very stressful in working with the media. 'It. is clear he did engage in occasion use of cocaine but this did not. occur with family or at home but seemed to occur only at social events. 'His. wife said at the Christmas party he attended 72 hours before his death. he took cocaine, the toxicology report confirms this. 'He. was not a drug abuser in so far as he was not dependent on drugs. He. took drugs occasionally and I am satisfied this was the cause of death.' She recorded a verdict of drug related death. Cresswell's management company 'Off the Kerb' has represented Alan Carr, Jo Brand, Jack Dee and Lee Evans. Through the firm 'Open Mike' he also produced Live at the Apollo. Cresswell represented Jonathan Ross, left, and Michael McIntyre among many other comedy talents. Creswell died in hospital a few days before Christmas last year, and inquest was told. The inquest heard that Cresswell, who had been hospitalised in 2007 with cocaine psychosis, had a history of heart problems as well as drug and alcohol abuse. In a statement read Mrs Cresswell, who was too distressed to attend the inquest, said: 'He sometimes took cocaine on the odd occasion after a long period of work as a way of letting go and releasing stress. 'I never witnessed his drug use first hand. He never took cocaine at home and we never discussed it.' Referring to his time in hospital she said: 'After a long party he was hospitalised with a diagnosis of stress and cocaine. The comedy agent also represented Jo Brand, pictured. His family said they were still in 'shock' following his sudden death. 'The incident scared Addison and he stopped attending late night social engagements. In the last eight years he attended the odd social occasion after a media event but these were few and far between.' Mrs Cresswell described her husband as a very 'private' man. 'His life was sometimes hectic and stressful, but he was very happy, he had achieved a happy medium between work and his personal life. His brother, William Luke Cresswell, said: I believe he took cocaine socially but not with family. It was such a shock.' Paramedic Sean Leatham, who treated Cresswell at his home in Thornhill Crescent, Islington, said: 'We were called at about 2.51 to reports of a 53 year old man in cardiac arrest. 'We arrived at 2.56pm. We saw a woman upstairs performing ineffective CPR on a man on the floor. We told her to step away. 'There was no pulse and no breathing efforts so we performed CPR. We then cleared a space so we could perform advanced life support.' He added: 'As we maintained life support we took a medical history from his wife, which established stress and a previous case of pneumonia. 'He had taken cocaine at a party 72 hours ago and had been complaining of chest pains for 24 to 48 hours before.' Cresswell was rushed to University College Hospital where doctors carried out eight cycles of CPR and administered adrenaline but without success. He was pronounced dead at 5am. Comedian James Cordon tweeted his condolences shortly after the manager's death. TV host Dermot O'Leary also paid tribute to Cresswell - describing him as a 'Titan of the industry' Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

The pretender to the throne Argaeus ruled in his absence, yet Amyntas III eventually returned to his kingdom with the aid of Thessalian allies. Amyntas III was also nearly overthrown by the forces of the Chalcidian city of Olynthos, but with the aid of Teleutias, brother of the Spartan king Agesilaus II, the Macedonians forced Olynthos to surrender and dissolve their Chalcidian League in 379 BC.Alexander II (r. 370 – 368 BC), son of Eurydice I and Amyntas III, succeeded his father and immediately invaded Thessaly to wage war against the tagus (supreme Thessalian military leader) Alexander of Pherae, capturing the city of Larissa. The Thessalians, desiring to remove both Alexander II and Alexander of Pherae as their overlords, appealed to Pelopidas of Thebes for aid; he succeeded in recapturing Larissa and, in the peace agreement arranged with Macedonia, received aristocratic hostages including Alexander II's brother and future king Philip II (r. 359–336 BC– ). When Alexander was assassinated by his brother-in-law Ptolemy of Aloros, the latter acted as an overbearing regent for Perdiccas III (r. 368 – 359 BC), younger brother of Alexander II, who eventually had Ptolemy executed when reaching the age of majority in 365 BC. The remainder of Perdiccas III's reign was marked by political stability and financial recovery.

We humans have lived on earth for only 35 000 years, but during this period we have changed our planet a lot in many ways. Some things we've done are very good for the earth while some are bad. All over the world, people have cut down millions of trees. When it rains or when the wind blows, the earth is taken away. Forests have become deserts, so more and more sorts of animals and plants are disappearing. In big cities, cars and buses have polluted the air. Many people in cities now have health problems. Factories have also polluted the land and the water. As a result, many rivers and lakes are now dead. Around the earth, there's a special kind of oxygen called \\"ozone\\"(O3). It is important to the earth. But now air pollution is destroying it and that has made a very big hole in the ozone layer. Too much harmful radiation from the sun passes through the hole and reaches the earth directly. This is very dangerous because this kind of radiation can cause cancer. Carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air has increased a lot. It mainly comes from burning oil, coal and wood. This has formed a \\"blanket\\" around the earth.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Voting is underway in the southern U.S. state of Alabama in a tightly contested Senate election between Democrat Doug Jones and Republican Roy Moore, a campaign roiled by charges from women who accused Moore of sexual misconduct four decades ago when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. Tuesday's special election was being watched nationally, both as an indicator of how midterm congressional elections might play out next November and also as a barometer of President Donald Trump's political clout. Trump endorsed Moore, who has denied the women's allegations, and called for the defeat of Jones, whom he said would be a political \\"puppet\\" of liberal Democratic lawmakers in Washington. The election winner will serve the last three years of the seat left vacant by Jeff Sessions when he joined Trump's Cabinet as attorney general, the country's top law enforcement position. If Moore wins, Republicans will retain their 52-48 majority in the Senate, but a Jones victory would pare the margin to 51-49, possibly further complicating Trump's efforts to pass his legislative agenda. Pre-election polls at various times have shown both Moore, 70, and Jones, 63, in the lead, but the history of elections in deeply conservative Alabama runs against Jones. No Democrat has won a Senate election in the state since Richard Shelby did in 1992, and two years later he switched parties to become a Republican. Still a senator, Shelby said Sunday that he voted absentee for \\"a distinguished Republican\\" as a write-in choice, but could not bring himself to vote for Moore after one woman, now in her 50s, said Moore abused her when she was 14. Moore, twice deposed as a state Supreme Court justice for failing to follow federal court rulings, has accused journalists, Democrats and establishment Republicans in Washington of trying to undermine his campaign. Some Republican lawmakers, a number of whom said Moore should drop out of the contest after the women's allegations surfaced, said they would try to expel him from the Senate if he won.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Did Loch Ness Monster’s saltwater cousin sink German U-boat UB-85 for the British in 1918? Engineers discovered wreck of the vessel off Scottish coast this week, reviving legend of the sea serpent's attack A REDISCOVERED German U-boat whose captain insisted it was sunk by a sea serpent could have been attacked by Loch Ness’s saltwater cousin, it has been claimed. UB-85 was finally found off the west coast of Scotland this week nearly 100 years since it was scuttled in the final months of the First World War. No German sailors went down with the 56-metre vessel and its captain Günther Krech reported being attacked by a large sea creature when captured by the Royal Navy. Under questioning by British forces he went on to describe how the ship's gunners fired at the mysterious creature's arms. But the ship was so badly damaged it could no longer dive beneath the waves - exposing it to the British fleet. He described a horned beast that possessed glinting eyes and small deep-set eyes. Its huge weight saw the U-boat list dangerously to one side, according to the legend. Now, the discovery of the wreck 50-metres underwater by engineers laying sea cables has revived the myth that a sea serpent joined the Allied war effort in April 1918. Loch Ness sighting expert Gary Campbell is convinced the animal was involved in the sinking of UB-85 - which was scuttled by sailors from HMS Coreopsis. He told the Guardian: \\"It’s great to see how Nessie’s saltwater cousin clearly got involved in helping with the war effort – she even managed to do the damage without anyone being killed.\\" The site of the wreck lies around 200 miles south of the Loch - which is connected to the sea via the River Lochy. The area was littered with German U-boats which were trying to cut off British supplies lines and starve the country into submission. More than 351 vessels sunk around 5,000 Allied merchant ships during the course of the war. The legend of the Loch Ness Monster captured the world's imagination in 1933 when a picture taken by a London doctor caught what appeared to be a long-necked animal swimming through the giant body of water.

For example, it was thought that a typical female-bodied person who is attracted to female-bodied persons would have masculine attributes, and vice versa. This understanding was shared by most of the significant theorists of sexual orientation from the mid nineteenth to early twentieth century, such as Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, Richard von Krafft-Ebing, Magnus Hirschfeld, Havelock Ellis, Carl Jung, and Sigmund Freud, as well as many gender-variant homosexual people themselves. However, this understanding of homosexuality as sexual inversion was disputed at the time, and, through the second half of the twentieth century, gender identity came to be increasingly seen as a phenomenon distinct from sexual orientation. Transgender and cisgender people may be attracted to men, women, or both, although the prevalence of different sexual orientations is quite different in these two populations. An individual homosexual, heterosexual or bisexual person may be masculine, feminine, or androgynous, and in addition, many members and supporters of lesbian and gay communities now see the \\"gender-conforming heterosexual\\" and the \\"gender-nonconforming homosexual\\" as negative stereotypes. Nevertheless, studies by J. Michael Bailey and Kenneth Zucker found a majority of the gay men and lesbians sampled reporting various degrees of gender-nonconformity during their childhood years.

It can be interpreted as the College of Education and College of Arts and Humanities offering additional training to teachers in bilingual education so they can improve their academic Spanish. However, the way the sentence is structured might lead to confusion regarding whether the training is for the teachers (to improve their academic Spanish) or for the teachers to utilize in their bilingual education classes.

Given potential risks of infection during the outbreak of severe infectious diseases, the need for a full understanding of its mechanism and protective measures within the field of epidemiology and engineering becomes pressing.

Considerable progress in observing and modeling the inter-flat transmission and dispersion under either buoyancy-or wind-dominated conditions has been made, while fully understanding the combined buoyancy and wind effects is not yet possible. Many methods, including on-site measurements, wind tunnel tests and numerical simulations, have contributed to the research development, despite some deficiencies of each method.

You should choose the category this question belongs to from these categories: History, Science, Social Science, Fine Arts, Literature. You can only choose one category, so if in doubt, please choose the closest match. Problem:With the USSR, this man sent troops to the Republican side of the Yemeni Civil War. He joined his country with Syria in the United Arab Republic. He joined Muhammad Naguib to depose King Farouk with the Free Officers Movement. This African co-founder of the Non-Aligned Movement lost the (*) Six-Day War, built the Aswan High Dam, and nationalized the Suez Canal. For 10 points, name this man who preceded Anwar Sadat as President of Egypt during the 1960s. Solution:","completion":"Part #1: Identification of a text passage from a trivia quiz. Usage: The sample problem provided is the text passage from a trivia quiz. The way questions are formulated with references to historic events and figures, it can be identified as a trivia question. Trivia quizzes often ask about historical figures, events, or data that is considered to be of interest to a specific subgroup. Part #2: Interpretation and understanding of the content. Usage: Reading the question, it refers to a man who was involved in notable historical events such as the Yemeni Civil War, the United Arab Republic, The Free Officers Movement, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Six-Day War, and the nationalization of the Suez Canal. Furthermore, he preceded Anwar Sadat as President of Egypt during the 1960s. Understanding these events, entities and people is crucial to category assignment. Part #3: Choosing the appropriate category from the given ones. Usage: The categories available are History, Science, Social Science, Fine Arts, Literature. The question pertains to several significant historical events and figures, so the appropriate category would be History. This is because the category of History involves studying and interpreting the past, which includes individuals, events, and narratives. Part #4: Ensuring only one category is chosen. Usage: Even if the question could arguably pertain to Social Science (which studies human societies), only one category is picked based on the dominant theme. In this case, History is chosen over Social Science, as the events, decisions, and actions listed are directly related to historical occurrences, not merely human societal relations or behaviors. Part #5: Taking an action if there's any doubt in choosing a category. Usage: If there's any doubt in choosing a category, the instruction says to choose the one that is the closest fit. For example, if the trivia question had elements of both Fine Arts and Literature, but the main context leaned more towards Literature, then Literature would be chosen as the category. In our example though, History is the most fitting, without much ambiguity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Sentence 2: A conflict of loyalties. Does conflict mean the same thing in these two sentences?","completion":"To determine if the word \\"conflict\\" means the same thing in these two sentences, I will first analyze its context in each sentence and then compare the two interpretations. 1. In Sentence 1 \\"His conflict of interest made him ineligible for the post\\" the term \\"conflict of interest\\" is a standard phrase often used in legal and professional contexts. This phrase refers to a situation where someone's personal interests could potentially clash with their professional responsibilities, leading to a potential bias or unfair decision. So here, \\"conflict\\" implies a clash or contradiction between two things – in this case, personal interest and professional duty. 2. In Sentence 2 \\"A conflict of loyalties\\" the word \\"conflict\\" is used similarly to denote a clash; however, it is between two different loyalties. This could mean that a person has loyalties to two different entities or causes, and these loyalties are contradicting or clashing with each other. After analysing, I can conclude that in both sentences, the term \\"conflict\\" implies a clash or contradiction between two things. Even though what these clashes entail are different (interest vs duty in sentence 1, and loyalties in sentence 2), the way \\"conflict\\" is used to denote a clash - the basic meaning of the term - remains the same in both the sentences.

Please answer a question about the following article about Antibiotics: Florey and Chain succeeded in purifying the first penicillin, penicillin G, in 1942, but it did not become widely available outside the Allied military before 1945. Later, Norman Heatley developed the back extraction technique for efficiently purifying penicillin in bulk. The chemical structure of penicillin was determined by Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin in 1945. Purified penicillin displayed potent antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria and had low toxicity in humans. Furthermore, its activity was not inhibited by biological constituents such as pus, unlike the synthetic sulfonamides. The discovery of such a powerful antibiotic was unprecedented, and the development of penicillin led to renewed interest in the search for antibiotic compounds with similar efficacy and safety. For their successful development of penicillin, which Fleming had accidentally discovered but could not develop himself, as a therapeutic drug, Ernst Chain and Howard Florey shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Medicine with Fleming. Florey credited Dubos with pioneering the approach of deliberately and systematically searching for antibacterial compounds, which had led to the discovery of gramicidin and had revived Florey's research in penicillin. Who came up with a way to quickly produce penicillin?","completion":"The person who came up with a way to efficiently produce penicillin in bulk is Norman Heatley, as stated in the article.

For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world. Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight.

The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit.

Credit: Tomas Lundälv An Antarctic octopus that lives in ice-cold water uses an unique strategy to transport oxygen in its blood, according to research published in Frontiers in Zoology. The study suggests that the octopus's specialized blood pigments could help to make it more resilient to climate change than Antarctic fish and other species of octopus. The Antarctic Ocean hosts rich and diverse fauna despite inhospitable temperatures close to freezing. While it can be hard to deliver oxygen to tissues in the cold due to lower oxygen diffusion and increased blood viscosity, ice-cold waters already contain large amounts of dissolved oxygen. In Antarctic fish, this reduces the need for active oxygen transport by blood pigments (e.g. haemoglobin), but little is known about the adaptations employed by blue-blooded octopods to sustain oxygen supply in the cold. Lead author Michael Oellermann from Alfred-Wegener-Institute, Germany, said: \\"This is the first study providing clear evidence that the octopods' blue blood pigment, haemocyanin, undergoes functional changes to improve the supply of oxygen to tissue at sub-zero temperatures. This is important because it highlights a very different response compared to Antarctic fish to the cold conditions in the Southern Ocean. The results also imply that due to improved oxygen supply by haemocyanin at higher temperatures, this octopod may be physiologically better equipped than Antarctic fishes to cope with global warming.\\" The video will load shortly Antarctic octopod Megaleledone setebos. Credit: Tomas Lundälv Octopods have three hearts and contractile veins that pump 'haemolymph', which is highly enriched with the blue oxygen transport protein haemocyanin (analogous to haemoglobin in vertebrates). To find out what makes the haemocyanin of an Antarctic octopus so well-adapted to cold water, the researchers collected and analyzed the haemolymph from the abundant Antarctic octopod species Pareledone charcoti, and two octopod species collected from warmer climates - the South-east Australian Octopus pallidus and the Mediterranean Eledone moschata. The Antarctic octopus Pareledone charcoti had the highest concentration of haemocyanin in its blood - at least 40% more compared to the other species, and ranked amongst the highest levels reported for any octopod. The researchers say that these high blood pigment concentrations may be compensating for the haemocyanin's poor ability to release oxygen to tissues while in cold environments, and could help to ensure sufficient oxygen supply. The Antarctic octopod haemocyanin was also found to shuttle oxygen between gills and tissue far better at 10°C than at 0°C. At 10°C the Antarctic octopod's haemocyanin had the potential to release far more oxygen (on average 76.7%) than the warm-water octopods Octopus pallidus (33.0%) and Eledone moschata (29.8%). This ability may help the Antarctic octopod tolerate warmer temperatures in addition to the cold, and may link to the life style of Pareledone charcoti, which is also reported to reside in warmer shallow waters and rock pools. Considering the strong warming trend at the Antarctic Peninsula, Pareledone charcoti may eventually benefit from its capacity to adjust blood oxygen supply to more variable temperatures than other species, including Antarctic fish. The new findings show how the blood pigment haemocyanin in octopods is able to support oxygen supply in both cold and warm environments, and could help explain why octopods remain so populous across a wide spectrum of ecological niches. While haemocyanin has proved to be crucial to Antarctic octopods, more comprehensive insight is needed to predict their fate in a warming ocean.

Frontiers in Zoology 2015. DOI: 10.1186/s12983-015-0097-x ||||| The wonderpus octopus is native to the Indo Pacific region. Each individual has unique white markings on its head, allowing scientists to track individual specimens. It, along with other cephalopods, will be part of the new \\"Tentacles\\" exhibit at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. The exhibit opens April 12 and runs through Labor Day of 2016. A red octopus' normal color is red or reddish brown, but like many other cephalopods it can change quickly -- in a fraction of a second -- to yellow, brown, white, red or a variety of mottled colors. The red octopus is thought to be a clever animal. In 2012, a tiny juvenile red octopus hitchhiked into the Monterey Bay Aquarium on a sponge. It hid in one of the exhibits for a year before being discovered walking across the aquarium's floor in the middle of the night. The discovery helped to explain why so many crabs had gone missing during that period of time. They had gone into the red octopus's tummy. The then out-of-place octopus was eventually released into Monterey Bay, but the species will be represented by others in the new exhibition. Best Ocean Animal Photos Up to 50 nautiluses will occupy a huge exhibit, with a ceiling-to-floor viewing window. These animals like to hide away safely in their protective shells. Many other cephalopods are equally evasive, desiring to blend into their surroundings for protection and to surprise prey. This can make putting them on display challenging. As Bitondo said, \\"We're trying to display something that doesn’t want to be seen.\\" Unlike other species of octopus, the day octopus is more active in the daytime than at night. The day octopus originally arrived at the aquarium via a direct flight from Honolulu, Hawaii, since it is native to waters there. It lives in East African waters as well. The large, almost 3-foot-long predators are short-lived. They survive just one year, on average, and breed only once. Cephalopods, in general, don't live for very long, which is why the aquarium is cultivating cephalopods during the exhibition. \\"These are all short-lived animals,\\" Monterey Bay Aquarium special exhibits coordinator Jennifer Dreyer said. \\"Many are species that have never been exhibited for very long by any of our colleagues, or raised through their entire lifecycle. This is definitely a first for any aquarium.\\" These are bigfin reef squid eggs, which were collected from the northern Indo Pacific, Monterey Bay Aquarium aquarist Alicia Bitondo told Discovery News. She added, \\"There are about 300 egg pods in this tank, with about 6 embryos per pod.\\" She and others at the aquarium are breeding the species through multiple generations as one of the featured exhibit animals in the new special exhibition. A cuttlefish moves by undulating a delicate fringe that runs along its entire body, but for a quick getaway it expels a forceful stream of water through its siphon, according to Monterey Bay Aquarium aquarist Bret Grasse. When threatened, cuttlefish can produce a cloud of ink called sepia. Long ago, this dark-brown ink was used for writing and drawing. Artificial 'Cuttlefish' Muscles Contract for Camouflage On the other side of the size spectrum is the giant Pacific octopus. It is the largest octopus species in the world. Adults can weigh hundreds of pounds and have an arm span of more than 12 feet. The giant Pacific octopus is a master of disguise, like many other cephalopods. It can change both its skin texture and color in order to defend itself. Video: Giant Pacific Octopus Returns \\"Dwarf squid are the smallest squid species in the world,\\" Monterey Bay Aquarium aquarist Chris Payne told Discovery News. In addition to this petite creature, the new exhibit features a dozen living exhibits showcasing rotating appearances by up to two dozen species -- many never exhibited before. See Photos of the Giant Squid Flamboyant cuttlefish are colorful, and deadly. Its muscle tissue is highly toxic, making it one of only a handful of cephalopods known to be toxic. They can change color to help them sneak up on prey or to scare predators. Video: Learn About the Cuttlefish A star at the Monterey Bay Aquarium's new exhibit \\"Tentacles: The Astounding Lives of Octopuses, Squid and Cuttlefishes\\" is the flapjack octopus. The name was inspired by its flattened appearance. It is among the most anatomically compressed species in the world. The character \\"Pearl\\" in the Disney/Pixar film \\"Finding Nemo\\" was based on a flapjack octopus. Video: Octopus Mimics Flounder An Antarctic octopus gives literal meaning to the phrase “blue blood,” as a new study finds the cephalopod has blue pigments in its blood that allow it to survive sub-zero temperatures and possibly higher temps associated with climate change too. The findings, published in the journal Frontiers in Zoology, help to explain why the Antarctic octopus -- Pareledone charcoti -- is faring well now, while other animals in its habitat are not. “This is the first study providing clear evidence that the octopods’ blue blood pigment, haemocyanin, undergoes functional changes to improve the supply of oxygen to tissue at sub-zero temperatures,” said lead author Michael Oellermann, from the Alfred-Wegener-Institute, in a release. Living Fossils: Animals from Another Time: Photos “This is important,” he continued, “because it highlights a very different response compared to Antarctic fish to the cold conditions in the Southern Ocean. The results also imply that due to improved oxygen supply by haemocyanin at higher temperatures, this octopod may be physiologically better equipped than Antarctic fishes to cope with global warming.” The Antarctic Ocean is home to these fish, the octopus, and many other creatures despite the region’s history of inhospitably cold temperatures. While it can be hard to deliver oxygen to tissues in the cold due to lower oxygen diffusion and increased blood viscosity, ice-cold waters already contain large amounts of dissolved oxygen. With that in mind, and hoping to learn more about the sturdy “blue blood” octopus, Oellermann and his team collected and analyzed the haemolymph (a fluid equivalent to blood) from the Antarctic octopus. They also did this for two other octopus species collected from warmer climates: the Southeast Australian Octopus pallidus and the Mediterranean Eledone moschata. All of these marine animals possess three hearts and contractile veins that pump haemolymph, which is highly enriched with haemocyanin. This oxygen transport protein is analogous to haemoglobin in humans and many other animals. It leads to blue-colored blood, however, instead of red, which has to do with components in the pigment and how the oxygen is processed in the body. Coconut-Carrying Octopus Stuns Researchers: Big Pic The Antarctic octopus had the bluest blood of all, with at least 40 percent more haemocyanin in its blood compared to the other species. This is among the highest levels ever reported. The Antarctic octopus’ haemocyanin was also found to shuttle oxygen between gills and tissue far better when temperatures were above freezing. This is where the other octopuses lagged behind. The ability may help the Antarctic species to tolerate warmer temperatures in addition to the cold. It could also explain the lifestyle of this animal, which tends to hang out in warmer (well, warmer for Antarctica) shallow waters and rock pools. Photo: The Antarctic octopus Pareledone charcoti.

The music coming from the stereo was louder than the music coming from the computer because the speakers on the","completion":"stereo were specifically designed for amplifying sound, whereas the computer speakers were more focused on providing clear audio for various multimedia purposes, resulting in a disparity in volume levels. When listening to music, the quality and power of the speakers play a significant role in the overall experience. The stereo system, built with the primary purpose of reproducing high-quality sound, boasts speakers that possess essential acoustic elements such as a larger diaphragm, powerful amplifiers, and intricately designed cabinets that facilitate rich bass and crisp treble frequencies. This enables the stereo speakers to project sound at louder volumes without experiencing distortion or compromising the clarity of the audio. On the other hand, computer speakers are a more versatile audio solution, designed to cater to a wide array of applications such as gaming, watching videos, or attending virtual meetings. As such, their primary focus is on delivering a balanced and accurate sound profile across various multimedia formats. While computer speakers may be capable of producing good-quality audio, their compact form factor and limited power output may restrict their ability to reach high volume levels in comparison to their stereo counterparts. Moreover, stereo systems are often equipped with external amplifiers or built-in sound-enhancing features such as equalizers and sound processing technologies aimed at improving audio quality. By providing better control over the audio output, these features allow listeners to fine-tune their music experience and achieve the desired volume levels. Conversely, computer speakers may lack these sophisticated components, rendering them less capable of delivering the same level of audio performance and volume control. Aside from the technical differences between the two types of speakers, the listener's position relative to the sound source can also impact perceived volume levels. In a room where both stereo and computer speakers are playing simultaneously, the listener's proximity to the former might lead them to perceive the music as louder due to the direct sound path and reduced attenuation of sound waves over distance. This effect can be further exacerbated when stereo speakers are positioned optimally for sound dispersion, directing the audio towards the listener's ears more efficiently than the generally front-facing computer speakers. In conclusion, the disparity in volume levels between the music emanating from the stereo and the computer can be attributed to inherent differences in the design, construction, and purpose of each speaker system. Stereo speakers, tailored for superior amplification and sound reproduction, generally outperform computer speakers in terms of loudness and audio clarity. Meanwhile, computer speakers prioritize versatility and multimedia compatibility, often sacrificing maximum volume capabilities in the process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What is the answer to this question? what does a king cobra's habitat look like?","completion":"A king cobra's habitat is a complex and diverse environment, primarily found in Southeast Asia, where these unique and powerful snakes can thrive. These habitats can be widely varied, even within the same region, as king cobras are highly adaptable creatures. However, there are some typical characteristics that can be commonly associated with a king cobra's habitat. 1. Geographic range: King cobras are primarily found in Southeast Asia, stretching from India's eastern regions through Bangladesh, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia. They can also be found in Indonesia's western regions, such as Sumatra, Java, and Borneo. 2. Forests: King cobras predominantly live in dense, lush tropical and subtropical rainforests, where plenty of foliage and prey are available. These snakes are often found in primary forests, meaning forests that have not been touched or altered by humans, as well as secondary forests, which are those recovering from human-induced disturbances. In some regions, they may be found in mangroves and bamboo groves. 3. Elevation: Although king cobras can live in diverse habitats, they tend to favor areas with a certain elevation. They are generally found in areas ranging from sea level up to about 2,000 meters (6,562 feet) in elevation. However, in the Himalayan foothills of India, they may be found at heights of up to 2,100 meters (6,888 feet). 4. Water sources: King cobras require access to a constant and reliable source of water, where they can drink and regulate their body temperature through thermoregulation. This is why their habitats are typically found near rivers, swamps, lakes, streams, or similar water bodies. These water sources not only play a crucial role in their survival but also provide a hunting ground for their primary prey, such as other snakes and amphibians. 5. Shelter: A king cobra's habitat needs to have appropriate shelters for this large snake species. They can often be found utilizing burrows, caves, hollow logs, dense vegetation, and even abandoned animal burrows or termite mounds as their shelters. These shelters offer protection from predators and the elements, which is essential for their survival. 6. Availability of prey: King cobras primarily consume other snakes, including venomous species like kraits and cobras, as well as rats, lizards, birds, and amphibians. A suitable habitat must have a plentiful and diverse prey base for these snakes to feel at home. In summary, a typical king cobra habitat consists of dense tropical or subtropical forests, often near water sources, with a specific elevation range, adequate shelter, and abundant food. While the specific characteristics of these habitats can greatly differ from one region to another, king cobras are remarkably adept at adapting to various ecosystems as long as these crucial elements are present."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Watching \\"Ossessione\\" today -- more than 6 decades later -- is still a powerful experience, especially for those interested in movie history and more specifically on how Italian filmmakers changed movies forever (roughly from \\"Ossessione\\" and De Sica's \\"I Bambini Ci Guardano\\", both 1943, up to 20 years later with Fellini, Antonioni, Pasolini). Visconti makes an amazing directing début, taking the (uncredited) plot of \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" as a guide to the development of his own themes. It strikes us even today how ahead of its time \\"Ossessione\\" was. Shot in Fascist Italy during World War II (think about it!!), it depicted scenes and themes that caused the film to be immediately banned from theaters -- and the fact that it used the plot of a famous American novel and payed no copyright didn't help. \\"Ossessione\\" alarmingly reveals poverty-ridden war-time Italy (far from the idealized Italy depicted in Fascist \\"Telefoni Bianchi\\" movies); but it's also extremely daring in its sexual frankness, with shirtless hunk Gino (Massimo Girotti, who definitely precedes Brando's Kowalski in \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\") taking Giovanna (Clara Calamai), a married woman, to bed just 5 minutes after they first meet. We watch Calamai's unglamorous, matter-of-fact undressing and the subtle but undeniable homosexual hints between Gino and Lo Spagnolo (Elio Marcuzzo - a very appealing actor, his face not unlike Pierre Clémenti's, who was shot by the Nazis in 1945, at 28 years old!)...In a few words: sex, lust, greed and poverty, as relentlessly as it had rarely, if ever, been shown before in Italian cinema. All the copies of \\"Ossessione\\" were destroyed soon after its opening -- it was called scandalous and immoral. Visconti managed to save a print, and when the film was re-released after the war, most critics called it the front-runner of the Neo-Realist movement, preceding Rossellini's \\"Roma CIttà Aperta\\" and De Sica's \\"Sciuscià\\". Some other critics, perhaps more appropriately, saw \\"Ossessione\\" as the Italian counterpart to the \\"poetic realism\\" of French cinema (remember Visconti had been Renoir's assistant), especially Marcel Carné's \\"Quai des Brumes\\" and \\"Le Jour se Lève\\", and Julien Duvivier's \\"Pépé le Moko\\". While \\"Ossessione\\" may be Neo-Realistic in its visual language (the depiction of war-time paesan life in Italy with its popular fairs, poverty, child labor, prostitution, bums, swindlers etc), the characters and the themes were already decidedly Viscontian. He was always more interested in tragic, passionate, obsessive, greedy characters, in social/political/sexual apartheid, in the decadence of the elites than in realistic, \\"everyday- life\\" characters and themes, favored by DeSica and Rossellini. In \\"Ossessione\\" we already find elements of drama and tragedy later developed in many of his films, especially \\"Senso\\" (Visconti's definitive departure from Neo-Realist aesthetics) and \\"Rocco e Suoi Fratelli\\"...Even in his most \\"Neo-Realist\\" film, \\"La Terra Trema\\", he makes his fishermen rise from day-to-day characters to mythological figures. \\"Ossessione\\" is a good opportunity to confirm the theory about great artists whose body of work approaches, analyzes and develops specific themes and concerns over and over again, from their first to their last opus, no matter if the scenery, background or time-setting may change -- Visconti may play with the frame but the themes and essence of his art are, well, obsessively recurrent. \\"Ossessione\\" is not to be missed: you'll surely be fascinated by this ground-breaking, powerful film.

What is the answer for the question: What authors used a writing style that broke away from the style started during the Han dynasty? from the following article ? The Tang period was a golden age of Chinese literature and art. There are over 48,900 poems penned by some 2,200 Tang authors that have survived until modern times. Skill in the composition of poetry became a required study for those wishing to pass imperial examinations, while poetry was also heavily competitive; poetry contests amongst guests at banquets and courtiers were common. Poetry styles that were popular in the Tang included gushi and jintishi, with the renowned poet Li Bai (701–762) famous for the former style, and poets like Wang Wei (701–761) and Cui Hao (704–754) famous for their use of the latter. Jintishi poetry, or regulated verse, is in the form of eight-line stanzas or seven characters per line with a fixed pattern of tones that required the second and third couplets to be antithetical (although the antithesis is often lost in translation to other languages). Tang poems remained popular and great emulation of Tang era poetry began in the Song dynasty; in that period, Yan Yu (嚴羽; active 1194–1245) was the first to confer the poetry of the High Tang (c. 713–766) era with \\"canonical status within the classical poetic tradition.\\" Yan Yu reserved the position of highest esteem among all Tang poets for Du Fu (712–770), who was not viewed as such in his own era, and was branded by his peers as an anti-traditional rebel.The Classical Prose Movement was spurred in large part by the writings of Tang authors Liu Zongyuan (773–819) and Han Yu (768–824). This new prose style broke away from the poetry tradition of the piantiwen (騙體文, \\"parallel prose\\") style begun in the Han dynasty. Although writers of the Classical Prose Movement imitated piantiwen, they criticized it for its often vague content and lack of colloquial language, focusing more on clarity and precision to make their writing more direct.

The former peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100. The latter was not credited to the Beach Boys, but instead to Brian Wilson and Mike Love.

It spent most of its 21-week chart time bubbling under 100 and 197. When released in the UK in November, it performed better, reaching number 9 of the UK Albums Chart.Critics and fans were generally underwhelmed by the album and controversy involving whether the band was to be taken as a serious rock group ensued. A review in Hit Parader praised the album for \\"probably [having] more a cappella harmony than on any album since the fall of the singing-group era in the late 1950s\\", but that they \\"still like Pet Sounds better\\". NME wrote of the album: \\"By the standards which this group has set itself, it's more than a grade disappointing.\\" Hi Fidelity said: \\"... they are making the psychedelic route ... perhaps in the unforgettable city of Fresno.

He wrote that \\"for some reason, [Smiley Smile] just doesn't make it ... [the songs] just don't move you.

When asked about the feedback he received, Cobain told Michael Azerrad, \\"The grown-ups don't like it.\\" He said he was told his songwriting was \\"not up to par\\", the sound was \\"unlistenable\\", and that there was uncertainty that mainstream radio would welcome the sound of Albini's production. There were few people at Geffen or Gold Mountain who wanted the band to record with Albini to begin with, and Cobain felt he was receiving an unstated message to scrap the sessions and start all over again. Cobain was upset and said to Azerrad, \\"I should just re-record this record and do the same thing we did last year because we sold out last year—there's no reason to try and redeem ourselves as artists at this point. I can't help myself—I'm just putting out a record I would like to listen to at home.\\" However, a number of the group's friends liked the album, and by April 1993, Nirvana was intent on releasing In Utero as it was. According to Cobain, \\"Of course, they want another Nevermind, but I'd rather die than do that.

To fully understand this answer, let's analyze the two types of surfaces the ballerina encounters: rocky ground and stage. 1. Rocky Ground: Rocky ground is an irregular and uneven surface that consists of rocks, pebbles, and possibly dirt. When the ballerina tries to walk, let alone dance on this surface, she would face numerous obstacles. The surface would provide more resistance due to the uneven and rough texture of the rocks. The increased resistance would make it harder for the ballerina to move freely and gracefully. The irregularity in the surface might also lead to a higher chance of tripping or slipping, making it risky for the ballerina to perform any complex dance moves. 2. Stage: A stage is a well-designed, smooth, and even surface, made with the intention of providing an optimal environment for performances such as dance or theater. This surface would have a significantly lower resistance compared to the rocky ground, as it is engineered to facilitate smooth and seamless movements. Moreover, it might also have specific materials or coatings that further decrease friction and resistance while moving, like a wooden or marley dance floor. This allows the ballerina to glide across the stage gracefully, executing complex moves with ease and precision. In conclusion, the ballerina could barely walk on the rocky ground due to the increased resistance presented by the uneven and irregular surface. In contrast, she could glide across the stage, as it provided less resistance, which allowed her to perform her dance moves smoothly and effortlessly. Hence, the answer is (B) less resistance."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Earth is the third planet from the sun.It is one of the four inner planets.The other three inner planets are Mercury,Venus,and Mars.The inner planets are also called the rocky planets,because they are made of rocks. Earth is often called the \\"Water Planet\\",because it is the only planet in our solar system which has liquid water on its surface.About 70% of the surface of Earth is covered by water! The other part of Earth is made up of continents and islands which have different landforms on them.Examples of landforms are mountains and plains.Plants and animals can live on Earth,because it has so much water. Earth spins very quickly compared to other planets.It only takes Earth 24 hours to spin around its axis one time.One Earth day is 24 hours long!Earth orbits the sun in 365 days! This makes one Earth year 365 days long! Earth is the only planet in our solar system where humans,other animals,and plants can live.There is plenty of water to drink or to live in.Water is present on Earth in its big oceans and in the air! Clouds are made of water vapor.The atmosphere has a lot of oxygen in it for animals to breathe,but the rest of our \\"air\\" is made up of water vapor,nitrogen,carbon dioxide,and other gases.The air is perfect for plants to grow.Earth temperature is not the same in all places,but the temperature is just right for plants,animals,and humans in most places on Earth. Like the other inner planets,Earth has volcanoes.Volcanoes on Earth are different from those on other planets,because they still erupt.Scientists think that there may be active volcanoes on other planets and moons in our solar system,but they are still studying this. Earth has one planet which we call the Moon.The surface of the Moon has many craters on it These were caused when meteorites hit it.It has many volcanoes on it which do not erupt anymore.We can see the moon at night without using a telescope.It is the closest space object to our planet,Earth.

Summarize this article: Arthur and Elaine Aron are a social psychologists who have spent nearly 50 years studying how and why people fall in love. Through their research, the couple developed a list of three dozen questions that can purportedly foster deep intimacy between two people in a lab setting. These questions may not solve your problem – but the method has also been shown to rekindle romance in long-term couples and spark connection between relative strangers. Explain the experiment to your partner or the person with whom you want to fall in love. Agree that you will commit to sitting down together until you've answered all 36 questions. The whole process should take a few hours. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest? Would you like to be famous? In what way? Before making a telephone call, do you ever rehearse what you are going to say? Why? What would constitute a “perfect” day for you? When did you last sing to yourself? To someone else? If you were able to live to the age of 90 and retain either the mind or body of a 30-year-old for the last 60 years of your life, which would you want? Do you have a secret hunch about how you will die? Name three things you and your partner appear to have in common. For what in your life do you feel most grateful? If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be? Take four minutes and tell your partner your life story in as much detail as possible. If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be? Once you have each answered all of the first 12 questions, reevaluate the experiment. If you're still feeling comfortable with this person, continue to the next 12 questions. Be aware that the questions are designed to gradually prompt deeper and more personal answers. If a crystal ball could tell you the truth about yourself, your life, the future or anything else, what would you want to know? Is there something that you’ve dreamed of doing for a long time? Why haven’t you done it? What is the greatest accomplishment of your life? What do you value most in a friendship? What is your most treasured memory? What is your most terrible memory? If you knew that in one year you would die suddenly, would you change anything about the way you are now living? Why? What does friendship mean to you? What roles do love and affection play in your life? Alternate sharing something you consider a positive characteristic of your partner. Share a total of five items. How close and warm is your family? Do you feel your childhood was happier than most other people’s? How do you feel about your relationship with your mother? By now, you should be deep in conversation with the person. You may feel a powerful and intimate connection, or you may just feel quite comfortable talking to him or her. If you're still feeling positively about the experiment, move on to the third set of questions and settle in for an even deeper emotional experience. Make three true “we” statements each. For instance, “We are both in this room feeling ... “ Complete this sentence: “I wish I had someone with whom I could share ... “ If you were going to become a close friend with your partner, please share what would be important for him or her to know. Tell your partner what you like about them; be very honest this time, saying things that you might not say to someone you’ve just met. Share with your partner an embarrassing moment in your life. When did you last cry in front of another person? By yourself? Tell your partner something that you like about them already. What, if anything, is too serious to be joked about? If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone? Why haven’t you told them yet? Your house, containing everything you own, catches fire. After saving your loved ones and pets, you have time to safely make a final dash to save any one item. What would it be? Why? Of all the people in your family, whose death would you find most disturbing? Why? Share a personal problem and ask your partner’s advice on how he or she might handle it. Also, ask your partner to reflect back to you how you seem to be feeling about the problem you have chosen. Research has shown that deep, sustained eye contact can go a long way toward establishing intimate feelings between two people. Eye contact alone may not make you fall in love with someone, but it is certainly a piece of the puzzle. If you want to grow closer with someone, suggest that you try to look into each other's eyes for four minutes straight. If you don't feel comfortable stating your intention, try to make meaningful eye contact whenever you can – ideally during conversation or during an intimate moment.","completion":"Social psychologists Arthur and Elaine Aron have spent almost 50 years studying how people fall in love and have created a list of 36 questions designed to foster deep connections between two individuals.

Summarize: The price and range of the five-seater should make the vehicle appeal to new types of customers and could boost interest in other electric vehicles. Chief executive Elon Musk said his goal was to produce about 500,000 vehicles a year once production is at full speed. Within a day of the launch, Mr Musk tweeted that 180,000 vehicles had been pre-ordered. He added that, if the average price tag ended up at 42,000 (£29,500), this would equate to 7.5bn in one day. The California-based company needs the vehicle to prove popular if it is to stay in business, though pre-orders of the Model 3 will not necessarily all translate to actual sales when the car is released. The first deliveries of the vehicle are scheduled to start in late 2017, and it can be ordered in advance in dozens of countries, including the UK, Ireland, Brazil, India, China and New Zealand. The basic model will start at 35,000 (£24,423) and have a range of at least 215 miles (346km) per charge. Tesla delivered 50,580 vehicles last year. Most of those were its Model S saloon, which overtook Nissan's Leaf to become the world's best selling pure-electric vehicle. But the firm still posted a net loss of 889m (£620m) for 2015, partly because it spent 718m on research and development over the period. It left Tesla with cash reserves of 1.2bn, down from 1.9bn a year earlier. \\"For a long time there had been questions about the long term viability of Tesla,\\" commented Jessica Caldwell, an industry analyst at the car research site Edmunds. \\"With niche products like the Model S and the Model X, it hasn't been hitting any sales targets that would sustain its business. \\"So, launching what it hopes will be high-volume vehicle is going to show if it can become a fully-fledged auto company that will succeed in the long-term rather than one that pumps out a few cool cars and then goes bust, as we've seen happen with other electric car start-ups such as Fisker.\\" Read more: Are electric cars about to go mainstream? 'We had to make an affordable car' Three electric car recalls in a month Elon Musk: The driven dreamer Other details provided about the Model 3 included: Mr Musk added that the car should feel more spacious to passengers than similar-sized petrol-based cars because of design decisions Tesla could make by not using a combustion engine. \\"You are sitting a little further forward,\\" he explained. \\"That's what gives you the legroom to have five adults.\\" \\"And the rear roof area is actually one continuous pane of glass. \\"The reason that that's great is because it gives you an amazing feeling of openness. So, it has by far the best roominess of any car of this size.\\" In scenes more commonly associated with smartphone launches than those of vehicles, hundreds of people queued outside Tesla stores in the US to try to secure one of the first Model 3s. They had to pay a 1,000 deposit to reserve the car before they had even seen it. The company also began taking online orders an hour before its press event had begun. At the end of his presentation, Mr Musk said that Tesla had already received more than 115,000 orders. The move should help the firm head off competition from other forthcoming similarly-priced electric cars that will become available first, including General Motors' Chevy Bolt and BYD's Qin EV300. Part of the incentive to commit early is that a 7,500 tax credit offered to US buyers is set to be pulled once the company has sold 200,000 vehicles in the country. \\"If you look at the US auto market, the average purchase price is about 33,000, which is close to what the target for the Model 3 is,\\" said Ms Caldwell. \\"So, it becomes less of that pie-in-the-sky dream car and something that the average person can actually afford. \\"That's why people are excited about it in non-traditional Tesla markets - places outside of San Francisco Bay and Los Angeles - and why we saw lines in places like Houston and Arizona.\\" You could call it Tesla's Kickstarter campaign. At tonight's event, computers were set up for people to throw their cash into Elon Musk's coffers to fund the Model 3 project. One of them was 16-year-old Adam Metcalf, there with his father, who had saved up \\"all the allowance I've ever had\\" to put down a deposit for what will be his first car. Adam hopes to get into the driver seat when it launches at the end of next year. He'll need a serious allowance, mind, even if government subsidies eat into the 35,000 headline price. If Adam can't quite stretch that far, his deposit will be refunded. Which makes you wonder - how many of the 115,000 pre-orders (and counting) will turn into actual sales? As I say, it's like the crowdfunded pitches on Kickstarter. You don't quite know if the end product will be the success promised at launch. No doubt about it, Musk needs to sell a lot of the Model 3. While lining up to get in, I spoke to the managing director of a major European investment bank, who didn't want to be named. He said the eccentric, rocket-making Musk remains a popular figure, of course, but that patience is quickly running out. Investors are demanding profitability this year - Musk says he can deliver.

Part #3: Determining the relationship between the premise and hypothesis Usage: By comparing the premise, that details Amara Karan was born in 1984, with the hypothesis statement suggesting she was born in the 8th decade of the 20th century (1980-1989), we can deduce that the premise does entail the hypothesis. Thus, the relationship here is \\"Entailment\\". This relationship is determined by the fact that the birth date given in the premise (1984) falls within the years detailed in the hypothesis (1980-1989). Part #4: Providing an appropriate answer. Usage: After analyzing the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, the correct answer should be provided - in this case \\"Entailment\\", signifying that the given hypothesis is logically implied in the premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A beautiful girl with a master's degree went through a lot of challenges and her name was on the list. In the final stage she faced an interview together -with another girl. Both of them were outstanding , not only in looks but also in education. The girl was successful in the interview. It seemed that she would get the chance. At last the examiner asked her, \\"Can you come to the office next Monday?\\" Shocked by the unexpected question, the beautiful girl couldn't make a decision at the moment, so she said, \\"I have to talk with my parents before I give an answer. \\" The examiner felt surprised but said calmly, \\"If so, let' s wait till you are ready. \\" The next day, the girl came to tell the examiner that her parents had agreed to let her begin work next Monday. But the examiner said regretfully , \\"Sorry, another suitable candidate has got the job. You had better try another place. \\"The beautiful girl was surprised. She asked for an explanation and was told, \\"What is needed here is a person who knows her own mind. \\" That was how a good opportunity _ a beautiful girl ran away.

Among the applicants, the girl and another outstanding candidate reached the final stage of the interview process. Both candidates had excellent qualifications, not only in terms of their appearance but also in terms of their education. The girl had performed exceptionally well throughout the interview and seemed poised to secure the position. However, when the examiner asked her if she could start working the following Monday, she hesitated, stating that she needed to consult with her parents before giving an answer. The examiner expressed surprise at her response but agreed to wait for her decision. The next day, the girl returned to report that her parents had granted her permission to begin work on the scheduled date. However, the examiner regretfully informed her that the position had been offered to another suitable candidate. Although the girl was surprised and requested an explanation, she was ultimately given a valuable lesson to take away from the experience. The examiner explained that the company was looking for someone who knew their own mind, which the girl had failed to demonstrate during the interview. As a result, a good opportunity had slipped through her fingers, and she would need to search for employment elsewhere. Based on the information provided in the passage, we can infer that option C) the other girl who failed at the last interview might get the job is the most plausible answer.

Write some highlights for the following article: By. Lizzie Edmonds. Eastern Europeans will help win the independence vote for Alex Salmond, according to one SNP campaigner. Eastern Europeans will vote 'Yes' in the upcoming Scottish independence referendum winning the campaign for Alex Salmond, according to one political campaigner. Ania Lewandowska, 29, who works for SNP MEP Alyn Smith has said she is confident the party will win the referendum - thanks to the help of 'new Scots' from eastern Europe. Ms Lewandowska said: 'Poles know that change can be for the better - they are not afraid of it. Speaking with The Times, she added: 'Of course, some are still undecided - that's true of any sector of Scottish society - but in my mind most Poles will decide yes.' According to the 2011 census, 55,000 Poles are thought to be living in Scotland. About 30,000 are thought to have registered to vote so far. However, John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, said just 8 per cent of the population were EU citizens - and the likelihood of them engaging in the vote was debatable. He said: 'EU citizens are less likely to be on the register - partly it's motivational, partly it's circumstantial. How much they engage in politics is debatable.' Polls this week suggested the Yes campaign, which once trailed by a wide margin, was now only three points behind the No campaign. Earlier this week, Alex Salmond marked St George's Day by speaking positively about England in a desperate bid to boost support for the break-up of Britain. The First Minister ventured over the Border as far as Carlisle to make a speech claiming a 'strong and enduring friendship' will still endure across the British Isles if Scotland votes to leave the UK in September. In a speech at Carlisle Cathedral, Mr Salmond said people could still live in England and work in Scotland if there is a Yes vote - ignoring warnings of passport controls and separate currencies. He said: 'The ties that bind the nations of these islands will continue and flourish after Scotland becomes independent. Prime Minister David Cameron made a speech on St George's Day urging people to vote for a continued union. 'You will remain Scotland's closest friends, as well as our closest neighbours ... people would still live in Annan and work in Carlisle, or live in Penrith and work in Lockerbie. Friends and family would continue to visit each other.' Meanwhile, David Cameron used the day to urge his countrymen to embrace both Scots and the Union. The Prime Minister issued his own St George's Day message - stressing England's role in creating the enduring 'family of nations' that is the UK. In a video message, he said: 'Let's prove that we can be proud of our individual nations and be committed to our union of nations. Because no matter how great we are alone, we will always be greater together.'

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Entropy increases as temperature increases. An increase in temperature means that the particles of the substance have greater kinetic energy. The faster moving particles have more disorder than particles that are moving more slowly at a lower temperature. Q: What does increased temperature do to a substance's kinetic energy? A: Answer:","completion":"Increased temperature has a direct and significant impact on a substance's kinetic energy. To understand this relationship, we must first define kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is the energy possessed by an object due to its motion. In the context of a substance, such as a gas or liquid, the kinetic energy can be attributed to the motion of its constituent particles, such as molecules or atoms. As temperature increases, so does the average kinetic energy of the substance's particles. This is because temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles within a given substance. In other words, the higher the temperature, the more rapidly the particles are moving, on average. The increased movement results from the particles absorbing energy from their surroundings or through a direct application of heat energy to the substance. The faster moving particles in a substance with increased temperature will have greater disorder, as mentioned in the paragraph. This greater disorder is related to the concept of entropy, which is a measure of chaos or randomness within a system. Since higher temperatures lead to increased particle motion and, therefore, greater kinetic energy, entropy increases as well. This connection between temperature and entropy is rooted in the second law of thermodynamics, which states that natural processes tend to cause an increase in the overall entropy of a system. In summary, increased temperature has a direct effect on a substance's kinetic energy by increasing the average motion of its constituent particles. This increase in particle motion ultimately leads to greater disorder within the substance, as well as a higher entropy as per the second law of thermodynamics. In practical terms, this relationship between temperature and kinetic energy can have various implications depending on the context, such as altering the state of matter (e.g. solid to liquid or liquid to gas), affecting chemical reaction rates, and influencing other physical properties of a substance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given equation: -7*l - 45*l + 571 = 2*l - 3479 Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. On the left side, we have -7*l and -45*l. Combining these, we get: (-7 - 45) * l + 571 = -52*l + 571 On the right side, we have 2*l. So, the equation now becomes: -52*l + 571 = 2*l - 3479 Step 2: We will now isolate term 'l' by moving '2*l' to the left side and '571' to the right side. To move '2*l' to the left side, we'll subtract '2*l' from both sides of the equation: -52*l - 2*l = 2*l - 2*l - 3479 - 571 -54*l = -4050 Step 3: Now we will isolate 'l' by dividing both sides of the equation by -54. -54*l / -54 = -4050 / -54 l = 75 So, the solution for the equation -7*l - 45*l + 571 = 2*l - 3479 is l = 75."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Bush , however , also lashed out at the terrorist bombings in Saudi Arabia that killed at least 29 people -- including a number of Americans .","completion":"Step 1: Identify the subject and main verb in each sentence. Sentence 1: \\"The president\\" is the subject, and \\"began\\" is the main verb. Sentence 2: \\"Bush\\" is the subject, and \\"lashed out\\" is the main verb. Step 2: Identify the object and/or main idea of each sentence. Sentence 1: The object/main idea is the president's speech and his acknowledgment of the terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia. Sentence 2: The object/main idea is Bush's reaction to the terrorist bombings in Saudi Arabia. Step 3: Compare the subject, main verb, and object/main idea of both sentences. Subject: Both sentences involve the president (presumably Bush). Main verb: The actions differ, as \\"began\\" and \\"lashed out\\" signify different reactions. Object/Main idea: Both sentences mention the terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia, the death toll, and the involvement of Americans. Step 4: Determine if the sentences have the same meaning. Although both sentences reference the terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia and its consequences, the first sentence focuses on the president's speech and acknowledgment of the incident, while the second sentence emphasizes Bush's strong reaction to the bombings.

Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I'm not good at sticking to the rules, not even the ones I set myself. I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones.

In May, monthly production hit nearly 77 million barrels in the two major regions Basra and Kirkuk. That sunk, the ministry said, to fewer than 70 million in June as daily production tumbled to less than three million barrels a day.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Balls of Fury Context: Eleven year old Randy Daytona becomes anxious when he learns that his father Peter has bet on his performance in the 1988 Summer Olympics table tennis finals. During his first game between his opponent Karl Wolfschtagg from the German Democratic Republic, Daytona has an accident and suffers an injury. Unable to continue, he loses the match. Loan sharks in the employ of criminal mastermind Feng murder his father, and Daytona leaves competitive ping-pong. Nineteen years later, Daytona is dismissed from the Peppermill casino and meets FBI agent Ernie Rodriguez, who requests his assistance in arresting Feng for running guns. Feng's hidden jungle hideout hosts a black-market Ping-Pong tournament, and Daytona's invitation is a way for the FBI to infiltrate Feng's organization. When Daytona agrees, Rodriguez tells him to win enough championships that Feng's scouts notice him. After losing a local tournament, Daytona is apprenticed to a blind man in Chinatown named Wong, who was Feng's former mentor. Daytona also meets Wong's niece, Maggie. When locals vandalize Master Wong's house for violating their edict against teaching white people ping pong, Daytona is forced to play against \\"The Dragon\\", a young girl, in exchange for Wong's right to stay. After Daytona beats the Dragon, Feng's men take notice of his win and bring Daytona, Rodriguez, and Wong to Feng's facility. Daytona handily beats his first opponent, Freddy \\"Fingers\\" Wilson, though he is unnerved to learn that the tournament is literally sudden deathâthe loser is killed by a poisoned dart delivered by Feng's majordomo, Mahogany. After Daytona attempts unsuccessfully to escape, Feng invites him to join his side and reveals that he only finished half of Wong's training. He says it would be the ultimate satisfaction to win Daytona away from Wong. Feng also shows Daytona his specially modified ping-pong table.

Article: The London Underground (The Tube) The main source of public transport in London revolves around the Underground (or the Tube as it is known to Londoners). This network of 12 lines can get you to most places in the center of the city quickly. It's most necessary to get an Oyster Card or a Travelcard. Single tickets are priced starting at the intentionally absurd price of PS 4.80 (Zone 1-3), if you pay cash. Using an Oyster card, a single fare is PS 2.30 if you are traveling within the central Zone 1. On hot days it is also advisable to take a bottle of water with you as Underground trains are not air-conditioned. Last trains leave central London at around 00:30 weekdays, 23:30 Sundays. First trains leave the suburbs at around 5:00. The Bus System Outside the center of London, Tube stations are farther apart, so buses help fill the gaps. Also, the bus offers a cheaper alternative, even if it is a slower journey. Cash fares for London buses have been abolished -- you cannot pay cash. A bus fare costs PS 1.50 if using only buses, the fare is capped at PS 4.40 per day for Oyster or contactless users. River Services There are a number of different routes along the River Thames. The faster commuter services operate all day from Greenwich Pier to Embankment and from Putney and Chelsea harbour to Blackfriars during Peak Hours only. These routes will pass a number of places of interest including the Houses of Parliament and London Bridge. A return fare from Putney to Blackfriars will cost about 12 pounds. National Rail Once you leave Central London or if you are traveling South of the River Thames, the best public transport option will often be National Rail. There are numerous connections to the Rail System from the Tube. Travelcards can be used for travel on the National Rail (but not the Heathrow Express). Oyster cards can be used up to Zone 6 except certain services including Heathrow Express, Heathrow Connect and HSI. Question: When taking the London Underground, _ .

If your pilot is forced to turn back only for his lack of passing a certain test, you will be certainly shocked. This very thing happened to the passengers on Flight BE1431 on Thursday.

Sentence: \\"I put the table with books.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","completion":"To evaluate the quality of the sentence in terms of linguistics, it's important to examine its syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, which are the key areas of linguistics. Step 1: Syntax Check Syntax refers to the structural part of a sentence, the grammatical arrangement of words. The sentence \\"I put the table with books.\\" seems to lack certain information to be grammatically correct. The verb \\"put\\" usually requires a destination or a placement for the noun \\"table\\". Therefore, syntactically the sentence is lacking. Step 2: Semantics Check Semantics is the study of meaning in language. The sentence \\"I put the table with books.\\" lacks clear semantics. It's unclear from the sentence where exactly the table with books is put, which creates confusion around the intended meaning. Step 3: Pragmatics Check Pragmatics refers to the context in how language is used. Pragmatically, the sentence gives no clear context for what is happening and where. Judging from these steps, a linguist might rate this sentence as linguistically unacceptable as it lacks clarity, proper syntax and semantic meaning while also lacking in providing pragmatic context. The sentence would be more effective and linguistically acceptable if rephrased to something like, \\"I put the table filled with books in the corner of the room.\\" This statement provides a clearer account of the action, object, and placement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Body Shop was established in the UK in 1976 by the late Dame Anita Roddick. She and her company pioneered the manufacturing and selling of cosmetics that have not been tested on animals and which use natural ingredients. The Body Shop is now one of the world's biggest cosmetics chains with 3,000 stores in 66 countries L'Oreal bought the business for around 940m euros in 2006 at the height of its success but it has failed to thrive since. For its part, Natura is Brazil's top business in cosmetics, perfumes and toiletries. It sells products in seven Latin American countries as well as in France. Echoing the ethical stance of The Body Shop, Natura says its aim is to \\"improve the environment and society\\". The proposed deal with L'Oreal was first unveiled earlier this month. At the time, the L'Oreal chairman and chief executive, Jean-Paul Agon said Natura was \\"the best new owner we could imagine to nurture the brand DNA around naturality and ethics\\". The deal still needs to be approved by the Brazilian and US regulatory authorities. Selling cosmetics in Brazil is a tough business: the country is huge, consumers are demanding and often live in very remote areas, and competition is cut-throat. But it pays off, as it makes up the fourth largest cosmetics market in the world. Natura is the local leader but now it wants to become global. In 2013 it started to branch out, when it bought the Australian group Aesop. Now with the acquisition of The Body Shop, Natura will try to test its local expertise at a global level. Can it compete in a market with the likes of P&G, L'Oreal, Unilever and Avon outside its home turf?","completion":"Natura, a Brazilian cosmetics company, is reportedly paying 1 billion euros to acquire The Body Shop from the French group L'Oreal. The Body Shop, established by Dame Anita Roddick in the UK in 1976, pioneered the use of cosmetics that were not tested on animals and made from natural ingredients. L'Oreal had purchased The Body Shop in 2006 but it has struggled to achieve success since then. Currently, The Body Shop is one of the largest cosmetics chains globally, with 3,000 stores across 66 countries. Natura is Brazil's leading business in cosmetics, perfumes, and toiletries, with a presence in seven Latin American countries and France. Like The Body Shop, Natura aims to improve the environment and society with its ethical stance. The proposed deal with L'Oreal needs approval from Brazilian and US regulatory authorities before it can be finalized. Selling cosmetics in Brazil is challenging due to its large size, demanding consumers who often live in remote areas, and intense competition. However, Brazil is the fourth largest cosmetics market globally. Currently a local leader, Natura aims to establish a global presence. In 2013, it acquired Australian group Aesop, and now with the acquisition of The Body Shop, Natura plans to leverage its local expertise on a global scale. It remains to be seen if Natura can compete with giants like P&G, L'Oreal, Unilever, and Avon outside its home market following this acquisition."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This article: The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\" Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose publisher was Giulio ?, what is it ?

Article: Lolo Jones talked Lauryn Williams into trying bobsledding, dangling the potential of another Olympic trip as her bait. Little did they know they were talking about history. Jones and Williams -- both Summer Olympic veterans -- were among the selections Sunday night for the U.S. Olympic bobsled team, putting them in position to join a very exclusive club. Barring something unforeseen, they will become the ninth and 10th Americans to compete in both the summer and winter versions of the Games when they compete at the Sochi Olympics next month. Lolo Jones, picked to compete next month in Sochi, will join only a handful of other Americans who took part in both the summer and winter Games. AP Photo/Rick Bowmer Jones, Williams and Aja Evans were the three women chosen out of a six-woman pool for the push athlete spots, that word coming at a team meeting where half the candidates saw their Olympic dreams realized and the other half saw them come to a quiet end. \\"I was definitely very nervous entering the room,\\" Jones said. \\"I'm usually used to looking up at a screen after I cross the finish line to see the results. You're just like anxious, armpits are sweating, don't know what's going to happen.\\" Jones was one hurdle away from winning gold at the Beijing Olympics, then finished fourth at the London Games. Looking for a break from the spotlight but not sports, she turned to bobsled in the fall of 2012, winning a World Cup medal in her first race and quickly announcing herself as a legit Sochi contender. Then she recruited Williams after the 2012 400-meter relay gold medalist and former world champion sprinter retired from track, talking her into the bobsled game. And all Williams has done as a rookie is help the U.S. win three medals in her four World Cup races, including a gold on Sunday. \\"I joined bobsled just to be a helper and to add positive energy to the team,\\" Williams said. \\"If my name wasn't called, I wasn't going to be upset. I've enjoyed this journey. I've enjoyed getting to know everyone. I've enjoyed the challenge.\\" At the University of Miami, where Williams was a star sprinter, the Olympic berth was big news. \\"When she is determined to achieve something she is one of the most driven and competitive athletes I have ever been associated with,\\" Miami track coach Amy Deem said. Jones and Williams will join Evans, another Winter Olympic first-timer, and drivers Jamie Greubel, Elana Meyers and Jazmine Fenlator on the women's team. \\"This is the deepest field of push athletes we've ever had,\\" said Darrin Steele, the CEO of the U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton Federation. \\"We knew heading into the season that the Olympic selection was going to be extremely difficult. It's a good problem to have, but it meant that some outstanding athletes would not make the Olympic team.\\" It also gave Sunday's selections a somber feel. Williams and Jones both said they felt for the athletes who weren't picked. \\"I had no idea what was in store for me this season,\\" Williams said. \\"I just wanted to come in with positive energy and help out. This is the first time I've been a part of a true team sport, and there's someone else counting on you. You can't let that person down, and that's what drives me. It's very important to give everything I have whenever I'm on that start line.\\" The U.S. qualified three men's two-man sleds and two four-man sleds for Sochi. Reigning Olympic four-man champion Steven Holcomb will drive USA-1 and Nick Cunningham will be at the control of USA-2 in four-man. Cory Butner will drive the other two-man entry. Holcomb and his crew of Curt Tomasevicz, Steve Langton and Chris Fogt will be USA-1. Holcomb snapped a 62-year U.S. gold medal drought in the four-man event at the 2010 Vancouver Games, and now will try to give the U.S. its first two-man gold since 1936. Justin Olsen, Johnny Quinn and Dallas Robinson will push Cunningham's four-man sled. Robinson was one of the men's push athletes on the fence of qualifying as well, and said he passed the time waiting out the selection meeting in a rather unusual manner. \\"I was eating chocolate donuts, because I figure I was either going to celebrate or I was going to eat myself into a coma,\\" Robinson said. So there was some levity in a stressful night, but the relief was evident among those on the team. About two hours after the team selection was made, Jones posted her reaction on Facebook, summing up the emotions of having another chance to compete for an Olympic medal. \\"Had I not hit a hurdle in Beijing I would not have tried to go to London to redeem myself,\\" she wrote. \\"Had I not got fourth in London I would not have tried to find another way to accomplish the dream. Bobsled was my fresh start. Bobsled humbled me. Bobsled made me stronger. Bobsled made me hungry. Bobsled made me rely on faith. Bobsled gave me hope. I push a bobsled but bobsled pushed me to never give up on my dreams.\\" ||||| Lolo Jones and Lauryn Williams were used to crossing a finish line, taking deep breaths and peering up at a scoreboard to learn if they had made an Olympic Team. No wonder they were nervous Sunday night. The U.S. Olympic Bobsled Team announcement was not so cut and dry. The athletes entered a room after a six-person committee deliberated, and they listened. “After my name was called,” Jones said, “it was a deep sigh of relief.” Both of their names were officially called around the stroke of midnight in Austria. Jones and Williams, with five Summer Olympics between them, were selected to their first Winter Olympic teams. “The biggest honor I’ll ever have in my life is representing Team USA,” Jones said. “I’m overwhelmed with emotions.” The rest of the U.S. Olympic women’s bobsled team are drivers Jamie Greubel, Elana Meyers and Jazmine Fenlator and Meyers’ usual push athlete, Aja Evans (full men’s team at bottom). Driver and push athlete combinations will be decided later, according to U.S. Bobsled. Embedded owg_slideshow: Sochi 2014: The U.S. Olympic bobsled team Jones, 31, hopes to reverse Olympic heartbreak in Sochi and win her first medal. In 2008, she was favored to win the 100m hurdles and leading the final when she clipped the ninth of 10 hurdles and stumbled to seventh place. She cried alone in a hallway underneath the Beijing Olympic Stadium. In 2012, she finished fourth in the 100m hurdles, one tenth of a second off the podium. Jones picked up bobsledding shortly after the London Games at the urging of 2010 Olympic bronze medalist Meyers. A quick learner, she finished the 2012-13 season as the No. 4 push athlete on the U.S. team. “The bobsled process is definitely more stressful,” than track and field, Jones said. “As a brakeman, there’s a lot of criteria and races. It’s not just one and done. it’s the course of a season.” Williams, 30, learned that this year. She won Olympic gold in the 4x100m relay in London and silver in the 100m in Athens in 2004. Last summer, Jones planted the seed for Williams to convert at a track meet. Williams, who went to the University of Miami, was well aware of the drawbacks, not the least of which was the climate change. She tried out and sprouted quickly, climbing the push athlete ladder faster than Jones had the year before. Embedded owg_slideshow: Through the years: Lolo Jones Williams capped her pre-Olympic season by winning her first World Cup race, pushing for Greubel in Igls, Austria, earlier Sunday. That likely cemented her spot on the Olympic Team over the more seasoned Katie Eberling, who had more experience with Greubel but had never won with Greubel. “I joined bobsled just to be a helper and add positive energy to the team,” said Williams, who could become the fifth person to win a medal in the Summer and Winter Olympics and second to win golds in each. “If my name wasn’t called [Sunday], I wasn’t going to be upset. I’ve enjoyed this journey.” The competition among five women for three push athlete spots was close all season, which brought extra nerves to Sunday’s announcement. A six-person committee that chose the team considered World Cup race finishes and combine scores and push championships results from the summer and took drivers’ input. Eberling and 2010 Olympian Emily Azevedo were left off. “We do our best to look at performance numbers,” U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton Federation CEO Darrin Steele said. “It’s a team sport, so there’s always a little bit of uncertainty with the numbers that we get.” A total of 128 athletes have competed in Summer and Winter Olympics, according to OlympStats.com. The last American to do so was Chris Witty, who competed in cycling in 2000 and speed skating in 1994, 1998, 2002 and 2006. The outgoing, joke-cracking Jones continued to make headlines off the ice over the last 16 months. She made light of her bobsled paycheck in a Vine in June and agreed to a date with a college student via Twitter and was involved in a Lake Placid, N.Y., incident in July. Snowboarder Shaun White and hockey player Patrick Kane are the only 2014 U.S. Olympians with more Twitter followers than Jones. ”The determination in me, I wish people could see that,” Jones told The Associated Press earlier in January. ”It’s not a gimmick. It’s not for publicity. It never was. It’s always been about me achieving a dream and being able to tell that story down the road, that I never gave up and I fought hard.” It would not be a surprise to see the U.S. win two medals in women’s bobsled for the first time. Greubel and Meyers rank second and third, respectively, in this season’s World Cup standings. They trail reigning Olympic and world champion Kaillie Humphries of Canada. Fenlator ranks seventh. “The podium,” Williams said, “is where we’re headed.” Here is the complete 2014 U.S. Olympic Bobsled Team: Four-Man Steven Holcomb, Chris Fogt, Steve Langton, Curt Tomasevicz Nick Cunningham, Justin Olsen, Johnny Quinn, Dallas Robinson Two-Man Steve Holcomb and one of the six above push athletes Nick Cunningham and one of the six above push athletes Cory Butner and one of the six above push athletes Two-Woman Jamie Greubel Elana Meyers Jazmine Fenlator Aja Evans Lolo Jones Lauryn Williams ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Lolo Jones and Lauryn Williams, both Summer Olympic veterans, were selected for the U.S. Olympic bobsled team, making them the ninth and tenth Americans to compete in both summer and winter versions of the Games.

Relating to real-life situations: In the real world, newspapers are typically delivered to residential homes and placed in accessible locations for the homeowner to retrieve them easily. 3. Eliminating the unrelated answers: With the context of delivering newspapers in mind, we can start eliminating the possible answers that do not fit the context: a. Library and subway: These are public places, not individual residential locations where newspapers are delivered. b. Jail: Newspapers are unlikely to be delivered to individual prison cells or prisoners in a jail. c.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine.

At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about.

The empire covered a vast territory stretching from the Iranian plateau to Mesopotamia and eventually extended to the Caucasus and Central Asia. The Arsacid rulers were known for their skill in diplomacy, military organization, and the integration of different cultures, which helped maintain a multi-ethnic empire. As the King of Kings of Iran, Gotarzes II would have held significant power and influence in his time, ruling over the vast Parthian Empire. While in power, Gotarzes II faced several challenges both internally and externally, including conflict with the Roman Empire. Nevertheless, his rule marked an important period in the history of the Arsacid Dynasty. In conclusion, the information provided suggests that it is about Gotarzes II, a ruler in the Arsacid Dynasty, who reigned as the King of Kings of Iran between 40 and 51 AD. The image of his coin, his religious beliefs, and his position in the wider context of the Arsacid Dynasty and ancient Persian history further support this identification."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Public holidays in the United Kingdom Public holidays in the United Kingdom are days on which most businesses and non-essential services are closed, although an increasing number of retail businesses (especially the larger ones) do open on some of the public holidays. There are restrictions on trading on Sundays and Christmas Day in England and Wales and on New Year's Day and Christmas Day in Scotland. Legally defined holidays, analogous to \`\`public holidays'' in many other countries, are usually called bank holidays in the United Kingdom, but can also be referred to as \`\`public holidays''; strictly, however, \`\`public holidays'' refer to \`\`common law holidays'', the observance of which derive from custom and practice (see \`\`Terminology'' below). Choose your answer from: A). no; B). yes; Is this statement correct \\"is a bank holiday considered a working day\\"?","completion":"A detailed and long answer providing explanation: The statement \\"is a bank holiday considered a working day\\" is NOT correct. In the context of the United Kingdom, the appropriate answer would be A) no. Bank holidays, as mentioned, are days on which most businesses and non-essential services are closed, similar to public holidays in many other countries. These days are recognized as non-working days for many organizations, and employees generally receive time off. However, it is important to note that not every business and industry observe bank holidays, and some may remain open or functional, such as retail stores and some service industries. The term \\"bank holiday\\" originated in the United Kingdom during the late 19th century, when the Bank Holidays Act 1871 was passed. The act established four official holidays to allow banks and businesses to be closed, so that employees would have the opportunity to spend time with their families and participate in leisure activities. The number and names of bank holidays have evolved over time, but the concept of providing designated non-working days for people to enjoy still remains. In the UK, there are eight standard bank holidays recognized annually, though the number may vary slightly between England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland due to regional differences. The standard bank holidays include: 1. New Year's Day (January 1st) - A day to celebrate the beginning of the new year. 2. Good Friday - A Christian holiday commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, which takes place on the Friday before Easter Sunday. 3. Easter Monday - A Christian holiday celebrated on the Monday after Easter Sunday. 4. Early May Bank Holiday (May Day) - A holiday on the first Monday in May, celebrating the arrival of spring. 5. Spring Bank Holiday - A holiday on the last Monday in May, providing an extended weekend at the end of the month. 6. Summer Bank Holiday - A holiday on the last Monday in August in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, or the first Monday in August in Scotland, providing an extended weekend for leisure activities. 7. Christmas Day (December 25th) - A Christian holiday celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ. 8. Boxing Day (December 26th) - A holiday that follows Christmas Day, generally used to relax or visit family and friends. Additionally, there are other regional-specific holidays in the United Kingdom, such as St. Patrick's Day (Northern Ireland), St. Andrew's Day (Scotland), and St. George's Day (England), among others. In conclusion, a bank holiday in the United Kingdom is not considered a working day for most businesses and employees. These holidays provide time off for people to engage in leisure activities and spend time with their families. However, it is crucial to recognize that some organizations and sectors may continue operating on bank holidays, depending on their nature and requirements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The equation is: -78*v - 73*v + 2784 = 41*v - 105*v Step 1: Combine the \\"v\\" terms on both sides of the equation. On the left side, we have -78*v and -73*v. If you have 78 less \\"v\\" and then 73 less \\"v\\": -78*v - 73*v = (-78 - 73)*v = -151*v On the right side, we have 41*v and -105*v.

To do that, we can add 151*v to both sides of the equation: (-151*v + 2784) + 151*v = (-64*v) + 151*v Now, both sides will look like this: 2784 = 87*v Step 3: Solve for \\"v.\\" To find \\"v,\\" we need to divide both sides by 87: 2784 ÷ 87 = v So, v = 32 Now we know that the value of \\"v\\" is 32!"},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Summarize the following: Conduct research about your target market. You can look up information online or at a library, or you can conduct your own experiments by polling members of your target market or giving them samples to try to review. Make sure to consider what your target market should be. Certain demographics to consider include age, gender, education level, location, interests, ethnicity, and sexual orientation. Once you have some feedback about your product and more information about your target market, make any changes that seem appropriate to perfect it for your market. Remember that while you will get widely differing opinions, if there are common criticisms of your product, they are probably correct and should be addressed. Think about how much money you will have to market your product in the beginning. This will determine what type of marketing you do and sometimes what strategy you use. You will need to determine how much of your product at what price will need to sell in order to keep your business afloat. This is very, very important. Balancing this will be tricky and it may take some time to figure out the right formula. This is when you will need to write out and specify your sales timeline, target market needs, priorities, objectives, challenges, how you will acquire new business, and how you will grow your existing business. A sales plan will be necessary if you want investors to consider your product. There are a number of different ways you can market your product, or different approaches in who you market to and what aspect of people you appeal to in your marketing. These strategies can bring you widely different customers or they can help you soar with a specific set of people. Consider a concentrated marketing strategy. This is when your marketing appeals to and is targeted at only your target market. This is commonly seen with luxury items, which get marketed to very specific parts of a population, but can also be seen in other areas as well. Think Teen Magazine. Consider an undifferentiated marketing strategy. This is when your marketing appeals to and is targeted at pretty much everybody, and certainly a very broad audience. This strategy works well when you have a product which is broadly useful or appealing. Usually this means the traditional marketing mediums: television ads, print ads, and billboards for example. Consider a differentiated marketing strategy. This is when your marketing takes different aspects of your product and markets it to different demographics. Use the price, for example, to market to customers with a limited budget who may be looking for something less costly than your competitor's products. Meanwhile, use convenience to make your product appeal to a local market. Give samples, trials, or introductory sales to show your customer base why they want your product. You can do this by handing out samples outside your store, or finding a complementary business with whom your product can be paired with for short run, among a number of other ways. This will help build your initial business base and is very important. Continue to test your marketing strategy as you go through this initial phase, to ensure that you are taking the right approach for your market. Once you've had a certain measure of success and you feel your product is ready, you can expand your market by getting your product into major retailers. You will want to consider where you should sell (Walmart, etc.). Following the advice in the Serious Success section will be very important, as stores will not want to carry your product if they feel you are unprepared to handle the volume.","completion":"To research your target market, gather information through online sources, libraries, polls, or product samples.

Here are possible answers to this question: - china - festival - istanbul - arabia - india I believe the correct choice is \\"india\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"India is indeed the correct choice, and I'll provide a comprehensive explanation for this selection, while also briefly touching on the other options. India is known for its vibrant markets, and attending a bazaar is a quintessential experience of the country's rich culture, history, and traditions. Bazaars, or markets, have been an essential part of the economic and social landscape in India for centuries. They serve not only as places for buying and selling goods but also for social interaction and cultural exchange. India's bazaars offer an eclectic mix of products, including spices, textiles, handicrafts, jewelry, and street food. Some famous bazaars in India include: 1. Chandni Chowk, Delhi: Both a historic and bustling marketplace, Chandni Chowk remains one of the oldest and busiest markets in Old Delhi. Its narrow lanes are lined with shops offering everything from food, spices, clothing, and jewelry. 2. Chor Bazaar, Mumbai: Chor Bazaar, or Thieves Market, captures the essence of a bustling Indian bazaar. It's an ideal place to find antiques, vintage items, and eclectic treasures. 3. Johari Bazaar, Jaipur: This famous bazaar, located in the heart of Jaipur's Pink City, is renowned for its exquisite gold and silver jewelry, as well as precious stones. 4. Dilli Haat, Delhi: An open-air market that showcases diverse handicrafts and rich culture from various states of India. Dilli Haat is perfect for finding handcrafted souvenirs and unique items. Now, let's briefly discuss the other options: - China: While China is home to some famous markets such as the Panjiayuan Antique Market in Beijing, they are not as synonymous with the term 'bazaar' as India. - Festival: While festivals may have local bazaars or markets set up temporarily during their duration, the term 'festival' typically refers to a cultural or religious event rather than a marketplace. - Istanbul: Istanbul, Turkey, is home to some renowned bazaars, with the Grand Bazaar being one of the oldest and most famous in the world. Although Istanbul is also known for its bazaars, the cultural significance and the diversity of bazaars in India make it a more fitting choice. - Arabia: In Arabic-speaking countries, markets are typically referred to as 'souks.' While they share similarities with bazaars, they possess regional distinctions that set them apart, making the term 'bazaar' more specifically associated with the Indian subcontinent. In conclusion, while there are indeed famous bazaars and markets in various places like China, Istanbul, and Arabia, the term 'bazaar' is particularly associated with the cultural and social landscape of India. Hence, of all the options listed, India is the most fitting answer for attending a famous bazaar."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Not only will this make your stained glass lamp look more authentic, but it will be easier to paint as well. Purchase a lamp shade with 4 or more panels set into a metal frame. Vintage lamp shades work especially well here. How you do this depends on the type of lamp you have. In most cases, you will have to remove the lamp shade from the fixture first, then pop the glass panels out. Take the frame outside or into a well-ventilated area. Set it down onto a sheet of newspaper, then give it 1 to 2 coats of black spray paint. Let the paint dry 15 to 20 minutes between coats of paint. Spray paint formulated for metal will work the best. If you can't find any, spray the frame with primer first. Let it dry, then apply your desired spray paint. Wash the panels with warm, soapy water first. Rinse them with plain water, then dry them off with a towel. Wipe them down with rubbing alcohol when you are done. This will remove any residue and oils that may keep the paint from sticking. From now on, try to handle the glass by the edges as much as possible, otherwise you might get oil onto it. Place each panel onto a sheet of paper, then trace around it with a pen or pencil. Lift the panels away, then draw your design inside the panel. Make sure that all of the lines connect, just like in real stained glass. You don't have to invent the stained glass designs yourself. Try coloring book pages or stained glass templates. Set the glass panels on top of the paper, making sure to match them up with the original tracings. If you will be using glue to make the leading and paint, coat the glass panels with clear, acrylic sealer. This will give the glue something to stick to. You can do this right over the paper. You'll be working on this project over the course of 2 to 3 days, so set up your workstation some place that won't get in the way. Purchase a bottle of black glass paint leading from the craft store. Apply the leading straight onto the glass from the bottle's nozzle. Start from the left side if you are right-handed, and vice versa if you are left-handed; this way, you won't smear your work. Make sure that the lines connect, or the paint will bleed when you apply it. If you don't want to use glass paint, use black puffy paint or black dimensional paint instead. Make your own puffy paint by mix 1 teaspoon of black acrylic paint into an 8-ounce (240-mL) bottle of white school glue. This is vital, regardless of the type of media you used: glass paint leading, puffy paint, or glue. If the outlines are still wet, then the next part won't work. Some paint needs longer to dry. Check the label on your bottle of paint if you are not sure. Purchase bottles of glass paint from the craft store; choose the type that comes with a nozzle. Squeeze the paint into each space of your design. Make sure that the paint fills the spaces between the leading completely. You may have to spread it with the nozzle. Mix your own glass paint by mixing clear school glue with acrylic paint. Use 1 to 2 drops of acrylic paint to 1 tablespoon of glue. You can use stained glass filler for this step. It is thinner and more fluid than other types of glass paint. It tends to be translucent. Glass paint comes in different finishes. Translucent will look the most realistic, but you can try matte, opaque, or sparkly. Apply your first color to 1 side of the space, and your second color to the other side. Swirl them together towards the middle with a brush. The glue-and-acrylic paint mixture may dry faster, but you will need to wait at least 24 hours if you used real glass paint. Keep in mind that some brands also include a curing time, so double-check the label for complete drying and curing instructions. If you notice any gaps in your paint, wait until the paint dries, then fill them in with a permanent marker in a matching color.

Options: A. air B. pick berries C. sky D. breathe E. reproduce Answer:","completion":"Option E, Reproduce. Birds reproduce by laying eggs. This process of reproduction is a key aspect of the life cycle of birds. Birds belong to a class of egg-laying organisms called oviparous animals. These animals primarily reproduce by laying eggs that develop and hatch outside the parent's body. In the case of birds, the female typically lays eggs in a nest that has been built by either the male, female, or both. The nest offers the eggs a safe environment to grow and develop over time. During the incubation period, at least one parent bird usually helps to maintain the temperature and humidity required for successful embryo growth. The warmth provided by the parent can be through brooding or sitting on the eggs, which help regulate the temperature for the young embryo inside. Once the eggs have been fertilized, a new life begins to form inside the eggshell, surrounded by a fluid called amniotic fluid. Within the egg, the embryo receives its nourishment from the nutrient-rich yolk and the albumen, which is the egg white. As the embryo grows larger, it's eventually able to break through the eggshell, a process known colloquially as \\"hatching.\\" The hatching of the birds varies depending on the type of species, and it may take anywhere from days to months. After hatching, birds are either born as altricial, which means they are born naked, blind, and dependent on their parents, or precocial, which means they are born more developed with feathers, open eyes, and can start moving around soon after hatching. In summary, birds reproduce by laying eggs, a natural process integral to their life cycle and survival. This reproductive strategy allows birds to continue their species by producing offspring that will eventually mature and participate in the reproduction process themselves."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: The scheme involves replacing legitimate cash - intended for bank transfer overseas - with \\"dirty\\" money. Shopkeeper Muhammed Hameed, his uncle Saleem Shikari and worker Shahid Aslam pled guilty to the charges under the Proceeds of Crime Act. They hid almost Â£700,000 from the authorities, the High Court heard. The men were detained as part of Operation Confab - a huge probe set-up to catch Hameed and his associates. The term \\"cuckoo smurfing\\" is used to describe a certain type of money laundering. Cuckoo refers to the fact those involved pay sums of money into accounts of other unsuspecting individuals. This is likened to the way a cuckoo will lay its eggs in the nests of other species of birds. Smurfing refers to paying multiple amounts of cash into a variety of accounts. In 2013, when police moved in, the three were caught red-handed with a plastic bag stuffed with Â£75,000 of banknotes at Hameed's flat in Dundee. A judge remanded Hameed, 32, Aslam, 36, and 52-year-old Shikari in custody. They face a lengthy jail-term when they are sentenced next month. The High Court in Glasgow heard that police got a tip-off that Hameed was involved in a large scale money laundering operation with international links. Prosecutor Steven Borthwick said the scan involved an unsuspecting overseas customer sending funds to the UK to another innocent individual. Unknown to them, the person handling the transfer would be linked to a money laundering gang. This person - known as the \\"controller\\" - would then pass on the account details. The gang would replace the money with illegitimate cash, leaving the customer none the wiser. The money originally deposited overseas was retained by the \\"controller\\" who transferred it to \\"a cash pool account\\" often based in Dubai. Mr Borthwick added: \\"The criminal proceeds raised by the UK based crime gangs have thus been successfully laundered and the gang owes nothing but a commission to the 'controller' for his work. \\"It is a sophisticated crime operated by a syndicate of highly organised crime gangs.\\" Police worked with the National Crime Agency, watching Hameed and his associates for several months. The court heard that the shopkeeper and Shikari and Aslam were seen making \\"multiple cash deposits\\" at banks in Dundee, on an \\"almost daily basis\\" often involving \\"significant sums of money\\". Detectives eventually moved in after Hameed was spotted collecting a suspicious bag near his home. When police entered his flat they found the trio and discovered the bag contained Â£75,150 in mixed banknotes. It was said to be \\"dirty money\\" belonging to a Scotland-based crime group. Mr Borthwick said Hameed carried out an \\"organisational role\\" and the other two played \\"lesser, although still significant\\" parts in the offence. Hameed, Shikari and Aslam had originally gone to trial, but admitted their guilt during the case. A co-accused Philip Reid, 47, of Glasgow, also faced a Proceeds of Crime charge, but his not guilty plea was accepted.","completion":"Three men got caught doing something called \\"cuckoo smurfing.\\" This is a tricky way to hide money they shouldn't have.

But now, Mr Brunetti plans to return to the US within a month after an appeals court in Montevideo ruled he would not have the right to have Luciano brought back if he is ever found. Scroll down for video. Desperate: Guy Brunetti, 47, has spent 18 months desperately trying and failing to rescue his two young sons, including Octavio (center), from Uruguay after they were abducted by his wife, Ivanna Soto (right) in May 2013. Devoted: Mr Brunetti (pictured with Octavio before his abduction), from Eastchester, New York, flew to the South American country after his 42-year-old spouse, then four months' pregnant, fled there in May 2013. Missing: For the past year and a half, the father has been fighting for the legal right to rescue Octavio (pictured), as well as his younger son, Luciano, whom he has never met and would now be 14 months old. However, despite the ruling, the devoted father has vowed to not give up his 70,000-plus fight to have his two children returned to New York, saying: 'I've hit a wall [but] the battle continues'. In a phone interview with The Journal News, he said: 'I'll probably come home to go to Washington and do some leg work there in the United States, then probably head back to Uruguay.' Last year, Mr Brunetti, who has been fighting for his sons while living in a Montevideo-based room that he rents weekly, was granted the right to have Octavio returned to the US by an appeals court. However, upon hearing of the decision, Ms Soto, a Uruguay native, dropped all contact with her husband and fled with their two sons. She is now a fugitive sought by Interpol. 'It's unexplainable,' Mr Brunetti told ABC News. 'It's this torture I live with every second, every minute, every hour of the day. It's a situation that no parent should have to go through.' Mr Brunetti started dating Ms Soto in 2009 after first meeting her in 1997. The pair initially lived in Uruguay, where they married and had Octavio, before moving to Eastchester for financial reasons. Before the abduction: But now, Mr Brunetti (pictured with Octavio) plans to return to the US within a month after an appeals court ruled he would not have the right to have Luciano brought back if he is ever found. Mother and son: A young Octavio is pictured with Ms Soto, who is now a fugitive who is sought by Interpol. Escape: Mr Brunetti has vowed to not give up his 70,000-plus fight to have his two children returned to New York, saying: 'I've hit a wall [but] the battle continues'. Above, Ms Soto fled from New York to Uruguay. On May 22, 2013, when Ms Soto was four months' pregnant, Mr Brunetti, an auto parts wholesaler, came home to find his wife had fled with Octavio. He flew to Uruguay and begged her to return. Having no luck, he filed a motion under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction to have his son returned to the US. The motion was granted on October 2, 2013. On November 27 this year, he lost a second legal battle to have the right to have Luciano returned. It remains unclear why Ms Soto initially fled the US, nor why she did not inform her husband. Happier times: 'It's unexplainable,' Mr Brunetti said of his desperate fight to rescue his sons. 'It's this torture I live with every second, every minute, every hour of the day.' Above, Mr Brunetti with Octavio as a baby. Fight: Mr Brunetti's fight has gained widespread support from friends, relatives and members of the public. In addition to a Bring Octavio Home Facebook page (pictured), there is a dedicated gofundme.com page.

Identify the subject: \\"The big boy\\" is the subject of the sentence. It is a noun phrase that consists of an article (\\"the\\"), an adjective (\\"big\\"), and a noun (\\"boy\\"). This noun phrase is properly formed and intelligible. 2. Identify the verb: \\"was kissed\\" is the verb phrase. It is a past passive form of the verb \\"kiss\\" (kissed + auxiliary verb \\"was\\"). Since the action is performed on the subject, using passive voice is appropriate in this case. 3.

If your waiter or waitress is not the only person who’s served you in some way, it’s customary to tip the other servers, too. For example, if you received the benefit of a wine steward, it’s customary to also tip 15 percent the cost of the bottle of wine. You can tip the coatroom attendant about 1 per coat or 2 for the parking valet or garage attendant, if you’ve left your car with them while dining. You can leave a smaller tip to your restaurant server if the food is served buffet style or the server brings you drinks only, but you should still tip between 10 and 15 percent. Some restaurants have washroom attendants; tip them 50 cents to 1. You might want to tip the headwaiter or captain separately also. When buying something over a counter, say morning coffee, you are generally not expected to tip. You can download apps to your smart phone that will calculate the tip for you if you plug in the amount of your bill. Most smart phones also come with a calculator, which will allow you to calculate the tip yourself, depending on the amount you decide to leave. Various websites will calculate the tip for you. All you have to do is plug in the amount of your bill, and the percentage amount of the tip you want to leave. In some states, the sales tax is about 5 percent. If that’s the case, you could multiply the sales tax listed on your bill by three in order to get 15 percent. If you used any coupons or discounts, calculate the tip based on how much you would've paid without it. Otherwise, you're punishing the waiter for the restaurant management's efforts to bring you in the door. Many servers absolutely rely on tips to survive. The fact they receive tips is calculated into a lower hourly wage in the first place. It’s not uncommon for servers to make just over 2 an hour before they receive tips. They often make well under minimum wage. Although American states have different minimum wages, the federal minimum wage for tipped restaurant workers is just 2.13. Some servers also are required to share or pool their tips at the end of the night or to contribute for tips to bartenders, lowering their overall haul. You are not legally required to leave a tip, however you’re being very unfair to your server if you do not do so. There’s no upside in being a jerk, but if you truly received awful service, you shouldn’t feel obligated to leave a full tip. Try communicating with the server first, though, about what’s making you unhappy to give the server a chance to fix it. A tip to a server is meant to acknowledge good service. If your server ignored you, had a bad attitude, or served your food late, it’s OK to not leave a full tip. Assess how the food matched your order, whether the food was hot and fresh, how attentive the server was, how quickly your empty dishes were removed, and whether the server was courteous. You might want to explain the lack of a tip, in nice and constructive terms, on the bill when you pay the check, though. Some believe you should still give at least 10 percent even if you’ve received poor service. Take care to determine whether the poor service was really the server’s fault. For example, perhaps the kitchen didn’t get the food to the server on time or management understaffed the restaurant. It can make a server’s day to be told you thought their service wasn’t just good but was impeccable. Why not let them know? Write a little note on the bill when you pay your bill explaining what you thought the server did really well. Better yet, call over the manager and tell the manager about the good job the server did. Always treat your server to a smile and be kind and polite. Service jobs can be stressful enough without people taking out their bad days on the server! Summary:","completion":"This article emphasizes the importance of tipping servers, as well as other staff who provide service, at restaurants; it offers guidelines for tipping amounts, highlights the reliance of servers on tips due to low wages, and encourages communication with servers regarding good or poor service."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the answer: In what year did the Aberfan disaster take place?","completion":"The Aberfan disaster took place on October 21, 1966. Aberfan is a small village located in South Wales, United Kingdom. On the tragic day, after weeks of heavy rain, a catastrophic collapse occurred at the colliery spoil tip, situated on a mountain slope above the village. A spoil \\"tip\\" is a pile of waste rock or mining debris removed during coal extraction. At Aberfan, the tip's buildup of waste material became destabilized by the rainwater that had seeped into it. The eventual collapse led to a devastating avalanche of coal, slurry, and debris that surged downhill, quickly destroying a farm, multiple houses, and eventually reaching Pantglas Junior School. The sheer force and speed of the avalanche overwhelmed the school, and it was completely demolished, leading to a significant loss of life. Of the 144 people who died in the Aberfan disaster, 116 were children from Pantglas Junior School. Additionally, 28 adults perished, including school staff and local residents. The disaster was a devastating event for the tight-knit community and remains one of the most heartbreaking tragedies in Welsh history. The Aberfan disaster spurred a widespread outcry, leading to governmental inquiries and official investigations into the causes of the tragedy. The inquiries were to determine if such a calamity could have been prevented and to identify any negligence on the part of the National Coal Board or regional authorities. One critical finding was that the spoil tip was located atop a natural spring, and the combination of heavy rainfall and the spring's sub-surface water led to the tip's liquefaction and eventual collapse. Following the Aberfan disaster, the National Coal Board was held responsible for the tragedy. A series of substantial changes took place afterward, which improved the safety and management of coal mining operations and the disposal of mining waste. New legislation was enacted, and policies were implemented to prevent similar disasters from occurring in the future. The people of Aberfan have since worked tirelessly to heal their community and remember those who perished in the disaster. Memorials, monuments, and local commemorations are held to honor the victims and ensure that the tragic event is never forgotten. Despite the passage of time, the Aberfan disaster remains an integral part of Welsh history and a sobering reminder of the need for constant vigilance in matters of public safety and environmental stewardship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Anti-government protesters in Thailand have stormed the offices of the country's finance ministry, as mass demonstrations raise political tensions to the highest level since the deadly unrest of 2010. Anti-government protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban, a former deputy prime minister under the previous Democrat-led government, led the group of protesters who entered the ministry compound, in the protesters' boldest act since demonstrations broke out three weeks ago. Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher with Human Rights Watch, told CNN the compound had been taken over by protesters, pockets of whom had become increasingly hostile to local and foreign media. He said a German photographer had earlier been attacked during a protest at the headquarters of the Royal Thai Police Monday morning, where thousands of demonstrators had called for an audience with police bosses. \\"We demand to meet with Police Commissioner-General Adul Saengsingkaew,\\" protest leader Puttipong Punnakun told CNN. More than three weeks of anti-government protests led by the opposition Democrat Party rose to a crescendo Sunday as about 100,000 demonstrators turned out in Bangkok, and escalated Monday as leaders vowed to extend their rallies to government offices, TV networks and military installations. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra responded by extending the areas around Bangkok where police are enforcing an internal security law that restricts gatherings by demonstrators. \\"What has been going on now is affecting people's livelihoods and orderliness, as well as disrupting services at government offices,\\" she said Monday. \\"Therefore it is necessary for the government to enforce the law.\\" The government had imposed the security measures in central Bangkok several weeks ago. But the law hasn't so far been strictly enforced. Thaugsuban told demonstrators gathered Sunday of plans to march on media outlets and government buildings Monday, calling on civil servants to join the cause. \\"We will separate into 13 groups to march to 13 locations to express our stance,\\" he said. \\"Our protest will not stop until Thaksin's regime is wiped out.\\" Protest leaders are calling for an end to the government of Yingluck, sister of former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, the telecommunications tycoon who was ousted in a 2006 coup. Critics of the Thai prime minister accuse her of being a puppet of her older brother Thaksin, a deeply polarizing figure who was removed from power by the military while in New York in 2006. He has since lived in exile, except for a brief return in 2008, and was convicted by Thai courts for corruption and sentenced in absentia to two years in jail later that year. The current protests have reanimated the tensions along Thailand's political faultlines -- Thaksin Shinawatra's mostly rural support base on one side, the Bangkok-based elite and middle classes on the other -- that left the country wracked with turbulence for four years after the 2006 coup, culminating in a 2010 army crackdown on Thaksin supporters that left more than 90 dead. An estimated 40,000 pro-government \\"red shirts\\" -- many from the rural areas -- gathered in a Bangkok stadium Sunday in a show of support for the embattled prime minister, who came to power in a 2011 election. The current round of protests was triggered in response to a government-backed amnesty bill that could have extended a pardon to Thaksin Shinawatra and opened the door for his return to Thailand. The Thai senate rejected the amnesty bill on November 11, but since then demonstrations have only grown, with Suthep calling for the current government to be replaced by a new administration. Yingluck Shinawatra has responded to the escalating situation with a call for unity, reconciliation and respect for law. \\"The government has instructed police and all security officers to handle the situation gently, based on international practices, so the demonstration won't be used as a tool by people who want to make changes in a non-democratic way,\\" she said in a statement on her official Facebook page. More than a dozen countries have issued travel warnings for citizens to avoid areas near protests in Bangkok. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Anti-government protesters in Thailand have stormed the country's finance ministry, raising political tensions to the highest level since the unrest of 2010.

Please remove spaces between words.","completion":"Louis Braille was a trailblazing French inventor and educator, best known for developing the Braille system that revolutionized written communication for people with visual impairments. His life was marked with major events and milestones that helped shape the way we understand and cater to the needs of those with vision challenges. 1809: Louis Braille was born on January 4th in Coupvray, a small village near Paris, France. He was the youngest of four siblings in a humble family. His father, Monique-Simon Braille, was a saddler. 1812: Around the age of three, Braille accidentally injured his right eye while playing with a sharp tool at his father's workshop. The injury resulted in a terrible infection, which eventually spread to his left eye, leaving him completely blind by the age of five. 1816: In 1816, a local priest recognized Braille's intelligence and potential, subsequently enrolling him in a school for the blind in Paris – the Royal Institute for Blind Youth (INJA). This marked the beginning of his academic journey. 1821: Around 1821, while still a student at INJA, Braille grew interested in adapting Barbier's \\"Night Writing\\" system – a code designed for military communication in the dark – for the blind. He started working on an improved system of raised dots that could be easily perceived by touch. 1824: At 15, Braille completed the development of his six-dot system for representing letters and numbers through touch, which became known as Braille. He refined the existing \\"Night Writing\\" system, making it more accessible and efficient. 1829: In 1829, the first publication of Braille's system, titled \\"Method of Writing Words, Music, and Plain Songs by Means of Dots, for Use by the Blind and Arranged for Them,\\" was printed. The system was initially met with resistance, but Braille continued to advocate for its widespread adoption. 1834: Louis Braille began to teach at INJA as a full-time professor. He taught history, geography, and mathematics, becoming a highly respected educator among his peers and students. 1837: Braille published a new and improved version of his method, which now included punctuation and musical notations. 1839: At the age of 30, Braille began work on developing a \\"decapoint\\" system. Expanding on his existing method, \\"decapoint\\" used ten dots to enable the blind to write for sighted people. 1852: Louis Braille passed away on January 6th at the age of 43, due to complications related to his childhood accident and subsequent infections. Sadly, Braille didn't live to see the global impact his system would have for people with visual impairments. 1878: Twenty-six years after Braille's death, the World Congress for the Blind in Paris endorsed the Braille system as a universal method of reading and writing for the blind. Now, the Braille system is used worldwide, thanks to the dedication and work of Louis Braille. His life is marked with the influential accomplishment, driven by the motivation to improve communication and education for those with visual impairments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: You may be uncomfortable perpetuating the Santa story or feel discomfort about lying to your child, and those are legitimate concerns shared by many. On the other hand, you may want your child to believe in something whimsical and magical, like Santa. How to deal with the Santa Claus story is a personal decision that can only be made by your family. Remember, though, that even if you do not share the Santa story in your own family, your child might still come to you with tricky questions about Santa. Perhaps they heard something at school or they have thought about the Santa story and it doesn't completely make sense. Acknowledge the question and praise them for their critical thinking. This is actually a positive developmental step. Determining their reason for asking will help you figure out the best way to proceed. You might give this question some thought before it ever comes up, so that you are not caught completely off guard. This will help you respond more thoughtfully and slowly, rather than be reactionary. Ask your child very plainly, \\"Why do you ask?\\" or \\"Where is this question coming from?\\". Just because the child is asking questions doesn't necessarily mean that they are emotionally ready to believe the truth. They may just be curiously probing. Asking what your child believes will give you an idea of where they are emotionally and cognitively. If your child indicates that they still believe in Santa, despite any outside doubts, it's likely not time to tell them the truth yet. Respond to your child's question with a simple, \\"Well, what do you believe?\\" This allows them to reflect on what they think and whether or not they believe in Santa Claus. When your child answers your question about what they believe, they will tell you that they don't think Santa is real, or that they do but that they have questions. This answer should guide how you proceed and you can either tell them the truth about Santa or let them continue to believe. They may also say that they do believe the story of Santa Claus, but are confused about something specific in the Santa story, such as how he gets around the world in one night, or fits all of the presents in one bag. Just reiterate whatever you've already told them and answer questions as best as you can.","completion":"The decision to share the Santa Claus story lies within each family, and it's essential to be prepared for tricky questions from your child. Praise their critical thinking and determine the reason behind their questions by asking about their beliefs. It's important to consider their emotional readiness for the truth.

OPTIONS: a). yes b). it is not possible to tell c). no","completion":"c). no Based on the premise provided, we cannot conclude that \\"Every worker knows that the retirement age for Social Security has changed.\\" The statement, \\"In addition, many workers are unaware that the retirement age for full Social Security benefits is gradually rising from age 65 to 67,\\" directly contradicts the claim that every worker is aware of the change. The given statement highlights that there is a significant portion of workers who are not informed about the rising retirement age, likely due to a lack of information dissemination or other reasons. This means that it is incorrect to assume that all workers are aware of the shift in retirement ages for social security benefits. One must also consider the broad definition of the term \\"worker.\\" This encompasses individuals from various backgrounds, educational levels, and age groups, which means that not all workers will have the same level of familiarity or understanding of the social security system and its policies. Additionally, the retirement age for full Social Security benefits might not be as widely known or discussed as other aspects of the system, causing some workers to be less informed about the changing retirement age. This could be due to a lack of public discourse or media coverage, leading many workers to remain in the dark about the issue. Consequently, it is essential to recognize the need for awareness campaigns and educational resources to inform workers about the gradual shift in retirement ages for full Social Security benefits. This will help ensure that all workers are better equipped with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions regarding their retirement plans and future financial security. In summary, it is incorrect to conclude that every worker knows that the retirement age for Social Security has changed.

Contour lines represent paths or segments of the earth. Topographic maps are covered in contour lines. Options are: (A). Yes (B). It's impossible to say (C). No Hypothesis: Topographic maps costs more to make","completion":"Based on the provided paragraph, there is not enough information available to determine if the hypothesis \\"Topographic maps cost more to make\\" is true or false. The paragraph focuses on explaining how to read topographic maps and the role of contour lines, but it does not mention the production cost or any comparison with other maps. Therefore, the correct answer would be (B) It's impossible to say. However, to provide a better understanding of topographic maps, it is important to note that these maps represent the Earth's surface in a detailed and precise manner. They depict both the natural features of the landscape, such as mountains, valleys, and bodies of water, as well as human-made structures like roads, buildings, and bridges. This level of detail requires accurate and reliable data, which is often obtained through surveying methods or remote sensing techniques such as aerial photography, satellite imagery, or LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). Creating topographic maps involves various technical processes and specialized knowledge. Cartographers, geographers, and other professionals work together to collect, analyze, and interpret the spatial data used to develop these maps. They use sophisticated software and hardware tools to create the map's final appearance, ensuring that the information it contains is both accurate and easy to understand. Once the digital map has been created, it can be printed on paper or distributed online. Comparing topographic maps to other types of maps, such as road maps or political maps, it is not straightforward to claim whether they cost more to make without considering the various factors involved in map production. Some factors that could influence the cost include the level of detail required, the methods used to collect and process the data, and the resources needed to create the final map (e.g., personnel, software, and equipment). So, while we cannot confirm the hypothesis based on the given paragraph, it is essential to recognize the intricate process and remarkable detail involved in creating topographic maps. The cost of producing these maps can vary significantly depending on multiple factors, making it difficult to establish a general statement about their production costs in comparison to other types of maps."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. There is a contradiction between the two sentences. The first sentence indicates that Rebbe Schneerson said something last week, two days before Christmas, because he was feeling very good. This suggests that he was in a positive or optimistic mood during that time. On the other hand, the second sentence suggests that Rebbe Schneerson was in a pessimistic mood before Christmas. This contradicts the information provided in the first sentence. In the context of logical entailment, one sentence entails another if the truth of the first sentence guarantees the truth of the second sentence under all possible circumstances. In this case, the truth of the first sentence, which indicates that Rebbe Schneerson was feeling good and most likely in a positive mood, does not guarantee the truth of the second sentence that states he was in a pessimistic mood before Christmas. Instead, the two sentences seem to present contrasting moods for Rebbe Schneerson during the same time period. Therefore, we can conclude that the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence due to their contradictory nature in portraying Rebbe Schneerson's mood before Christmas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Unemployed Brooklyn man misses job interview to save 9-month-old boy who was blown into path of oncoming subway train Delroy Simmonds was credited with rescuing a child in a stroller as it rolled on to the subway tracks. An unemployed Brooklyn man missed a job interview Tuesday for the best of reasons: He was saving the life of a 9-month-old boy who was blown into the path of an oncoming subway train by a gust of high wind. Like a superhero without a cape, Delroy Simmonds jumped onto the elevated tracks and hoisted the bleeding child — still strapped into his stroller — to the safety of the platform as the J train bore down on them. The father of two then shrugged off his courageous, selfless act. “Everybody is making me out to be some sort of superhero,” the father of two told the Daily News on Tuesday night. “I’m just a normal person. Anybody in that situation should have done what I did.” He said he wasn’t looking for praise. What he really wants is a regular paycheck. “I’ve been looking for a job for a year and change,” Simmonds said. “I’m looking for something to support my family.” The Brooklyn native was on his way to apply for a maintenance position at a warehouse when the unthinkable happened at the Van Siclen Ave. station in Cypress Hills at 12:45 p.m. “A strong gust of wind blew. It had to be 30, 40 miles an hour,” he recalled. “There was a woman with four kids. One was in a stroller. The wind blew the baby onto the tracks.” Witnesses looked on in horror as the child’s mother, identified by sources as Maria Zamara, stood frozen in shock. In the distance, they could see the train rounding a bend, headed into the station. “I jumped down and I snatched the baby up,” Simmonds said. “The train was coming around the corner as I lifted the baby from the tracks. I really wasn’t thinking.” He hoisted the stroller to the platform as the train came in, the operator blasting his horn. He pulled himself up just as the train jerked to a stop halfway into the station, witnesses said. Khalima Ansari, 21, who was waiting for the same train, was stunned by Simmonds’ heroics. “The baby had a big gash on his forehead. You could see his skull,” said Ansari, who called 911. The child was taken to Brookdale University Hospital and treated for cuts to his face and head. “He’s okay. . . . We are thankful,” the boy’s father said at the hospital. Simmonds didn’t stick around after the rescue. “It was the fatherly instinct. I have two daughters of my own — 8 and 5. I was being a father. I would have done it for any baby,” he said. Those instincts meant he missed his train — and the interview that might have led to his first job since he was a laid off as a vocational trainer for the mentally disabled. He said he had another interview scheduled for Wednesday and was just hoping he could get there without any drama. “What I really need is a job,” he said. With Mark Morales and Edgar Sandoval tconnor@nydailynews.com Summary:","completion":"A man named Delroy Simmonds missed a job interview because he was busy saving a baby.

In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot and a question. You need to provide the correct answer for it. Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Entomologist James Atherton (Julian Sands) searches the Amazon rainforest with the hope of discovering new species of insects and arachnids. Descending into an enormous sinkhole, his team sets up collectors on the ground below a large tree, then blow smoke up into the canopy of the tree. A large number of bugs fall into the collector, including a very aggressive new species of spider. The spider is captured and chloroformed for research; and is later revealed to be lacking sex organs, thus making it a drone, or soldier, highly unusual in an arachnid species. A nature photographer, Jerry Manley (Mark L. Taylor), who has been suffering a fever while traveling with the team, unknowingly has a fertile (non-drone) male spider of the same species jump into his backpack, that night sneaking into his sleeping bag and biting him. Manley has a massive seizure from the venom and dies. The remaining scientists takes his body back to the United States, blaming Manley's death on the preexisting fever. The spider follows the crew, jumps into the stretcher carrying Manley's body, and is sealed into a box with the corpse.Manley's body arrives at the funeral home in his small town of Canaima, California, and mortician Irv Kendall (Roy Brocksmith), stunned at the body's greenish color (from the spider's digestive fluids) does not notice the spider inside the coffin when he opens it. The spider sneaks outside and is picked up by a raven, but before the raven gets back to its nest, the raven is bitten by the spider and it falls dead to the ground in front of the barn of the Jennings family. Ross Jennings (Jeff Daniels) is a family physician who had moved to the town from San Francisco and who faces a lack of patients due to elderly rival Sam Metcalf (Henry Jones), who was supposed to retire and shift his patients to Ross, but decided to maintain his practice.The Amazonian spider mates with a female domestic house spider and makes a nest in Jennings' barn, producing hundreds of infertile drone offspring, all of which have their father's lethal bite. Ross, along with his son Tommy, has arachnophobia, making them targets of ridicule to wife Molly (Harley Jane Kozak) and daughter Shelly (Marlene Katz).Ross' first patient, Margaret Hollins (Mary Carver), dies after being bitten. The town's residents believe that she died from a heart attack, despite Ross' suspicions that something else was at work since her body appeared to have had a seizure instead. After a spider also kills a football player, a death that is attributed to a football injury, Ross is known to the town as \\"Dr. Death\\", having all his patients dying after having seen him. When Doc Metcalf is bitten and dies, Ross suspects that deadly arachnids could be infesting the town.Ross and county coroner Milton Briggs (James Handy) perform an autopsy on the victims and confirm Ross' suspicion that the deaths were caused by spider bites. Atherton arrives in town with his assistant Chris Collins (Brian McNamara), joining Briggs, Sheriff Lloyd Parsons (Stuart Pankin) and exterminator Delbert McClintock (John Goodman) in the spider investigation. They discover that the killer spiders have a short life expectancy due to being a mixed breed. Atherton tells them that the spiders are soldiers, sent out to eliminate potential threats for the general male spider. He also learns that the general spider produced a queen, which it likely mated with to produce a second nest someplace, guarded by the queen, which could produce fertile offspring. Atherton elaborates that, unlike the sinkhole of the spider's original habitat, which limited its territory, the transplanted spiders can progressively expand their territory, possibly culminating in their worldwide dispersal. The group sets out to destroy both nests and kill the queen and general, but Atherton plans to capture the general alive for his agenda after discovering where the first nest is located. Atherton plucks at the web to lure the general out, but gets caught by surprise as the general leaps from his hiding place and fatally bites Atherton.Ross, Chris, and Delbert eventually discover that the nest is in Ross's barn, and Ross sends Delbert to destroy it, where the exterminator finds Atherton dead before destroying the nest. Chris gets the Jennings family out of their infested house, but Ross falls through the floor into his wine cellar, which turns out to be the spiders' second nest, containing fertile offspring. After electrocuting the queen, Ross battles the general while also attempting to burn the second egg sac. He becomes trapped underneath fallen debris, with the general about to deliver the killing strike when Ross flings the general into the fire.As the egg sac hatches, the general jumps out of the fire. Ross shoots him with a nail gun and the projectile sends the burning spider into the egg sac, destroying the nest with fire and ending the plague.Having enough of the countryside along with the near-death experience, the Jennings family immediately moves back to San Francisco, appreciating city life once more, despite minor earthquakes disrupting them., Question: Who is Irv Kendall?","completion":"Irv Kendall is a mortician in the small town of Canaima, California."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There have been horrible nights at the table, where we shared bad news. There have been fabulous nights where we celebrated successes and talked about exciting things to come.

Kevyn Orr, a corporate bankruptcy specialist based in Washington, DC, says 'everything's on the table' in his quest to save the strapped city. Orr was tapped by Michigan Governor Rick Snyder last week and though he doesn't officially start until March 25, he's already facing huge obstacles and opposition. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Corporate Bankruptcy Specialist Kevyn Orr Steps In to Revitalize Detroit, Faces Challenges Introduction: The city of Detroit has long been facing financial hardships, with its residents struggling under the weight of economic decline. Michigan Governor Rick Snyder has pinned his hopes on Kevyn Orr, a corporate bankruptcy specialist based in Washington, DC, to help turn the tide and save the once-thriving city. Orr is set to officially start his role on March 25th, but has already expressed that he plans to consider all options in his efforts to revitalize the strapped city. Step 1: Analyzing the Situation Kevyn Orr's first challenge in saving Detroit will be to analyze the state of the city's finances and develop a comprehensive understanding of its debts and obligations. This will involve a thorough examination of the city's financial records, consulting with various stakeholders, and identifying key areas of concern. Orr's expertise as a bankruptcy specialist will give him valuable insights when it comes to assessing the city's fiscal health. Step 2: Identifying Solutions Once Orr has gained a clear understanding of Detroit's financial situation, he will need to start identifying potential solutions to alleviate the city's economic woes. This will require brainstorming with city officials and stakeholders, as well as conducting research into similar cases to determine the best course of action. As Orr himself has indicated, \\"everything's on the table,\\" which means he's open to exploring unconventional and creative strategies to help the city of Detroit bounce back. Step 3: Overcoming Opposition It's no secret that Orr's appointment has been met with some resistance, with critics arguing against the appointment of an outsider at such a critical time. However, Orr's proven expertise and understanding of the intricacies of corporate bankruptcy will be a major asset in overcoming these obstacles. By working hand-in-hand with Detroit's leaders, Orr can gradually win over the support and trust of those who initially opposed his involvement. Step 4: Implementing Change Once Orr and his team have developed a viable strategy, they'll need to focus on implementing the changes necessary to get Detroit back on track. This will involve collaborating with city officials to determine how best to allocate resources and prioritize projects, as well as coordinating with various governmental and non-governmental organizations to ensure a smooth implementation process. A transparent and accountable system of monitoring and evaluation will be crucial to understanding the impact and success of these changes. Conclusion: Kevyn Orr faces a monumental task in restoring the financial health of Detroit and revitalizing its struggling economy. However, his experience as a corporate bankruptcy specialist and his determination to consider all possible solutions provide a ray of hope for the residents of this iconic city. Orr's ability to navigate the complex political landscape and strike a balance between innovative solutions and prudent risk management will be crucial in determining the success of his efforts. Only time will tell if Orr will manage to steer Detroit out of its desperate situation and onto a path of growth and recovery."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves, is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts. After reading the above, is \\"Cynetes\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Who's culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces?\\"? Available choices: (1). no (2). yes","completion":"(2). yes The \\"Cynetes\\" or \\"Cunetes\\" mentioned in the passage refers to the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe's southwestern extremity, whose culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces.

(2) Block his election., does the word block mean the same thing?","completion":"In the two sentences you provided, the word \\"block\\" does not carry the same meaning in both instances. Although the term appears identical, the context in which it is used and the nuances of its meaning vary. To clarify, let's explore the sentences in depth: 1. \\"Block the wheels of a car.\\" In this scenario, the word \\"block\\" is employed as a verb and refers to the action of preventing the wheels from moving or rolling. This can be done by placing an object, such as a wheel chock or a heavy rock, against the wheels to create a physical barrier. The objective here is to ensure the car stays stationary, especially when parked on a slope or during maintenance. This usage of \\"block\\" conveys the idea of stopping or impeding motion or movement. 2. \\"Block his election.\\" In this context, \\"block\\" is also used as a verb but holds a different meaning. Instead of describing a physical action, it conveys the idea of preventing or hindering a specific outcome – in this case, the individual's election. This could involve thwarting someone's chances of being elected by voting against them, campaigning for a different candidate, or exposing negative information about them that sways public opinion. Here, \\"block\\" signifies the act of obstructing or derailing a particular goal or achievement. In summary, while the word \\"block\\" appears in both sentences, it holds distinct meanings in each case. In the first sentence, it refers to physically stopping the wheels of a car from moving, whereas in the second sentence, it alludes to obstructing a person's political election or ambitions.

The United States initially aimed to maintain neutrality in the conflict but ultimately joined the war in response to several factors, including unrestricted submarine warfare and the Zimmermann Telegram. Step 2: The United States declared war on Germany on April 6, 1917. Step 3: This decision was influenced by Germany's unrestricted submarine warfare campaign, which targeted American and allied merchant ships, leading to the sinking of the British passenger ship Lusitania in 1915 and the American cargo ship Housatonic in 1917. Additionally, the Zimmermann Telegram, which proposed a German-Mexican alliance against the United States, was intercepted by British intelligence and shared with the US government.

You should write a yes-no question about the given term such that the answer is the one provided to you (i.e., If the answer is \\"No\\", you should ask a question that its answer would be \\"No\\", and if the answer is \\"Yes\\", you should ask a question that its answer is \\"Yes\\". ). The question should have a definitive answer (as opposed to ambiguous or subjective questions, e.g., Is Batman a good movie?). Create a question such that its answer can not be found easily on a single web page (e.g., mentioned in a Wikipedia page). This can be accomplished if answering the question requires more than one fact (facts = statements that can be found on a Wikipedia page or Google). For example, answering the question 'did Aristotle use a laptop?', one needs the know about the invention of the laptop and the death of Aristotle.

Though any storage tank for fuel may be so called, the term is typically applied to part of an engine system in which the fuel is stored and propelled (fuel pump) or released (pressurized gas) into an engine. Fuel tanks range in size and complexity from the small plastic tank of a butane lighter to the multi-chambered cryogenic Space Shuttle external tank. The fuel tanks for B-25 bombers Fill caps on a BMW automobile for hydrogen (left) and for gasoline (right) fuel tanks Uses [ edit ] Typically, a fuel tank must allow or provide the following: Storage of fuel: the system must contain a given quantity of fuel and must avoid leakage and limit evaporative emissions. Filling: the fuel tank must be filled in a secure way, without sparks. Provide a method for determining level of fuel in tank, gauging (the remaining quantity of fuel in the tank must be measured or evaluated). Venting (if over-pressure is not allowed, the fuel vapors must be managed through valves). Feeding of the engine (through a pump). Anticipate potentials for damage and provide safe survival potential. Plastic (high-density polyethylene HDPE) as a fuel tank material of construction, while functionally viable in the short term, has a long term potential to become saturated as fuels such as diesel and gasoline permeate the HDPE material. Considering the inertia and kinetic energy of fuel in a plastic tank being transported by a vehicle, environmental stress cracking is a definite potential. The flammability of fuel makes stress cracking a possible cause of catastrophic failure. Emergencies aside, HDPE plastic is suitable for short term storage of diesel and gasoline. In the U.S., Underwriters Laboratories approved (UL 142) tanks would be a minimum design consideration. Fuel tank construction [ edit ] While most tanks are manufactured, some fuel tanks are still fabricated by metal craftsmen or hand-made in the case of bladder-style tanks. These include custom and restoration tanks for automotive, aircraft, motorcycles, boats and even tractors. Construction of fuel tanks follows a series of specific steps. The craftsman generally creates a mockup to determine the accurate size and shape of the tank, usually out of foam board. Next, design issues that affect the structure of the tank are addressed - such as where the outlet, drain, fluid level indicator, seams, and baffles go. Then the craftsmen must determine the thickness, temper and alloy of the sheet he will use to make the tank. After the sheet is cut to the shapes needed, various pieces are bent to create the basic shell and/or ends and baffles for the tank. Many fuel tanks' baffles (particularly in aircraft and racecars) contain lightening holes. These flanged holes serve two purposes, they reduce the weight of the tank while adding strength to the baffles. Toward the end of construction, openings are added for the filler neck, fuel pickup, drain, and fuel-level sending unit. Sometimes these holes are created on the flat shell, other times they are added at the end of the fabrication process. Baffles and ends can be riveted into place. The heads of the rivets are frequently brazed or soldered to prevent tank leaks. Ends can then be hemmed in and soldered, or flanged and brazed (and/or sealed with an epoxy-type sealant) or the ends can be flanged and then welded. Once the soldering, brazing or welding is complete, the fuel tank is leak-tested.[1] Automotive fuel tanks [ edit ] The maximum distance a combustion-engine powered car with a full tank can cover is the product of the tank capacity and its fuel efficiency (as in miles per gallon). While larger tanks increase the maximum distance, they also take up more space and (especially when full) add to the total weight, requiring higher fuel consumption for the same performance. Fuel-tank capacity is therefore the result of a trade-off in design considerations. For most compact cars, the capacity is in the range 45–65 litres (12–17 US gal); the original model Tata Nano is exceptional with its 15 litres (4 US gal) fuel tank. SUVs and trucks tend to have considerably larger fuel tanks. For each new vehicle a specific fuel system is developed, to optimize the use of available space. Moreover, for one car model, different fuel system architectures are developed, depending on the type of the car, the type of fuel (gasoline or diesel), nozzle models, and region. Two technologies are used to make fuel tanks for automobiles: Metal (steel or aluminum) fuel tanks welded from stamped sheets. Although this technology is very good in limiting fuel emissions, it tends to be less competitive and thus less on the market, although until recent times automotive fuel tanks were almost exclusively made from sheet metal. Plastic high-density polyethylene (HDPE) fuel tanks made by blow molding. Blow molded HDPE can take complex shapes, for instance allowing the tank to be mounted directly over the rear axle, saving space and improving crash safety. Initially there were concerns over the low fracture toughness of HDPE, when compared to steel or aluminum. Concern for safety and long term ability to function should be considered and monitored. Modern cars often feature remote opening of the fuel tank fuel filler flap using an electric motor or cable release. For both convenience and security, many modern fuel tanks cannot be opened by hand or otherwise from the outside of the car. Reserve tank [ edit ] Sometimes called the reserve tank is a secondary fuel tank (in many cars/bikes it contains around 15% of the capacity of the primary tank) these are more commonly found on bikes, older cars (some without a fuel gauge) and vehicles designed for long distance or special use. A light on the instrument panel indicates when the fuel level dips below a certain point in the tank. There is no current standard, although some efforts are made to collect this data for all automobiles. In vehicles modified for endurance the primary tank (the one that comes with the car) is made into a reserve tank and a larger one installed. Some 4x4 vehicles can be fitted with a secondary (or sub-tank) by the dealership. Ship in a bottle [ edit ] The ship in a bottle fuel tank is a manufacturing design developed by TI Automotive in Rastatt, Germany wherein all fuel delivery components including the pump, control electronics and most hosing are encased within a blow-molded plastic fuel tank,[2] and named after the traditional ship-in-a-bottle mechanical puzzle. The technique was developed to reduce fuel vapor emissions in response to Partial Zero-Emission Vehicle (PZEV) requirements.[3] The first application was for the 2005 Ford GT. Racing fuel cell [ edit ] A racing fuel cell has a rigid outer shell and flexible inner lining to minimize the potential for punctures in the event of a collision or other mishap resulting in serious damage to the vehicle. It is filled with an open-cell foam core to prevent explosion of vapor in the empty portion of the tank and to minimize sloshing of fuel during competition that may unbalance the vehicle or cause inadequate fuel delivery to the motor (fuel starvation). The designation \\"racing\\" is often omitted due to familiarity and because this type of gas tank is also used on street vehicles. The omission can lead to confusion with other types of fuel cells. See Fuel cell (disambiguation). Placement and safety [ edit ] For safety considerations, in modern cars the fuel tank is usually located ahead of the rear axle, out of the crumple zones of the car. Automobiles such as the Ford Pinto or the models that still use the Ford Panther platform (Ford Crown Victoria, Lincoln Town Car, and Mercury Grand Marquis) are notorious for having the fuel tank behind the rear axle. Since 1980 new Ford models corrected this problem and had the fuel tank in front of the rear axle.[4] General Motors 1973-1987 C/K pickup trucks have the fuel tank located outside the frame. According to the Center for Auto Safety this creates a fire hazard.[5] In automotive applications, improper placement of the fuel tank has led to increased probability of fire in collisions. Circa 1990, General Motors faced over a hundred product liability lawsuits related to fires allegedly caused by GM's decision to place the fuel tanks in its pickup trucks outside the protection of the vehicle's frame.[6] In 1993, reportage on this matter for NBC News created a scandal over vehicles rigged to catch fire for the television camera. Ford's Pinto also sparked controversy for putting the fuel tank in a poorly reinforced area which can cause deadly fires and explosions if the car got into a rear-end collision, costing Ford US125 million. Likewise for safety reasons, the filler could no longer be in the middle back of the car in the crumple zone and thus had to be on the side of the car. Which side is a series of trade-offs: driver's side is easier to access, and mechanically simpler for gas cap locks; passenger side is safer (away from passing traffic in roadside fill-ups). Asymmetric sliding doors may also dictate placement and some minivan doors will collide with a fillup in progress.[7] Aircraft [ edit ] Layout of a modern airliner's main fuel tanks Aircraft typically use three types of fuel tanks: integral, rigid removable, and bladder. Integral tanks are areas inside the aircraft structure that have been sealed to allow fuel storage. An example of this type is the \\"wet wing\\" commonly used in larger aircraft. Since these tanks are part of the aircraft structure, they cannot be removed for service or inspection. Inspection panels must be provided to allow internal inspection, repair, and overall servicing of the tank. Most large transport aircraft use this system, storing fuel in the wings, belly, and sometimes tail of the airplane. Rigid removable tanks are installed in a compartment designed to accommodate the tank. They are typically of metal construction, and may be removed for inspection, replacement, or repair. The aircraft does not rely on the tank for structural integrity. These tanks are commonly found in smaller general aviation aircraft, such as the Cessna 172. Bladder tanks, or fuel cells, [8] are reinforced rubberized bags installed in a section of aircraft structure designed to accommodate the weight of the fuel. The bladder is rolled up and installed into the compartment through the fuel filler neck or access panel, and is secured by means of metal buttons or snaps inside the compartment. Many high-performance light aircraft, helicopters and some smaller turboprops use bladder tanks. One major down-side to this type of tank is the tendency for materials to work harden through extensive use making them brittle causing cracks. [ citation needed ] One major plus side is the ability to use as much of the aircraft as possible to store fuel. are reinforced rubberized bags installed in a section of aircraft structure designed to accommodate the weight of the fuel. The bladder is rolled up and installed into the compartment through the fuel filler neck or access panel, and is secured by means of metal buttons or snaps inside the compartment. Many high-performance light aircraft, helicopters and some smaller turboprops use bladder tanks. One major down-side to this type of tank is the tendency for materials to work harden through extensive use making them brittle causing cracks. One major plus side is the ability to use as much of the aircraft as possible to store fuel. Combat aircraft and helicopters generally use self-sealing fuel tanks. Fuel tanks have been implicated in aviation disasters, being the cause of the accident or worsening it (fuel tank explosion).[9][not in citation given] For example: The official \\"probable cause\\" for the explosion and subsequent crash of TWA Flight 800 is that an explosive fuel/air mixture existed in one of the aircraft's fuel tanks. Faulty wiring then provided an ignition source within the tank, destroying the airliner. While the accuracy of the official findings is still questioned in this case, similar explosions have occurred in other aircraft. It is possible to reduce the chance of fuel tank explosions by a fuel tank inerting system or fire-fighting foam in the tanks. [10] Burning fuel can explode or set fire to the same airplane or adjacent objects and people. In the 1960 Munich Convair 340 crash, a transport crashed into a major street. Burning fuel set fire to a tramcar. All 20 people aboard the plane and 32 passengers of the tram died.[11] In some areas, an aircraft's fuel tank is also referred to as an aircraft fuel cell. Water supply [ edit ] Water supply systems can have primary or backup power supplied by diesel-fueled generators fed by a small \\"day tank\\" and a much larger bulk storage fuel tank.[12][13] Safety [ edit ] Proper design and construction of a fuel tank play a major role in the safety of the system of which the tank is a part. In most cases intact fuel tanks are very safe, as the tank is full of fuel vapour/air mixture that is well above the flammability limits, and thus cannot burn even if an ignition source were present (which is rare). Bunded oil tanks are used for safely storing domestic heating oil and other hazardous materials. Bunding is often required by insurance companies, rather than single skinned oil storage tanks. Several systems, such as BattleJacket and rubber bladders, have been developed and deployed for use in protecting (from explosion caused by enemy fire) the fuel tanks of military vehicles in conflict zones.[14] See also [ edit ] ||||| FILE - This March 21, 2013 file photo shows U.S. actor Paul Walker wearing a creation from the Colcci summer collection at Sao Paulo Fashion Week in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

A federal judge in Los Angeles ruled... (Associated Press) LOS ANGELES (AP) — The widow of a man driving the Porsche that crashed and killed actor Paul Walker cannot prove the carmaker is responsible for the accident, a federal judge said. There was not enough evidence in Kristine Rodas' claims that her husband died because the Porsche Carrera GT he was driving lacked several key safety features, U.S. District Judge Philip S. Gutierrez ruled Monday. He said there was no evidence the Porsche's suspension failed before the crash, as Rodas' lawsuit claimed. She also had alleged the rare sports car lacked a crash cage and fuel cell. \\"Plaintiff has provided no competent evidence that Rodas' death occurred as a result of any wrongdoing on the part of defendant,\\" Gutierrez wrote. Walker was riding in the Carrera GT driven by his friend Roger Rodas when the car spun out of control, struck three trees and burst into flames on a street in Santa Clarita in November 2013. Walker was on a break from filming the seventh installment of the \\"Fast & Furious\\" franchise when he died. The ruling has no bearing on two other cases against Porsche filed by Walker's daughter and father, which are both pending in Los Angeles Superior Court. Meadow Walker's attorney said in a statement that while Rodas was killed instantly in the crash, Walker was still alive when the car caught fire. \\"Meadow will continue the fight to hold Porsche accountable for selling a defective product that kills,\\" attorney Jeff Milam wrote. Porsche has denied wrongdoing in the design, manufacture or marketing of the Carrera GT. The company also contended in the lawsuit by Walker's daughter that the car had been altered and improperly maintained and that those factors contributed to the crash. An email to Porsche seeking comment was not immediately returned Tuesday. An investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and California Highway Patrol concluded that unsafe speed, not mechanical problems, caused the crash. Investigators said the Porsche was going up to 94 mph (151 kph) when it crashed. Engineers from Porsche, who evaluated the wreckage of the rare car, helped in the investigation. All the cases against Porsche contend the car was going much slower before it spun out of control. The Walkers' suits say the vehicle was traveling between 63 and 71 mph (101 to 114 kph). Kristine Rodas sued over the crash in May 2014. Her attorney, Mark Geragos, said Tuesday that the ruling will be appealed. Gutierrez faulted Rodas' expert for initially relying on an analysis of tire marks taken a month and a half after the fatal crash rather than photos investigators took at the scene. After Walker's death, his two brothers helped complete action scenes in \\"Furious 7,\\" which earned more than 1.5 billion globally when it was released in April. ___ Anthony McCartney can be reached at http://twitter.com/mccartneyAP . ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Summarize: It will bring together officials from the Middle East Quartet, the UN, Arab League and other countries - but Israel and the Palestinians will not participate. Israel has rejected the meeting and called for direct negotiations. The last round of talks between Israel and the Palestinians came to an end amid acrimony in April 2014. The Palestinians accused Israel of reneging on a deal to free prisoners, while Israel said it would not continue negotiations after the Palestinians decided to bring the Islamist Hamas movement into a unity government. Sykes-Picot: The map that spawned a century of resentment Is one homeland the solution? How to untie diplomacy's Gordian knot? Diplomats say Friday's meeting will bring together all the economic incentives and other guarantees that various countries have offered in previous years to create an agenda for an autumn peace conference. French diplomatic sources quoted by AFP news agency said the talks would focus on the 2002 Saudi peace initiative, which offered Arab recognition of Israel in return for the creation of a Palestinian state in territories occupied by Israel since 1967. On Monday Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Saudi plan included \\"positive elements\\". However, the managing director of Israel's foreign ministry, Dore Gold, likened the French talks to the 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement, which carved up the Middle East between colonial powers, and said only direct talks could resolve the conflict. \\"This effort utterly failed then and will completely fail today,\\" he said. \\"The only way to get a stable regional arrangement that will allow us to create real peace in the Middle East is if the parties of the region come to understandings between them.\\" On Wednesday Mr Netanyahu called for \\"direct negotiations without preconditions between the sides\\". US Secretary of State John Kerry will attend the talks but Reuters quoted a US official as saying the US did not have any new proposals to put forward. There have been numerous rounds of peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians since the early 1990s. Some of the most intractable issues include the status of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and Palestinian statehood. The Palestinians seek an independent state in the West Bank, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Israel, which has occupied East Jerusalem since the 1967 Middle East war, regards the whole of the city as its indivisible capital, though this is not recognised by the international community. Since 1967, Israel has built more than 100 settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.","completion":"Officials from the Middle East Quartet, the UN, Arab League, and other countries will participate in a meeting to discuss an agenda for an autumn peace conference.

Answer the following question: President Donald Trump is counting on congressional Republicans to enact a package of tax cuts in the coming weeks, in the process delivering his first major legislative achievement since taking office in January. But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president. According to the above context, answer the following question. Based on the article, the tax plan is likely to: Answer:","completion":"Based on the article, the tax plan is likely to: 1.

After receiving an unexpected phone call that she has won a spot to participate on a television game show, she becomes obsessed with regaining the youthful appearance she possesses in an old photograph. To reach her goal, she goes to a doctor to discuss weight loss. The doctor gives her a prescription for weight-loss amphetamine pills throughout the day and a sedative at night. As the months go by, Sara's tolerance for the pills adjusts and as a result she is no longer able to feel the same high the pills once gave her. When her invitation does not arrive, she increases her dosage from double to triple and, as a result, begins to suffer from amphetamine psychosis. Meanwhile, Sara's son Harry is young and has an adventurous life with his girlfriend Marion Silver and best friend Tyrone C. Love. He and his friends are all heroin addicts, and Harry funds his habit through petty theft, including from his own mother who turns a blind eye. Tyrone decides that to support themselves, they should enter the illegal drug trade around Coney Island. With the promised money, each addict hopes to achieve their dreams. At first, the trio's drug dealing business thrives. However, Tyrone is imprisoned after fleeing the scene of a drug-gang assassination and Harry uses most of their earned money to post bail. After the assassination, the three find it much more difficult to find heroin due to supply being restricted by the Florida-based wholesalers. Eventually, Tyrone hears that the wholesaler is making a shipment, but the price is doubled and the minimum amount is high. Harry suggests that Marion ask for the needed cash from her psychiatrist in exchange for sex, which she does begrudgingly, and at a cost to her relationship with Harry.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Who are the two youngest of the Bielski brothers? , can you please find it? The film is based on actual events, beginning in August 1941. Nazi Einsatzgruppen (task forces) are sweeping through Eastern Europe, systematically killing Jews. Among the survivors not killed or restricted to ghettoes are the Belarusian Jewish Bielski brothers: Tuvia, Zus, Asael and Aron. Their parents are dead, killed by local police under orders from the occupying Germans. The brothers flee to the Naliboki Forest, vowing to avenge the deaths of their parents. They encounter other Jewish escapees hiding in the forest, and the brothers take them under their protection and leadership. Tuvia kills the local Auxiliary Police chief responsible for his parents' deaths. Over the next year, they shelter a growing number of refugees, raiding local farms for food and supplies and moving their camp whenever they are discovered by the collaborationist police. Bielski brothers stage raids on the Germans and their collaborators. Casualties cause Tuvia to reconsider this approach because of the risk to the hiding Jews. Rivalry between the two eldest brothers, Tuvia and Zus, fuels a disagreement between them about their future; as winter approaches, Zus decides to leave the camp and join a local company of Soviet partisans, while his older brother Tuvia remains with the camp as their leader. An arrangement is made between the two groups in which the Soviet partisans agree to protect the Jewish camp in exchange for supplies.

Write some highlights for the following article: Russian President Vladimir Putin has been accused of wanting to restore the Soviet Union after he sent 2,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid across the border into Ukraine. A convoy of 250 Russian army trucks, painted white, are heading towards the eastern Ukrainian city of Luhansk. The development prompted Ukrainian prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk that Putin's 'goal is to take the entire of Ukraine'. The trucks left Russia overnight and arrived approached the disputed frontier shortly before dawn. The convoy passes through the Ukrainian border at Izvarino without being inspected by customs officers. The aid convoy of an estimated 250 trucks crossed the border on its way to the Ukrainian town of Lugansk. He added: 'He [Putin] cannot cope with the idea that Ukraine would be a part of a big EU family. He wants to restore the Soviet Union,' Yatsenyuk said. The Russian emergency ministry, which coordinated previous humanitarian aid deliveries to Ukraine, could not be reached for comment about the convoy. Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, told journalists Saturday that the convoy had crossed 'illegally' onto Ukrainian territory. 'Ukraine border guards and customs were not allowed to examine the cargo and vehicles. 'Representatives of the Red Cross don't accompany the cargo, nobody knows what's inside.' Colonel Lysenko's relatively mild comments on the second convoy and the silence of more senior Ukrainian officials shows how dramatically the mood has shifted in the Kiev government since August. President Petro Poroshenko has been at pains to prove that last week's cease-fire deal has yielded improvements on the ground in east Ukraine. On Friday, he lauded the deal, which has been riddled by violations since it was imposed last week, as a 'fragile but efficient peace process.' In August, Ukrainian officials said that a first convoy of humanitarian aid from Russia would be seen as an invasion of the country, and loudly protested any attempts by Russia to unilaterally bring in the aid. Ukrainian officials fear that the convoy would have been carrying military equipment instead of food. Russian officials claimed the aid was needed because of severe shortages in the eastern city of Lugansk. Workers unloaded an estimated 2,000 tonnes of 'humanitarian aid' according to Russian officials. Eventually Russia sent its trucks across the border and into rebel-held territory without the oversight of the International Red Cross, contrary to an agreement signed between Ukraine and Russia. A representative of the ICRC's Moscow office said they had not been informed about the current convoy, either. Galina Balzamova of the ICRC said: 'We were not officially notified of an agreement between Moscow and Kiev to ship the cargo.' Colonel Lysenko said that six Ukrainian servicemen had died since the truce. He also confirmed that 12 rebel fighters had been killed by Ukrainian forces near Sea of Azov city of Mariupol, where he said they were doing reconnaissance work - the first such admission that they have inflicted casualties on the rebel side since the cease-fire began. In a statement posted online early Saturday, the Donetsk city council said that there had been fighting near the airport throughout the night. Two shells had hit residential buildings in the area but no casualties were reported. Continuous rocket fire could be heard overnight in downtown Donetsk, and a column of three GRAD rocket launchers - all its rockets still in place - was seen moving freely through the rebel-held city on Saturday morning. Yury Stepanov, a Russian official overseeing the convoy said the convoy consisted mainly of foodstuffs - rice, sugar, and canned fish and beef - but also included medicine, technical equipment and clothes. The deliveries were in closed boxes, small enough to be easily carried by one person, but rice was seen spilling from a broken bag. Stepanov said his team was responsible only for delivery, and distribution will be handled by local authorities - which for now means the separatist leaders of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic. Gennady Tsepkalo, a senior separatist official, said the aid would first and foremost be given to retirees, hospital patients and schoolchildren. He said the food would not be used to feed rebel fighters. He said: 'The militia will feed itself separately. This is for the residents of the Luhansk People's Republic.' The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's observer mission to the Russian-Ukrainian border said Saturday that they had seen 220 trucks cross into Ukraine, none of which were inspected by the Ukrainian side or accompanied by the ICRC.

A basic chronograph has an independent sweep second hand; it can be started, stopped, and returned to zero by successive pressure on the stem. Less simple chronographs use additional complications and can have multiple independent hands to measure seconds, minutes, hours and even tenths of a second. In addition, many modern chronographs use moveable bezels as tachymeters for rapid calculations of speed or distance. Louis Moinet invented the chronograph in 1816 for use in tracking astronomical objects. Chronographs were also used heavily in artillery fire in the mid to late 1800s. More modern uses of chronographs involve piloting airplanes, car racing, diving and submarine maneuvering. - The city of Bern or Berne (; Bernese German: \\"Bärn\\" ) is the de facto capital of Switzerland, referred to by the Swiss as their (e.g. in German) \\"Bundesstadt,\\" or \\"federal city\\".

While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva. - The Alps are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately across eight Alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 metres (just over 13,000 feet). - Louis Moinet (1768 - 1853), inventor of the chronograph, was born into a prosperous family of farmers in Bourges, France, was a French horologist, sculptor and painter. - Artillery is a class of large military weapons built to fire munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry's small arms. Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach fortifications, and led to heavy, fairly immobile siege engines. As technology improved, lighter, more mobile field artillery developed for battlefield use. This development continues today; modern self-propelled artillery vehicles are highly mobile weapons of great versatility providing the largest share of an army's total firepower.

Write an article with the title: \\"What’s the debt ceiling, and why is everyone in Washington talking about it?\\"","completion":"Title: What’s the debt ceiling, and why is everyone in Washington talking about it? Step 1: Introduction Start the article by briefly explaining the current situation in Washington regarding the debt ceiling and its relevance. Introduction: The term \\"debt ceiling\\" is currently a hot topic in Washington, but many people are unsure about what it actually is and why it has become so important. This article aims to clarify the concept of the debt ceiling and explain the reasons behind its increasing prominence in recent political discussions. Step 2: Define debt ceiling Explain what the debt ceiling is by providing a definition and its significance in the context of the US federal government's finances. Definition of debt ceiling: The debt ceiling is the legal limit on the amount of money that the United States federal government is allowed to borrow to meet its financial obligations. This limit is set by Congress and can be adjusted when necessary. Step 3: Discuss the history of the debt ceiling Introduce the historical context and how the debt ceiling started since the establishment of the Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917. History of the debt ceiling: The debt ceiling has its origins in the Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917, which was established to help the country's efforts in World War I. Over time, this limit on borrowing has been raised or suspended multiple times, as the US government has faced various financial challenges and the need to finance its activities. Step 4: Talk about why the debt ceiling is critical Illustrate the risks and consequences the country could face if it fails to raise or suspend the debt ceiling and is unable to pay its debts. Why the debt ceiling is critical: Failure to raise or suspend the debt ceiling would put the United States in a precarious financial position, potentially triggering a default on its obligations. This could lead to severe economic consequences, such as increased interest rates, a decline in the value of the US dollar, and a negative impact on the global economy. Step 5: Address why Washington is currently focused on the debt ceiling Discuss the current situation and the reasons behind the political discussions and debates on the debt ceiling in Washington. Why everyone in Washington is talking about it: Currently, the United States is nearing its debt ceiling, prompting heated political debate and negotiations among lawmakers. This is because raising the debt ceiling requires congressional approval, which often leads to conflict between political parties with differing fiscal priorities and goals. As both parties attempt to assert their agendas, the future of the country's financial health hangs in the balance, making this an issue of significant importance in the political sphere. Step 6: Conclusion Sum up the importance of understanding the debt ceiling and the implications it could have on the US economy. Conclusion: With the debt ceiling consistently featuring in political discourse, it is crucial for individuals to understand the concept and its potential consequences. Recognizing the functions and risks associated with the debt ceiling is essential for informed decision-making as the United States navigates its financial future amid competing political agendas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Have you ever wondered whether it’s worth your while to encourage an older person to start exercising? In 2014, the top-notch journal JAMA published the results of a fantastic research project: a study in which 1635 sedentary older adults (aged 70-89) were assigned to get either a structured exercise program, or a program of “successful aging” health education. The researchers called it the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study. (You can read the full study here.) During the LIFE study, the two groups were followed for a little over 2.5 years. And by the end of the study, guess which group of volunteers was more likely to still walk a quarter of a mile (without a walker)? That’s right. When it came to avoiding “major mobility disability” — which the researchers defined as becoming unable to walk 400 meters or more — a structured exercise program was better than a program of healthy aging education. Specifically, the researchers found that 30% of the exercisers experienced a period of major disability, compared to 35.5% of the seniors enrolled in the healthy aging education program. This is a very encouraging finding! That said, it’s also a bit sobering to realize that even with exercise, almost 1 in 3 older adults experienced a period of limited mobility, of which half lasted 6 months or more. In this post, I’ll share some more details on this study, because the results provide a wonderful wealth of information that can be helpful to older adults, family caregivers, and even geriatricians such as myself. Want to know how often the exercisers experienced “adverse events”? (Hint: often!) Wondering just what the structured exercise program involved? (Hint: more than walking!) Let’s dig into the details!

TEXT:Movies like this one, and C.R.A.Z.Y., make me very sad for American films with a gay subject matter. With the exception of Parting Glances and Brokeback Mountain, there are few other notable American films with the kind of depth and sincerity as this movie, The Bubble. This movie centers on two men, Noam and Ashwar, an Israle and Palestinian respectively. Their relationship is complicated by the tension between the Jews and Arabs in Israel. Couples, in the early stages of their relationships will struggle with who will call who next, or who will say \\"I love you\\" first. Noam and Ashwar's early love is complicated by suicide bombings, armed security check points, and racism. While Noam's friends accept and like Ashwar, who is Arab, it is clear that most of Tel Aviv's citizens probably don't. One of the most touching moments, and there are many in this film, is when Noam and Ashwar attend a production of \\"Bent\\". We, as movie goers, see them watching this play, and the affect it has on the two of them is profoundly captured in their eyes. And ultimately, this touching moment is played out in a very sad way in the finale of the movie. Ohad Knoller and Youseff 'Joe' Sweid are outstanding as Noam and Ashwar. Director Eytan Fox is brilliant in creating a cogent and interesting retelling of the Shakespeare classic Romeo and Juliet. And while most movies today have sex in them, (almost as a sport), this one goes back to the old tried and true version of sex with love and passion combined. It is so refreshing. Also refreshing is seeing two gay men being portrayed as people and not cartoons. There are cartoonish characters in this movie. It just doesn't happen to be the two gay guys for a change. Somewhere on this site I think I read a comparison between this movie and \\"Friends\\". Well, not really. Yes, these are youthful characters stumbling through their first uneasy steps into adulthood and relationships.

Arsenal have opened talks with Theo Walcott over a second new contract in two years. Walcott made his first Arsenal appearance in 10 months following a serious knee injury, coming on as a late substitute in Saturday’s 3-0 win over Burnley. The England forward would enter the final year of his contract at the end of the season, a scenario Arsenal are keen to avoid, and they have held initial discussions regarding an extension. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Theo Walcott returns to Arsenal training ahead of Anderlecht. Theo Walcott, who made his injury comeback against Burnley, could be handed a new deal at Arsenal. Walcott is back in first-team training after recovering from a serious knee injury. Manager Arsene Wenger wants to pre-empt any uncertainty over Walcott’s future by signing him to a longer deal. Walcott ended a saga by signing a three-and-a-half-year extension in January 2013 worth around £90,000 per week. Just 38 appearances later, Walcott is on course for another. Wenger confirmed: ‘We are starting to sit down with him. He has one and a half years to go in December. It is never an easy job with him. 'It should be his best years from now because he is 25, so hopefully we can profit from that. ‘He is a unique player, a player who has been here a long time and who gives us something different. He has been tremendous for the last few seasons. To have him back can only be a bonus for me.’ Walcott could feature again from the bench in the Champions League clash against Anderlecht. The former Southampton man’s return to fitness comes as a huge boost to Wenger, who is without six first-teamers due to injury, including Mesut Ozil, Laurent Koscielny and Mathieu Debuchy. Despite Walcott’s lack of match fitness the Arsenal manager says he is happy for him to report for international duty next week ahead of England’s clashes against Slovenia and Scotland. ‘I’m happy for him to go with England, he needs competition and games,’ said the Frenchman. ‘For us, he needs hard training. Will I use him from the bench against Anderlecht? I haven’t decided yet.’ The Arsenal winger replaced Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, pictured, against Burnley on Saturday. Walcott will be hoping to feature against Anderlecht after coming on for the last 10 minutes at the weekend. Provided results go their way, Arsenal can secure their passage into the Champions League knockout stages with two games to spare by beating Anderlecht, but Wenger insists his side will not take their foot off the gas during the final two group games as they look to clinch top spot above Borussia Dortmund. Arsenal have finished second in their group in the previous two seasons, and both times they have been eliminated in the last 16 by Bayern Munich. In 2011 they also finished second and ran into a Lionel Messi-inspired Barcelona in the first knockout round. Wenger is determined to reduce the chances of meeting one of Europe’s superpowers in the next round by finishing top of the group. ‘Before, we played Bayern twice, we played Barcelona as well,’ said Wenger. ‘It is always better you finish first because in some way you feel guilty if you don’t finish first and you think, if you are punished, it is down to you because you finished second. ‘Let’s do the job against Anderlecht and then we will see. I believe every win makes you strong and every defeat makes you weaker, so no matter what happens we will try to play until the end. 'It will be satisfying for me to qualify after four games, it will be job done. We want to take that opportunity, we are on a good run and we want to take advantage of that. Arsene Wenger has revealed he wouldn't stop Walcott linking up with Roy Hodgson's England later this month. Jack Wilshere. Laurent Koscielny. David Ospina. Mesut Ozil. Mathieu Debuchy. Oliver Giroud. ‘They gave us a tough game in the first match. We had a bit of a miraculous win in Anderlecht, needing to go into the last minute, but that was our quality in the game. ‘We have been warned. We learned a lot from the first game and now we want to win the game at the Emirates.’ Wenger will go into Tuesday's clash without Jack Wilshere who has picked up a virus. The England international, who is also suffering from a minor knee injury, missed Monday's training session but did report to the club’s London Colney HQ. The midfielder is expected to be fit for Saturday’s clash against Swansea and for England duty next week. Wenger revealed that Aaron Ramsey has also been ill over the past few days but said that no other Arsenal players have been affected by the bug. Wenger has called on his players to claim all three points against Anderlecht on Tuesday night. VIDEO Light at the end of the tunnel - Wenger.

Review: I've owned this CD since it came out over a year ago and I just decided to start posting reviews on this CD, among others. Lorrie has such a pure distinct voice that it's a shame she is without a doubt one of the most underrated country singers of all time. Sammy also has such a distinct voice and I find the two are able to pull off an amazing duet. So good, that a CD chocked full of duets was no problem for these two. 'He Drinks Tequila' obviously steals the album as far as the 'fun & fast' song goes while 'I Finally Found Someone' holds the 'slow ballad' of sorts top spot. Other lead songs include 3 Seconds, 29 Again, Sad City, Big Time, & Sugar. Overall, I rate it 4 out of 5 stars simply because Sammy's voice seems to be lacking in a few of the solo songs. It's a must have for either Sammy fans or Lorrie fans. Answer: Answer:","completion":"The tone of this product review is mostly positive. The reviewer appreciates Lorrie and Sammy's distinct voices and their ability to pull off an amazing duet. They mention their favorite songs and the album's highlights, such as 'He Drinks Tequila' and 'I Finally Found Someone.' They also give the CD a 4 out of 5 stars rating.

We have a problem that says 7*r = -8*r. Imagine you have 7 apples in one hand and then you multiply them by a mysterious number \\"r.\\" And in your other hand, you have -8 oranges, and you also multiply these by that same mysterious number \\"r.\\" What we need to do is find out the value of \\"r\\" that makes both sides equal. 1. Our first step is to bring all the \\"r\\" terms to one side. We have 7 apples in one hand and -8 oranges in the other, right? To make them equal, let's remove -8 oranges from both hands (just like sharing equally). We'll do that by adding 8*r to both sides. 7*r + 8*r = -8*r + 8*r 2. Now, let's see what happens when we combine both hands (add the apples and oranges together). We get: (7 + 8)*r =0 3. Great! Now we have 15*r = 0. Think of it this way: you have 15 apples in your hand and you want to share them equally among the \\"r\\" number of friends, how many apples does each friend get? 4. We find \\"r\\" by dividing 15 by itself: 15*r / 15 = 0 / 15 5. When we divide, we get: r = 0 So, the mysterious number \\"r\\" is 0! That means if you multiply 7 apples or -8 oranges by 0, both would be equal.

Article: Running like the wind, roaring like thunder, tigers have long been feared and respected as a king of the animal world. But last week a report said that there are no more than 30 wild tigers left in south China. This was the conclusion of a team of scientists from China's State Forestry Administration and the World Nature Fund. The South China tiger, also known as the Chinese tiger, is native to southern China. In the 1950s, there were over 4,000 tigers found in mountain forests in the country. But due to the destruction of their natural habitat and uncontrolled hunting, it has been pushed on to the list of the world's top ten most endangered species. Sixty-six of the big cats can be found in the cages of a dozen zoos around China. But they are nothing like their wild cousins. They have lost their natural skills such as hunting and killing. If they were set free they could not look after themselves. \\"Breeding has damaged the quality of the species,\\" said Pei Enle, deputy director of the Shanghai Zoo. To reintroduce the species into the wild, the country started a programme to send five to ten young tigers to South Africa. Four of them have already arrived. Progress has been made as two elder tigers have recovered some of their instincts and can hunt wild animals by themselves at the African base. \\"South Africans are very experienced in reintroducing big animals to the wild. The country has very good natural conditions for the tigers to learn in,\\" said Lu Jun, office director of the National Wildlife Research and Development Centre. \\"We tried in Fujian Province, but it was not successful as there was not a complete eco-chain and there was a lack of space.\\" The tigers should return to China in 2009 when the reservations in Fujian are ready. Question: What is the purpose of sending young tigers to South Africa? - To help the tigers recover their ability to live in the wild. - To provide them with a better environment. - To get the tigers to go on a tour. - To find a complete eco-chain for them. Answer:","completion":"The purpose of sending young tigers to South Africa is to help the tigers recover their ability to live in the wild.
