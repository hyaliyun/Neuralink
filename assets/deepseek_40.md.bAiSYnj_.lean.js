Write the answer: Who refuses Mr St John Rivers’ offer of marriage?","completion":"Jane Eyre, the protagonist of Charlotte Bronte's novel \\"Jane Eyre,\\" refuses Mr. St. John Rivers' offer of marriage. The reasons behind Jane's refusal and the significance of this rejection are essential aspects of the story, shedding light on Jane's personal journey and growth throughout the novel. Mr. St. John Rivers is Jane's cousin, who she meets later in the novel after fleeing Thornfield Hall - the estate where she works as a governess for Mr. Edward Rochester, whom Jane falls in love with. However, Jane's love story with Mr. Rochester faces several obstacles, forcing her to leave Thornfield. While living with her newfound relatives, particularly with Mr. St. John Rivers and his sisters Mary and Diana, Jane grows to appreciate their kind and caring nature. Mr. St. John Rivers, an ambitious, focused, and religious man, proposes to Jane, but not out of romantic love. He views Jane as a suitable partner for his missionary goals in India, believing that her morals and practical nature make her an ideal life partner in terms of their shared faith and good works. Moreover, marrying Jane would provide her with financial security, as she has recently inherited a substantial sum of money from her late uncle. Despite the sensible and noble reasons presented by Mr. St. John Rivers, Jane refuses his marriage proposal. Jane's decision can be attributed to several factors: 1. Authentic Love: Jane values genuine emotional connection and yearns for true love, as she had experienced with Mr. Rochester. She senses that Mr. St. John Rivers does not truly love her, and instead, fulfilling his aspirations serves as his primary motivation in his proposal. 2. Independence: Throughout the novel, Jane exemplifies an independent and strong-willed woman who not only seeks love but also desires to maintain her dignity and autonomy. Mr. St. John Rivers' controlling nature clashes with her aspirations for self-determination. 3. Personal Growth: Refusing the proposal demonstrates Jane's growth throughout the story. Despite societal expectations and the pragmatic benefits of marrying Mr. St. John Rivers, Jane chooses to prioritize her emotional needs and self-respect. 4. Incompatible Personalities: Jane recognizes the vast differences between her own passionate and empathetic nature and Mr. St. John Rivers' cold, driven personality. She realizes they would not make a happy and fulfilling couple in the long run. After respectfully refusing Mr. St. John Rivers’ proposal, Jane returns to Thornfield Hall, only to find it burnt down. She learns about the tragic events that occurred during her absence, ultimately reconnecting with Mr. Rochester. Despite his newly acquired disabilities from the fire, Jane no longer faces obstacles in her love for Mr. Rochester, and the two marry, finding happiness and companionship with each other. In the end, Jane's refusal of Mr. St. John Rivers' proposal reiterates the importance of emotional honesty, self-awareness, and personal fulfillment embedded in the themes of Charlotte Bronte's \\"Jane Eyre.\\""},{"prompt":"Read the following article and answer the question.

Indians always shake their heads when they talk to others. It doesn't mean \\"No\\". If someone wants to visit India, he should know this, or he will be in trouble. One day, a foreign officer went to India on business. He hired a car and asked an Indian to drive him. When he told his driver to take him to his office, the Indian shook his head at once. The officer said again and the driver shook his head again. At last the officer, of course, got angry. \\"How dare you refuse my order?\\" he shouted, \\"Drive me to my office at once!\\" The driver answered in quite a loud voice, too. \\"Yes, sir!\\" But to the officer's surprise, the driver shook his head at the same time.

Question: This article: In 1861 Saint-Saëns accepted his only post as a teacher, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse, Paris, which Louis Niedermeyer had established in 1853 to train first-rate organists and choirmasters for the churches of France. Niedermeyer himself was professor of piano; when he died in March 1861, Saint-Saëns was appointed to take charge of piano studies. He scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner. His best-known pupil, Gabriel Fauré, recalled in old age: After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known. ... At the time I was 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment ... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I [have] had for him, throughout my life. Saint-Saëns further enlivened the academic regime by writing, and composing incidental music for, a one-act farce performed by the students (including André Messager). He conceived his best-known piece, The Carnival of the Animals, with his students in mind, but did not finish composing it until 1886, more than twenty years after he left the Niedermeyer school.In 1864 Saint-Saëns caused some surprise by competing a second time for the Prix de Rome. Many in musical circles were puzzled by his decision to enter the competition again, now that he was establishing a reputation as a soloist and composer. He was once more unsuccessful. Berlioz, one of the judges, wrote: We gave the Prix de Rome the other day to a young man who wasn't expecting to win it and who went almost mad with joy. We were all expecting the prize to go to Camille Saint-Saëns, who had the strange notion of competing. I confess I was sorry to vote against a man who is truly a great artist and one who is already well known, practically a celebrity.... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the man who scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music., what is it ?

(AP) — An Oregon man impersonated a sheriff's deputy while taking an SUV for a test drive and pulled over a motorcyclist, authorities said. Anthony McGuire, 39, of Salem was arrested Saturday after the motorcyclist and two employees from the car lot sensed something was off and called real deputies, Sgt. Chris Baldridge of the Marion County Sheriff's Office said Monday. Baldridge said McGuire visited Good Fellows Auto Sales three days in a row and told workers he was a sheriff's deputy. Each day, he wanted to test drive a black Chevrolet Tahoe. On the third day, two suspicious employees decided to join the customer for the drive. Just down the street from the lot, McGuire suddenly lowered the window and yelled at a motorcyclist to pull over. The motorcyclist obeyed and McGuire told him he was being stopped for speeding. Baldridge said McGuire had no badge or identification, and his manner led everyone else to conclude he might be a fake. The employees from Good Fellows Auto Sales, who could not be reached for comment, told investigators that the motorcyclist had gone around the SUV because McGuire was driving very slowly. \\"They said the motorcyclist really wasn't doing anything wrong,\\" Baldridge said. \\"He was acting for his own safety to get around the slow-moving vehicle.\\" Baldridge said McGuire confessed to impersonating a deputy and was taken to the county jail. He was charged with criminal impersonation, a misdemeanor. Baldridge said McGuire did not explain his actions. Investigators think McGuire might have pulled over other drivers. Anyone who might have been a victim has been asked to call the sheriff's office. McGuire was released from county jail Monday afternoon. It was not immediately clear whether he had a lawyer, and a court date has not been set. Public records show he was arrested in December 2011 for unauthorized use of a vehicle.

Passage:Beginning his career in England with Everton in 1997, three years later he moved on to Port Vale, having never turned out for the first team at Everton despite winning caps for the Republic of Ireland under-21s and lifting the FA Youth Cup. He spent four years with Vale, and did make 39 first team appearances, though was never their first choice keeper. He also spent time on loan at Macclesfield Town, but never made it onto the field. He returned to Ireland in 2004 to sign a contract with Shelbourne, who he helped to the League of Ireland title in 2006.

ParkScore ranks urban park systems by a formula that analyzes median park size, park acres as percent of city area, the percent of city residents within a half-mile of a park, spending of park services per resident, and the number of playgrounds per 10,000 residents.\\" Answer: The answer is:","completion":"New York City's system of green areas holds the bragging rights of being ranked the second-best park system among the 50 most populous U.S. cities, as reported by The Trust for Public Land's 2013 ParkScore ranking. This notable achievement places NYC's park system just behind that of Minneapolis in terms of excellence and quality. The ParkScore ranking evaluates urban park systems based on a comprehensive formula that takes into account several key factors essential for a thriving and accessible green space network. These factors include: 1. Median Park Size: One criterion used to rate green areas is the median size of the parks within the city. Larger parks typically offer a wider range of amenities and recreational opportunities for residents, contributing to a higher ParkScore. 2. Park Acres as Percent of City Area: This factor measures the proportion of a city's total area that is dedicated to parks and green spaces. Cities with a higher percentage of parkland are commended in the ParkScore ranking for providing sufficient open spaces for their residents to enjoy. 3. Percentage of City Residents within a Half-mile of a Park: The accessibility of parks is an essential factor in an efficient green space network, and the ParkScore ranking evaluates the proximity of parks and green spaces to the residents. A higher percentage of residents within a half-mile of a park means that more people have easy access to the city's park system without needing to travel long distances. 4. Spending on Park Services per Resident: The park system's quality is also determined by the budget allocated to maintaining and developing parks and recreational facilities. Cities with a higher investment per resident on park services boast better-maintained green spaces, attracting more visitors and ensuring their long-term sustainability. 5. Number of Playgrounds per 10,000 Residents: A city's park system is also assessed based on the number of playgrounds available for children. A higher ratio of playgrounds per resident indicates a dedication to creating an inclusive and family-friendly environment within the green spaces. According to the 2013 ParkScore ranking, New York City's impressive achievements in each of these key areas have earned its park system a well-deserved second-place rating among the 50 most populous cities in the United States. This distinction highlights the city's commitment to developing and maintaining a top-quality network of green spaces for residents and visitors alike to enjoy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Federal Reserve, however, continued to increase the money supply, resulting in stagflation and a rapidly declining value of the U.S. dollar in the 1970s. This was largely due to the prevailing economic view at the time that inflation and real economic growth were linked (the Phillips curve), and so inflation was regarded as relatively benign.

In fact, people's cognitive styles \\"can be a better predictor of what music they like than their personality\\"—such as how neurotic or conscientious they are—the study's lead author, a trained jazz saxophonist, tells Popular Science. To study this, the researchers had more than 4,000 volunteers complete the Empathy Quotient and NEO Personality Inventory-Revised and listen to and rate 50 music excerpts from a library of 26 sub-genres that aimed to mitigate cultural or personal ties to certain songs. They then calculated each person’s scores across five \\"MUSIC\\" dimensions—mellow, unpretentious, sophisticated, intense, and contemporary—and found that cognitive style influences the very genres of music people like (empathizers drift toward \\"mellow\\" and \\"unpretentious\\" music like soft rock and blue grass, while systemizers prefer \\"intense\\" music like punk rock and heavy metal). Even within genres they found differences. Those who scored high as empathizers drift toward music that has low energy or great emotional depth, while the systemizers tend toward music that is high energy or positive.

The way you identify yourself could be a key predictor of your taste in music, according to a study by University of Cambridge psychologists published in the journal PLoS ONE. Surprisingly, people's cognitive styles seem to carry more weight in determining their musical preferences than their personalities, like how neurotic or conscientious they are. In the study, more than 4,000 volunteers completed the Empathy Quotient and NEO Personality Inventory-Revised before listening to and rating 50 music excerpts chosen from a library of 26 sub-genres. The aim was to minimize cultural or personal biases towards certain songs. With their responses, the researchers calculated scores of the participants across five \\"MUSIC\\" dimensions: mellow, unpretentious, sophisticated, intense, and contemporary. The findings revealed that cognitive style significantly influences a person's preferred music genre. Empathizers, who typically focus on the emotions of those around them, tend to gravitate towards \\"mellow\\" and \\"unpretentious\\" music like soft rock and bluegrass. On the other hand, systemizers, who are more interested in patterns and rules of the world, prefer \\"intense\\" music like punk rock and heavy metal. Not only did cognitive styles influence genre preferences, but they also determined tastes within genres themselves.

With rising anti-slavery sentiment at home and changing economic realities, Great Britain outlawed the international slave trade in 1807. Following the Napoleonic Wars, Great Britain established the West Africa Squadron in an attempt to halt the international traffic in slaves. It stopped ships of other nations that were leaving the African coast with slaves; the seized slaves were taken to Freetown, a colony in West Africa originally established for the resettlement of freed slaves from Britain. Britain intervened in the Lagos Kingship power struggle by bombarding Lagos in 1851, deposing the slave trade friendly Oba Kosoko, helping to install the amenable Oba Akitoye, and signing the Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos on 1 January 1852.

But the court's eight justices so far appear divided on the hot button issue. It is the court's first major abortion case in decades and the first big case since its most conservative justice, Antonin Scalia, died in February. His death leaves the court evenly split between liberals and conservatives, with all eyes on Justice Anthony Kennedy who holds a swing vote on the highly charged issue. Hundreds of activists - both in support and in opposition to abortion - camped outside the court on Wednesday. The crowd was overwhelmingly in favour of abortion access for women. Mostly younger women enthusiastically gathered together, holding signs and wearing hats emblazoned with the logo of pro-choice groups. They called the Texas abortion regulation in question a \\"sham law\\". \\"It's too important to miss,\\" said Gena Johnson, 36, who came from Chicago for the hearing. \\"My mom fought for Roe v Wade in the 1970s, and now here we areâ€¦ still fighting about abortion, it's ridiculous.

It also focuses on a mandate within the law already gone into effect that requires doctors to have the ability to admit patients to hospitals within 30 miles (50km) of their clinic. Opponents to the law say it would leave just 10 abortion clinics in Texas, making it harder for women there to obtain the procedure. But the law's proponents argue it is necessary to protect women's health. Justices at the court must decide whether such restrictions on clinics hampers a woman's constitutional right to an abortion. Hear both sides speak What is Planned Parenthood? But after 90 minutes of arguments, they failed to show a unified front on the issue. In their questions, liberal judges voiced hostility towards the law while the conservatives appeared more sympathetic. Justice Kennedy did not give a clear indication of which way he stood, however he did suggest sending the case back to the lower court to allow more evidence to be gathered on the law's impact. A ruling is not expected until the end of June, although experts say this is likely to end in deadlock with a 4-4 split in the case. Without a majority verdict, the Texas law would be implemented but the court will not set a nationwide legal precedent. Abortion is a highly disputed issue in the US, and is a hot topic in the presidential election, with all of the Republican candidates backing bans on the procedure. The Supreme Court legalised abortion more than 40 years ago in a landmark ruling, but some states have since endeavoured to pass laws placing restrictions on a woman's ability to terminate a pregnancy.","completion":"Part #1: Reading the article and understanding the overall message.

Answer:","completion":"Rhodes Lynx football represents Rhodes College, which is closely associated with the Presbyterian Church (USA) religious denomination. Established in 1848, Rhodes College (originally named the Masonic University of Tennessee and then Southwestern Presbyterian University) was founded by freemasons and members of the Presbyterian Church with the aim of providing higher education grounded in the liberal arts. The Presbyterian Church (USA), or PC (USA), is the largest Presbyterian denomination in the United States. It is the result of a merger in 1983 between two Presbyterian denominations: the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (UPCUSA) and the Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS). The denomination traces its roots back to the Reformed tradition established by John Calvin in the 16th-century Protestant Reformation. Rhodes College, as an institution affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA), holds a covenant relationship with the denomination. While the college embraces its Presbyterian heritage and connection, it values and welcomes students, faculty, and staff from diverse religious backgrounds, fostering an environment that supports interfaith dialogue, understanding, and spiritual growth. Throughout its history, Rhodes College has sought to balance its religious affiliation with a commitment to academic excellence, intellectual freedom, and the development of personal values. The campus chaplain, as well as the campus ministries, play a pivotal role in fostering spiritual life on campus and supporting the college's commitment to community service, social justice, and peace. Some of the notable features of the relationship between Rhodes College and the Presbyterian Church (USA) include: 1. A commitment to liberal arts education grounded in an understanding of the Christian faith and the Reformed theological tradition. 2. The study and teaching of religion as a crucial part of the liberal arts curriculum. 3. Encouragement of critical thinking and open inquiry as essential components of faith development. 4. Focus on the importance of ethical decision-making, social responsibility, and service to others as part of a well-rounded education. 5.

Options: - watch tv - socialize - go somewhere - jump rope - clean room Explain why a human would choose \\"go somewhere\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human might choose \\"go somewhere\\" as a solution to boredom while sitting at a friend's home for several reasons. Here are the steps and justification for this choice: 1. Assessing the situation: The person realizes they are bored, and wants to change their mental state by engaging in a fun or interesting activity. 2. Evaluating the options: They consider the listed options - watch TV, socialize, go somewhere, jump rope, and clean the room. 3. Analyzing context: They might find watching TV unappealing due to inactivity or uninteresting content. Socializing might not be an option if their friend is busy or unavailable. Jumping rope could be unsuitable due to space constraints or lack of equipment. Cleaning the room may not be their responsibility, or it could infringe on their friend's privacy. 4. Prioritizing: \\"Go somewhere\\" stands out as an appealing option, as it offers the opportunity to engage in various activities away from the friend's home. 5. Seeking social connection: If their friend is also bored or available to join them, this option can also serve as a bonding experience. They can explore new places or engage in shared interests. 6.

Her protective father, Walter (Larry Miller), is distraught by the news, as he wants Kat to attend college nearby. Kat distracts her father by revealing that Bianca was given a ride home from school by Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan). Bianca begs her father to allow her to date, but to no avail. Kat's aversion to dating prompts the father to come up with a new rule: Bianca can only date if Kat is dating.Cameron starts tutoring Bianca, and she informs him of her fathers rule after Cameron makes many failed attempts to ask her out.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Acid rain makes waters acidic - Causes them to absorb aluminum from soil - The water runs off from the soil into lakes, streams, etc - Fish and their eggs die - Frogs and plants die - Insects and other wildlife die - The ecosystem is out of balance, causing further problems - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more wildlife dies happens, how will it affect MORE damage by acid rain. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the perturbation hypothesis you mentioned can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of damage caused by acid rain. If more wildlife dies due to acid rain and its consequences, the damage caused by acid rain will increase and possibly intensify. This increased damage can affect the ecosystem in a few ways: 1. Loss of biodiversity: As more wildlife dies, the biodiversity of the affected ecosystem will decrease. This loss of biodiversity can weaken the ecosystem, making it less resilient and more vulnerable to future disturbances. A lack of biodiversity also decreases an ecosystem's ability to provide essential ecosystem services like nutrient cycling and air and water purification. 2. Disruption of food chains: If more wildlife dies, especially species at the lower levels of the food chain, it will disrupt the balance of predator-prey relationships that maintain the stability of the ecosystem. This disruption can lead to further declines in species populations and loss of balance in the ecosystem. 3. Reduced ability for natural recovery: With more wildlife dying, the ecosystem's ability to naturally recover from the damage done by acid rain might be reduced. Certain plant and animal species play crucial roles in maintaining ecosystem health and recovering from disturbances. If these species are lost due to the damage caused by acid rain, the ecosystem may not be able to recover. 4. Secondary effects on human communities: The increased damage to the ecosystem due to the death of more wildlife can also have secondary effects on human communities that depend on the ecosystem for resources like food, drinking water, and other ecosystem services. It can lead to loss of economic opportunities (e.g., fishing and tourism) and reduced access to clean water sources for local communities. 5. Feedback mechanisms and amplification: As the perturbation increases and more wildlife die, there may be feedback mechanisms that further amplify the consequences of acid rain. For example, the loss of vegetation can lead to increased soil erosion, causing more aluminum to be released into water systems and intensifying the acidification process. This can create a cyclical pattern of increased damage to the ecosystem caused by acid rain compounded by the death of wildlife. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis you have mentioned can have both direct and indirect effects on the damage caused by acid rain. The increased death of wildlife can further exacerbate the consequences of acid rain, leading to even more damage to ecosystems and the services they provide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Problem-Solving Strategies for the Effects of Heat Transfer 1. Examine the situation to determine that there is a change in the temperature or phase. Is there heat transfer into or out of the system? When the presence or absence of a phase change is not obvious, you may wish to first solve the problem as if there were no phase changes, and examine the temperature change obtained. If it is sufficient to take you past a boiling or melting point, you should then go back and do the problem in steps—temperature change, phase change, subsequent temperature change, and so on. Identify and list all objects that change temperature and phase. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). A written list is useful. Make a list of what is given or what can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns). Solve the appropriate equation for the quantity to be determined (the unknown). If there is a temperature change, the transferred heat depends on the specific heat (see Table 14.1) whereas, for a phase change, the transferred heat depends on the latent heat. See Table 14.2. Substitute the knowns along with their units into the appropriate equation and obtain numerical solutions complete with units. You will need to do this in steps if there is more than one stage to the process (such as a temperature change followed by a phase change).

However, after analyzing the paragraph provided, it does not directly support or refute the hypothesis. The paragraph discusses a systemic problem in healthcare costs and attributes the rise to the lack of consumer involvement in the decision-making process. It further explains that most healthcare costs are covered by third parties, leading to a disconnect between the actual user of healthcare and the purchaser of healthcare. The paragraph argues that market forces are not involved in healthcare due to this disconnect. While the paragraph highlights a potential cause for rising healthcare costs, it does not specifically address any geographical region or the west coast.

A dedication to Connor's daughter Summer, her second child with American pop singer Marc Terenzi, it was written by Connor along with frequent collaborators, Rob Tyger and Kay Denar, for her sixth studio album, \\"Sexy as Hell\\" (2008), with production helmed by the latter. Musically, \\"I'll Kiss It Away\\" is a mid-tempo pop ballad with contemporary R&B influences that combines classic chord progression on an acoustic guitar with a modern-sounding 808 drum beat. The song samples US \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100 top ten hit Tattoo by R&B singer Jordin Sparks. Context_2 : Electribe is the name given to a group of electronic musical instruments by Korg. From its beginnings with the Electribe R to the ESX-1, this series includes both analogue modeling synthesizers and sampling drum machines that can be programmed the same as a drum machine. The analogue modeling synth and sampling drum machine both share a \\"drum-pattern\\" section and a \\"synth-pattern\\" section, whereby the user can not only program drum patterns, but also synth and basslines. These hybrid machines could be considered 'grooveboxes'. Context_3 : Sarah Connor Live in Concert – A Night to Remember: Pop Meets Classic is the first live DVD released by German pop star Sarah Connor. It was recorded live on January 24, 2003 at Altes Kesselhaus in Düsseldorf, Germany. Context_4 : Journey is the third and final studio album by British experimental rock band Kingdom Come. After the band featured drastically different styles on their first two albums, and after several line-up changes, band leader Arthur Brown worked the band towards a new direction for \\"Journey\\". The album was the first album in history to use a drum machine responsible for all the percussive sounds on the album. The drum machine in question was the Bentley Rhythm Ace, manufactured by Ace Tone. Although the band had commented the album was entirely based on the drum machine, the band attempted to, in rock and electronic terms, create an album that was the closest they could get \\"to a string quartet\\". The album features other experimental techniques, including using a triangle to guide guitar playing and excessive use of Mellotron and synthesizers from new member Victor Peranio, who replaced Michael \\"Goodge\\" Harris early on production.

Context_6 : \\"Living to Love You\\" is a song by German singer–songwriter Sarah Connor from her fourth studio album, \\"Naughty but Nice\\" (2005). Written and produced by Sarah Connor, Rob Tyger and Kay Denar, it was released as the album's lead single on 8 November 2004. The song samples Céline Dion's 1997 hit single \\"My Heart Will Go On\\".

It featured advances in technology compared to previous Roland drum machines: it had an LCD graphic display, showing a step-programming grid for the various drum voices. The DR-110 allowed the drum sounds to be played manually from rubber pads (as well as programmed). Like all Roland's previous drum machines, the DR-110's synthesized drum \\"voices\\" (synthesizer sounds) used analog synthesizer circuits. Tempo was continuously variable between 45 and 300 beats per minute (BPM). The DR-110 used a 4-bit Hitachi microprocessor and 1KB of μPD444C RAM memory.

It was the first Roland drum machine to use samples (for its cymbal and hi-hat sounds) alongside analog sounds. Designed by Tadao Kikumoto, who also designed the Roland TB-303 synthesizer, the 909 features a 16-step step sequencer and drum sounds that aimed for realism and cost-effectiveness. It is fully programmable, and like its predecessor, the TR-808, it can store entire songs with multiple sections, as opposed to simply storing patterns. It was the first MIDI-equipped drum machine.

Context: I was 35 weeks pregnant when I had my stroke. For weeks prior to the event I kept experiencing ‘visual disturbances.’ I felt when I was reading a newspaper or book a sense that my eyes were crossing. I’d feel aware right before it would occur and I would rush to look in a mirror only to discover my eyes were not crossing. I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me. Later I was told by a surgeon what I was experiencing was ‘textbook’ for the passing of blood clots through my occipital area of the brain! The feeling would eventually subside. I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth. My husband asked me what was going on and I apparently told him, I was ‘stroking’ out. He got up from the table assuming I was OK and went off to take his morning shower. While in the shower it occurred to him something might not be right. He came back to the table where I was struggling to lift myself from the chair. I put my hands on the table to lift my body and my left hand kept sliding off the edge. He finally got behind me and tried to lift me under my arms and I crumbled to the floor. He then called my OB and told him he thought I’d had a stroke. My OB immediately expressed his doubt but my husband was advised to call an ambulance to get me to the ER. I never really experienced pain from the stroke. Question: How long were they sitting at the breakfast table?

Demand is identified and then satisfied through a supply chain. Attempts are made to increase demand through advertising. In the 2000s, an increasing amount of retailing began occurring online using electronic payment and delivery via a courier or via postal mail. Retailing as a sector includes subordinated services, such as delivery. The term \\"retailer\\" is also applied where a service provider services the small orders of a large number of individuals, rather than large orders of a small number of wholesale, corporate or government clientele. Shops may be on residential streets, streets with few or no houses, or in a shopping mall. Shopping streets may restrict traffic to pedestrians only. Sometimes a shopping street has a partial or full roof to create a more comfortable shopping environment protecting customers from various types of weather conditions such as extreme temperatures, winds or precipitation.

But I never really liked being on the water, the way my father did. I liked being in the water, moving through it, having it all around me. I was not a strong swimmer, or one who learned to swim early, for I had my fears. But I loved being in the swimming pool close to my father's office and spending those summer days with my father, who would come by on a break. I needed him to see what I could do. My father would stand there in his suit, the only person not in swimsuit. After swimming, I would go inside his office and sit on the wooden chair in front of his big desk, where he let me play with anything I found in his top desk drawer. Sometimes, if I was left alone at his desk while he worked in the lab, an assistant or a student might come in and tell me perhaps I shouldn't be playing with his office things.

The people of Liptar have found a way to use water as a source of power and they barely use any fossil fuels at all. The habitats of which planet's animals are in more danger? A:","completion":"The habitats of the animals on planet Mandron are in more danger as compared to those on planet Liptar due to the extensive use of fossil fuels by the people of Mandron. There are several reasons why using fossil fuels poses a threat to the habitats and well-being of animals on planet Mandron, whereas the more sustainable use of water as a power source on Liptar greatly reduces the negative impact on their environment. 1. Air pollution: The burning of fossil fuels releases a significant amount of air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and carbon dioxide. These pollutants can have various adverse effects on animal habitats, including contributing to respiratory diseases, acid rain, and smog. Acid rain, for instance, can acidify water bodies, damage plants and trees, and ultimately harm the ecosystems that animals depend on. 2. Climate change: The excessive use of fossil fuels leads to the release of large amounts of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide. This contributes to global warming, resulting in climate change. Climate change can lead to the loss or alteration of habitats for many species, making it difficult for them to survive and reproduce. This, in turn, can result in shifts in ecosystem composition and the extinction of some species. 3. Water pollution: The extraction, processing, and transportation of fossil fuels can cause significant water pollution, affecting the quality of water in streams, rivers, and oceans. Spills and leaks from oil pipelines, for example, release toxic substances into the water, damaging aquatic life and the ecosystems that support them. Moreover, some power plants using fossil fuels require vast amounts of water for cooling, which can lead to thermal pollution and harm aquatic life in nearby water sources. 4. Habitat destruction: The extraction and transportation of fossil fuels often require large-scale infrastructure and land clearance, causing direct habitat destruction. This can include the construction of mines, pipelines, power plants, and roads, which leads to the loss of ecosystems and habitats that animals rely on for their survival. In contrast, the people of Liptar have adopted the use of water as a source of power, which tends to have fewer environmental consequences. Harnessing water power, such as using hydroelectric dams or other water-based technologies, results in fewer emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases, mitigating the negative impacts associated with fossil fuel use. However, it must be noted that water-based energy sources are not entirely without environmental consequences. For instance, building large hydroelectric dams can result in the displacement of animal and plant species, depending on the specific location and scale of the project. Additionally, harnessing tidal power may have unintended effects on marine ecosystems. Despite these potential challenges, the overall environmental impact is still significantly smaller than that of fossil fuel use. In conclusion, the habitats of animals on planet Mandron face a greater danger due to the extensive use of fossil fuels, which contribute to air and water pollution, climate change, and habitat destruction. In contrast, the utilization of water as a power source on planet Liptar helps in mitigating these negative environmental impacts, thus offering a more sustainable solution for energy generation and providing a safer habitat for their animals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: BEIJING, July 21-More and more parents in Shanghai have found that their children are forgetting how to use Shanghai dialect to express themselves, according to a report in the city's Jiefang Daily on July 11, and some have begun forcing them to speak it at home. Language experts say that the promotion of Putonghua, and the large number of non-Shanghainese setting down in the city have meant that the local dialect has lost its previous high social status, according to the report. They have urged that the dialect be protected alongside Putonghua (also known as Mandarin), the nation's common tongue that has been systematically promoted since new China was founded in 1949. In their opinion, dialects carry and preserve local culture . They say that a dialect is not only a linguistic tool. But is also like a person's \\"birthmark\\" and part of their local identity and feeling of belonging. They recommended that TV and radio stations set up channels and programs using dialects , and that schools offer selective courses in which the dialects are taught. The experts also suggested that dialect be protected while maintaining high standards of Putonghua and a multicultural environment in the city.

Please answer the following question: Who finds mutated men who attempt to kill them? Answer the above question based on the context below: Dr. Edwards arrives at a secluded island laboratory to examine Mr. Porter. Although Porter carries a deadly flesh-eating virus, he is asymptomatic and shows no signs of necrosis. Along with fellow researchers Camila and Bridget, Dr. Edwards spends two months examining Porter in isolation. Porter continually asks to see his wife, but he is continually denied. Marcus prepares to marry wealthy heiress Kate Arias in the Dominican Republic. Mark's best friend Dobs, his brother Josh, and Josh's girlfriend Penny charter a boat and take Mark to a supposedly unpopulated island for a low key bachelor party. Sympathetic researcher Camila creates a rapport with Porter. Frustrated with his confinement, Porter intentionally infects one of the researchers as he begins revolting against his continued isolation. Porter warns Camila that he is dangerous. Bridget becomes infected. Josh and Penny go snorkeling and find dead sea animals littering the ocean floor. When they return to camp, Josh and Penny discover strange rashes on their skin. While Josh performs oral sex on her, Penny begins spitting up large amounts of blood and her flesh starts melting. Josh radios for help and a voice claiming to be Dr. Edwards provides him with instructions. Realizing that they need help but are stranded, Mark and Dobs search the island and find a bunker. Inside, the two friends discover research related to the virus. They also find mutated men who attempt to kill them. Mark and Dobs are able to escape the human danger, but Dobs becomes infected. The bunker turns out to be connected to Dr. Edwards' laboratory. Josh reunites with Mark and Dobs and they find the researchers. After formulating a plan for extraction, Bridget and Josh split off to gather Penny and wait for the boat on the beach. Dobs and Edwards also go on their own while Porter, Camila, and Marcus initiate the laboratory's self-destruct sequence.

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: James is memorizing the periodic table and some of the features of the elements on it. He is currently working on the fourth row which starts with Potassium (K) on the far left and ends with Krypton (Kr) to the far right. and a hint : The increase in electrons across the periodic table explains why elements go from metals to metalloids and then to nonmetals from left to right across the table. Look at period 2 in Figure below as an example. Lithium (Li) is a metal, boron (B) a metalloid, and fluorine (F) and neon (Ne) are nonmetals. The inner energy level is full for all four elements. This level has just one orbital and can hold a maximum of two electrons. The outer energy level is a different story. This level has four orbitals and can hold a maximum of eight electrons. Lithium has just one electron in this level, boron has three, fluorine has seven, and neon has eight. Please answer this question : Given two elements are in the same row of the periodic table, which element will have a higher number of elections, a metal or a nonmetal? Answer:","completion":"Given two elements in the same row of the periodic table, a nonmetal will have a higher number of electrons compared to a metal. As you move from left to right across a row (period) in the periodic table, the number of electrons and protons increases. At the left side of the table, you have metals, which have fewer electrons in their outer energy level. As you move to the right, you encounter metalloids, and then, further to the right, you find nonmetals with more electrons in their outer energy level. In the example provided, lithium (Li) is a metal with 3 electrons, while neon (Ne) is a nonmetal with 10 electrons. Both are in the same row (period 2), but the nonmetal (neon) has more electrons than the metal (lithium). This pattern of increasing electrons from metals to nonmetals holds true for all the rows in the periodic table."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: Title: Disappointed Review: When I saw Kellerman had a new book coming out, I signed up for it at the library without knowing what it was about, just assuming it was another Alex Deleware book. When I picked it up, I was disappointed that it wasn't, but still optimistic, since I love Kellerman's books. This book is a disappointment. I was well over 100 pages in, and still was not \\"into\\" the story. The main character, Jeremy, did not draw me in like Alex did in the other books. I didn't feel a connection with Jeremy, and didn't find myself rooting for him, like I do for Alex and Milo. The story is very slow moving, no driving suspense like the Deleware books. I finished the book because I was \\"curious\\" about how it would end, not because I had a driving need like I do with really good mysteries. I hope Kellerman sticks with the Deleware series, it's a much better read in my opinion. Is this product review negative? Answer:","completion":"Yes, this product review is negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment with the book for various reasons. Firstly, they had initially expected an Alex Deleware book, but upon realizing that it was not, they still decided to give it a chance due to their love for Kellerman's books. However, the reviewer found several issues with the book, including the main character, Jeremy, who they claimed did not resonate with them as much as Alex from the Deleware series did. The reviewer also felt that the story was slow-moving and lacked the driving suspense present in the Deleware books. Their motivation to finish the book stemmed from sheer curiosity instead of the gripping intensity one would expect from a good mystery novel. In conclusion, the reviewer expresses a preference for Kellerman's Deleware series and hopes that the author would focus on that series instead of exploring other characters and storylines like this one. This review portrays the book as a disappointment when compared to the author's other works, making it a negative product review."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The President covered the fact that he bugged the offices in the White House. pick from the following. [A]. different meanings [B]. the same meaning","completion":"[A]. different meanings The verb \\"cover\\" in English can have several meanings, and in the sentences provided, it is used in two different ways. In the first sentence, \\"Cover your head!\\", the context suggests a physical use of the word. It advises or instructs someone to put something over their head to protect it in some way. This could be from the rain, sun or any other potential harm. The term \\"cover\\" here is used in the sense of shielding or safeguarding. It implies placing an object over another to prevent it from exposure. This is its literal, physical meaning. On the other hand, in the second sentence, \\"The President covered the fact that he bugged the offices in the White House.\\", \\"cover\\" is used metaphorically. It means to hide, obscure, or keep something secret. In this context, the president is not physically covering something but rather concealing the truth or information about his actions. This is related to its figurative or idiomatic usage where \\"covering something up\\" generally implies deception or secrecy. Therefore, although \\"cover\\" is the keyword in both sentences, its meaning varies significantly depending on the context of its use.

It is also agreed that \\"no direct or categorical and stringent proof of the dogma can be brought forward from Scripture\\". But it is claimed that the doctrine is implicitly contained in the teaching of the Fathers. Their expressions on the subject of the sinlessness of Mary are, it is pointed out, so ample and so absolute that they must be taken to include original sin as well as actual. Thus in the first five centuries such epithets as \\"in every respect holy\\", \\"in all things unstained\\", \\"super-innocent\\", and \\"singularly holy\\" are applied to her; she is compared to Eve before the fall, as ancestress of a redeemed people; she is \\"the earth before it was accursed\\". The well-known words of St. Augustine (d. 430) may be cited: \\"As regards the mother of God,\\" he says, \\"I will not allow any question whatever of sin.\\" It is true that he is here speaking directly of actual or personal sin. But his argument is that all men are sinners; that they are so through original depravity; that this original depravity may be overcome by the grace of God, and he adds that he does not know but that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin \\"of every sort\\" (omni ex parte). What phrases were used to describe Mary ?","completion":"People used different phrases to describe Mary.

To secure commercial publication in 1896, Crane agreed to remove profanity, but he also made stylistic revisions. Bowers's approach was to preserve the stylistic and literary changes of 1896, but to revert to the 1893 readings where he believed that Crane was fulfilling the publisher's intention rather than his own. There were, however, intermediate cases that could reasonably have been attributed to either intention, and some of Bowers's choices came under fire – both as to his judgment, and as to the wisdom of conflating readings from the two different versions of Maggie.

Although foreign trade returned after these hostilities, Boston's merchants had found alternatives for their capital investments in the interim. Manufacturing became an important component of the city's economy, and by the mid-19th century, the city's industrial manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance. Until the early 20th century, Boston remained one of the nation's largest manufacturing centers and was notable for its garment production and leather-goods industries. A network of small rivers bordering the city and connecting it to the surrounding region facilitated shipment of goods and led to a proliferation of mills and factories. Later, a dense network of railroads furthered the region's industry and commerce.

Given those answer options, answer the question: When a friend tells you she has wild roses blooming everywhere, it’s not hard to imagine where the conversation headed to next… to turning them into rose petal jam, of course. My friend Simona Quirini and her family run the beautiful Canto del Maggio, a B&B, restaurant and garden, about one hour’s drive from Florence. We arrived to catch Simona with a wooden crate in her hands, already half full of blush pink flower heads, small and as fragrant as honey. It wasn’t just roses that were bursting out of their bushes with colour and fragrance. In fact, every time I go to Canto del Maggio, I notice how lush the property is with fruit, flowers and plants, and every season there are bounties to be collected. The first time I was there I noticed the myrtle bushes and heirloom fruit trees — little tiny, red pears and apples. The garden was full of summer produce and I stole green-skinned figs harbouring raspberry-red flesh off the trees. The next time I went, we picked ripe olives off the trees around the pool and took them down to the local frantoio, olive oil mill, to press the bright green oil out of them. I also came home with buckets of corbezzoli, or Irish strawberries, to make jam. This spring, I noticed the hedge rows of flowering wild strawberries and this last visit we picked the berries off them for an afternoon snack. With the help of my daughter (who was slightly more interested in playing with Simona’s new puppy), we filled a crateful of roses and picked the petals delicately off and into bowls. We were using the rose petal jam recipe and the technique I learned between two wonderful sources — Pellegrino Artusi’s 1891 cookbook (this pastry recipe below is also inspired by it) and the Armenian monks on Venice’s Isola di San Lazzaro Island where I worked for two autumns. The secret, other than having beautiful, small and fragrant roses to begin with, is in massaging the petals with a bit of the sugar and the lemon juice until almost a pulp to release the essential oils.

How to teach teens about the dangers of credit cards Do your research. Read up on credit card companies, the national debt average, and interest rates. Did you know credit card companies are allowed to visit many high schools and colleges? You may want to warn your teen.","completion":"After presenting them with all the data and dangers, enforce the importance of responsibility. Ensure they understand that credit cards are not free money, but borrowed funds that must be paid back, often with high interest charges. Make them realize that misuse can lead to serious financial trouble affecting their future. Let them know that credit cards can be beneficial if used wisely, for things like building a good credit history. Encourage open conversations about financial matters, so they feel comfortable discussing their questions or concerns with you. Step-by-step justification: 1. The previous parts of the paragraph focus on the dangers and pitfalls of using credit cards. So, logically, the next part needs to instill a sense of responsibility in teens regarding credit card usage. Hence, starting the paragraph-end with the importance of responsibility. 2. As the paragraph focuses on teaching teens, the next step is to clarify common misconceptions like \\"credit cards are free money\\". This would help in making them aware of the reality of credit cards. 3. Highlighting the consequences of misuse such as substantial financial trouble, is a crucial step in educating teens about the risks involved. 4. Following that, it's important to note that credit cards are not entirely negative. They have benefits like building a good credit history, but these benefits can be achieved only through wise usage. 5. Concluding with an establishment of open conversation about finances could help teens with any future queries or worries they may have about credit cards, giving them a safe platform."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Conservatives held the seat, after former MP Stephen Phillips quit, citing \\"irreconcilable policy differences\\" with the government. Dr Johnson won 17,570 votes to beat UKIP's Victoria Ayling, who had 4,426. Labour slipped from second place in 2015 to fourth - described by one veteran Labour MP as \\"humiliating\\". Consultant paediatrician Dr Johnson said her election would boost Theresa May's support on Brexit. She said: \\"I look forward to strengthening the government's majority in Parliament so Theresa May, our prime minister, can get on with the job of triggering Article 50, leaving the European Union and building a country and economy that works for everyone.\\" The result in full: Caroline Johnson: (Conservatives) - 17,570 Victoria Ayling: (UKIP) - 4,426 Ross Pepper: (Liberal Democrats) - 3,606 Jim Clarke: (Labour) - 3,363 Marianne Overton: (Lincolnshire Independent) - 2,892 Sarah Stock: (Independent) - 462 The Iconic Arty-Pole: (Monster Raving Loony Party) - 200 Paul Coyne: (Independent) - 186 Mark Suffield: (Independent) - 74 David Bishop: (Bus Pass Elvis Party) - 55 The seat has returned Conservative MPs since it was formed in 1997 and Mr Phillips, who resigned in November, had a majority of more than 24,000 votes in 2015. Although he backed leaving the EU, he had since been critical of the government's approach to Brexit. Dr Johnson won with a 13,144 majority after securing 53.51% of the votes, while UKIP came in second with 13.48%. Liberal Democrat candidate Ross Pepper won 3,606 votes to clinch third, narrowly ahead of Labour's Jim Clarke who was fourth with 3,363 votes. There were few words from the victor in Sleaford and North Hykeham. Dr Caroline Johnson was whisked out of the hall without a word to reporters, after a short speech in which she looked forward to helping the prime minister \\"get on with the job\\" of leaving the EU. It was not the first time a brand new Conservative MP had left a by-election in a hurry. With the party's message on Brexit being closely managed, it may have been a conscious choice to let more senior MPs do the talking. And it is likely there will be quiet comfort for Theresa May at this result. In June, voters in this rural Lincolnshire seat decisively backed Brexit - the verdict here would be keenly watched for any messages about the government's EU withdrawal strategy so far. There were rumblings during the by-election campaign from UKIP that voters may want to send a message to Mrs May for, in their view, \\"backsliding on Brexit\\". But it didn't happen. UKIP came a distant second - a result their new leader Paul Nuttall celebrated as a \\"small step on a long road\\", despite the party's vote share falling compared with last year's general election. But the most acute soul searching may be for Labour, beaten into fourth place by the Liberal Democrats. BBC political editor for Yorkshire and Lincolnshire Tim Iredale, who filmed Dr Johnson after the result, tweeted that she had been \\"rushed away from count after refusing to speak to the media\\". The Lincolnshire seat is in an area which voted heavily to leave the EU. UKIP's former leader Nigel Farage and his successor Paul Nuttall had been on the campaign trail, supporting Ms Ayling - a former Conservative who stood for the Tories in Great Grimsby in 2010. Ms Ayling said coming in second was a \\"great result\\" for UKIP as it showed \\"more people are trusting us to deliver\\". Mr Nuttall said the result was a \\"really good way to get my leadership off the ground\\". He added: \\"If someone would have offered me second place at the beginning of the campaign, considering we were in the middle of a leadership election and the party resembled a bit of a shambles over the summer, I would have bitten their hand off.\\" Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said his party's \\"strong result\\" showed they were \\"back as an electoral force\\" in areas that had voted to leave, as well as remain, in the EU. He went on: \\"With Labour yet again nowhere, and after losing their deposit in Richmond, the Liberal Democrats are the real opposition to the Conservative Brexit government.\\" Labour MP Jess Phillips said the party's stance on Brexit was confusing and it was hard for leader Jeremy Corbyn, given his political background, to address voters' concerns on immigration in areas like Lincolnshire. \\"When people are putting a cross in a box, clarity is everything,\\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today. \\"Labour needs to have a very clear position and for everybody to be saying the same thing and at the moment that is not the case.\\" And David Winnick, the veteran Labour MP for Walsall North, said: \\"If we were to continue in this way then the indications are 2020 will be an electoral disaster.\\" He also told BBC 2's Daily Politics: \\"To be beaten into fourth place by the Liberal Democrats was humiliating ... My fear is that we're not in touch with ordinary people anywhere, to the extent that it's necessary to make a real impact in the country.\\" Former Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said Labour's showing was evidence of its \\"disintegration\\", tweeting that this was \\"not good for democracy\\". The turnout for the by-election was 37.1% according to North Kesteven District Council, down from 70.2% at the general election last year. Following their victory, the Conservatives have a majority of 10 in the House of Commons but, given that the four Sinn Fein MPs do not take their seats, their working majority is effectively 14.

Most successful comic book movies usually depend on having villains that are bigger than life, ready to jump off the screen and strangle you alive with a smile or a demented line or two of dialog. The Tim Burton Batmans had it, as did (in an even more grotesque manner) Sin City. With Dick Tracy producer/director/star Warren Beatty piles on the villains until it becomes part of the framework. Like a boisterous homage to 1930s gangster pictures- only this time meant for kids as opposed to the darker Bonnie and Clyde- Dick Tracy is filled, joyfully, with archetypes and bright, primary colors, where the criminals carry tommy guns and are formed on their faces to shape their personalities. Villains like The Stooge, Shoulders, Lips, The Brow, Mumbles, the Blank, Pruneface, Spud. Chester Gould gave the names to his characters that fit their profiles, and gave his hero a jaw that could cut glass. The film is a continuation of sight gags that are perfectly taken seriously. If, at the time, movies like Batman and (underrated) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were darker depictions of reality within a comic-book outline, Dick Tracy is more 'old-school'. It's a story of cops and crooks, or rather A cop, detective Tracy as he tries to bust Big Boy (Al Pacino, in what is arguably his BIGGEST performance to date, and in a sense the one that makes sense for his grandiose style), but with no such luck. There's also a little kid, called simply the Kid (Charlie Korsmo, who somehow brings more spunk to this little kid than would've been imagined), and Tracy's love interest in Tess. And then there's the nightclub 'dame' (Madonna, who probably doesn't give any kind of great acting performance, but maybe that suits the role fine, and she sings excellently when called upon), who wont testify unless Tracy admits feelings he doesn't have for her. Then there's convoluted dealings with taking Tracy down, and a mysterious masked figure with a scraggly voice. Meantime, as if doing an impersonation of a Howard Hawks film in a splash of visual effects and bigger explosions, Dick Tracy adds on the wink-and-nod comedy and the action like its syrup on a tall stack of pancakes. It's a wonder to look at this world, which is created in ways that have a fascination to them that had they been done today would just be simply by proxy of computers (i.e. Sin City, which can be justifiably compared to Beatty's film). We're driven through this world in great big shots and then thrust in the plot line, or whatever there is of it, in big editing montages with camera angles that seem to come out of those little tilted panels in the comics of old. I'm almost reminded of the Cotton Club during these sequences, as story, music, detail, and a few BIG punches and gun-shots go a long way to revealing what needs to be said, which, actually, isn't more than it needs to. And there's a heap-load of catchy dialog from the script (one of my favorites: \\"the enemy of my enemy is... my enemy\\", plus any of Pacino's references to other figures in quotes). Revisiting this after seeing it for the first time in the movie theater (and only remembering little bits), Dick Tracy is a hard-boiled fantasy to the finest degree. It's filled with good cheer for the kids, and with some pretty good action squared away without some of the more sinister intent of its cousin comic-book movies (i.e. PG-13 fare), and for the adults its throw-back central done with panache and a solid feeling for the unsubtle. Even Dustin Hoffman hams it up, and he barely says an audible word!

It states that \\"as the Universe expands, galaxies move further and further apart,\\" which is right. However, it then asks if the decreasing distances between galaxies imply that the Universe is expanding or contracting. If the distances between galaxies are decreasing, it would mean that the galaxies are getting closer, not further apart. This would imply that the Universe may be contracting. However, it's crucial to note that current observations and scientific consensus indicate that the Universe is indeed expanding, not contracting. Steps: 1. Understand the query: The user has given a statement and asked a question based on the statement. First, I clarify that there seems to be a misunderstanding somewhere as the statement and the question contradict each other. 2. Analyze the conditions: If the Universe is expanding, galaxies would move further apart. If they're getting closer or their distances are decreasing, it suggests the Universe might be contracting. 3. Consult relevant information: Based on the observed data and prevailing consensus in the field of cosmology, the Universe is observed to be expanding, not contracting. 4. Conclude based on analysis and data: Based on the user's query and the information we have, if the distances between galaxies are decreasing, it could indicate a contracting Universe. However, as per the current scientific consensus, this isn't what's happening. The Universe is expanding, and galaxies are moving further apart.

Chitti helps Sana, Vaseegaran's medical student girlfriend, cheat in her examination, then saves her from being assaulted by a group of thugs. Vaseegaran's mentor, Professor Bohra, is secretly engaged in a project to create similar android robots for a terrorist organisation, but has so far been unsuccessful. Vaseegaran prepares Chitti for an evaluation by the Artificial Intelligence Research and Development (AIRD) Institute, which is headed by Bohra. During the evaluation, Chitti attempts to stab Vaseegaran at Bohra's command, which convinces the evaluation committee that the robot is a liability and cannot be used for military purposes. Vaseegaran's effort to prove Bohra wrong fails when he deploys Chitti to rescue people from a burning building. The robot saves most of them, including a girl named Selvi who was bathing at the time, but she is ashamed at being seen naked on camera and flees, only to be hit and killed by a truck. Vaseegaran asks for one month to modify Chitti's neural schema to enable it to understand human behaviour and emotions, to which Bohra agrees. While nearing the deadline, Chitti becomes angry with Vaseegaran, demonstrating to him that it can manifest emotions. Chitti uses Sana's textbooks to successfully help Sana's sister Latha give birth to a child. Bohra congratulates Vaseegaran on the achievement and allows Chitti to pass the AIRD evaluation. Chitti develops romantic feelings for Sana after she congratulates Chitti by kissing it. When Vaseegaran and Sana realise this, Sana explains to Chitti that they are only friends. Saddened by her rejection, yet still in love with her, Chitti deliberately fails an evaluation conducted by the Indian Army. Enraged, Vaseegaran chops Chitti into pieces, which are dumped into a landfill...

The weather phenomena this last month had an immense impact on Dirk county, the precipitation lead to many flood evens, the steady rain lead to massive water infiltration. 20 miles away, in Saulk county, they had a few thunderstorms, they had quite a bit of runoff, but less infiltration and less soil saturation. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which county experienced more rainy days? Hint: Precipitation can impact infiltration in many ways. The amount, type and duration of precipitation all have an impact. Rainfall leads to faster infiltration rates than any other precipitation events, such as snow or sleet. In terms of amount, the more precipitation that occurs, the more infiltration will occur until the ground reaches saturation, at which point the infiltration capacity is reached. Duration of rainfall impacts the infiltration capacity as well. Initially when the precipitation event first starts the infiltration is occurring rapidly as the soil is unsaturated, but as time continues the infiltration rate slows as the soil becomes more saturated. This relationship between rainfall and infiltration capacity also determines how much runoff will occur. If rainfall occurs at a rate faster than the infiltration capacity runoff will occur.

Answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Prothrombin time. Yes or no? Answer: PT measures factors I (fibrinogen) , II (prothrombin) , V , VII , and X . Question: what is the normal inr range Answer:","completion":"The normal INR (International Normalized Ratio) range is typically considered to be between 0.8 and 1.2 for people who are not on anticoagulant therapy. This range is based on the comparison of an individual's Prothrombin Time (PT) results to a standardized reference value, aiming to achieve consistency in test results across different laboratories. The INR is a crucial metric employed to evaluate and monitor the efficacy of blood-thinning medications, such as warfarin, prescribed to patients with a predisposition to clot formation. Prothrombin Time (PT) is a crucial blood test that assesses the ability of blood to coagulate, specifically evaluating the extrinsic and common pathways of coagulation. This assessment is particularly important in determining the adequacy of various clotting factors, including factors I (fibrinogen), II (prothrombin), V, VII, and X. A deviation from the normal INR range could indicate an increased risk of bleeding or excessive clot formation, necessitating adjustment in anticoagulant therapy or further investigation. For patients on anticoagulant therapy, such as warfarin, the targeted INR range varies depending on the underlying medical condition. For instance, the recommended INR range for individuals with atrial fibrillation or venous thrombosis is usually between 2.0 and 3.0, while those with mechanical heart valves may require a higher INR range of 2.5 to 3.5, or even up to 4.0 in certain cases. It is important for clinicians to frequently monitor the INR values of patients on anticoagulant therapy to ensure optimum therapeutic benefits and minimize the risk of complications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What are Flower Houses? Movie title: Flowers of Shanghai Movie plot: In four elegant brothels, called \\"Flower Houses\\", in fin-de-siÃ¨cle 19th-century Shanghai (Qing dynasty), several affairs are described. Events presumably take place in 1884, a year named in one of the scenes. The action involves four men who live for pleasure, and takes place mostly in the light of oil lamps, giving the film a claustrophobic feel. Preparation and consumption of opium and tea occur more than once, and dishes of food are served and hot towels prepared in several scenes. We are introduced to the main characters, mainly the courtesans known as Crimson, Pearl, Emerald, Jasmine and Jade. Crimson belongs to Huifang Enclave (èè³é) brothel; Pearl and Jade to Gongyang Enclave (å¬é½é) brothel; Emerald lives at Shangren Enclave (å°ä»é) brothel; and Jasmine works at East Hexing Enclave (æ±åèé) brothel. The relationship between the wealthy patrons and the courtesans are semi-monogamous, frequently lasting many years. The courtesans are purchased at an early age by the owners of the brothels, otherwise known as \\"Aunties\\". In spite of the trappings of luxury and the wealth surrounding them, the graceful, well-bred courtesans live lives of slavery. Although there are only a few references to the courtesans being beaten, we are led to understand that there are frequent beatings for the girls and women with harsher Aunties and that beatings for perceived misbehaviour are common. Because of the oppressing social conventions, the best that the courtesans, known as \\"flower girls\\", can hope for is to pay off their debts some day (possible through a wealthy patron) or marry into a better social status. The silent Master Wang leaves the courtesan Crimson in favor of Jasmine, with whom he fell madly in love in only 10 days, after (allegedly) 2Â½ years with Crimson. He offers to settle Crimson's debts. Wang sees himself with multiple ties and between hardening fronts. The dependencies turn out to be reciprocal.

Question: A deadly strain of avian flu may have passed between people for the first time, experts believe.The avian influenza A (H7N9) virus is thought to have been transmitted between father and daughter in eastern China, according to research published online by the British Medical Journal (BMJ). The findings provide the strongest evidence yet of H7N9 transmission between humans since its discover in February, but its ability to transmit itself _ \\"limited and non-sustainable\\" by the Chinese researchers behind the study.At the end of June 133 cases had been reported, including 43 deaths. Most infections have been among people visiting markets, selling live birds or among those who had contact with live poultry in the seven to 10 days before becoming ill. The latest study examined the case of a 60-year-old father who regularly visited a live poultry market and became ill five to six days after his last visit in March. He was admitted to hospital with fever, cough and shortness of breath. Despite intensive care treatment he died of multiple organ failure on 4 May. His 32-year-old daughter, who was previously healthy, looked after him at his bedside before he was admitted to intensive care. She had no known exposure to live poultry before falling ill with a very high temperature, cough and fever. The daughter developed symptoms six days after her last contact with her father and was admitted to hospital where she died of multiple organ failure on 24 April. Follow-up investigations uncovered almost genetically identical virus strains from each patient, suggesting transmission from father to daughter. Another 43 people were also tested who had had close contact with the father, daughter or both.

News article: Elan Gale later revealed on Twitter that this fight was a hoax. Click here for more. Thanksgiving - a time for sharing the love? Not so for these two flyers who engaged in a bitter war of words at 30,000-feet — before it ended with a slap and near police prosecution at the airport. LA TV producer Elan Gale enthralled his Twitter followers Thursday when he used the micro-blogging site to take-down an apparently nasty woman on board his flight to Phoenix. Gale sends a nasty note to the woman causing a disturbance on the flight. (theyearofelan via Tiwtter) The entire exchange was recorded in real-time by Buzzfeed. Gale, who claims to be a producer on ABC's The Bachelor, first tweeted at 11 a.m. after being told his plane would be taking off late. But he went into overdrive after finally boarding the craft — and on hearing a woman several rows behind consistently complaining about the delay. The war of words escalates. (theyearofelan via Tiwtter) Our flight is delayed. A woman on here is very upset because she has Thanksgiving plans. She is the only one obviously. Praying for her — elan gale (@theyearofelan) November 28, 2013 \\"She's telling the flight attendants that it is Thanksgiving. She wants them to know she wants to have dinner with her family,\\" he added. Gale launches into a profanity-laced response to one of Diane’s nasty replies. (theyearofelan via Tiwtter) \\"The male flight attendant said 'I understand ma'am. I'm looking forward to seeing my family too.' She responded 'This isn't about you,'\\" Gale continued to tweet. She had to sit down because we took off. She has been muttering \\"about DAMN time\\" and I can hear her breathing from 5 rows back — elan gale (@theyearofelan) November 28, 2013 After several more posts, and by now up in the air, Gale decided to send the woman a glass of red wine along with a note. The 30-year-old Gale got his start as a producer on the reality shows ‘Cookin’ with Coolio’ and ‘Coolio’s Rules.’ (theyearofelan via Tiwtter) \\"Dear Lady in 7A, It has come to my attention that today is your 'Thanksgiving!' It must be hard to not be with your family. Please accept this glass of wine. It is a gift from me to you,\\" he wrote. \\"Hopefully if you drink it, you won't be able to use your mouth to talk. Love Elan,\\" he added. The male flight attendant refused to deliver the \\"gift,\\" so Gale handed it over himself. Gale shows off the note that he received from his sparring partner. (theyearofelan via Tiwtter) \\"Oh my God I did it. I walked as if I was going to the bathroom and I leaned over and put them on her tray table and walked away Oh my God,\\" he posted online. The woman, clearly incensed, struck back with her own message. \\"Dear 'Elan,' The wine wasn't funny. The vodka wasn't funny. You're an awful person with no compassion. I'm sorry for your family that they should have to deal with you. — Diane,\\" she replied. Elan Gale, a producer on ABC's 'The Bachelor' got into a fight with a fellow passenger on a flight on Thanksgiving Day and detailed the argument on Twitter. (theyearofelan via Tiwtter) \\"This means war,\\" Gale posted, before revealing \\"Diane\\" was \\"in her late 40s or early 50s\\" and was \\"wearing mom jeans and a studded belt.\\" Another note was passed over to her, which read: \\"Dear Diane, Thank you for your lovely note. The person who lacks compassion is you.\\" It added: \\"We all want to get home, particularly the nice men and women who fly your lazy ass around and serve you drinks (you're welcome!) Gale received a slap in the face at the gate from the woman identified only as Diane - but declined to press charges. (theyearofelan via Tiwtter) And he ended: \\"Next time you're in a bad mood, stay home. I hate you very much. Eat my d***. Love Elan.\\" Diane fired back with another message, threatening to contact the cops on landing. Gale just couldn't let it go, however, and replied: \\"Dear Diane. When you speak to the authorities, please make sure they arrest you for cannibalism because you just ate my d***! Love Elan.\\" Back on firm ground at Phoenix, she walked up and slapped Gale straight in the face. A gate agent detained Diane and asked Gale if he wanted her to be arrested. Gale said he didn't — but revealed he was \\"overjoyed\\" to learn she'd missed her connecting flight to Sacramento. He then had one last message, which read: \\"Diane, allow me to introduce myself. I am TheYearOfElan. Look me up online. read every tweet. \\"Read every response. And maybe next time you'll be nice to people who are just trying to help. PS Eat my d***. Love Elan.\\" ||||| As some of you know, I had a bit of an altercation today with a woman named Diane on an airplane. I had a great time antagonizing her, reading your responses, and just generally trying to have fun with an irritating person. But I did have a point and I just want to put it out there. I know I can come across as abrasive. I know I can seem harsh. But what I’ve never done is be unkind to a person in a service position. My first job was in a video store. I rewinded tapes and put them back on the shelves. I was a caterer. I put ravioli into divided plates and cut bagels in half for hours at a time. The difference between someone being nice and someone being mean was the difference in how I felt when I went home that night. I don’t care what’s going on with you: Don’t be rude to people who are doing their job. Don’t do it. Don’t dismiss them. Don’t act like they are less than you. Don’t abuse them just because you’re the customer and “The Customer Is Always Right.” If you’re the customer, you’re only right if you’re kind, polite and positively thankful. If you’re not, you’re a jerk, and that’s the bottom line. A lot of people have been really nice to me and called me a hero today. It’s really fun to hear but it’s not true. Our troops are heroes. Fire fighters and policemen are heroes. Doctors and teachers are heroes. Flight attendants and pilots and waiters and baristas… These are the people that make things work in this crazy world. What I did today was just point out something we all know: Be nice. It’s Thanksgiving. Be nice. Be nice everyday, but if you see a man or a woman working on a holiday you better respect that they would like to be with their family too. So have some compassion and have some appreciation.

Seriously. More than anything. I love you ||||| ABC's \\"Bachelor\\" and \\"Bachelorette\\" producer Elan Gale was on a flight yesterday live-tweeting his feud with a fellow passenger. According to Gale's tweets, which were picked up by Buzzfeed's Rachel Zarrell, a female passenger was complaining that she might not make it home for Thanksgiving dinner. She seemed to be oblivious to others on the flight, who also needed to get home to their families for Thanksgiving. The battle began before the flight boarded. Gale tweeted about the woman at 11:05 a.m. Our flight is delayed. A woman on here is very upset because she has Thanksgiving plans. She is the only one obviously. Praying for her — elan gale (@theyearofelan) November 28, 2013 A flight attendant tried to calm her down, which was apparently the wrong move. The male flight attendant said \\"I understand ma'am. I'm looking forward to seeing my family too.\\" She responded \\"This isn't about you\\" — elan gale (@theyearofelan) November 28, 2013 \\"Today is Thanksgiving! I'm supposed to be with my family. NOT with you people I barely know!\\" — elan gale (@theyearofelan) November 28, 2013 Once the plane boarded, Gale said he could hear her breathing deeply and muttering from a few rows back. That's when the note-passing war began. He sent her a glass of wine and later two vodka nips with this note: I sent the lady a glass of wine and a note pic.twitter.com/GttnmQI25P — elan gale (@theyearofelan) November 28, 2013 This was not well received by the woman, Diane. She sent Gale this response, pitying the family who has to \\"deal\\" with him: Gale retaliated with yet another note and escalated the language: My response to \\"Diane\\" in 7A pic.twitter.com/cRN2togLdq — elan gale (@theyearofelan) November 28, 2013 Diane replied, noting its inappropriate nature: Gale responded again with a vulgar comment: My final (I think) note to Diane in 7A pic.twitter.com/SLrOug9U4d — elan gale (@theyearofelan) November 28, 2013 When the plane landed, Gale waited for Diane to get off the plane and held out a final note. When she saw him, Gale says she smacked him. She walked right up to me and slapped me immediately in the face — elan gale (@theyearofelan) November 28, 2013 Diane may have ended up missing her connecting flight because she smacked him, while Gale was able to board his. The gate agent for the next flight actually grabbed her and held her back. He asked me if I wanted to have the airport police come over — elan gale (@theyearofelan) November 28, 2013 The final note he handed her read: \\"Look me up online. Read every tweet. Read every response. And maybe next time you'll be nice to people who are just trying to help\\" — elan gale (@theyearofelan) November 28, 2013 Yesterday afternoon, Gale wrote a blog post explaining why he felt the need to pick a fight with Diane. \\"I don’t care what’s going on with you: Don’t be rude to people who are doing their job,\\" he wrote on Tumblr. \\"If you’re the customer, you’re only right if you’re kind, polite and positively thankful. If you’re not, you’re a jerk, and that’s the bottom line ... Be nice everyday, but if you see a man or a woman working on a holiday you better respect that they would like to be with their family too.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"On Thanksgiving Day, LA TV producer Elan Gale live-tweeted an escalating war of words with a fellow passenger, named Diane, on a delayed flight to Phoenix.

While attending my MOS AIT in the US Army (good lord, was that 25 years ago???), a few of us had a hotel party. It didn’t get too crazy as it was mainly to get off post. If I remember right, after some folks left, there was one couple, a couple girls (maybe 3?), and myself who stayed over. I had known them all for a month or so and had spent a ton of time hanging out at the barracks or around the school area. The couple took one bed, the girls took the other, and I took the floor at the foot of the girls’ bed. About the time everyone started to nod off, one of the girls woke me, asking if I would share the blanket, as the bed was too crowded. She and I had both recently gotten engaged to people two plane flights away and had been nothing more than friends previously - with no hint of anything else… I thought nothing of it and said sure. After a few minutes, she said she couldn’t sleep and asked if she could snuggle up a little. I thought nothing of it and said sure. I started to think… hunh… this is peculiar… After a few more minutes, she asked if I minded if we kissed a little. At that point, I started to get the idea… but that was as far as I thought anything was going to happen as I thought, hunh, OK, maybe she misses her fiance. I know I do. Then we progressed to (very quiet) sex at her request. As far as we knew, everyone else in the room was asleep - at least they never hinted at knowing. We dated another month or two while we were both there. I was so clueless as to how she felt and it took FAR too long to figure out what was happening. Question: Who was the sex partner?

In the late 1970s, UK bands such as Buzzcocks and the Undertones combined pop-style tunes and lyrical themes with punk's speed and chaotic edge. In the early 1980s, some of the leading bands in Southern California's hardcore punk rock scene emphasized a more melodic approach than was typical of their peers. According to music journalist Ben Myers, Bad Religion \\"layered their pissed off, politicized sound with the smoothest of harmonies\\"; Descendents \\"wrote almost surfy, Beach Boys-inspired songs about girls and food and being young(ish)\\". Epitaph Records, founded by Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion, was the base for many future pop punk bands. Bands that fused punk with light-hearted pop melodies, such as the Queers and Screeching Weasel, began appearing around the country, in turn influencing bands like Green Day and the Offspring, who brought pop punk wide popularity and major record sales. Bands such as the Vandals and Guttermouth developed a style blending pop melodies with humorous and offensive lyrics. Eventually, the geographically large Midwest U.S. punk scene, anchored largely in places like Chicago and Minneapolis, would spawn bands like Dillinger Four who would take a catchy, hooky pop-punk approach and reinfuse it with some of punk's earlier grit and fury, creating a distinctive punk rock sound with a regional tag. This particular substrate still maintains an identity today. The mainstream pop punk of latter-day bands such as Blink-182 is criticized by many punk rock devotees; in critic Christine Di Bella's words, \\"It's punk taken to its most accessible point, a point where it barely reflects its lineage at all, except in the three-chord song structures.\\" contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that is very critical of modern mainstream pop punk bands?, what is it ?","completion":"The full name of the person that is very critical of modern mainstream pop punk bands, as mentioned in the article, is Christine Di Bella."},{"prompt":"Sasha said they would send information over but forgot to send it.

The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument. - Christian metal, also known as white metal or heavenly metal, is a form of heavy metal music usually defined by its message using song lyrics as well as the dedication of the band members to Christianity.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person that worked at the Salzburg Festival? is inside the article: Sir Georg Solti, (born György Stern; 21 October 1912 – 5 September 1997) was a Hungarian-born orchestral and operatic conductor, best known for his appearances with opera companies in Munich, Frankfurt and London, and as a long-serving music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Born in Budapest, he studied there with Béla Bartók, Leó Weiner and Ernő Dohnányi. In the 1930s, he was a répétiteur at the Hungarian State Opera and worked at the Salzburg Festival for Arturo Toscanini. His career was interrupted by the rise of the Nazis' influence on Hungarian politics, and being of Jewish background he fled the increasingly harsh Hungarian anti-Jewish laws in 1938. After conducting a season of Russian ballet in London at the Royal Opera House he found refuge in Switzerland, where he remained during the Second World War. Prohibited from conducting there, he earned a living as a pianist. After the war, Solti was appointed musical director of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich in 1946. In 1952 he moved to the Oper Frankfurt, where he remained in charge for nine years. He took West German citizenship in 1953. In 1961 he became musical director of the Covent Garden Opera Company, London. During his ten-year tenure, he introduced changes that raised standards to the highest international levels. Under his musical directorship the status of the company was recognised with the grant of the title \\"the Royal Opera\\". He became a British citizen in 1972. In 1969 Solti became music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, a post he held for 22 years. He relinquished the position in 1991 and became the orchestra's music director laureate, a position he held until his death. During his time as the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's eighth music director, he also served as music director of the Orchestre de Paris from 1972 until 1975 and principal conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra from 1979 until 1983.

Importance Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are effective therapies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and are all currently available as an injection. Objectives To compare the effects of oral semaglutide with placebo (primary) and open-label subcutaneous semaglutide (secondary) on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Design, Setting, and Patients Phase 2, randomized, parallel-group, dosage-finding, 26-week trial with 5-week follow-up at 100 sites (hospital clinics, general practices, and clinical research centers) in 14 countries conducted between December 2013 and December 2014. Of 1106 participants assessed, 632 with type 2 diabetes and insufficient glycemic control using diet and exercise alone or a stable dose of metformin were randomized. Randomization was stratified by metformin use. Interventions Once-daily oral semaglutide of 2.5 mg (n = 70), 5 mg (n = 70), 10 mg (n = 70), 20 mg (n = 70), 40-mg 4-week dose escalation (standard escalation; n = 71), 40-mg 8-week dose escalation (slow escalation; n = 70), 40-mg 2-week dose escalation (fast escalation, n = 70), oral placebo (n = 71; double-blind) or once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide of 1.0 mg (n = 70) for 26 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was change in hemoglobing A1c (HbA1c) from baseline to week 26. Secondary end points included change from baseline in body weight and adverse events. Results Baseline characteristics were comparable across treatment groups. Of the 632 randomized patients (mean age, 57.1 years [SD, 10.6]; men, 395 (62.7%); diabetes duration, 6.3 years [SD, 5.2]; body weight, 92.3 kg [SD, 16.8]; BMI, 31.7 [SD, 4.3]), 583 (92%) completed the trial. Mean change in HbA1c level from baseline to week 26 decreased with oral semaglutide (dosage-dependent range, −0.7% to −1.9%) and subcutaneous semaglutide (−1.9%) and placebo (−0.3%); oral semaglutide reductions were significant vs placebo (dosage-dependent estimated treatment difference [ETD] range for oral semaglutide vs placebo, –0.4% to –1.6%; P = .01 for 2.5 mg, <.001 for all other dosages). Reductions in body weight were greater with oral semaglutide (dosage-dependent range, −2.1 kg to −6.9 kg) and subcutaneous semaglutide (−6.4 kg) vs placebo (−1.2 kg), and significant for oral semaglutide dosages of 10 mg or more vs placebo (dosage-dependent ETD range, –0.9 to –5.7 kg; P < .001). Adverse events were reported by 63% to 86% (371 of 490 patients) in the oral semaglutide groups, 81% (56 of 69 patients) in the subcutaneous semaglutide group, and 68% (48 of 71 patients) in the placebo group; mild to moderate gastrointestinal events were most common. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with type 2 diabetes, oral semaglutide resulted in better glycemic control than placebo over 26 weeks. These findings support phase 3 studies to assess longer-term and clinical outcomes, as well as safety.

The French language is a Romance language that evolved from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire. It is an official language in 29 countries, and it is spoken by millions of people worldwide. Some of these countries include France, Belgium, Canada, Switzerland, and several countries in Africa. Like other Romance languages, French grammar has a complex system of inflections, conjugations, and gender agreement. Peary caribou (Rangifer tarandus pearyi) is a subspecies of the reindeer (or caribou in North America) native to the Arctic islands of Nunavut and the Northwest Territories of Canada. They have a smaller body size compared to other caribou subspecies and have adapted to the harsh Arctic environment. Dolphin and Union caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus x pearyi) are a population of barren-ground caribou that migrate seasonally between Victoria Island and the mainland in the Canadian Arctic. They are named after their unique migratory route through the Dolphin and Union Strait. Reports on the situation of both caribou types are essential for understanding their population dynamics, conservation status, and potential threats they may face, such as habitat loss, climate change, and human activities. Informed decisions on their conservation can then be made, helping to preserve these unique Arctic animals for future generations and maintain the health of their ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His lawyer denied this and called his arrest unconstitutional. He has no criminal record. Mr Ramirez was brought to the US illegally at the age of seven and was protected from deportation under one of President Barack Obama's policies. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, was established in 2012 to allow those brought to America while young to attend school and work without fear of deportation. His case is being closely watched by the more than 740,000 people in the programme, who fear they may lose their protections under President Donald Trump's government. Those protected are often known as \\"dreamers\\" - a name taken from the failed 2010 Dream Act (Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors) - a bill which aimed to help young illegal immigrants become US citizens. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents had intended to arrest his father at home in Seattle, but also detained Mr Ramirez on 10 February. Officials then revoked his protected status, AP news agency reported. An immigration judge earlier this week granted his release on a 15,000 (Â£12,000) bond pending a decision on his immigration status. Supporters welcomed Mr Ramirez in the lobby of a detention facility after he was freed on Wednesday. He nodded and smiled at reporters.

But recently, some people who work for the government thought Daniel might be a part of a gang and wanted to send him back to his home country. Daniel's lawyer said this wasn't true, and now a judge has let Daniel leave the place he was being held until they decide what will happen next.

A short nap will help you feel energized for a long night. Try to avoid napping for more than two hours or you might end up feeling lethargic and tired. Quick naps will be more likely to refresh you. Power naps can be a good way to recharge yourself in the mid-afternoon before you stay up late. Find a comfortable place and lay down. You can even lay your head down on your arms if there is no place to go horizontal. Set an alarm for thirty minutes later, put on some soothing sounds from the internet, and you'll wake up feeling refreshed. If you are already overtired from not sleeping the past few days it will be much harder to stay awake. Try sleeping in the two days before you know you're going to need to stay up very late. This also depends on what you'll be doing the night that you stay up late. If you have to stay up late to do physical labor like construction, a lack of sleep may not impact you that much. Generally, as long as you haven't been sleep deprived for a long period of time, your heart and lungs and muscles can operate equally well. It's your brain and cognitive functions that struggle on a lack of sleep. If you know you're going to need to think clearly and quickly the night that you stay up late then sleep will be very important. Heavy meals will cause you to feel sleepy as your body tries to digest what you have just eaten. Avoid heavy carbs and stick to lean meat and fruit if you are planning on staying up very late. Protein will help you stay up later because it stimulates the neurotransmitter orexin. Orexin boosts wakefulness, so eating a steak could be a good way to stay awake. Don't gorge yourself to the extent that you have an incredibly full stomach. Digestion will make you sleepy. Just snack on bites of steak or another lean meat.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article in one sentence. A lot of the skills necessary to improve your reading speed will not come naturally to you, so you will need to practice them everyday until they become second nature. Even 15 to 20 minutes of practice per day can make a huge difference to your overall pace. Improving your reading speed will take time, as you are learning how to read in a whole new way. Remember it took you years to learn how to read well as a child, so be patient with yourself this time round. A good way to track your progress is to time yourself on a regular basis. Set a timer and count how many words you read per minute. The more you practice, the higher this number should become. When you are training yourself to read faster, it's a good idea to start with easier material -- something that you enjoy or gain immediate value from -- until your abilities improve. Something like a travel book or memoir of famous figure, for example, might be a good option. Starting with something very dense -- like a physics textbook -- can throw you off and make the whole process seem more daunting. Once your skills improve and you learn what to look for in a text, you will find yourself much better equipped to deal with longer, more complex material. By this time, you will have developed a good grasp of which techniques work best for you and learn to recognize which parts of a text are most important. It's a good idea to use your finger, a pen or an index card to mark your place on the page as you read. And while using a pointer prevents you from losing your place and having to make regressions, this is not the only benefit. By moving the pointer quickly across each line and down the page you can set the pace you wish to read at, as your eyes will be forced to keep up. Think of your eyes like a magnet that's attracted to the pointer on the page -- wherever it goes, your eyes will follow! Your brain needs some time to sink into the rhythm of reading, especially if you’re coming from another activity that’s more active. Encourage yourself to read for at least 15 minutes at a time to ensure that your brain has time to adjust its focus. You’ll get progressively better at finding your focus with practice. It’s OK to take breaks when necessary, as well. In addition to implementing specific techniques for increasing your reading speed, it's also important that you revise your attitude towards reading in general. Rather than seeing reading as a chore or something that has to be done, you should look at reading as an opportunity -- to be entertained, to learn something new, to expand your horizons. It doesn't matter what the subject is -- it could be a book on statistics or a historical account of mining in Colorado -- as long as you approach the topic with an open mind and a willingness to learn, you'll find the whole process much more enjoyable and easier to get through. Despite the benefits of reading faster, it's important to recognize that there will be times when you need to slow down and really make an effort to fully comprehend what you're reading. There's no point skimming through a text if it prevents you from fully comprehending the material or retaining any useful information. Therefore, one of the most important skills you can develop is the ability to recognize when you should read slowly. In addition, there are certain types of texts that should never be skimmed through or glossed over too quickly. This includes works of fiction, classic literature, poetry and plays. These kinds of texts are works of art and creativity, where each and every word is intended to be read and even analysed. You will lose much of the value of these texts if you attempt to read them too quickly. Summary:","completion":"To improve reading speed, practice daily with easier and enjoyable materials, track progress, use a pointer to set pace, allow time for focus, adopt a positive attitude towards reading, and recognize when to slow down for comprehension or appreciation of specific texts."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Military history of the United States: The Philippine–American War (1899–1902) was an armed conflict between a group of Filipino revolutionaries and the American forces following the ceding of the Philippines to the United States after the defeat of Spanish forces in the Battle of Manila. The Army sent in 100,000 soldiers (mostly from the National Guard) under General Elwell Otis. Defeated in the field and losing its capital in March 1899, the poorly armed and poorly led rebels broke into armed bands. The insurgency collapsed in March 1901 when the leader Emilio Aguinaldo was captured by General Frederick Funston and his Macabebe allies. Casualties included 1,037 Americans killed in action and 3,340 who died from disease; 20,000 rebels were killed. Please answer a question about this article.

When it was sold recently in New York for 27000, the seller, Mr. Oliver Pitt, was asked to explain how the picture had come into his possession. Pitt said, \\"I didn't know it was so valuable. I'm not an art expert. Photography is my hobby. I bought 'Fisherman' in Italy in 1970 for 140.the picture was dirty, and I couldn't see the artist's signature. But anyway it wasn't the picture that I like. I bought it because of the frame.\\" \\"It's most unusual frame, made of tiny, silvery sea-shells. They are set in such a way that they reflect perfect light onto the surface of a picture. I now have a photograph of my wife in that frame, and I'll never part with it.\\" \\"When I returned to New York I showed the painting in its frame to a customs officer. I told him that I had paid 140 for it but admitted I didn't know its actual worth. The customs man valued it at 140, and I was asked to pay duty on that value. I did so, there and then.\\" \\"Later, I took off the frame, and that uncovered Maveleone's signature. My wife suggested in fun that the painting might be a valuable one, so I cleaned it and put it up for sale.\\" As a result of his explanation, Oliver Pitt had to appear in court. He was accused of knowingly making a false statement of the value of a picture so as to cheat the Customs Department. Pitt was not happy. \\"I told the truth as I knew it then,\\" he said, \\"What else could I say?\\" And then the judge agreed with him. \\"The Customs Department is to be responsible (blame),\\" he said, \\"for making a true valuation of goods bought into the country, so that the correct amount of duty may be charged. Mr Pitt did not cause or try to cause the mistake that was made. He paid the duty that was demanded. If now, the Customs Department finds that its valuation was not correct, it cannot be allowed to have another try. Pitt is not guilty. Options: A Pitt knew the true value of the picture.

Kai caught Remy in the act of stealing his friend's new bike. Given the context: How would Kai feel afterwards?","completion":"In order to provide a detailed and long answer, it's important to consider various aspects of the situation, including the relationship between Kai and Remy, Kai's personality, his principles, and his emotional intelligence. Here, we will analyze the possible feelings and thoughts that Kai might experience after catching Remy stealing his friend's new bike based on these aspects. 1. Relationship between Kai and Remy: If Kai and Remy are close friends, Kai might feel a strong sense of disappointment and betrayal. Trust is an essential component of any close relationship, and witnessing a friend engaging in dishonest behavior can damage that trust. Kai may question the integrity of Remy and wonder whether he can still consider him a friend. If Kai and Remy are just acquaintances or have little personal connection, Kai might still feel frustrated and disappointed. However, in this case, the emotional gravity of the situation might not be as great since the relationship isn't as deep. This scenario may still alter Kai's perception of Remy and make it difficult for them to develop a genuine friendship in the future. 2. Kai's Personality: If Kai is an empathetic and compassionate person, he might be concerned about the circumstances that led Remy to steal the bike. Kai could feel driven to understand why Remy committed this act and help him find a solution or seek redemption in some way. On the other hand, if Kai has a strong sense of justice, he might feel an immediate urge to confront Remy and correct the behavior, possibly reporting him to the appropriate authorities. This type of response would demonstrate that Kai puts a high priority on doing what is morally right. 3. Kai's Principles: Depending on Kai's upbringing and life experiences, his personal moral code may influence how he feels after witnessing the act of theft. If Kai strongly believes in honesty and fairness, he may feel compelled to take action against Remy, even if it puts their relationship at risk. However, if Kai has a more flexible outlook on morality and has perhaps faced moral dilemmas in the past, he may feel more inclined to help Remy understand the impacts of his actions and explore healthier ways to deal with difficult situations. 4. Kai's Emotional Intelligence: If Kai has high emotional intelligence, he may be better equipped to navigate the situation by acknowledging his own feelings and understanding Remy's motives. This could potentially allow him to address the matter in a more productive and compassionate way. He may still feel anger, disappointment, and frustration, but his emotional management skills can assist him in responding to the situation maturely. In conclusion, Kai's feelings after catching Remy stealing his friend's new bike would largely depend on several factors, such as their relationship, Kai's personality, his principles, and his emotional intelligence. He may experience a range of emotions, from disappointment and betrayal to anger, empathy, and concern. By keeping these factors in mind, a more comprehensive picture of Kai's emotional response to the situation can be formed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person Black Francis told he was keen to record again? is inside the article: While the Pixies' 1991 album Trompe le Monde was being recorded, Thompson had discussions with the album's producer, Gil Norton, about a possible solo record. He told Norton he was keen to record again, even though he had no new material; as a result, the two decided on a cover album. However, by the time Thompson visited a recording studio again in 1992, he had \\"plenty of tunes and musical scraps.\\"He collaborated with Feldman to record new material; they began by trimming down the number of covers to one, The Beach Boys' \\"Hang On to Your Ego\\". Feldman became the album's producer, and played keyboard and bass guitar on several songs, with Santiago featuring on lead guitar and Nick Vincent on drums. Francis recorded the album during the hiatus and breakup of the Pixies in late 1992 and early 1993. He then adopted the stage name \\"Frank Black\\" (inverting his old persona \\"Black Francis\\") and released the results as Frank Black in March 1993. Frank Black was characterized by a focus on UFOs and science fiction, although he explored other subjects, such as in \\"I Heard Ramona Sing\\", a song about the Ramones. The album was similar in style, both musically and lyrically, to the Pixies' albums Bossanova and Trompe le Monde. Feldman later said that the first record connected his solo career with Trompe le Monde, \\"but at the same time it is an island, like nothing else he [Black] did.\\"The following year, Black released his second solo record, a 22-song double album entitled Teenager of the Year. Teenager included the song \\"Headache\\" (sample ), a moderate success on alternative rock playlists; critics described the song as \\"irresistible pop\\". The production of Teenager of the Year was markedly different from Frank Black; in the previous album, MIDI templates were used when writing songs, but in Teenager, Black showed individual parts to band members, the core of which included drummer Vincent and Lyle Workman on lead guitar. Feldman noted that Thompson's songwriting became \\"a lot more spontaneous\\" while recording the..., can you guess it ? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Gil Norton.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Would the following sentence, by the strictest standards, be considered correct by a linguist? We contributed our paycheck to her.","completion":"The sentence \\"We contributed our paycheck to her\\" can certainly be understood and its meaning is clear; however, there are some aspects to consider from both a linguistic and a stylistic standpoint to determine if it can be considered entirely correct by a linguist. Linguists focus on various aspects of language, such as morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Each of these comes into play when assessing the correctness of a sentence. 1. Morphology: Morphology is concerned with the structure and formation of words. In the given sentence, all the words are formed correctly, and no issues arise concerning the words' morphology. 2. Syntax: Syntax deals with the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences. In this sentence, the subject \\"we,\\" the verb \\"contributed,\\" and the direct object \\"our paycheck\\" appear to be syntactically correct. The prepositional phrase \\"to her\\" serves as the indirect object, completing the idea of the action being performed. From a syntactic standpoint, the sentence is correct. 3. Semantics: Semantics relates to the meaning of words and phrases. In the provided sentence, all the words have clear meanings and contribute to an understandable message. The sentence is semantically appropriate. 4. Pragmatics: Pragmatics concerns language use within context and considers factors such as appropriateness, assumptions, and social norms in communication. The given sentence could be perceived as correct from a pragmatic point of view, but it may depend on the context in which it is used. However, from a stylistic standpoint, there can be potential suggestions for improvement: 1. Ambiguity: The sentence might seem a bit ambiguous, as it mentions \\"our paycheck.\\" It is unclear whether it implies a single shared paycheck or multiple paychecks. A more explicit sentence could be \\"We contributed our paychecks to her\\" (individual paychecks) or \\"We contributed our joint paycheck to her\\" (a combined paycheck). 2. Word choice: The term \\"contributed\\" may not be the best verb for this sentence. It can be replaced with a more precise word like \\"gave,\\" \\"handed,\\" \\"donated,\\" or \\"provided,\\" depending on the intended meaning and context. 3. Directness: In some contexts, using a more direct and straightforward wording might be more appropriate. For example, \\"We gave her our paycheck/paychecks\\" would be considered acceptable and more direct. In conclusion, while linguists might consider the sentence \\"We contributed our paycheck to her\\" correct from the perspectives of morphology, syntax, and semantics, there is room for stylistic improvements. Depending on the context, a more explicit, appropriate, and straightforward sentence might be preferred. Addressing the ambiguity in \\"our paycheck\\" and considering alternative verb choices can help improve the sentence, ensuring more precise communication."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

No; If I tell you that Earth tilted on its rotating axis causes weather changes which affect all plants and animals, and ask you the question \\"earth tilted on its rotating axis causes what which affects all plants and animals?\\", is the correct answer \\"global warming\\"? Answer:","completion":"The correct answer is not \\"global warming\\". The Earth's tilt on its rotating axis is responsible for seasonal changes, which affect all plants and animals on the planet. As the Earth orbits the sun, its tilt causes differences in the angle at which sunlight strikes different regions of the planet. This results in variations in temperature and daylight hours, giving rise to seasonal patterns like spring, summer, fall, and winter. These seasonal changes have a direct impact on the behavior, growth, and reproduction of plants and animals. Global warming, on the other hand, refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due primarily to human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This rise in temperature has numerous consequences for the planet's climate, ecosystems, and human societies.

The man demands that he be left alone. Later, the innkeeper, Mr. Hall (Forrester Harvey) is sent by his wife (Una O'Connor) to evict the stranger after he makes a huge mess in his room while doing research and falls behind on his rent.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (June 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) When North Carolina secedes from the Union on May 20, 1861, the young men of a rural, provincial, North Carolina backwater known only as Cold Mountain hurry to enlist in the Confederate military. Among them is W.P. Inman (Jude Law), a carpenter who has fallen in love with Ada (Nicole Kidman), a minister's daughter, and finds their whirlwind courtship interrupted by the American Civil War. Three years later, Inman finds himself in the trenches of Petersburg, Virginia, during the Battle of the Crater. Union soldiers tunneling beneath Confederate fortifications detonate over 300 kegs of gunpowder, in a futile attempt to undermine the position prior to their assault. As the ill-fated attack begins, Oakley (Lucas Black) an old acquaintance of Inman's from Cold Mountain, is impaled on a bayonet and mortally wounded. Inman rescues him from the fighting and takes him to a field hospital. Later that day Oakley dies in the hospital, with Inman and Stobrod Thewes (Brendan Gleeson) beside him. The next night, Inman, along with his Cherokee friend Swimmer (Jay Tavare), are sent to flush out surviving Union troops trapped behind their lines. During the raid, a burst of friendly fire kills Swimmer and seriously injures Inman. As Inman lies in the hospital near death, he has a letter from Ada read to him in which she pleads with him to stop fighting, stop marching, and come back to her. Inman recovers, andâwith the war drawing ever closer to an inevitable Confederate defeatâdecides to go home to Cold Mountain. On his journey he meets the corrupt preacher Reverend Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who is about to drown his pregnant slave lover.

Movie title: Where the Heart Is Movie plot: Stewart McBain (Coleman) is a successful self-made demolitions expert who blows up buildings for a living. In the midst of one such project, a group of protesters stops the last building on a lot, the Dutch House, from being demolished. When McBain appears on TV to dismiss the protests, he is made to look foolish. Returning home, his three college-aged children - Daphne (Thurman), Chloe (Amis), and Jimmy (Hewlett) - ridicule him for appearing on camera. Feeling his children are spoiled and soft, McBain kicks them out of the house. Giving them each 750, he drops them off at the Dutch House to live. The house is dilapidated and on the verge of collapse. In order to finance their new lives, the children take on housemates. These include a fashion designer (Glover) named Lionel; a homeless magician, Shitty (Plummer); a stockbroker, Tom (Walsh); and Sheryl, an amateur occultist (Kelley). Chloe is commissioned to finish a calendar for an insurance company. Lionel has to complete his designs for a fashion show. Chloe uses her roommates in the calendar and Lionel ends up using some of them to model for his show. The story is told against the backdrop of a stockmarket crash which brings McBain to ruin. He desperately attempts to stave off a hostile takeover of his demolition company and fails. He loses his home and becomes destitute. Ultimately, his children take him in and he starts to see the world in an entirely different light.

Bill Goldberg Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Defining the genre and setting To build a movie plot, we need to first determine the genre and setting for the film. Since Goldberg is known for his career in professional wrestling, the movie could be an action-thriller with elements of drama. The setting will be an urban city with a mix of gritty and luxurious landscapes. Step 2: Establishing the main character Bill Goldberg plays the role of Burke, a former special forces operative turned private investigator. Burke is well-built, has a strong presence, and is known for getting results in difficult cases. His military background has given him exceptional skills in hand-to-hand combat, strategy, and firearms. Step 3: Creating the conflict The movie's central conflict revolves around Burke being hired to investigate the disappearance of a wealthy businessman's daughter, Jessica. It is believed that she has been kidnapped, and a ransom note has been received, but the police have hit a dead end. The case calls for someone with Burke's expertise. Step 4: Introducing the antagonist As Burke delves deeper into the case, he discovers that the main antagonist is a powerful crime lord named Victor. Victor has strong influences within the city and has infiltrated most of its key institutions. He has a group of highly skilled mercenaries working for him that will do whatever it takes to stop Burke from rescuing Jessica and bringing Victor to justice. Step 5: Developing the main character's relationships During the course of the investigation, Burke teams up with Sarah, a talented but inexperienced police officer who is frustrated with her department's lack of progress in the case. They form an uneasy alliance as Sarah's knowledge of the city and its underbelly complements Burke's combat and strategic skills. Step 6: Intensifying the conflict As the stakes get higher and clues lead to more dangerous encounters with Victor's henchmen, Burke and Sarah face numerous obstacles. Burke becomes more invested in the case as he discovers that Jessica was not a random target; her abduction is connected to a larger conspiracy involving Victor and other powerful individuals. Step 7: The climax The climax of the movie features an epic showdown between Burke and Victor's chief enforcer in a tense fight scene. Using his wit, strategy, and brute strength, Burke defeats the enforcer and manages to rescue Jessica. However, Victor escapes in the chaos, leaving the possibility of a sequel. Step 8: Resolution In the aftermath of the rescue, Sarah is promoted within the police department due to her work on the case. Burke and Sarah develop a mutual respect and a bond between them, hinting at a possible romantic connection. With Jessica safe and the conspiracy exposed, Burke's reputation as a private investigator is solidified. He continues to work as a formidable force for justice, always ready to take on the next challenging case. With these steps, we have created a compelling plot for a movie with Bill Goldberg playing the lead role of Burke, a tough and resourceful private investigator caught in a web of intrigue and danger in a sprawling urban city."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article with the title: \\"Make Your Predictions\\"","completion":"Title: Make Your Predictions Introduction The world is ever-changing, with advances in technology, shifts in societal values, and new discoveries in science constantly scrutinized for their potential impact on our lives. However, one thing remains consistent—our innate curiosity and drive to predict the future. From early human civilizations to modern-day data analytics, our ability to make accurate predictions can influence decisions and transform various aspects of our lives. This article will delve into the fascinating world of forecasting, discussing why accurate predictions matter, various methods to develop predictions, and the potential of combining technology and human forecasters. Why Accurate Predictions Matter Predictions, in their essence, are educated guesses on how events might unfold based on a given set of circumstances or factors. Accurate predictions allow individuals, businesses, and governments to anticipate future challenges and take necessary action to mitigate risks or capitalize on new opportunities. They can empower decision-makers, enhance strategic planning, and spur innovation. For example, companies that can anticipate consumer trends or technological advancements can adjust their focus accordingly. Governments that wisely predict socio-political shifts can create policies that adapt to their citizens' evolving needs, promoting stability and progress. On an individual level, accurate forecasting can help us make better-informed decisions about our careers, investments, and personal relationships. Developing Predictive Skills 1. Identify Relevant Data Points: First, gather information about a subject—the more detailed, the better. By analyzing historical data, correlating patterns, and understanding various factors, people can better assess possible future outcomes. 2. Build Diverse Knowledge: Interdisciplinary thinking—drawing on ideas from a wide array of sources—plays a crucial role in accurate prediction-making. By exploring the interconnectedness of various fields and disciplines, forecasters can expand their viewpoints and better understand the potential ramifications of their predictions. 3. Learn from the Past: A critical aspect of making predictions is to study past events and understand the factors responsible for their outcomes. Observing patterns, trends, and cause-effect relationships can provide valuable insights that can then be applied to future situations. 4. Foster Critical Thinking: Developing the ability to think critically, question assumptions, and weigh alternatives enables those who are creating predictions to evaluate the credibility and likelihood of each scenario. This process can help eliminate bias and create a more precise forecast. 5. Cultivate Adaptability: The future is often uncertain, and unexpected events can occur that disrupt our expectations. By learning to adapt to new information and recalibrate predictions as needed, individuals can maintain a degree of flexibility that leads to better-informed decision-making. Technology and Human Forecasters: A Perfect Combination? The use of AI, machine learning, and big data analytics paves the way for improved predictive capabilities in various fields, from finance and healthcare to climate science and geopolitics. These technologies can process vast amounts of data in real-time, revealing hidden patterns and optimizing predictive models. However, the role of human intuition and judgment should not be neglected. While machine intelligence can quickly analyze data and identify trends through algorithms, it cannot match the creativity, nuance, and contextual knowledge that human forecasters bring to the table. Human intuition, experience, and analytical capacity, when combined with technology, create a powerful force—one that can dramatically increase the accuracy and significance of predictions. Final Thoughts Predicting the future is not just an exercise in curiosity; it is a valuable tool in decision-making and strategic planning. By honing our predictive abilities and embracing the integration of technology and human instinct, we can enhance our capacity to anticipate events, mitigate risks, and create a more informed and prepared society. Whether you aspire to be a successful entrepreneur, policymaker, or simply a keen observer of the world around you, it is essential to \\"Make Your Predictions\\" with clarity, confidence, and an unwavering commitment to the pursuit of knowledge. Remember, the future starts with us and our ability to envision it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Yes. I have something to tell. We have record rainfall during 24 hours in Lahore, breaking previous one day record by more than 60%. Our drainage system is pathetic. Other systems such as telephone, electricity, cable etc. are no better. Poor planning has further been aggravated by extremely mismanaged maintenance and operational bugs. This morning, when I was out for our fajr (morning prayers) in masjid, a neighbor told me that the pole laden with electricity meters was under fire. After that he buzzed off for complaint office. When I returned after prayers, I saw fire reaching cable part after meter; one meter had caught fire and other meters (including ours) was in danger of catching fire. It was still dark. I waited for someone to come out. No one appeared. I came inside and told my wife about and went again out to see if I could find someone to go about extinguishing fire. IT WAS DAM RISKY AS DIGGING WAS DONE BY TELEPHONE COMPANY AND RAINS HAD MADE A MESS ON OUR STREET. No one was seen. My wife came out; brought hose pipe. I managed to use it as water gun and there was some post-extinguishing sparking; fire was put out. I want to add here that hose pipe should only be used when someone knows how to send bursts of water so that electric current cannot build a circuit. Later in day we heard about the most stupid thing; people were inside their houses, watching flames from pole but not knowing what to do. THEY DID NOT EVEN COME OUT TO SHARE THE ACTIVITY.

Arvoisa puhemies, Espanjassa saamme päivittäin todistaa järkyttävää murhenäytelmää, kun ihmiset saapuvat maahamme paremman elämän toivossa. Which language is this?","completion":"The language used in the text provided is Finnish. Here is a detailed answer about the Finnish language and its origins: Finnish is a Uralic language that belongs to the Finno-Ugric branch, and it is primarily spoken in Finland, where it is the official language, and in areas of Sweden where there is a Finnish-speaking minority. Finnish is also one of the 24 official languages of the European Union. There are approximately 5.4 million native Finnish speakers in Finland, and about 700,000 Finnish speakers are living in other countries. The Finnish language is closely related to Estonian, and more distantly to Hungarian, as well as other Finno-Ugric languages such as Karelian, Veps, and Sámi languages. Finnish and its closely related languages evolved from the earlier Proto-Finno-Ugric language, which was spoken about 2,000 - 2,500 years ago. Finnish has been influenced by various other languages over time. From the Middle Ages onwards, contact with Germanic languages (such as Old Norse, Old Swedish, and Middle Low German) and later with Swedish due to Finland being under Swedish rule (from the 13th century till 1809), added loanwords to the Finnish vocabulary. After Finland became part of the Russian Empire as a Grand Duchy in 1809, Finnish gained more significance as a national language. The latter part of the 19th century, called the Finnish national awakening, saw an upsurge in efforts to promote Finnish culture and language. It was during this period that the first comprehensive grammar of the Finnish language was published by Elias Lönnrot, who also compiled the Finnish national epic, the Kalevala. The Finnish language has two distinct written forms: standard written Finnish and spoken Finnish. Standard written Finnish is used in official documents, media, and literature, while spoken Finnish is used in everyday informal conversations. The written and spoken forms of Finnish can be quite different from each other in terms of vocabulary, grammar, and syntax. Finnish is known for being an agglutinative language, meaning that it uses a complex system of affixes (such as suffixes and postpositions) to express various grammatical relationships, rather than relying on isolated prepositions and word order. This feature allows for very long compound words and constructions that can express complex meanings in a single word. Additionally, Finnish does not use gendered pronouns, making it a gender-neutral language. In conclusion, Finnish is a unique and fascinating language with a rich history and a wealth of complex linguistic features. Its origins within the Uralic language family and influences from other languages over centuries have made it an important element of Finnish national identity and an interesting linguistic phenomenon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Oil prices drop below 75 for first time in four years amid supply glut Oil prices dropped below 75 Thursday, hitting their lowest levels in four years as higher production creates an excess of supply. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil dropped by 2.85 to 74.33, and has fallen more than 30% since June, when prices were above 107. Meanwhile, Brent crude oil dropped 2.46 on Thursday, to 77.92, for a similar 30% drop in the past five months for the global benchmark. A major driving force behind the declining prices is U.S. oil production, which has increased to nearly 9 million barrels per day and is expected to average 9.4 million barrels per day in 2015. That would be the highest production levels since 1972, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The increase in production comes as a result of the shale boom in states like North Dakota, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Struggling economies in Asia and Europe have also contributed to global oversupply, while the decision by Saudi Arabia — the world’s largest oil producer — to cut its prices this month applied pressure to other global suppliers. Oil prices are also being driven down by the rising value of the U.S. dollar, which hit a five-year high last week. The drop in oil costs continues to hurt energy companies on Wall Street, where shares of Chevron CVX dropped about 1% on Thursday while Exxon Mobil CVX slipped 0.8%. Oil and gas driller Helmerich & Payne HP saw its shares drop steeply, almost 7%. Meanwhile, lower oil prices could be forcing some energy companies to consider consolidation. Reports surfaced on Thursday of a potentially major oil field services deal involving Halliburton HAL and Baker Hughes BHI . Both companies saw their shares rise on the speculation. Of course, there is at least one positive effect of plummeting oil prices for American consumers who are seeing some of the lowest gas prices in years. Prices at the pump are averaging around 2.92 per gallon after recently falling below 3 for the first time since 2010. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"1.

He receives a lead about an ancient manuscript reported to contain the answers to some of humanity's deepest mysteries. Intrigued and determined, he embarks on a globetrotting adventure to uncover the mysterious book, leaving his beloved library in the care of his trusted assistant, Katherine. As Boris follows clues across Europe and Asia, he encounters a clandestine network of scholars, art collectors, and criminals, each with their own hidden agendas. Along the way, he learns about the existence of an enigmatic artifact known as \\"The Lucium Key,\\" which is said to unlock the secrets contained within the sought-after manuscript. Meanwhile, Katherine discovers a coded message within one of the books in Boris' collection, pointing to an ominous conspiracy spanning centuries, involving powerful figures both historical and contemporary. She quickly realizes the hidden mastermind behind the theft of rare books and the quest for The Lucium Key is none other than Victor Rennard, Boris' longtime rival.

Answer:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"What are reptiles called as?\\" is \\"amniotes.\\" This is because reptiles, as a class of tetrapod vertebrates, are characterized by their ability to lay shelled eggs, specifically amniotic eggs.

These amniotic eggs offer protection and nourishment to the developing embryo while preventing desiccation. The other answer choices provided are not an accurate description of reptiles or their defining characteristics. Some explanations for those incorrect answer choices are: 1. Infected: This term refers to the presence of an infection or pathogen within an organism, which is unrelated to the biological traits or taxonomy of reptiles. 2. Animals: While reptiles are indeed a group of animals, this answer choice is too generic and does not specify the unique attributes that set reptiles apart from other animal groups. 3. Graptolites: Graptolites are an extinct group of colonial animals known from the fossil record. They are unrelated to reptiles. 4. Parasites: Parasites are organisms that live on or within another organism, causing harm. Reptiles do not fall within this category, as they are a group of vertebrates with distinct evolutionary and physiological traits. 5. Genus: Genus is a taxonomic rank in biological classification, one level above species and below family. This term does not apply to reptiles as a whole, as there are many different genera within the reptile class. 6. Warm-blooded: Reptiles are typically ectothermic (cold-blooded) animals, relying on external sources to regulate their body temperature. This distinction is one of the key factors that separate reptiles from mammals and birds, which are endothermic (warm-blooded) animals. 7. Strong: While some reptiles may exhibit physical strength, this term does not provide any information about the specific characteristics that define reptiles as a class of animals. In conclusion, based on the information provided and the knowledge that reptiles are a class of tetrapod vertebrates that produce amniotic eggs, the most appropriate and accurate answer choice is \\"amniotes.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 2: Determine the sentence structure. To create a clear and coherent sentence, I'll choose a simple subject-verb-object (SVO) structure, where the \\"flower\\" will be the subject, \\"bloom\\" will be transformed to a verb, and \\"edge\\" will be placed as an attribute of the object. Step 3: Create the sentence. With the structure and relationships decided, I can now write the sentence: \\"The flower blooms at the edge of the garden.\\" Justification: This sentence effectively communicates the concepts by describing a flower (the reproductive structure of a plant) going through the process of blooming (producing or opening its petals) at the outer boundary (edge) of a garden.

Write a title for this article: Rep. Gabrielle Giffords vows to return to Congress in a new book that details months of intense therapy and her emotional battle to come to terms with what happened when a gunman opened fire in front of a Tucson grocery store. The memoir, called \\"Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope,\\" is the most personal and detailed look yet at Giffords' struggle over the past 10 months to relearn how to walk and talk, and her painful discovery that 12 others were wounded and six killed during the Jan. 8 attack. The Associated Press purchased an advanced copy of the book. It is set for release on Nov. 15. The book is written by Giffords' husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, but Giffords delivers the last chapter -- a single page of short sentences and phrases entitled \\"Gabby's Voice\\" in which she says her goal is to get back to Congress. \\"I will get stronger. I will return,\\" she vows. Giffords, 40, stunned colleagues by appearing on the U.S. House floor in Washington on Aug. 1 to vote for the debt ceiling deal, but she has focused most of her time on her recovery at TIRR Memorial Hermann, a rehabilitation center in Houston. In the book, Kelly recalls trying to tell his wife several times what had happened that June 8 morning, when Giffords was shot in the head while meeting constituents. But she didn't fully understand until March 12. Kelly asked Giffords if she remembered being shot, and she replied that she did. When he asked what she remembered about it, she said three words: \\"Shot. Shocked. Scary.\\" Later that same day, Kelly was reading to her from a New York Times article about her recovery and skipped over a paragraph that said six others were killed. Giffords, following along, knew he left something out and pushed him to tell her what it was. Kelly writes that after she learned of the deaths, Giffords was overcome with emotion and had trouble getting through her therapy. That night as they lay in bed, she told Kelly that she felt awful about all the people who were killed. He held her as she cried. Six months later, after being released from the Houston hospital to Kelly's home 25 miles away, Giffords wanted to know who had been killed that day. He warned her that it would be tough on her because she knew two of the victims. He started by telling her that her staff member Gabe Zimmerman died, which caused her to moan and cry in a wave of emotion. Then he told her about her friend, federal Judge John Roll, and the four other people she didn't know. Finally, he told her that Christina Taylor-Green, a 9-year-old girl born on Sept. 11, 2001, was among the dead. After she got the news, Kelly writes that he held her as she processed the information and wept. Kelly recounted the agonizing moments when several media outlets inaccurately reported that Giffords was dead, then described experiencing hope when he learned she was alive and being treated at a Tucson hospital. When Kelly first saw Giffords after the shooting, he wrote that he was shocked at her state: She was in a coma with her head partially shaved and bandaged, her face black and blue, her body connected to a bunch of tubes. He told her how much he loved her and that she was going to survive. He also describes the early days in Giffords' recovery and rehab in Texas, saying that the darkest moment came when Giffords panicked because she realized she couldn't talk. Her eyes were wide with fear and she was crying uncontrollably as Kelly tried his best to comfort her and assure her that she would get better. The book describes lighter moments, like when President George H.W. Bush and his wife, Barbara, visited Giffords at the Texas hospital. Giffords kept replying to Bush with the only word she was able to say: \\"chicken.\\" At another point, a specialist showed her various politicians to see if she recognized people. When she saw former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, she said: \\"Messin' around. Babies.\\" As she progressed, Kelly said Giffords learned to talk again, reciting the U.S. Constitution and Martin Luther King Jr.'s \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech. The book reveals that because of her injuries, Giffords has lost 50 percent of her vision in both eyes. Kelly also reveals that the couple was quietly trying to have a baby. Giffords had undergone several rounds of fertility treatments in the last few years and was hoping to be pregnant early in 2011.

Question: Who are the Blue World's peacekeepers? Movie title: Lady in the Water Movie plot: One evening, Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti), who became a handyman at a Philadelphia apartment complex after his family was murdered, discovers Story (Bryce Dallas Howard), a naiad-like character (called a Narf) from the Blue World, in his building's pool, immediately rescuing her from an attack by a \\"Scrunt\\",[5] a grass-covered lupine that lies preternaturally flat. Story is here to find a specific writer whose book will better humanity's future. After questioning residents Farber (Bob Balaban), Bell (Mary Beth Hurt), Dury (Jeffrey Wright), and five nameless smokers, Heep discovers the author, Vick Ran (M. Night Shyamalan), who is writing The Cookbook, containing views and ideas so significant they will inspire a future President, a great Midwestern orator, to greatly change the world for the better. Ran meeting Story eliminates his fear and sharpens his inner voice, but he learns he will be assassinated because of the controversial nature of his ideas. The Tartutic, an invincible simian trio that serve as the Blue World's peacekeepers, have forbidden that Story be attacked while returning home. The Scrunt nonetheless does just that, as Story is destined to be a great leader as well. To return safely, she will now need the help of a Symbolist, Guardian, Guild, and Healer. Story believes Heep to be her Guardian; Heep asks Farber, a West Coast Ã©migrÃ© turned film critic, to help him figure out the others' identities. Working off movie tropes, Farber misadvises Heep, leading him to a flawed conclusion that Dury is the Symbolist, the smokers are the Guild, and Bell is the Healer. Heep asks Story how to \\"practice\\" for the confrontation but nearly dies in the process, convincing him he's not the Guardian. The next night, Farber's bad advice leads to their plan's immediate failure. In the confusion, Farber is killed and Story is mortally wounded by the Scrunt. Dury suddenly realizes his son Joey (Noah Gray-Cabey) is the Symbolist. Interpreting the information on cereal boxes, Joey deduces the true Guild is...

Lord Chesterfield and Bishop Warburton (and others) initially thought that the work was genuinely by Bolingbroke rather than a satire. All the reviews of the work were positive, with critics especially appreciative of Burke's quality of writing.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the final step of the following process: - Mix flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt into a bowl - Mix in milk, eggs, and melted butter - Mix until smooth - Heat a griddle or frying pan to medium high Answer:","completion":"The final step in this process is cooking the pancake batter on the heated griddle or frying pan. Here is the detailed process: 1. Lightly grease the preheated griddle or frying pan with a small amount of butter or non-stick cooking spray to prevent the pancakes from sticking. Make sure the surface is evenly coated. 2. Use a ladle or a small measuring cup (such as ¼ cup) to pour the prepared pancake batter onto the hot griddle or pan. The size of the pancake is determined by the amount of batter you pour. You can adjust the size according to your preference. 3. Wait for bubbles to form on the surface of the pancake. This is an indication that the pancake is ready to be flipped. Generally, this will take around 1-3 minutes, depending on the thickness of the batter and the temperature of the griddle or pan. 4. Carefully slide a spatula or a flat turner under the pancake and gently flip it over. Be cautious not to flip it too fast or too forcefully, as this can splatter batter or break the pancake apart. 5. Cook the other side of the pancake for about 1-2 minutes, or until it is golden brown on the bottom and cooked through. To check for doneness, gently press the center of the pancake with the edge of your spatula. If it feels firm and springs back, it is fully cooked. 6. Once cooked, transfer the pancake to a plate, and keep it warm by covering it with aluminum foil or a clean kitchen towel. Alternatively, you can store the cooked pancakes in a warm oven at a low temperature (around 200°F or 93°C) until you have cooked all the batter. 7. Repeat the process for the remaining batter, making sure to re-grease the cooking surface as needed, to prevent sticking. 8. Serve the pancakes warm, topped with your choice of butter, maple syrup, fruit, whipped cream, chocolate chips, or any other toppings you prefer. In conclusion, the final step in this pancake-making process is cooking the batter on the heated griddle or frying pan by pouring the batter onto the surface, flipping the pancakes once bubbles appear, and finally cooking them until they are golden brown and cooked through. Afterwards, serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings and enjoy!"},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

If you wash your shirts daily, before the stain has time to set in, the shirts will not become stained. [b]. Wash your shirts less frequently. If you wash your shirts daily, before the stain has time to set in, the shirts will not become stained.","completion":"The correct answer is: [a]. Wash your shirts more frequently. If you wash your shirts daily, before the stain has time to set in, the shirts will not become stained. Explanation: To prevent sweat stains, you should wash your shirts more often. This is because when you clean them every day, the sweat doesn't have time to leave a stain on the clothing. Washing them less frequently, as mentioned in option [b], would actually give the sweat more time to create a stain, which is the opposite of what we want to avoid."},{"prompt":"Information: - The High Fens , which were declared a nature reserve in 1957, are an upland area, a plateau region in the province of Liège, in the east of Belgium and adjoining parts of Germany, between the Ardennes and the Eifel highlands.

Question: A kid is studying new words at home in the kitchen, where could a dictionary be? Options: - library - table - bookstore - shelf - classroom Explain why a human would choose \\"table\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"table\\" as the answer to the question above for several reasons: 1. Context: The question describes a kid studying new words at home in the kitchen. A table is a common piece of furniture found in many kitchens where people often sit to study, eat, or work. Therefore, it is more likely that the dictionary the kid is using would be placed on the kitchen table during the study session. 2. Accessibility: When learning new words, a student would want to have easy access to a dictionary for quick reference. Having the dictionary on the table while studying ensures that it is within reach and readily available as needed. This makes it convenient and efficient for the kid to use the dictionary for learning purposes. 3. Home environment: The other options - library, bookstore, and classroom - suggest locations outside the home or distinct, designated areas within a school or public space. Since the question specifically states that the kid is studying at home, these options are less relevant or appropriate in this context. 4. Temporary placement: The option \\"shelf\\" might be a place where a dictionary is typically stored when not in use. However, since the question indicates that the kid is actively studying new words, it is more reasonable to assume that the dictionary has been taken off the shelf and placed on the table for immediate access during the learning session. In summary, the \\"table\\" is the most logical answer because it is a common piece of furniture found in kitchens, provides easy access to the dictionary while studying, corresponds to the home environment described in the question, and implies temporary placement for the ongoing study session."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A poem is often a personal expression, and therefore, the poet is more likely to write about what resonates with them. Step 2: Factor in the target audience. The intended readership may influence the choice of subject matter, as certain themes might be more appealing or relevant to specific audiences. Step 3: Reflect on the purpose of the poem. If the poem is intended to convey a message, raise awareness, or provoke thought, the underlying theme should align with these goals. Ultimately, a poem can be about any topic, as long as it connects with the poet and their audience and serves the intended purpose. 2. \\"What is a poem?\\": This question asks for the definition of a poem.

What is the answer for the question: What are the first names of the three people who moved to the CBS studios in Nashville, Tennessee? from the following article ? Blonde on Blonde is the seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released June 20, 1966 on Columbia Records. Recording sessions began in New York in October 1965 with numerous backing musicians, including members of Dylan's live backing band, the Hawks. Though sessions continued until January 1966, they yielded only one track that made it onto the final album—\\"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)\\". At producer Bob Johnston's suggestion, Dylan, keyboardist Al Kooper, and guitarist Robbie Robertson moved to the CBS studios in Nashville, Tennessee. These sessions, augmented by some of Nashville's top session musicians, were more fruitful, and in February and March all the remaining songs for the album were recorded. Blonde on Blonde completed the trilogy of rock albums that Dylan recorded in 1965 and 1966, starting with Bringing It All Back Home and Highway 61 Revisited. Critics often rank Blonde on Blonde as one of the greatest albums of all time. Combining the expertise of Nashville session musicians with a modernist literary sensibility, the album's songs have been described as operating on a grand scale musically, while featuring lyrics one critic called \\"a unique mixture of the visionary and the colloquial\\". It was one of the first double albums in rock music. The album peaked at number nine on the Billboard 200 chart in the US, where it eventually was certified double platinum, and it reached number three in the UK. Blonde on Blonde spawned two singles that were top-twenty hits in the US: \\"Rainy Day Women #12 & 35\\" and \\"I Want You\\". Two additional songs—\\"Just Like a Woman\\" and \\"Visions of Johanna\\"—have been named as among Dylan's greatest compositions and were featured in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list.","completion":"The first names of the three people who moved to the CBS studios in Nashville, Tennessee, as mentioned in the article, are Bob (Bob Dylan), Al (Al Kooper), and Robbie (Robbie Robertson).

Information: - Social-Demokraten (\\"The Social Democrat\\") was a Swedish daily Social Democratic newspaper, belonging to the Swedish Social Democratic Party. The paper was founded in 1885 by Axel Danielsson and August Palm, and existed up to 1944 when it changed name to \\"Morgon-Tidningen\\" (\\"The Morning Paper\\"). \\"Morgon-Tidningen\\" existed up to 1958. - Västra Götaland County is a county or \\"län\\" on the western coast of Sweden. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - Axel Danielsson (15 December 1863 30 December 1899) was a Swedish socialist agitator, journalist and writer, born in Värmland. He was a prominent leader of the early Swedish Social Democratic Party. Danielsson retranslated Karl Marx's \\"Communist Manifesto\\" into Swedish in 1886. - Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium \\"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\\" (MTB). Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections do not have symptoms; in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis. About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those infected. The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The historical term \\"consumption\\" came about due to the weight loss. Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms. Tuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze. People with latent TB do not spread the disease. Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke. Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids. Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests. Prevention of TB involves screening those at high risk, early detection and treatment of cases, and vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine. Those at high risk include household, workplace, and social contacts of people with active TB. Treatment requires the use of multiple antibiotics over a long period of time. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem with increasing rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). One-third of the world's population is thought to be infected with TB. New infections occur in about 1% of the population each year. In 2014, there were 9.6 million cases of active TB which resulted in 1.5 million deaths. More than 95% of deaths occurred in developing countries. The number of new cases each year has decreased since 2000. About 80% of people in many Asian and African countries test positive while 510% of people in the United States population tests positive by the tuberculin test.... - The lungs are the primary organs of respiration in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails. In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the heart. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their musculoskeletal systems to support and foster breathing. In early tetrapods, air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians. In humans, the primary muscle that drives breathing is the diaphragm. The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human speech possible. - The Swedish Social Democratic Party, (SAP; literally, \\"Social Democratic Workers' Party of Sweden\\"), contesting elections as the \\"ArbetarepartietSocialdemokraterna\\" ('The Workers' Party The Social Democrats'), usually referred to just as the 'Social Democrats' (\\"Socialdemokraterna\\"); is the oldest and largest political party in Sweden. The current party leader since 2012 is Stefan Löfven; he has also been Prime Minister of Sweden since 2014. - A diagnosis of latent tuberculosis (LTB), also called latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) means a patient is infected with \\"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\\", but the patient does not have active tuberculosis. Active tuberculosis can be contagious while latent tuberculosis is not, and it is therefore not possible to get TB from someone with latent tuberculosis. The main risk is that approximately 10% of these patients (5% in the first two years after infection and 0.1% per year thereafter) will go on to develop active tuberculosis. This is particularly true, and there is added risk, in particular situations such as medication that suppresses the immune system or advancing age. - Karl Johan ( K.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"I will address each question individually: Question 1: What is a ring network, and how are its nodes connected? What is the importance of this network to topology? Step 1: Define a ring network. A ring network is a type of computer network topology where each node (computer or device) is connected to exactly two other nodes, forming a cyclic, closed loop or circular data path. Step 2: Explain how nodes are connected in a ring network. In a ring network, the nodes are connected in a circular or loop fashion. Each node is connected to its immediate neighbors, and data travels in one direction around the loop. Step 3: Explain the importance of the ring network to topology. The importance of a ring network topology is that it offers several advantages, including: 1. Simplicity and ease of installation: Each node only needs to be connected to its immediate neighbors, making setup relatively simple. 2. Predictable performance: Since data always travels in one direction, it is easy to calculate transmission times. 3. Fault tolerance: If one node fails, the network can often continue functioning by bypassing the failed node. However, ring networks also have some disadvantages, such as slower communication speeds and potential bottlenecks in heavy traffic situations. Question 2: What does Bash mean? Bash stands for \\"Bourne Again SHell.\\" It is a command-line interface for Unix and Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux and macOS. Bash is a program that interprets and executes commands from users, allowing them to interact with the computer's operating system directly. It was developed as an enhanced version of the original Bourne Shell, hence the name \\"Bourne Again SHell.\\" Regarding the question: \\"Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?\\" No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is asking about a specific network topology, the ring network, while question 2 is asking about a command-line interface for Unix and Unix-like operating systems. These topics are unrelated and cover different aspects of computer systems and networks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Alexander married twice: Roxana, daughter of the Bactrian nobleman Oxyartes, out of love; and Stateira II, a Persian princess and daughter of Darius III of Persia, for political reasons. He apparently had two sons, Alexander IV of Macedon of Roxana and, possibly, Heracles of Macedon from his mistress Barsine. He lost another child when Roxana miscarried at Babylon. Alexander also had a close relationship with his friend, general, and bodyguard Hephaestion, the son of a Macedonian noble. Hephaestion's death devastated Alexander. This event may have contributed to Alexander's failing health and detached mental state during his final months. Alexander's sexuality has been the subject of speculation and controversy. No ancient sources stated that Alexander had homosexual relationships, or that Alexander's relationship with Hephaestion was sexual. Aelian, however, writes of Alexander's visit to Troy where \\"Alexander garlanded the tomb of Achilles and Hephaestion that of Patroclus, the latter riddling that he was a beloved of Alexander, in just the same way as Patroclus was of Achilles\\". Noting that the word eromenos (ancient Greek for beloved) does not necessarily bear sexual meaning, Alexander may have been bisexual, which in his time was not controversial. Green argues that there is little evidence in ancient sources that Alexander had much carnal interest in women; he did not produce an heir until the very end of his life. However, he was relatively young when he died, and Ogden suggests that Alexander's matrimonial record is more impressive than his father's at the same age. Apart from wives, Alexander had many more female companions. Alexander accumulated a harem in the style of Persian kings, but he used it rather sparingly; showing great self-control in \\"pleasures of the body\\". Nevertheless, Plutarch described how Alexander was infatuated by Roxana while complimenting him on not forcing himself on her. Green suggested that, in the context of the period, Alexander formed quite strong friendships with women, including Ada of Caria, who adopted him, and even Darius's mother Sisygambis, who supposedly died from grief upon hearing of Alexander's death.

To answer the question about the number of children Alexander's father had when he was Alexander's age when Alexander died, we need to dig deeper into historical records.

When Philip II was 32 years old (in 350 BC), he had already fathered several children by different wives and consorts. Among these children at least four were born before 350 BC: 1. Philip III Arrhidaeus (born circa 359 BC) 2. Alexander IV (born before 350 BC) 3. Cleopatra (born circa 356 BC) 4.

But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.

News article: Ancient scorpion had feet, may have walked out of ocean A specimen of the new scorpion species Eramoscorpius brucensis, which lived about 430 million years ago, making it among the earliest scorpions. The species probably lived in water, but it had feet that would have allowed it to scuttle about on (© David Rudkin, Royal Ontario Museum) A new scorpion species found fossilized in the rocks of a backyard could turn the scientific understanding of these stinging creatures on its head. The fossils suggest that ancient scorpions crawled out of the seas and onto land earlier than thought, according to the researchers who analyzed them. In fact, some of the oldest scorpions had the equipment needed to walk out of their watery habitats and onto land, the researchers said. The fossils date back some 430 million to 433 million years, which makes them only slightly younger than the oldest known scorpions, which lived between 433 million and 438 million years ago. The new species \\"is really important, because the combination of its features don't appear in any other known scorpion,\\" said study leader Janet Waddington, an assistant curator of paleontology at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. [25 Amazing Ancient Beasts] The new species fell into Waddington's hands almost by happenstance. Museum curators frequently get calls about fossils, most of which are run-of-the-mill, she told Live Science. But a woman who called about an \\"insect\\" in her backyard stone wall had something very exciting on her hands. \\"When she showed me this fossil, I just about fell on the floor, it was so amazing,\\" Waddington said. The fossil was no insect, but rather a scorpion — and a new species at that. Over the years, more specimens trickled in, mostly from patio stones and rock quarries, and one from a mislabeled fossil at a national park on Canada's Bruce Peninsula. Now, Waddington and her team have 11 examples of the new species, ranging in length from 1.1 inches to 6.5 inches. What made the animal, dubbed Eramoscorpius brucensis, so fascinating was its legs. Previously, the earliest scorpion fossils found came from rocks that were originally deposited in the water, leading paleontologists to believe that the animals evolved on the seafloor, like crabs, and only later became landlubbers. Ancient scorpions had legs like crabs, with a tarsus, or foot segment, that was longer than the segment preceding it. This arrangement, Waddington said, would have meant the creatures walked on their \\"tippy-toes,\\" such as crabs do today. But E. brucensis was different. This species had a tarsus segment that was shorter than the segment before it, which would have made it possible for the animal to set its tarsus flat against the ground. In other words, this scorpion had feet. \\"They could have walked on their feet, which is really important because it meant that they could have supported their own weight,\\" Waddington said. Without the need for water to buoy them up, the animals could have walked on land. The fossils also show that the scorpions' legs were solidly attached at the body, without the exaggerated \\"hinge\\" seen in scorpions that would have needed water to stay upright. What's weird, Waddington said, is that all the other features of these scorpions seem aquatic. They are found in marine rocks, and their digestive systems appear to require water (in today's land scorpions, digestion begins outside of their bodies, a process that requires adaptations these ancient scorpions lack). Waddington said she and her team suspect that the fossils they've collected are not the bodies of dead scorpions at all. Instead, they may be molts, exoskeletons left behind as the scorpions grow. Scorpions are incredibly vulnerable during molting, Waddington said, and in deep water, ancient squidlike animals would have loved a helpless scorpion snack. The scorpions that could haul themselves out of the water onto the shore to escape predators would have had a survival advantage. The rocks that house the scorpion fossils often feature ripples that would have been created when wind blew thin films of water over land, suggesting a shoreline lagoon habitat. What that means is that the first adaptations that scorpions developed for life on land could have appeared much earlier than researchers thought. \\"Our guys are really, really old,\\" Waddington said. \\"They're vying for the second-oldest [scorpions] known.\\" The researchers reported their findings Jan. 13 in the journal Biology Letters.

Article: On runways, green lights indicate the beginning of the runway for landing, while red lights indicate the end of the runway. Runway edge lighting consists of white lights spaced out on both sides of the runway, indicating the edge. Some airports have more complicated lighting on the runways including lights that run down the centerline of the runway and lights that help indicate the approach (an approach lighting system, or ALS). Low-traffic airports may use pilot controlled lighting to save electricity and staffing costs. Now answer this question: On runways, what indicate the end of the runway?","completion":"On runways, red lights indicate the end of the runway. These lights are crucial for pilots, as they provide essential visual cues when landing or taking off, ensuring that they can safely navigate the runway and manage the aircraft's speed and positioning. Along with the green lights that mark the beginning of the runway, these red lights play a vital role in maintaining safe and efficient airport operations, particularly during low visibility conditions such as nighttime, fog, or extreme weather events. In addition to the green and red lights indicating the beginning and end of the runway, there are other lighting systems in place to assist pilots during the landing process. Runway edge lighting, which consists of white lights spaced out on both sides of the runway, provides a clear visual boundary, helping pilots maintain the aircraft's alignment with the runway centerline. Some airports, especially those handling a larger volume of traffic or in regions with more challenging weather conditions, incorporate more complex lighting systems. These may include lights running down the centerline of the runway, which further aid pilots in aligning their approach. Additionally, an approach lighting system (ALS) can be utilized to indicate the proper approach path for aircrafts preparing for landing, particularly during periods of low visibility. To conserve electricity and reduce staffing costs, low-traffic airports may rely on pilot-controlled lighting. In these airports, pilots can activate the runway lighting systems remotely as needed, ensuring a safe and efficient operation even without continuous staffing. In summary, red lights indicate the end of the runway on airport runways, and they play an essential role in guiding pilots through the landing and takeoff process. With additional lighting elements such as the runway edge lighting, centerline lighting, and approach lighting system, pilots can safely navigate their approach and landing even in challenging weather conditions or periods of low visibility, ultimately contributing to a more efficient and secure airport environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget. It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example: you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall. Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. When does the author advise that adding super foods should occur after beginning clean eating? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - one does not have to eat \\"super foods\\" at any time since clean eating is possible without them - not enough information - when one is able to acquire produce in bulk - after reading \\"experts\\" advice on clean eating Answer:","completion":"The author advises that one does not have to eat \\"super foods\\" at any time since clean eating is possible without them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"CHAPTER 4: STEWARDSHIP LAND\\" This statement appears to be a title or heading, presumably for a text or document that discusses the topic of stewardship land. It is not a fact or argument in itself and does not provide any information about the significance or centrality of stewardship land. Hypothesis: \\"Stewardship Land is the primary focus.\\" This statement asserts that stewardship land is the main subject or area of concern. However, it is unclear whether the statement refers to the primary focus of the document or text mentioned in the premise or the primary focus in a broader context (e.g., in environmental management, land use, or policy). Given the provided options: (I). yes (II). it is not possible to tell (III). no Let's examine each and determine the best response in relation to whether the hypothesis follows from the premise: (I). Yes: Choosing this option would imply that if the premise (that the title is \\"CHAPTER 4: STEWARDSHIP LAND\\") is true, then the hypothesis (that stewardship land is the primary focus) is also true. As mentioned earlier, the premise by itself does not give enough information to support the conclusion that stewardship land is the primary focus. Therefore, this option is not accurate. (II). It is not possible to tell: This option suggests that the premise does not provide enough information to determine whether the hypothesis is true or not. Based on the analysis above, this seems to be the most appropriate response. The title of a chapter might suggest that the text or document discusses stewardship land, but it does not indicate that stewardship land is the primary focus either within the document or in a broader context. (III). No: This option implies that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is not true. The premise, as a standalone statement, does not provide evidence against the hypothesis. Rejecting the hypothesis based on the premise alone would not be accurate or justified. In conclusion, given the available information, we can choose option (II) \\"it is not possible to tell\\" as the most accurate response.

She is a two-time Olympic medalist (1998 and 2002), a five-time World champion (1996, 1998, 2000, 2001, and 2003) and a nine-time U.S. champion (1996, 1998-2005). She is tied with Maribel Vinson for the all-time National Championship record. She competed at the senior level for over a decade and is the most decorated figure skater in U.S. history. Context: Michelle began to develop a more mature style in 1996. Her new, more artistically expressive programs were \\"Romanza\\" (short program) and \\"Salome\\" (free skate). She also improved her extension, speed and jump technique, and performed to more difficult choreography. She won both the U.S. Championships and the World Championships in 1996. In the later event, she edged out defending champion Chen Lu in a very close competition in which both competitors garnered two perfect 6.0s for Presentation in the free skate. In the 1996-97 season, Kwan skated to \\"Dream of Desdemona\\" (short program) and \\"Taj Mahal\\" (free skate). During this season, Kwan struggled with her jumps because of a growth spurt and problems with new skating boots which she wore for an endorsement contract with the manufacturer. She fell twice and stumbled once in her free skate at 1997 U.S. Nationals, losing the title to Tara Lipinski. She lost the Champion Series Final to Lipinski a month later. At the World Championships, Kwan stepped out of her triple lutz combination and placed 4th in the Short Program portion of the competition behind Lipinski, France's Vanessa Gusmeroli, and Russia's Maria Butyrskaya. Kwan skated a six triple, mistake-free performance to win the freestyle portion of the competition, but placed second to Lipinski overall. Kwan started out the 1997-1998 Olympic season by winning Skate America (where she defeated Tara Lipinski) and then Skate Canada. However, she suffered a stress fracture on her foot and was forced to withdraw from her third Champions Series Final. Kwan regained her U.S. title from Lipinski at the 1998 National Championships, despite her fractured toe. Many people consider her performances of her Rachmaninoff short program and free skate set to William Alwyn's \\"Lyra Angelica\\" at the 1998 U.S. Championships to be the high point of her career from both a technical and artistic standpoint. The performances earned her fifteen perfect 6.0s and left one judge in tears. Kwan and Lipinski were co-favorites to win the 1998 Olympic Games in Nagano, Japan. Kwan placed first in the Short Program portion of the competition, winning eight first place votes out of nine judges. In the free skate, Kwan skated a clean 7-triple performance but placed behind Lipinski, who also did 7 triples including a triple loop/triple loop combination and a triple toe-loop/half-loop/Triple Salchow. Kwan ended up winning the silver medal, with the gold medal going to Tara Lipinski and the bronze medal to Chen Lu. Lipinski and Chen both retired from competitive skating shortly after the Olympics, while Kwan went on to win the 1998 World Championships in Minneapolis. Question: What did she do next? Answer:","completion":"After the 1998 Olympics, Michelle Kwan continued to compete in figure skating. She won the World Championships in 1998, which took place in Minneapolis.

In Boxing, name the referee who angered the crowd by giving the decision to Joe Bugner against Henry Cooper????","completion":"The referee who faced public outcry for his decision during the boxing match between Joe Bugner and Henry Cooper was Harry Gibbs. To delve more deeply into the details, the match was held on March 16, 1971, at the Empire Pool in Wembley, London. The match was a competitive one, with both renowned boxers, Joe Bugner and Henry Cooper, contending for the British, Commonwealth, and European heavyweight titles. Harry Gibbs was handed the crucial task of officiating the match. However, the match's outcome saw Gibbs facing significant backlash from the public and the media. Post-contest, he was harshly criticised for the decision he made in favor of Joe Bugner. Many among the spectators and viewers believed that Henry Cooper had done enough to win the match. Cooper himself expressed disappointment in the decision and accused Gibbs of favoring the younger Bugner. Regardless, the decision laid in the hands of Gibbs, who was a distinguished referee of his time. He scored the match 73-72 in favor of Bugner, which was an undeniably close tally. It signifies that according to Gibbs, Bugner held the upper hand, albeit slight, during the match. To put into context, the controversy raged not only because of the perceived injustice against Cooper but also due to the match's significance. It was Cooper's final professional match, effectively bringing an end to an illustrious career. His record includes being the British, European and Commonwealth heavyweight champion, holding the British title for a record number of times. He was also beloved by the public, intensifying the emotional charge of the decision. Harry Gibbs's decision in favor of Joe Bugner against Henry Cooper on that night has gone down in boxing history and is often brought up in debates about the sport. It serves as a testament to the subjective nature of scoring in boxing and the enormous responsibility that lies on a referee’s shoulders to make fair and impartial decisions. Despite the controversy, Gibbs continued to work as a sought-after referee, officiating more than 160 world title fights in his career."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

From there, she obtained work as a secretary, and acting on her friend's advice, she telephoned Louis Leakey, the notable Kenyan archaeologist and palaeontologist, with no other thought than to make an appointment to discuss animals. Leakey, believing that the study of existing great apes could provide indications of the behaviour of early hominids, was looking for a chimpanzee researcher, though he kept the idea to himself. Instead, he proposed that Goodall work for him as a secretary. After obtaining approval from his wife Mary Leakey, Louis sent Goodall to Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, where he laid out his plans. In 1958, Leakey sent Goodall to London to study primate behaviour with Osman Hill and primate anatomy with John Napier. Leakey raised funds, and on 14 July 1960, Goodall went to Gombe Stream National Park, becoming the first of what would come to be called The Trimates. She was accompanied by her mother, whose presence was necessary to satisfy the requirements of David Anstey, chief warden, who was concerned for their safety; Tanzania was \\"Tanganyika\\" at that time and a British protectorate. Leakey arranged funding and in 1962, he sent Goodall, who had no degree, to Cambridge University. She went to Newnham College, and obtained a PhD degree in ethology.

Dougie believes that Satan is fun and friendly, and the family is convinced that the masked figure is Alex acting spookily.A killing spree starts around the neighborhood.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: Your body has a very efficient reaction to dangerous events that pumps up your \\"fight-or-flight\\" response, allowing you to jump out of the way of an oncoming car and save your life. This reaction causes your heart to pound, your pulse to quicken, and your muscles to tense. But you may also unconsciously perceive that this reaction is necessary for non-life-threatening situations, such as traffic jams, looming deadlines, or family issues. You must learn ways to counter your body's stress response so that you can \\"put the brakes\\" on and allow your body to relax. You may be experiencing unproductive, negative thoughts that lead to worrying, which can trigger the release of stress hormones. This is a response that is appropriate if, say, you run into a stressful situation like a bear in your path, but may not be appropriate when traffic is making you late to work. Identify common stressful thoughts by noticing if they fall into these categories: \\"Should\\" or \\"Must\\" statements: You have a strict list of things you \\"should,\\" \\"must,\\" or \\"should not\\" do, and feel stressed out or anxious when you do not follow these rules. Catastrophizing: You expect the worst-case scenario or blow things out of proportion. Even small problems are \\"horrible\\" or a \\"disaster.\\" All-or-nothing thinking: You see things only in black or white, as good or bad. Instead of acknowledging the complexities (or \\"gray areas\\") of being human, things are either wrong or right and there is no in between. \\"What if\\"ing: You find yourself having an internal conversation about things you fear, such as \\"What if my child is hurt?\\" \\"What if I fail?\\" \\"What if I'm late?\\" and so on. Sometimes, a stressful situation is just a matter of perspective. Pessimism, for example, is an excellent example of avoidable stress we put ourselves through. Instead of focusing on the negatives and the problems that are causing you anxiety, concentrate on the positives. Negative thoughts lead to a negative mood state and positive thoughts lead to a positive mood state. When you feel down, pay attention to your thoughts. What have you been telling yourself? Try to spin negative thoughts into positives. For example, you may think to yourself \\"I'll never finish all my work.\\" Change this thought by spinning it: \\"If I work at a steady pace and take regular breaks, I can knock this work out in __ hours.\\" When you change your viewpoint, you can change your level of stress altogether. Do your best to see things in a positive light, and avoid cynicism at all costs. Another way to combat stressful thoughts is to ask yourself whether there's really any truth to them. Disputing and disproving your thoughts can help you view your thoughts objectively instead of immediately accepting them as truth. Make a column for evidence of/for the stressful thought and another for evidence against it. Or, if you don't have paper or time, try to do this exercise mentally. Write the evidence in the appropriate column. So if you're catastrophizing because you've been running late (and you are thinking \\"I'm going to be fired\\"), your \\"for\\" column might look like: \\"I was late twice last week and they're not going to tolerate me being late again;\\" while your \\"against\\" column might look like: \\"My boss said he understands that I have to drop my son off at preschool before I can drive to work,\\" \\"We have a time and attendance policy that allows me to be late a certain number of times, and I'm nowhere near that point,\\" and so on. . Although keeping a journal may seem strange or tedious, writing down your thoughts on a regular basis can help keep you stress-free. When you feel bogged down with some emotional or mental stressor, write about it in your journal. Getting it out on paper will give you a sense of relief you might not otherwise find. Write honestly and without fear. Your journal is only for you: no one else needs to read it or see what is stressing you out. It is a safe, judgment-free place to get out all your worries, emotions, thoughts, and feelings. Once your thoughts are down on paper, they will no longer be taking up space in your brain. Journaling can help you experience clarity and see the source of your stress. Write out your problems to organize your thoughts. When your thoughts are not organized, you can't think clearly, which leads to confusion and stress. If you have a problem and can't decide between two solutions, make a two-column pros and cons list (for and against), such as dividing a sheet of paper down the center to compare two ways to handle that situation. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article discusses the body's stress response and how it can be triggered in non-life-threatening situations, leading to negative thoughts and worrying.

It covered an area of 190,800 mi² or 494,169 km². According to the testimony of Julius Caesar, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica and Aquitania. Archaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La Tène culture, which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia and southwestern Germania during the 5th to 1st centuries BC. During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: Gallia Cisalpina was conquered in 203 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC. - Camillo Tanio Boccia (19121982) was an Italian film director and screenwriter active in the 1960s. - A film director is a person who directs the making of a film.

The scenario is based on Julius Caesar 's Commentarii de Bello Gallico . - The Gallic Wars were a series of military campaigns waged by the Roman proconsul Julius Caesar against several Gallic tribes. Rome's war against the Gallic tribes lasted from 58 BC to 50 BC and culminated in the decisive Battle of Alesia in 52 BC, in which a complete Roman victory resulted in the expansion of the Roman Republic over the whole of Gaul (mainly present-day France and Belgium). While militarily just as strong as the Romans, the internal division between the Gallic tribes helped ease victory for Caesar, and Vercingetorix's attempt to unite the Gauls against Roman invasion came too late. The wars paved the way for Julius Caesar to become the sole ruler of the Roman Republic. - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - Commentarii de Bello Gallico, also simply Bellum Gallicum, is Julius Caesar's firsthand account of the Gallic Wars, written as a third-person narrative. In it Caesar describes the battles and intrigues that took place in the nine years he spent fighting the Germanic peoples and Celtic peoples in Gaul that opposed Roman conquest. - The Roman Republic was the era of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire. It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world. - Gaius Julius Caesar (13 July 100 BC 15 March 44 BC), known as Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician, general, and notable author of Latin prose. He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire.

Q:Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which would partially ionize in water, sample A or sample B? David is a chemical engineer. Yesterday, he was working on two samples, sample A and sample B. Sample A was a strong acid, and sample B was a weak acid. David needed to find the differences between them. Hint: The strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton. A strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water; in other words, one mole of a strong acid HA dissolves in water yielding one mole of H+ and one mole of the conjugate base, A−, and none of the protonated acid HA. In contrast, a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution. Examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydroiodic acid (HI), hydrobromic acid (HBr), perchloric acid (HClO4), nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). In water each of these essentially ionizes 100%. The stronger an acid is, the more easily it loses a proton, H+. Two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the polarity of the H—A bond and the size of atom A, which determines the strength of the H—A bond. Acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base. A:","completion":"Given the information, the sample that would partially ionize in water is sample B. This is because the passage describes sample B as a weak acid. Weak acids do not completely ionize or dissociate in water, meaning they only partially break apart into their ions. This is in contrast to strong acids, like sample A, which fully ionize in water. The process of ionization refers to how an acid separates into its constituent ions in a solution. Thus, the key to answering this question is understanding the difference between weak and strong acids and how they behave when they dissolve in water."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Q: Context: Hypertension is one of the most important risk factors for coronary heart disease. Recent studies have pointed out the possibility that virgin olive oil (VOO) may lower blood pressure in hypertensive (HT) subjects. However, until the date there is scarce information regarding elderly people. The present study was designed to assess the effect of dietary VOO on blood pressure in medically treated hypertensive elderly patients.', '31 medically treated HT elderly patients and 31 normotensive (NT) elderly volunteers participated in a randomized sequential dietary intervention. Subjects consumed diets enriched in sunflower oil (SO) or VOO for 4 weeks each with a 4-week washout period between them.', 'VOO reduced total and LDL-cholesterol in NT but not in HT (P < 0.01) and the concentrations were lower than in the group consuming SO. In contrast, no significant differences were found in the levels of tocopherols among the groups studied. Iron-induced oxidation of LDL resulted in a complete loss of monoacylglycerols (MG) and diacylglycerols (DG) and a reduction in triacylglycerols (TG) (60-80%), which was found to be greater in HT (P < 0.01) with no effect of diet.

From the information given, a complete skull of a Dakosaurus was discovered in Argentina in 1996. The researchers who studied the skull included Diego Pol of Ohio State University, Zulma Gasparini of Argentina's National University of La Plata, and their colleagues. The discovery was of a complete skull, not an entire Dakosaurus. It has provided valuable information about the species, contributing to our understanding of the Dakosaurus and its unique features, but it does not constitute a complete specimen of the extinct marine reptile. Dakosaurus, a marine reptile that lived during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous periods, had a unique set of adaptations that helped it become a successful predator in the prehistoric oceans. This group of marine reptiles, known as metriorhynchids, had evolved to have a more hydrodynamic body plan that allowed them to achieve higher swimming speeds. Furthermore, the skull of Dakosaurus displayed adaptations for a powerful bite, suggesting that it was a formidable predator. Through the study of this skull, researchers like Diego Pol and Zulma Gasparini were able to learn more about Dakosaurus and its intriguing characteristics. The discovery of the complete skull provided valuable new information on the anatomy, feeding behavior, and ecology of this ancient predator, as well as the insights into the broader evolution of marine reptiles during the Mesozoic Era. In conclusion, it is incorrect to state that a complete Dakosaurus was discovered by Diego Pol. However, the finding of the complete skull unearthed in Argentina in 1996 and studied by Diego Pol, Zulma Gasparini, and their team has had significant implications for our understanding of the species and the history of marine reptiles.

Article: It's official: Twitter's advertising platform launches in the next 24 hours. The much-anticipated Twitter business model will begin appearing in search results in the afternoon, with ads on Twitter.com and within third-party apps to follow. The launch of the new ad platform, known as Promoted Tweets, isn't a surprise — like any other company, Twitter has to make money from somewhere, plus the existence of Twitter's ad platform has been known for some time. Now that the ad platform has been revealed and Twitter is focused on making money, the multi-billion dollar question is this: will users click Twitter ads? The answer to this question will decide not only the fate of Twitter as a company, but change the direction of all social media. Twitter Resonance: The New Digg Ads? Twitter's new ad platform will begin by charging per thousand impressions, but will eventually switch to a model that the company calls \\"resonance.\\" Essentially, a sponsored tweet gains points based on factors such as retweets, favorites, impressions, and clicks. Combined, this resonance score will tell Twitter whether or not an advertisement is performing, which will affect its longevity and its price. To us, the system sounds very familiar to Digg Ads. Digg Ads appear in the homepage stream as sponsored Digg submissions. Based on the number of diggs, buries, and clicks an ad receives, that ad will either stay on the homepage for longer and decrease in price, or it will be \\"buried\\" and the advertiser is charged more for submitting a bad ad. While clearly there are differences between Digg Ads and Promoted Tweets, the same concepts and philosophies underly both: users know the difference between a good ad and a bad one, and thus they should get a say as to which ads appear in their streams. It's not a bad strategy on Twitter's part: Digg Ads have been successful thus far. Could this be a fundamental shift in how online advertising is done? We'll reserve judgment on that question until we see Promoted Tweets in action. Will Users Click? Will users embrace in-stream ads? Will they click them, thus giving Twitter the revenue it needs to become a truly profitable company? There are a ton of factors involved in predicting click-through rates — it's almost a science. Twitter seems to believe that a combination of relevancy and its in-house resonance score will be enough to address that issue. If Digg Ads are any indication, relevancy shouldn't be a problem. Another factor is the presentation of Promoted Tweets. On this charge, Twitter seems to be balancing the need to identify promoted tweets with the desire to integrate them seamlessly into the stream. Twitter ads look nearly identical to regular tweets — the only real difference seems to be the \\"Promoted By X\\" line at the bottom of the tweet. Many users will barely notice the difference and will thus click these links just as they would with any regular tweet. To succeed, Twitter ads have to maintain a level of sincerity that has been one of the cornerstones of social media communication. They also have to be compelling and conversational, rather than overly-promotional. This is something Digg has been able to manage through Digg Ads, and it is something that Twitter must replicate if its model is to prevail. If Twitter can fine-tune its resonance scale so that promotional, value-deprived advertisements are quickly expelled from the stream, the company may very well be able to entice users to click. It's those clicks that will determine the fate of the platform, so we can only hope that Promoted Tweets is a success. [sponsored tweet img credit: AdAge] ||||| Twitter Inc. will start rolling out advertising to users Tuesday, the four-year-old company's first significant attempt to turn its microblogging service into a profitable business. The company plans to announce a new service called Promoted Tweets, a Twitter spokesman said. The ads will appear at the top of results for searches users conduct on Twitter, a model similar to Google Inc.'s wildly successful search-advertising system. Over time, they may appear in the stream of posts users see when they log into the site. Twitter will start rolling out advertising to users today as it attempts to turn its microblogging service into a profitable business. Stacey Delo talks with Jessica Vascellaro in San Francisco. Plus a Preview of Intel & AMD quarterly earnings. The San Francisco start-up will begin rolling out the ads to 2% to 10% of users Tuesday and more in the coming days, the spokesman said. There will be around 10 initial advertisers, including Starbucks, Virgin America and Best Buy . Advertisers and users have been waiting for years for the hot upstart to settle on a formula for ads. While the company has tens of millions of users and has raised hoards of venture capital, most recently at a 1 billion valuation, it has only recently begun to earn revenue from providing its Tweets to larger Internet companies like Google and Microsoft Corp. Twitter Chief Executive Evan Williams and co-founder Biz Stone have been publicly lukewarm about advertising, suggesting it could irritate users. They emphasized that they were exploring a range of monetization models, including enhanced services for businesses. Advertising executives have been skeptical that Twitter could build a formula that would appeal to advertisers more than Google's search ads or other display or banner ads. For now, Twitter's ad-matching and pricing formula is a work in progress. The company will start by charging marketers per thousand impressions of their ads. Over time, it plans to move to a more complex model, charging based on how users interact with the messages. The Twitter spokesman said it will not show ads that don't receive a certain \\"resonance\\" score, based on factors like how many people clicked on or forwarded the ad. The new feature could appeal to the millions of businesses who have created accounts on the service to share deals and other corporate updates. Today, those brands must get users to follow them to get out their message. Now, they will be able to push their message to users who search any keyword they buy. Write to Jessica E.

Options: - wireroom - kitchen - ocean - hallway - outside The answer is \\"kitchen\\" because A:","completion":"The answer is \\"kitchen\\" because it is common for guests to congregate in the kitchen during social gatherings. This is due to a number of reasons: 1. Food and Drinks: Kitchens are usually the center of food preparation and storage. Guests naturally gravitate towards the food and beverages during a party. This is especially true if the host or hostess is still preparing or serving food while guests arrive. 2. Warmth and Comfort: Kitchens tend to evoke a sense of warmth and comfort, associated with the preparation and sharing of meals. This can make the kitchen a welcoming and familiar space for guests to gather and socialize. 3. Informal Gathering Space: While the living room may be set up for the party, the kitchen often serves as a more casual and informal space. Guests might feel more relaxed and comfortable in the kitchen than in the more formal setting of the living room. 4. Conversation Starter: Being in the kitchen while the mother works can promote conversations around cooking, recipes, and the food being prepared, which makes it an easy ice-breaker for guests who may not know each other well. 5. Proximity to the Host: If the mother is working in the kitchen during the party, guests may want to be near her to offer assistance, chat, or simply provide her with company while she completes her tasks.

Context: And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) Question: After the release of the new AHA guidelines, what is going to happen to the author's patients?

Confirm a positive result with a doctor.","completion":"Title: Taking the Leap - Confirming Pregnancy with a Home Pregnancy Test Introduction Discovering you're pregnant can be a life-changing moment, yet the journey to this profound realization may initially begin in the privacy of your own home. Home pregnancy tests have become widely accessible and provide an affordable, convenient, and confidential method for determining the possibility of pregnancy. In this article, we will walk you through the process of using a home pregnancy test, interpreting the results, deciding if a retest is necessary, and ultimately confirming your pregnancy with a doctor. Step 1: Taking a Home Pregnancy Test Home pregnancy tests detect the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in your urine, which is a hormone produced during pregnancy. The best time to take a home pregnancy test is generally a week after your missed period to ensure the most accurate result. To perform the test, follow these steps: 1. Purchase a home pregnancy test from your local pharmacy or online. 2. Read the instructions provided in the test kit. 3. it is recommended that you take the test in the morning, as this is when your urine has the highest concentration of hCG. 4. Collect a sample of your urine as per the instructions in the test kit. 5. Apply the urine sample to the designated area on the test. 6. Wait for the time specified in the instructions for the test results. 7. Check the results and refer to the test kit's guide to interpret the findings. Step 2: Interpreting the Results Most home pregnancy tests show a positive result by displaying two lines or a '+' symbol. Conversely, a single line or a '-' denotes a negative result. It is crucial to check the results within the time specified, as waiting too long may lead to incorrect or inconclusive readings. Step 3: Deciding If a Retest is Necessary If your test result is negative and you still suspect that you may be pregnant, you can choose to do a retest. Consider doing a retest if: 1. You initially took the test before or too early after your missed period. 2. You did not follow the instructions properly. 3. The test you used has expired or was damaged. Upon retesting, if the result remains negative but pregnancy symptoms persist, consult your doctor to discuss the situation and determine if additional testing is needed. Step 4: Confirming a Positive Result with a Doctor If you receive a positive result from your home pregnancy test, it is crucial to make an appointment with your doctor to confirm the pregnancy. Your doctor will likely conduct further testing, such as a blood test or an ultrasound, to ensure the pregnancy's progress and to provide guidance and support. Conclusion A home pregnancy test is a great first step to discovering whether you are pregnant. However, it is essential to remember that these tests are not infallible, and results may vary. Therefore, trust your instincts and follow up with a healthcare professional for accurate confirmation and continued guidance throughout your pregnancy journey. The path to parenthood starts with one small step, and a home pregnancy test can be the beginning of that remarkable adventure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

This book certainly is not for the beginning trader and is not worth its relatively steep price. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? A:","completion":"This product review conveys a negative sentiment towards the book being discussed. The reviewer expresses disappointment and dissatisfaction in multiple aspects of the book, making it evident that their experience with the product was not a positive one. To break down the points raised in the review and the reasoning behind this conclusion, we can analyze the issues mentioned by the reviewer as follows: 1. First, the reviewer mentions that while the book appears to be an \\"impressive discussion of technical analysis,\\" upon further reading, it fails in accomplishing its core purpose. The reviewer notes that the author does not sufficiently explain how the reader can use the technical tools discussed to improve their day trading skills. This indicates that the content of the book is not as valuable or practical as it initially seems, imparting a negative sentiment. 2. Second, the reviewer states that the book is not suitable for beginning traders. This narrows down the book's target audience, which can be perceived negatively by potential buyers who are new to day trading. By expressing that the book falls short of meeting the needs and expectations of a beginner audience segment, the reviewer conveys disappointment with the book, contributing to an overall negative sentiment. 3. Finally, the reviewer comments on the relatively high price of the book, indicating that they do not believe it is worth the amount being charged. This point underscores the dissatisfaction with the book's content, as the reviewer implies that the information provided does not justify the cost of purchase. Taken together, these elements of the review create an impression of buyer's remorse, as the title suggests, and convey a negative sentiment towards the book. The review highlights perceived shortcomings in the content, limited audience appeal, and unfavorable pricing, demonstrating an unfavorable opinion of the product overall."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: I had this one guy, who enjoyed being a part time bully and part time neutral to me. To say the least he was annoying. He'd take the liberty to hide my backpack, borrow my books without consent, doodle scandalous stuff on my notebooks with a pen and yada yada. So one day, I was showing this cool trick I learned on an anatomy program on the TV to a couple of classmates who used to sit around me. The thing was that you can't flex your ring finger upwards if you put your middle finger under the palm (try that) We were all kids, and soon everyone in the class started staring at us weirdos looking laughing at out hands. The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed. And then, I saw our teacher walking up the corridor, just a couple paces behind the class door. So, I asked him (the bully) if he wanted to see another trick and to that he nodded a big yes. Cool, What I did was, that I grabbed his right arm by the thumb and put it on my throat right above the larynx. Then I quickly shifted my grip to his wrist. He without batting an eye, asked what I was doing, but then I started beating the desk with my other hand and made squeaking noises while pushing his hand against my throat harder with every turning head. And voilà! Every one in the class (including the teacher) thought he was smothering me. After a few ifs and buts between him and the teacher, he was summoned at the principal’s chambers, from where, later he was sent home, where presumably judging from the look on his face for the next few days, he was beat to crap by his folks. And after that, never was I ever bothered by anyone in the school.(^^) How does the bully probably feel about his past actions now that he no longer bothers anyone?

It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - A gill is a respiratory organ found in many aquatic organisms that extracts dissolved oxygen from water and excretes carbon dioxide. The gills of some species, such as hermit crabs, have adapted to allow respiration on land provided they are kept moist. The microscopic structure of a gill presents a large surface area to the external environment. - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - The Southern Hemisphere is the half sphere of Earth which is south of the equator. It contains all or parts of five continents (Antarctica, Australia, about 90% of South America, the southern third of Africa, and several southern islands off the continental mainland of Asia), four oceans (Indian, South Atlantic, Southern, and South Pacific) and most of the Pacific Islands in Oceania. Its surface is 80.9% water, compared with 60.7% water in the case of the Northern Hemisphere, and it contains 32.7% of Earth's land. - Crayfish, also known as crawfish, crawdads, freshwater lobsters, mountain lobsters, mudbugs or yabbies, are freshwater crustaceans resembling small lobsters, to which they are related; taxonomically, they are members of the superfamilies Astacoidea and Parastacoidea. They breathe through feather-like gills. Some species are found in brooks and streams where there is running fresh water, while others thrive in swamps, ditches, and rice paddies. Most crayfish cannot tolerate polluted water, although some species such as \\"Procambarus clarkii\\" are hardier. Crayfish feed on living and dead animals and plants. - The South Pole, also known as the Geographic South Pole or Terrestrial South Pole, is one of the two points where the Earth's axis of rotation intersects its surface. It is the southernmost point on the surface of the Earth and lies on the opposite side of the Earth from the North Pole. - Auckland is a city in the North Island of New Zealand. It is the most populous urban area in the country. Auckland has a population of , which constitutes percent of New Zealand's population. It is part of the wider Auckland Regionthe area governed by the Auckland Councilwhich also includes outlying rural areas and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf, resulting in a total population of . Auckland also has the largest Polynesian population of any city in the world. The Mori language name for Auckland is or , meaning \\"Tmaki with a hundred lovers\\", in reference to the desirability of its fertile land at the hub of waterways in all directions. It has also been called karana, the Mori enunciation of \\"Auckland\\". - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago. - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - The North Island or Te Ika-a-Mui (\\"Mori\\") is one of the two main islands of New Zealand, separated from the slightly larger but much less populous South Island by Cook Strait. The island's area is , making it the world's 14th-largest island. It has a population of - Antarctica (US English , UK English or ) is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At , it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula. - In geology, a supercontinent is the assembly of most or all of Earth's continental blocks or cratons to form a single large landmass. However, the definition of a supercontinent can be ambiguous. Many earth scientists, such as P.F. Hoffman (1999), use the term \\"supercontinent\\" to mean \\"a clustering of nearly all continents\\". This definition leaves room for interpretation when labeling a continental body and is easier to apply to Precambrian times. Using the first definition provided here, Gondwana (a.k.a. Gondwanaland) is not considered a supercontinent, because the landmasses of Baltica, Laurentia and Siberia also existed at the same time but physically separate from each other. The landmass of Pangaea is the collective name describing all of these continental masses when they were in proximity to one another. This would classify Pangaea as a supercontinent. According to the definition by Rogers and Santosh (2004), a supercontinent does not exist today. Supercontinents have assembled and dispersed multiple times in the geologic past (see table). The positions of continents have been accurately determined back to the early Jurassic. However, beyond , continental positions are much less certain. - Solomon Islands is a sovereign country consisting of six major islands and over 900 smaller islands in Oceania lying to the east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu and covering a land area of . The country's capital, Honiara, is located on the island of Guadalcanal. The country takes its name from the Solomon Islands archipelago, which is a collection of Melanesian islands that also includes the North Solomon Islands (part of Papua New Guinea), but excludes outlying islands, such as Rennell and Bellona, and the Santa Cruz Islands. - Wellington is the capital city and second most populous urban area of New Zealand, with residents. It is at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region, which also includes the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa. As the nation's capital city, the New Zealand Government and Parliament, Supreme Court and most of the civil service are based in the city. - Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km). In terms of social and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Southern Brazil and sometimes Paraguay. - Tonga (or ; Tongan: \\"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about scattered over of the southern Pacific Ocean. It has a population of 103,000 people of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu. - Parastacidae is the family of freshwater crayfish found in the southern hemisphere . The family is a classic Gondwana - distributed taxon , with extant members in South America , Madagascar , Australia , New Zealand and New Guinea , and extinct taxa also in Antarctica . - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats. - The Antarctic (US English , UK English or and or ) is a polar region, specifically the region around the Earth's South Pole, opposite the Arctic region around the North Pole. The Antarctic comprises in the strict sense the continent of Antarctica and the island territories located on the Antarctic Plate. In a broader sense the Antarctic region include the ice shelves, waters, and island territories in the Southern Ocean situated south of the Antarctic Convergence, a zone approximately wide varying in latitude seasonally. The region covers some 20% of the Southern Hemisphere, of which 5.5% (14 million km) is the surface area of the Antarctic continent itself. All of the land and ice shelves south of 60°S latitude are administrated under the Antarctic Treaty System.

In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether PersonX needs what is mentioned in the Tail before the Head or not. Here need is a precondition for PersonX to achieve the event.

Since forgetting to set the alarm could lead to PersonX oversleeping and potentially being late, it can be a contributing factor or cause for being late. However, there can be many other reasons for being late, like traffic, delays in public transportation, and unexpected interruptions, which do not depend on forgetting to set the alarm. Therefore, the Tail is not a necessary precondition for the Head event. Answer: No"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

With five minutes played, both sets of supporters took part in a minute's applause in memory of McBride. A scrappy first half eventually livened up in the final five minutes as both sides went close to breaking the deadlock.

The group consists of Ben, the clumsy but determined leader; Chloe, the tech expert and hacker; James, the explosives guru; and Sofia, the level-headed strategist. Together, they plan to steal a priceless ancient artifact known as The Jade Empress, which is at the center of a prestigious exhibition. Ben, fueled by a long-standing desire to impress his father, who is an accomplished art thief, has planned the heist down to the last detail. The gang bonds over late-night strategy sessions and training montages as they prepare for the big day. Act 2: The Heist The day arrives, and as expected, nothing goes according to plan. The group skillfully avoids numerous security measures, including state-of-the-art camera systems, lasers, and armed guards, all while hilariously struggling with their own personal quirks. Sofia must navigate the crew through tense situations, Chloe encounters a challenging cybersecurity system, and James fumbles with his explosives. Despite their misadventures, the group finally manages to reach the Jade Empress, and together, they carefully extract the artifact from its heavily guarded case. The heist seems to be going smoothly until their escape, when disaster strikes. As the team climbs into their getaway truck, Ben, in a fit of excitement, trips on his own shoelace and tumbles out of the truck bed just as Chloe hits the gas. Act 3: The Consequences Ben's fall from the truck alerts the security guards, who quickly catch up to the gang, leading to a high-speed chase through the city. At this point, the team must work together to protect the Jade Empress, which is still in their possession. They outmaneuver the guards while dealing with the hilarity and consequences of Ben's misstep. Amidst the chaos, the crew realizes they must work together more than ever, as each member plays an important role in protecting the artifact. Eventually, the group decides to return the Jade Empress to the museum, realizing the heist was more about bonding and self-discovery than pure profit. The team escapes before the heist is attributed to them. In the end, Ben's father, who was secretly watching the entire time, is impressed by the group's resourcefulness and determination, and the gang celebrates their success as an unlikely family of thieves, ready to tackle their next adventure. The Unraveling Heist perfectly mixes action, comedy, and friendship, resulting in an exhilarating movie experience that proves the bonds of camaraderie can overcome even the most challenging obstacles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Alice Actress Dead at 74 (SANTA MONICA, Calif.) — Beth Howland, the actress best known for her role as a ditzy waitress on the 1970s and ’80s CBS sitcom “Alice,” has died. She was 74. Her husband, actor Charles Kimbrough, told The Associated Press that Howland died Dec. 31 of lung cancer in Santa Monica, California, and there was no announcement, funeral or memorial service. “That was her choice,” he said. Howland was born May 28, 1941, in Boston. At 16, she landed a role on Broadway alongside Dick Van Dyke in “Bye Bye Birdie.” CBS later noticed Howland on stage in the 1970 production of “Company” and brought her to Hollywood for a bit part on “The Mary Tyler Moore Show.” Small roles on “The Love Boat” and “Little House on the Prairie” followed before she was cast as Vera Louise Gorman on “Alice,” a comedy set in an Arizona greasy spoon diner based on the 1974 Martin Scorcese film, “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore.” Howland earned four Golden Globe nominations during the comedy’s 1976-85 run for her performance as the naive Vera. Howland told the AP in a 1979 profile that she was “very shy” and that she saw something of herself in the character. “I’m a little naive sometimes but not as much as Vera. I guess I’m really a cynic,” she said. After “Alice” ended, Howland largely disappeared from television acting, aside from bit parts on series including “Murder, She Wrote” and “Sabrina, the Teenage Witch.” Howland created Tiger Rose Productions with actress Jennifer Warren. The company produced “You Don’t Have to Die,” a 1988 HBO documentary about a boy’s battle against cancer that won an Academy Award for best short-subject documentary. Howland is survived by a daughter from her previous marriage to actor Michael J. Pollard. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"1.

We have the equation: -30*i - 179 - 99 = -98 First, we need to make the numbers on the left side smaller. So, we add 179 and 99: -30*i = -98 + 179 + 99 -30*i = 180 Now, we want to find out what \\"i\\" is. To do that, we have to get rid of the -30 next to it.

It was manufactured in Dundee, Scotland, in the now closed Timex factory. - 3D Monster Maze is a computer game developed from an idea by J.K.Greye and programmed by Malcolm Evans in 1981 for the Sinclair ZX81 platform with the 16 KB memory expansion. The game was initially released by J. K. Greye Software in early 1982 and re-released later the same year by Evans' own startup, New Generation Software. Rendered using low-resolution character block \\"graphics\\", it was one of the first 3D games for a home computer, and the first game incorporating typical elements of the genre that would later be termed survival horror. - The IBM System/360 introduced byte-addressable memory with 8-bit bytes, as opposed to bit-addressable or decimal digit-addressable or word-addressable memory, although its general purpose registers were 32 bits wide, and addresses were contained in the lower 24 bits of those addresses. Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - Escape is an early ZX Spectrum video game developed and released by New Generation Software in 1982 . \`\` Can you ESCAPE from the monsters ? You must search through the maze to find the axe which will enable you to break down the door and ESCAPE . But it is not that easy - the Triceratops hides behind the hedges and the Pteranodon soars over the maze to swoop down upon you '' - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - New Generation Software was a firm best known for the computer games with innovative graphics it produced for the Sinclair ZX81 and ZX Spectrum computers. It was conceived in the spring of 1982 shortly after the lead developer, Malcolm Evans created \\"3D Monster Maze\\" (initially released by J. K.

I find that the Battle of Tours, also known as the Battle of Poitiers, was a critical battle that took place in AD 732. The Muslim forces led by Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi, the governor of Muslim Spain, were advancing into Europe, aiming to conquer the Frankish kingdom. The person who stopped the Muslim advance into Europe at this battle was Charles Martel, also known as Charles the Hammer. He was the ruler of the Frankish kingdom and commanded the Frankish forces that faced the invading Muslim army. In the battle, Charles Martel successfully managed to halt the Muslim advance, ensuring the security of the Frankish kingdom and protecting Europe from further invasion.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -102*x - 215 - 1417 = 0 for x.","completion":"The equation -102*x - 215 - 1417 = 0 can be solved using the principles of basic algebra. The aim is to isolate the variable x on one side of the equation. Let's take it step by step: 1. Combine the constant terms. The equation contains the constant terms -215 and -1417. Adding these two terms together gives -1632. 2. Rewrite the equation. Substituting -1632 for -215 - 1417 into the equation gives -102*x - 1632 = 0. 3. Add +1632 to both sides of the equation to isolate -102*x. Doing so gives -102*x = 1632. 4. Divide each side of the equation by -102 to solve for x. This gives x = 1632 / -102. 5. Simplify the right side of the equation to get the value of x. x = -16. So, the solution to the equation -102*x -215 -1417 = 0 is x = -16. To check that this solution is correct, you can substitute x = -16 back into the original equation and simplify.

These are considered to be clouds that are between 19,500 feet (5,943 meters) and 42,500 feet (12,954 meters). This encompasses cirrus, cirrostratus and cirrocumulus clouds. These clouds tend to be frozen (filled with ice crystals) and have blurry outlines; they are generally thin and wispy to the human eye. Contrails from jet airplanes are also found at this level in the Earth's atmosphere. High clouds produce beautiful red, orange and yellow colors in the sky at sunrise and sunset. Rings of light around the moon or the sun are caused by cirrus clouds. A halo around the sun or moon can suggest rain or snow on the way, especially if accompanied by thickening lower clouds. Cirrus clouds often partially obscure the sun. Cirrus clouds are distinguishable by their thin, white and wispy appearance. They generally reach an altitude above 20,000 feet (6,000 meters). The thinness tends to be due to the frigid winds in the upper atmosphere. Cirrus clouds are made up of ice crystals formed by supercooled water droplets. Cirrus clouds that are sparse and stay that way usually show signs of fair weather. When cirrus clouds change into cirrostratus clouds, wind and precipitation are probably on their way within the next 24-36 hours. Cirrus indicates moisture above; if cirrus changes to altostratus and then stratus, a storm approaches soon. You'll see cirrus clouds as a warm front advances. The direction in which cirrus clouds move will usually tell you the direction of air movement, namely the weather coming your way. Cirrus clouds are sometimes referred to as horse's or mare's tails because they curl out like a horse's tail. These clouds are often found in rows and they look like little puffed-up ripples. Some people think these clouds look like fish scales. The broken or rippled nature of these clouds is caused by air turbulence; it's bad news for anyone flying through them, but great news on the ground because these clouds usually mean that the weather is going to stay the same with no major sudden changes. These clouds tend to lack shape and have a hazy appearance. They usually spread across much of the sky. They suggest moisture is present in a large part of the sky, indicating that rain might be due soon. Thicker cirrostratus clouds can come from the top of an advancing storm system. Cirrostratus clouds are made up of ice crystals as well, but unlike cirrus clouds they can cover the entire sky and be up to several-thousand feet thick. Cirrostratus clouds are sheetlike and nearly transparent. Although these are machine made by jet airplanes, contrails can help you to know the weather in the heights above. Contrails are condensation, formed when the jet's warm exhaust mixes with the very cool air surrounding the jet in the upper atmosphere. If the contrail disappears quickly, or you see a jet with no contrail, this means that the upper atmosphere you're observing is dry. On a lovely day, you can usually take this as a sign that the weather is going to remain fine for a while. On the other hand, if the contrail is obvious for a time, is long and spreads, the upper atmosphere you're observing is wet. Grab your coat and umbrella because the weather will probably change soon, if it hasn't already. Summary:","completion":"High clouds are found between 19,500 and 42,500 feet in the sky, and they are made of ice crystals. There are different types, like cirrus, cirrostratus, and cirrocumulus clouds. Cirrus clouds are thin, white, and wispy, looking like a horse's tail. Cirrocumulus clouds are puffy and look like fish scales. Cirrostratus clouds are hazy and cover most of the sky. Contrails are made by airplanes and can help us know the weather too.

Movie title: Life Is Hot in Cracktown Movie plot: The film intertwines several unsettling stories of people in a Manhattan neighborhood ravaged by crack cocaine.[1][2] Romeo, a 14-year-old criminal, is the leader of a gang. In the beginning of the movie, he lures his girlfriend, Debbie, to a secluded alley where he and another gang member gang rape her. He leads his gang into robbing and torturing a very sick pensioner, and then steps up to doing a murder-for-hire at the behest of a local drug dealer, unaware of the enormous risks. Manny and Concetta, a young couple, are desperately trying to rise out of poverty and care for their sick baby. Manny works two jobsâthe front desk of a drug-riddled flop house by day and the cash register of a frequently-robbed bodega at night.

Marybeth is a transgender woman who makes a bit of money as a street prostitute to pay for surgery, and Benny is into very low-paying burglaries. Their principal source of drugs is a well-off transvestite, Ridley, who is looking to follow in Marybeth's footsteps. Young Willy and younger Susie are the much-neglected children of an addict named Mommy, who makes them sleep on the floor of their one-room apartment. Mommy's current boyfriend, a hot-tempered addict named Chaz, makes the children beg on the street for his drug money.

We need to find the value of \\"m\\" in this equation: 8*m + 30171 = 30291. Let's break it down step by step. First, we want to get rid of the 30171 on the left side of the equation. To do that, we will subtract 30171 from both sides: 8*m + 30171 - 30171 = 30291 - 30171 Now, the equation looks like this: 8*m = 120 We are closer! Now we just need to find out what number we need to multiply by 8 to get 120. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 8: 8*m / 8 = 120 / 8 Which simplifies to: m = 15 There you go!

Answer:","completion":"To answer the question of whether this review would increase or decrease the chances of me buying the product, I would first evaluate the content of the review. Step 1: Identify the subject of the review In this case, the review seems to be focused on a book authored by a person named Coulter, who is associated with the American Right. Step 2: Evaluate the pros and cons mentioned in the review The review does not mention any positive aspects of the book. The reviewer claims that the book contains false statements and lies, and the footnotes are not reliable. The reviewer also suggests that the author's arguments do not hold up to scrutiny. It seems that the reviewer is critical of the American Right and has a negative opinion of the book. Step 3: Consider the reviewer's perspective It's important to keep in mind the reviewer's perspective while evaluating the review. In this case, the reviewer seems to have a strong bias against the American Right, as they mention negative opinions about them several times throughout the review. Step 4: Consider the relevance of the review to my purchasing decision Since the review mainly focuses on criticizing the American Right and the author's affiliation with them, rather than providing detailed information about the book's content or quality, it may not be entirely helpful in making a decision about purchasing the product. However, the reviewer does point out that the book contains false statements and lies, which may raise concerns about its accuracy and credibility. Answer: Overall, this review would likely decrease the chances of me buying the product, primarily due to the concerns raised about the book's credibility and accuracy based on the false statements mentioned.

You see, we all have two kidneys and they help us filter out the bad stuff from our bodies, like when you use a strainer to separate your toys from the sand in your sandbox. Now, Dr. Baker was supposed to take out something called an adrenal gland, which is a little part of our body that makes important stuff called hormones to help us do different things. But instead, he took out Ms. Knapp's healthy kidney. When she found out, she was really upset and now she's asking the doctor and his practice to help fix things by suing them, which means she's taken them to court for doing the wrong thing. Ms. Knapp had to get another operation later in a different hospital to get her adrenal gland removed correctly. Because of this, she's had to spend a lot of money, and she's also dealing with some tough times like feeling very tired, being in pain and even feeling sad. Plus, because she's not well, she can't do a lot of things she used to do like cleaning and maintaining her house, so she had to get others to help her.

Plagued by a convoluted plot, mediocre performances, inconsistent visual effects, and forgettable dialogue, this movie is a cinematic mess that leaves audiences more confused than entertained. Despite the all-star cast and the elaborate marketing campaign, it seems the creators seemingly misunderstood the most basic elements that make movies enjoyable. Firstly, the plot of \\"Of Fools and Fractures\\" is as complicated as it is disorganized, leaving the audience struggling to keep up with the story. To put it mildly, there is not a single moment of clarity or coherence, as the viewer is dragged through a never-ending series of twists and turns that ultimately grossly diminish the emotional investment. Characters appear, disappear, and reappear with no clear motivation, and the film is abundant in irrelevant subplots that leave the viewer longing for simpler times. The central theme is bewildering, comically leaving the audience questioning the director's basic understanding of narrative structure. In addition to the story's structural issues, the performances in \\"Of Fools and Fractures\\" are far from the actors' crowning achievements. The all-star cast initially appears to promise an engaging ride, but it quickly becomes evident that the talent is grossly misused. With characters so underwritten, the actors are given little room to showcase their skills, turning even enchanting actors into stale and bland shadows of themselves. Their abrupt and unnatural interactions with each other do little to help either, further highlighting the lack of chemistry that pervades throughout the movie. Visually, the film seems to be stuck in a state of perpetual limbo between low-budget and blockbuster. Rife with visual inconsistencies, it is hard to ignore the glaring disparity between the high-quality set pieces and the sub-par computer-generated imagery (CGI). It is baffling that a movie with such a ample budget would choose to cut corners on one of its most critical elements. These visual hiccups frequently destroy any semblance of immersion, leaving the audience disenchanted in their seats. Lastly, one would hope that dialogue could salvage something, anything, from this shipwreck of a movie, but unfortunately, that too falls flat. Overflowing with clichéd expressions and tired tropes, the script leaves audiences impatiently waiting for a clever moment that never arrives. With such forgettable lines, even the most unassailable actors can only deliver mediocre performances, further contributing to the film's downfall. In conclusion, \\"Of Fools and Fractures\\" fails miserably to reach the heights it ambitiously strives for. Hindered by its chaotic plot, lackluster performances, inconsistent visual effects, and stale dialogue, the movie remains a cinematic catastrophe, garnering shuttered laughs when the intention was to inspire indelible thrills. If one is seeking an enjoyable and memorable movie-going experience, it is best to avert one's eyes from this train wreck and look elsewhere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which Bond film starring Roger Moore had scenes filmed at the Nene Valley Railway What is the answer?","completion":"The Bond film starring Roger Moore that had scenes filmed at the Nene Valley Railway is \\"Octopussy.\\" Released in 1983, it is the thirteenth film in the James Bond series and the sixth to star Roger Moore as the British secret agent, James Bond. \\"Octopussy\\" is directed by John Glen, produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, and written by George MacDonald Fraser, Richard Maibaum, and Michael G. Wilson. The film's plot revolves around Bond's mission to stop a plot by a mysterious woman, Octopussy, and a rogue Soviet general who plan on using a stolen Fabergé egg and a nuclear warhead to provoke a war between the East and West. The Nene Valley Railway, located near Peterborough in Cambridgeshire, England, played an integral part in the film as the location of the climactic train sequence. The railway is a preserved heritage railway that runs along a picturesque section of the River Nene, and it was an ideal setting for the thrilling action scenes involving trains, helicopters, and other vehicles. In the movie, Bond pursues the villains on the train through various European locations. While the characters in the film traverse across Germany, the entire train sequence was predominantly filmed at the Nene Valley Railway. Some of the memorable action sequences in this portion of the film include Bond's fight with the knife-throwing twins, Mischka and Grischka, and Bond's daring leap from a speeding car onto the train. The use of the Nene Valley Railway in \\"Octopussy\\" highlights the importance of utilizing unique and scenic locations to create memorable action sequences in the James Bond franchise. These visually impressive and thrilling set pieces are part of what makes the series so enduringly popular. In conclusion, the Roger Moore-starring Bond film that had scenes filmed at the Nene Valley Railway is \\"Octopussy.\\" This 1983 installment in the series is notable for its action-packed train sequence, which takes advantage of the railway's picturesque setting to create a memorable and exciting spectacle."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: What happens when they realize their problems? Their lives come crashing down. Answer:","completion":"Title: Unraveling Threads Overview: \\"Unraveling Threads\\" is a powerful drama that explores the lives of three interconnected individuals who find their worlds crumbling as they finally confront the problems they've long ignored. Amid the chaos, their tangled relationships expose a gripping web of addiction, betrayal, and trauma. The film expertly navigates the complexities of the human experience as it weaves an intricate narrative where love, revenge, and forgiveness become deeply entwined. Plot: Act 1: The movie opens with a brief introduction to the three main characters: Sarah, an aspiring writer who's been struggling with depression; James, a successful entrepreneur with a hidden alcohol addiction; and Rebecca, a therapist working on unresolved trauma from her past. The lives of these three characters seem ordinary at the surface, but underlying problems threaten to shatter their facades. Sarah is working a stagnant job in a publishing house, barely making ends meet. She dreams of escaping the monotony and becoming a successful author. James, on the other hand, carries the weight of his family's expectations, and his addiction to alcohol has been worsening as he secretly suppresses guilt from a past accident. Lastly, Rebecca is haunted by the memories of an abusive ex-partner, preventing her from fully connecting with her patients and moving forward in her life. Act 2: The three characters' lives initially intertwine when Sarah joins a support group for depression, led by Rebecca. At the same time, James, seeking a therapist for his addiction, starts sessions with Rebecca as well. Unknown to each of them, Rebecca begins to recognize the interconnection between James' addiction and Sarah's depression. As Sarah and James attend Rebecca's group sessions and personal appointments, they begin to address their issues and develop a supportive friendship with each other. Slowly, they become aware of the sense of emptiness in their lives, stemming from past mistakes, personal traumas, and the inability to confront their problems. Act 3: Sarah discovers a manuscript in her apartment written by her long-lost father, which tells a story eerily similar to James' guilt-ridden past. As they delve deeper, Sarah and James learn that their lives are more connected than they initially thought. This shocking revelation threatens to destroy their newfound support system, with Sarah accusing James of causing her father's death and Rebecca feeling conflicted in her role as a therapist. Their lives start crumbling as they confront the realities they long ignored. Sarah's depression spirals out of control, James' addiction worsens, and Rebecca begins to crumble under the weight of her own past trauma and her responsibility to her patients. Act 4: As the characters face the darkest moments of their journey, a turning point emerges: a confrontation between James and Sarah over their shared tragic past. In a raw, emotional exchange, they begin to understand the destructive nature of unresolved grief and guilt. This mutual realization allows them to start the process of forgiveness and healing. Sarah, inspired by her father's manuscript, quits her job and begins writing with renewed determination. James attends rehab and starts mending relationships with his family. Rebecca, after recognizing her inability to fully heal herself, seeks therapy to confront her trauma head-on and rediscovers her passion for helping others. Epilogue: Months later, Sarah and James reconcile their friendship and continue attending the support group, now both on the path to recovery. Rebecca has made significant progress in her own healing and continues her dedicated work as a therapist. The film closes with the three characters sitting together in a session, each taking the first steps toward rebuilding their lives and embracing the possibility of hope in the chaos."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Where does Nicky have to go on his quest? Title: Little Nicky Movie plot: In this very unusual comedy, the devil meets an angel at a certain heaven-hell mixer; both drunk, they have a rendez-vois that produces three kids who somehow end up living in hell with the devil. The movie starts with a picture of hell - a guy falls off a tree spying on a woman taking off her clothes in her own house, ends up in hell. The three kids - Adrian, Cassius, and Nicky - are each very different. Cassius and Adrian live up to their rep of being the devil's children, while Nicky isn't 'into evil,' and is shown as a 'papa's boy.' The movie starts with Cassius and Adrian conspiring to take over Earth by leaving hell and messing up the balance between good and evil, thus taking power over everyone in the process. Their departure 'freezes the fire' through which souls enter hell, however, and the devil begins to fall apart, since no new souls can enter. He sets his only son left, Nicky, on a quest to go to Earth, find his brothers, and trap them in a silver flask, since they have to return to hell at the same time. Nicky hesitantly takes his father's orders and, with the help of a talking dog his father asked to help, settles into an apartment with a wannabe actor. He's soon found by two devil-worshiping guys who help him retrieve his flask as it's stolen by a petty thief. The guys befriend him and stand by his side against his brothers. Nicky also meets a girl he gets infatuated with, though he doesn't tell her the truth about him yet. She helps get his flask back from the thief, and they... hit it off. He's able to track down one of his brothers - Cassius - as he possesses the referee at a Globetrotters game. Adrian turns out to be far more witty and doesn't fall for a trap Nicky and all his new friends set up for him at a subway station.

The available options are: 1. Lawrence always tended to take things wrong. 2. Steven always tended to take things wrong. Let's analyze both options: Option 1 would imply that Lawrence is hesitant because of his own tendency to misunderstand things. This, however, doesn't explain why he would specifically be hesitant when speaking to Steven, as the same reasoning would apply to any person Lawrence interacts with. Option 2 offers a clearer reason for Lawrence's hesitance in speaking to Steven. If Steven is known for frequently misunderstanding things, then it would make sense that Lawrence would be cautious when speaking to Steven to avoid any miscommunications or conflicts that may arise.

It is simple and easy to make, and perfect for anyone who loves to work with glue and paint. Here's what you will need: Toilet paper roll Blue and yellow paint Black and yellow paper Black marker 1 – 2 large googly eyes Glue Paintbrushes Newspaper Masking tape or paper tape Black yarn or pipe cleaners This will make your minion nice and solid. If you cannot find a toilet paper roll, try cutting a paper towel roll in half, or into thirds. This will make the domed shape of the minion's head. This will cover the top of the head and make it smooth. Keep covering it with tape from different angles until you can't see the newspaper anymore. Make sure that you are using masking tape or paper tape, or the paint won't stick to it. Regular scotch tape is too smooth. The yellow part will be the body of the minion and the blue part will be the overalls. Use a thin brush to paint two \\"n\\" shapes across from each other, right above the blue part of the tube. This will make the straps. Start by placing the minion down on a sheet of black paper. Trace around the minion using a pencil. Take the minion off the paper and draw an \\"m\\" right above the circle. Make sure that the bottom of the \\"m\\" is touching the top of the circle. Also, make sure that the \\"m\\" is the same width as the circle. The arches from the \\"m\\" will make the shoes. Cut the circle out; be sure to include the \\"m\\" shape. Glue the minion down onto the feet. Use school glue or tacky glue to line the bottom rim of the toilet paper roll. Place a few drops of glue onto the newspaper inside the minion as well. Press the minion down onto the feet. The arches from the \\"m\\" should be sticking out from under the minion, like shoes. If you want, you can paint or color the hands black to look like gloves. Minion arms are shaped like long, skinny rectangles; they have three loops at one end, sort of like a three-leaf clover. Fold the bottom of each arm by 1 centimeter. Put a drop of glue onto the folded part, and press it against the minion, just below the shoulder strap. Glue one or two large googly eyes down for the eyes. Use a marker to draw around each eye. This will make the frame of the goggles. Next, use a marker to draw a line going around the entire head, from one side of the goggles to the other. This will be the strap. If your minion has two eyes, make sure that the googly eyes are touching each other. Minion eyes are very close together. Use a black marker to draw the mouth. You can also use it to draw the buttons and pocket on the overalls. In the movie, the minions had a letter \\"G\\" on the front pocket of the overalls. You can use that, or use the first letter of your name to make the minion your personal minion.

Here are possible answers to this question: - shoreline - coast - coastal area - lake - manhattan I believe the correct choice is \\"shoreline\\", here's why: The answer is:","completion":"\\"shoreline\\" A bay is a body of water that is partially enclosed by land, typically on three sides. It is usually smaller than a gulf but larger than a cove, and it connects to a larger body of water like an ocean, sea, or lake. The shoreline is the line where the land meets the water, forming the boundary between the land and the water within the bay. Here's a breakdown of the other possibilities and why they are not the correct answer: - Coast: A coast refers to the land along the edge of a sea, ocean, or another large body of water. While a bay may be part of a coast, it is the shoreline that specifically separates the bay from the water. - Coastal area: A coastal area is a region where the land meets the sea, typically associated with a broader geographic region. While a bay may be located within a coastal area, it is still the shoreline that forms the boundary between the bay and the water. - Lake: A lake is a large body of water surrounded by land, generally not connected to an ocean or sea. As a bay is an inlet of a larger body of water, it is different from a lake and therefore not the correct answer. - Manhattan: Manhattan is an island borough of New York City and not related to the geographical features that separate a bay from the water.

Last sentence: Dot was now considered the cool mom.","completion":"Once upon a time, in a sleepy little town, there lived a woman named Dorothy, fondly known as 'Dot' by her friends and family. Dot was a deeply loving mother of two teenagers, Sarah and Kevin. She tried her best to provide them with a great life, and she took care of every little detail, from preparing their lunches to driving them to school when the weather was bad. However, Dot felt the world was changing around her, and she didn't feel like she belonged anymore. Throughout the years, her teenagers felt increasingly distant from the life Dot knew. The once intimate family dinners were replaced with busy schedules and their heads buried in their smartphones, leaving Dot feeling increasingly isolated. One day, at her regular book club meeting, Dot overheard a conversation about a new community center that had recently opened, offering a variety of classes and workshops for people of all ages. Intrigued by the idea of learning and participating in a new activity, Dot thought it might be a way to bridge the gap with her children. Dot carefully perused the course catalog, trying to find something both interesting and exciting. That's when the announcement for a skateboarding workshop caught her eye. \\"Why not?\\", she thought. Skateboarding had always been something Dot admired from a distance, a sport that represented courage, freedom, and self-expression. Best of all, both her children loved it too. Dot knew it would be quite a challenge for a woman in her 40s, but she was determined to give it her all. The next week, Dot found herself at the skatepark, dressed in a daring pair of jeans and a new leather jacket, looking every bit the cool mom she wanted to be. The skateboarding instructor, a talented young woman named Angie, took Dot under her wing and guided her through the basics. With every lesson, Dot fell more and more in love with the sport, and before she knew it, she was skateboarding alongside her children. It didn't take long for Sarah and Kevin to notice their mom's new hobby and, to their surprise, they found her efforts genuinely impressive. They began to invite her to their skateboarding sessions, introducing her to their friends and fellow skaters. Sarah and Kevin were oddly proud of their mom and enjoyed these moments of connection as Dot began to learn the ins and outs of the skateboarding community. Their admiration for Dot grew when she managed to learn a complicated trick called the \\"kickflip\\" after months of practice and determination. Despite the challenges that came Dot's way, she persevered, showing her children that age was just a number, and it was never too late to learn something new. Word soon spread across the sleepy little town about the incredible skateboarding mom who took risks and defied expectations. The younger generation began to see Dot as more than just a mother; she was an inspiration and a representation of the boundlessness of human spirit. Over time, Sarah and Kevin's friends began referring to her as the \\"cool mom,\\" not only because of her skateboarding prowess but because of her approach to life—fearless, spirited, and open to new experiences. Dot was a living embodiment of youthfulness and a reminder to never say never. Embracing the world around them, Dot and her children grew closer together, sharing a love for a sport that would create memories that would last a lifetime. Through her courage to step out of her comfort zone and into a whole new world, Dot was now considered the cool mom."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

She's exposing a growing billion-dollar industry, through the eyes of victims and those on the frontlines of the fight against modern-day slavery. Groups such as the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women have strongly opposed the move. It wrote an open letter to Amnesty carrying the names of such Oscar-winning actresses as Kate Winslet, Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway and Emma Thompson as well as those of activists and sex trade survivors. Esohe Aghatise, anti-trafficking manager at Equality Now, told CNN: \\"It is a matter of deep regret that Amnesty has chosen to support the powerful sex trade barons who exploit the weak and poor and has refused to listen to the voice of survivors. It has ignored international law and has ignored the evidence from countries which have decriminalized brothel keeping, pimping and buying sex.\\" But Catherine Murphy, policy adviser at Amnesty, said she believes the rights group's policy was being misinterpreted. \\"There's a lot of misunderstanding about our proposal. What decriminalizing talks about is the laws that are used to criminalize adult consensual sex work, or selling of sex among consensual adults,\\" Murphy said. \\"It does not mean the removal of all laws that deal with exploitation, abuse, trafficking, involvement of children. Those laws are absolutely needed and are still absolutely relevant within a decriminalized system. We would never advocate for that, absolutely not.\\" She said that one of the group's main findings in a two-year consultation is the \\"antagonistic relationship, often, between police and sex workers,\\" which Amnesty hopes will be alleviated if countries choose to follow its proposal. \\"This is a historic day for Amnesty International,\\" Shetty said in the statement. \\"It was not a decision that was reached easily or quickly and we thank all our members from around the world, as well as all the many groups we consulted, for their important contribution to this debate. \\"They have helped us reach an important decision that will shape this area of our human rights work going forward.\\" ||||| It’s happening here.

A discarded bra lies on the ground outside an informal bar that allegedly employed sex workers after a government raid in La Pampa, Peru, on May 16, 2014. Rodrigo Abd—AP In a landmark decision Tuesday, Amnesty International voted to recommend the full decriminalization of sex work and prostitution in order to protect the human rights of sex workers. The resolution recommends a policy that would decriminalize all aspects of adult, consensual sex work, while still classifying coercion into sex work or having sex with a minor as a major human rights violation. The resolution is intended to protect adult sex workers from stigma and abuse by decriminalizing aspects of sex work including buying sex, pimping and operating a brothel. \\"Sex workers are one of the most marginalized groups in the world who in most instances face constant risk of discrimination, violence and abuse,\\" said Amnesty International Secretary General Salil Shetty in a statement. \\"Our global movement paved the way for adopting a policy for the protection of the human rights of sex workers which will help shape Amnesty International’s future work on this important issue.\\" Amnesty International doesn't have the power to make or enforce laws, but as an international human rights organization Amnesty has been influential on some issues like lobbying against the death penalty and getting political prisoners released. Amnesty says the new policy on sex work was based on research from the World Health Organization, UNAIDS and UN Women. But some are not happy with the idea of decriminalizing all aspects of the sex trade, arguing that the move would expand the sex industry, and sex trafficking would grow with it. Critics agree with Amnesty that sex workers themselves shouldn't face legal consequences, but argue that pimps and sex buyers should. \\"By calling for the decriminalization of all facets of commercial sex, including sex- buying, pimping, and brothel-owning, Amnesty is saying they value the rights of exploiters over the exploited,\\" says Ian Kitterman, policy specialist for Demand Abolition, a group that aims to abolish sex trafficking by ending the demand for paid sex, in a statement. \\"I fully agree with their belief that more must be done to protect those sold in the sex trade, but it’s equally critical to hold accountable sex buyers, pimps, and traffickers who perpetuate this predatory industry.\\" He added that many people in sex trade are not there by choice, but by manipulation, coercion or lack of options. Former President Jimmy Carte r sent Amnesty delegates a personal letter urging them to reject the proposal on these grounds, and feminists including Lena Dunham, Meryl Streep and Gloria Steinem signed a letter to the same effect. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Amnesty International has decided to recommend the full decriminalization of sex work and prostitution in order to protect the human rights of sex workers.

To solve for 'f', we need to get all the terms with 'f' on one side and the numbers without 'f' on the other side. First, let's add '50*f' to both sides of the equation. This will help us eliminate 'f' from the right side of the equation: -47*f + 9 + 50*f = -50*f + 50*f Now, combine the 'f' terms on the left side: (-47*f + 50*f) + 9 = 0 (3*f) + 9 = 0 Now let's subtract '9' from both sides to isolate the term with 'f': (3*f) + 9 - 9 = 0 - 9 3*f = -9 Lastly, let's divide both sides of the equation by '3' to get the value of 'f': 3*f/3 = -9/3 f = -3 So, the solution to the math problem is f = -3."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer the following question: Information: - In dipterous insects, halteres (singular halter or haltere) are minute dumbbell-shaped organs that have been modified from hindwings to provide a means of encoding body rotations during flight. Halteres are rapidly oscillated simultaneously with the wings, allowing them to experience forces resulting from body rotations. If the body of the insect rotates about one of its three axes (yaw, pitch or roll), the rotation exerts a force on the vibrating halteres this is known as the Coriolis effect (see below). The insect detects this force with sensory organs called campaniform sensilla and chordotonal organs located at the base of the halteres and uses this information to interpret and correct its position in space. Halteres act as a balance and guidance system by providing rapid feedback to the wing-steering muscles, as well as those responsible for stabilizing the head. This is what allows flies to perform their fast acrobatic maneuvers. - The Streblidae are flies in the superfamily Hippoboscoidea, and together with their relatives the Nycteribiidae, are known as bat flies. They are winged or wingless ectoparasites of bats, and often have long legs. They appear to be host-specific, with different species of bat flies occurring only on particular species of bat hosts, sometimes with multiple species of flies sharing a host bat. - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans. - Nycteribiidae of the true fly superfamily Hippoboscoidea are known as \`\` bat flies '' , together with their close relatives the Streblidae . As the latter do not seem to be a monophyletic group , it is conceivable to unite all bat flies in a single family . They are flattened , spiderlike flies without eyes or wings , and are seldom encountered by general collectors , as they almost never leave the bodies of their hosts . Both males and females take blood meals , thus they qualify as real parasites . Most species are highly host - specific . The family is primarily found in the Old World tropics ; a few of the 274 known species occur in the Neotropics and in Europe . - Hippoboscoidea is a superfamily of the Calyptratae. The flies in this superfamily are blood-feeding obligate parasites of their hosts. Four families are often placed here: - True flies are insects of the order Diptera, the name being derived from the Greek \\"di\\" = two, and \\"ptera\\" = wings. Insects of this order use only a single pair of wings to fly, the hindwings being reduced to club-like balancing organs known as halteres. Diptera is a large order containing an estimated 1,000,000 species including horse-flies, crane flies, hoverflies and others, although only about 125,000 species have been described. - Bats are mammals of the order Chiroptera (from the - \\"cheir\\", \\"hand\\" and - \\"pteron\\", \\"wing\\") whose forelimbs form webbed wings, making them the only mammals naturally capable of true and sustained flight. By contrast, other mammals said to fly, such as flying squirrels, gliding possums, and colugos, can only glide for short distances. Bats do not flap their entire forelimbs, as birds do, but instead flap their spread-out digits, which are very long and covered with a thin membrane or patagium. - Calyptratae is a subsection of Schizophora in the insect order Diptera, commonly referred to as the calyptrate muscoids (or simply calyptrates). It consists of those flies which possess a calypter that covers the halteres, among which are some of the most familiar of all flies, such as the house fly.

A. barn B. house C. window sill D. humane society E. comfortable chair The best answer is","completion":"The best answer is C. window sill, but there is more to consider when finding the perfect spot for a cat to soak up sunlight. Let's explore each of these options in detail: A. Barn While a barn can provide some shelter and warmth, it may not consistently provide direct sunlight for a cat to soak up. Barns are often built with practical purposes in mind, such as housing livestock and storing farm equipment. They may have few windows or openings, limiting the amount of sunlight that can stream inside. Moreover, barns can be dusty, dirty, or filled with potential hazards for a cat. Therefore, a barn is not the ideal location for a cat to enjoy sunlight. B. House A house can be a good option for a cat to soak up sunlight, but it depends on the specific house and its layout. Some houses may not provide consistent sunlight due to their design or position. Additionally, if a house doesn't have suitable windows or doors that allow sunlight to stream inside, a cat may have difficulty finding a comfortable spot. However, a sunny room or a house with a solarium can offer ample sunlight for a cat to enjoy. C. Window sill The best answer is indeed a window sill. Cats love to bask in sunlight and enjoy the warmth it provides. A window sill, especially one facing the sun, can offer a cozy spot for a cat to curl up and bathe in sunlight. The elevated position of a window sill also allows cats to observe their surroundings and satisfy their instinctive curiosity. This combination of sun exposure and vantage point makes window sills a perfect spot for a cat to soak up the sun. D. Humane society A humane society is a facility that provides shelter, care, and homes for abandoned or homeless animals. While a humane society may offer sunlight and warmth for cats, their primary purpose is not to serve as a relaxation area for felines but rather to house animals awaiting adoption. Additionally, a humane society environment can be stressful for animals due to the number of other animals present, the unfamiliar surroundings, and the overall bustle of the facility. So, although a cat may find some sun at a humane society, it's not an ideal setting for a cat to soak up sunlight. E. Comfortable chair A comfortable chair can be a great option for a cat to soak up sunlight, particularly if it's placed near a window or another area with ample sun exposure. Cats enjoy lounging in comfort and warmth, and a chair can provide excellent support and relaxation. However, the amount of sunlight a cat can enjoy on a comfortable chair depends on the location of the chair. If it's not positioned near a source of sunlight, the chair may not be an ideal spot for a cat to bask in the sun. In conclusion, a window sill is the best option for a cat to soak up sunlight as it provides an elevated spot with a clear view of their surroundings while being bathed in warm, nourishing sunlight. Other options such as a house or a comfortable chair can also be suitable if positioned correctly, but window sills remain the top choice for most cats."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: 'The second beginning' as it's title explains, shows us the beginning of the end for the human race. Set long before the matrix existed, this short anime written by the Wachowski's shows us the world that could lay infront of us in the not to distant future, set at the turn of the 21st century, the second renaissance delves into issues common with human behaviour; greed, power, control, vanity etc. The use of robots or artificial intellegence as slaves or servents is common among science fiction/fantasy stories. The second renaissance is no exeption to this concept, however instead of a simple man vs. machine layout, this story explains the struggle that the machines put up with, the struggle for acceptance in a world ruled by humans. Where the matrix films show us the human perspective, these short animations tell both sides of the story.

Texting affects learning and performing on test, a new study finds. So a Montana teen, Colin decided to test that. They asked 47 classmates to take part in a two-part experiment. The goal was to test how well these students understood written material. Each one had to read a paragraph or two about a certain topic, then answer questions about it. In the first part, the participants had 15 minutes to understand and then answer questions about six readings. Throughout this test, they met no distractions. During a new set of readings, the brothers sent messages to the participants' cell phones every 90 seconds. In each message, there were questions that required a reply. Participants should have scored better on the second test because it was easier. In fact, they scored worse when distracted by messages. Only a few students scored as well when replying to messages as they did when undistracted. But importantly, nobody performed better during the texting part. The brothers presented details of their findings at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. Boys and girls scored equally poorly while texting, the brothers noticed. Older participants didn't do any better than younger ones. And it didn't matter if a student thought he was good at multitasking. On average, the brothers found that even students who were confident of their abilities did just as poorly while texting. Surprisingly, even though the students remembered less of what they read while texting, most of them answered questions in messages perfectly. \\"Our teachers are very happy to see these results,\\" says Coler. The teens' new data strongly support their teachers' opinion that texting while studying is a serious distraction.

Depending on the size of your baking dish, you may have to use multiple layers to make room for the bread. To ensure that each layer of bread is adequately coated with the butter and sugar mixture, use a spatula to spread the mixture evenly across the bottom of the pan. This will help to create a nice, even caramelization on the bottom of each slice of French toast. Once you have the butter and sugar mixture spread out, arrange slices of bread in the dish, making sure they are fully submerged and in contact with the mixture. If necessary, create additional layers by placing more bread on top and smearing the butter and sugar mixture between each layer. Finally, cover the baking dish with plastic wrap, sealing it well to prevent any air from getting inside, and refrigerate the dish overnight. This will allow the bread to soak up the flavors of the mixture and become tender, resulting in a delicious and effortless breakfast that's ready to be baked and enjoyed the next morning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: How many hosts do the demons need? Title: Night of the Demons Movie plot: The film opens in 1925, with scenes of gore and demons. Evangeline Broussard prepares to hang herself from her balcony when she is stopped by a man trying to reassure her that he is truly Louis and that she shouldn't hang herself. Evangeline calls him a liar, then jumps, hanging herself -- and also causing her head to rip off and bounce down the stairs. Louis stares over the balcony...as his eyes switch to a demonic shade of orange. Cut to present day: a girl named Maddie goes to a party held by Angela Feld with her friends Lily and Suzanne. She realizes her ex-boyfriend Colin is there, dealing drugs. Also there is Lily's ex-boyfriend Dex and his friend Jason. At the party, Angela prompts everyone to go wild, as she must make money off the party or she will have to live on the streets. Lily and Dex eventually reunite, while Suzanne becomes incredibly drunk. Maddie goes to the toilet, only to have a hand grab her through the mirror. They pass it off as an elaborate trick placed by Angela. Police break up the party. Panicked, Colin stuffs his drugs into a grate to hide it from the police before leaving. Maddie, Lily, Dex and Jason leave with the rest, leaving an upset Angela alone in the house. After a while, the group returns, unable to find Suzanne, who is revealed to have passed out. Colin returns for his drugs and, with Angela, goes into the basement to find them. The pair find a hidden door, and Angela remarks that the house is full of hidden rooms, including a tunnel that leads to the next estate over. They enter the room and find six skeletons.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was offered a song on the condition that he release it as his next single? , can you please find it? Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song. I like writing sad songs, it's a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of your own and put them in it. It's a good vehicle, it saves having to go to a psychiatrist.\\"The opening theme is repeated throughout. The...

Please answer the following question: Information: - The Borghese Collection is a collection of Roman sculptures, old masters and modern art collected by the Roman Borghese family, especially Cardinal Scipione Borghese, from the 17th century on. It includes major collections of Caravaggio, Raphael, and Titian, and of ancient Roman art. The Borghese also bought widely from leading painters and sculptors of his day, and Scipione Borghese's commissions include two portrait busts by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Most of the collection remains intact and on display at the Galleria Borghese, although a significant sale of classical sculpture was made under duress to the Louvre in 1807. - Villa Borghese is a landscape garden in the naturalistic English manner in Rome, containing a number of buildings, museums (see Galleria Borghese) and attractions. It is the third largest public park in Rome (80 hectares or 197.7 acres) after the ones of the Villa Doria Pamphili and Villa Ada. The gardens were developed for the Villa Borghese Pinciana (\\"Borghese villa on the Pincian Hill\\"), built by the architect Flaminio Ponzio, developing sketches by Scipione Borghese, who used it as a \\"villa suburbana\\", a party villa, at the edge of Rome, and to house his art collection. The gardens as they are now were remade in the early nineteenth century. - The Madonna and Child with St. Anne ( Dei Palafrenieri ) is one of the mature religious works of the Italian Baroque master Caravaggio , painted in 1605 - 1606 , for the altar of Archconfraternity of the Papal Grooms ( Italian : Arciconfraternita di Sant'Anna de Parafrenieri ) in the Basilica of Saint Peter . The painting was briefly exhibited in the parish church for the Vatican , the church of Sant'Anna dei Palafrenieri on the Via di Porta Angelica in Borgo , near the Vatican . It was subsequently sold to Cardinal Scipione Borghese , and now hangs in his palazzo ( Galleria Borghese ) , where it shares space along with five other Caravaggios : Boy with a Basket of Fruit , David with the head of Goliath ( attributed to 1606 ) , Young Sick Bacchus , Saint Jerome Writing , and St John the Baptist in the Desert . While not his most successful arrangement , it is an atypical representation of the Virgin for its time , and must have been shocking to some contemporary viewers . The allegory , at its core , is simple . The Virgin with the aid of her son , whom she holds , tramples on a serpent , the emblem of evil or original sin . Saint Anne , whom the painting is intended to honor , is a wrinkled old grandmother , witnessing the event . Flimsy halos crown the upright ; the snake recoils in anti-halos . Both Mary and Jesus are barefoot ; Jesus is a fully naked uncircumcised child . All else is mainly shadow , and the figures gain monumentality in the light . If this painting was meant to honor the grandmother of Christ , it is unclear how the ungracious depiction of her wrinkled visage in this painting would have been seen as reverent or iconic . Further shock must have accrued , as stated by Bellori , at the Virgin Mary 's revealing bodice . One could speculate that the parallel diagonals of Jesus '' phallus and leg suggest that both battle the snake , with one its metaphorical equal . - The Galleria Borghese (English: Borghese Gallery) is an art gallery in Rome, Italy, housed in the former Villa Borghese Pinciana. At the outset, the gallery building was integrated with its gardens, but nowadays the Villa Borghese gardens are considered a separate tourist attraction. The Galleria Borghese houses a substantial part of the Borghese collection of paintings, sculpture and antiquities, begun by Cardinal Scipione Borghese, the nephew of Pope Paul V (reign 16051621). The Villa was built by the architect Flaminio Ponzio, developing sketches by Scipione Borghese himself, who used it as a \\"villa suburbana\\", a party villa at the edge of Rome.

In John's office computer CPU will turn off or will not turn off many internal components? Hint: In Windows 2000 and later the threads in the System Idle Process are also used to implement CPU power saving. The exact power saving scheme depends on the operating system version and on the hardware and firmware capabilities of the system in question. For instance, on x86 processors under Windows 2000, the idle thread will run a loop of halt instructions, which causes the CPU to turn off many internal components until an interrupt request arrives.

When an ally of the Ü-Tsang ruler threatened destruction of the Gelugpas again, the fifth Dalai Lama Lozang Gyatso pleaded for help from the Mongol prince Güshi Khan (1582–1655), leader of the Khoshut (Qoshot) tribe of the Oirat Mongols, who was then on a pilgrimage to Lhasa. Güshi Khan accepted his role as protector, and from 1637–1640 he not only defeated the Gelugpas' enemies in the Amdo and Kham regions, but also resettled his entire tribe into Amdo. Sonam Chöpel urged Güshi Khan to assault the Ü-Tsang king's homebase of Shigatse, which Güshi Khan agreed upon, enlisting the aid of Gelug monks and supporters. In 1642, after a year's siege of Shigatse, the Ü-Tsang forces surrendered. Güshi Khan then captured and summarily executed Karma Tenkyong, the ruler of Ü-Tsang, King of Tibet.Soon after the victory in Ü-Tsang, Güshi Khan organized a welcoming ceremony for Lozang Gyatso once he arrived a day's ride from Shigatse, presenting his conquest of Tibet as a gift to the Dalai Lama. In a second ceremony held within the main hall of the Shigatse fortress, Güshi Khan enthroned the Dalai Lama as the ruler of Tibet, but conferred the actual governing authority to the regent Sonam Chöpel. Although Güshi Khan had granted the Dalai Lama \\"supreme authority\\" as Goldstein writes, the title of 'King of Tibet' was conferred upon Güshi Khan, spending his summers in pastures north of Lhasa and occupying Lhasa each winter. Van Praag writes that at this point Güshi Khan maintained control over the armed forces, but accepted his inferior status towards the Dalai Lama. Rawski writes that the Dalai Lama shared power with his regent and Güshi Khan during his early secular and religious reign.

Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves, is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts. Question: \\"What was the Portuguese city of Silves was once known as?\\" Response: \\"Stone age\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question. The correct answer is that the Portuguese city of Silves was once known as Chelb (or Xelb) during the Moorish rule."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It was first performed at the Théâtre de l'Athénée in Paris in a production that opened on 17 April 1947, which Louis Jouvet directed. - The Screens is a play by the French dramatist Jean Genet. Its first few productions all used abridged versions, beginning with its world premiere under Hans Lietzau's direction in Berlin in May 1961. Its first complete performance was staged in Stockholm in 1964, two years before Roger Blin directed its French premiere in Paris. - Our Lady of the Flowers (\\"Notre Dame des Fleurs\\") is the debut novel of French writer Jean Genet, first published in 1943. The free-flowing, poetic novel is a largely autobiographical account of a man's journey through the Parisian underworld. The characters are drawn after their real-life counterparts, who are mostly homosexuals living on the fringes of society. - Querelle of Brest is a novel by the French writer Jean Genet. It was first published anonymously in 1947 and limited to 460 numbered copies. It is set in the midst of the port town of Brest, where sailors and the sea are associated with murder. Its protagonist, Georges Querelle, is a bisexual thief, prostitute and serial killer who manipulates and kills his lovers for thrills and profit. The novel formed the basis for Rainer Werner Fassbinder's last film, \\"Querelle\\" (1982). - A film director is a person who directs the making of a film. Generally, a film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects, and visualizes the script while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking. Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film. - Jean Genet ( ) was a French novelist, playwright, poet, essayist, and political activist. Early in his life he was a vagabond and petty criminal, but he later took to writing. His major works include the novels \\"Querelle of Brest\\", \\"The Thief's Journal\\", and \\"Our Lady of the Flowers\\", and the plays \\"The Balcony\\", \\"The Blacks\\", \\"The Maids\\" and \\"The Screens\\". - The Thief's Journal (\\"Journal du voleur\\") is perhaps Jean Genet's most famous work. It is a part-fact, part-fiction autobiography that charts the author's progress through Europe in a curiously depoliticized 1930s, wearing nothing but rags and enduring hunger, contempt, fatigue and vice. Spain, Italy, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Nazi Germany, Belgium... everywhere is the same: bars, dives, flop-houses; robbery, prison and expulsion. - Querelle is a 1982 West German - French English - language drama film directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder and starring Brad Davis , adapted from French author Jean Genet 's 1947 novel Querelle de Brest . It marked Fassbinder 's final film as a writer / director ; it was posthumously released just months after the director died of a drug overdose in June 1982 . - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance. - New German Cinema is a period in German cinema which lasted from the late 1960s into the 1980s. It saw the emergence of a new generation of directors. Working with low budgets, and influenced by the French New Wave, such directors as Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Werner Herzog, Alexander Kluge, Harun Farocki, Volker Schlöndorff, Helma Sanders-Brahms, Hans-Jürgen Syberberg, Margarethe von Trotta and Wim Wenders made names for themselves and produced a number of 'small' motion pictures that caught the attention of art house audiences, and enabled these directors (particularly Wenders and Schlöndorff) to create better-financed productions which were backed by the big US studios. - Rainer Werner Fassbinder (31 May 1945 10 June 1982) was a German film director, screenwriter, film producer and actor. Fassbinder was part of the New German Cinema movement. After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'querelle' with the relationship of 'based on'.

Write highlights for this article: Today could be a crucial day in the push to rid Syria of chemical weapons. It's day two of meetings between Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva, Switzerland. A plan could be created Friday, but then again ... The United Nations is also poised to get involved. Although Syria's bloody civil war is over two years old, power players from many nations seemed focused on making changes. Here are the five things to pay attention to today. 1. Nailing down a plan. Lavrov and Kerry take 2. The most talked about chat in the world goes into its second day Friday with many hoping that the two can nail down a blueprint to destroy Syria's chemical weapons. If Thursday's meeting in Geneva is any indication, there is going to be a lot of back and forth. The sparring began in the opening statements. Lavrov spoke first. Kerry followed with longer and more forceful remarks. When he finished, Lavrov asked to respond and said he hadn't come \\"prepared with the extended political statement,\\" adding that \\"diplomacy likes silence.\\" Kerry then asked the translator to repeat Lavrov's final comment, but when that didn't happen, Lavrov tried to assure Kerry there was no problem. \\"You want me to take your word for it? It's a little early for that,\\" Kerry said, smiling, as the two men shook hands for the cameras. Ouch. Though this exchange was playful, former U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen says Kerry will have his hands full with Lavrov. Cohen said Lavrov is \\"very, very skilled,\\" \\"bright,\\" \\"articulate\\" and \\"a very tough negotiator.\\" The talks could extend into Saturday, officials have said. If any deal is reached, it would have to be taken to the United Nations for consideration. 2. More Putin backlash. Russian President Vladimir Putin may not be America's favorite writer, right now. Putin's opinion piece published Wednesday in the New York Times ruffled some feathers and had at least one U.S. lawmaker looking for a barf bag. The Russian leader's argument against military intervention in Syria brought some response. But his slap at American exceptionalism brought a flurry of U.S. reaction Thursday. Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez says the piece made him almost want to throw up, and House Speaker John Boehner says he's \\"insulted.\\" Even though the the White House shrugged off the fuss calling it \\"irrelevant,\\" don't be surprised if there are more reactions Friday. 3. More fighting and sadly more deaths. Though the camera seems focused on political spats, and negotiations about Syria, in the country a fierce fight continues. The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported that fighting killed at least 94 people across Syria on Thursday, including 24 in Daraa province. This figure includes 27 deaths in Daraa province and another 26 in Aleppo province. The same group documented shelling that struck nearly 500 locales, along with almost 50 military jet attacks. The fight continues Friday. 4. So where are these chemical weapons? And while world powers haggle about what to do with Syria's chemical weapons, a rebel leader is claiming the government's cache of mass destruction is on the move. Gen. Salim Idriss, head of the opposition Free Syrian Army, says Syria's government is shifting its chemical weapons out of the country. Where? Iraq and Lebanon, Idriss says. CNN could not verify that claim. And Iraq quickly said: no way. \\"We were the victims of chemical weapons under Saddam (Hussein's) regime, and we will never allow to let any country to transfer chemical materials to our lands at all,\\" said an adviser to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. 5. The UN gets closer to weighing in. A greatly anticipated U.N. report on Syria's alleged chemical attack could be coming soon. This development could speed up an international response to Syria. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said Thursday that the United Nations report on the August attack in Syria will \\"probably\\" be published on Monday, and that there will \\"certainly be indications\\" pointing to the origin of the attack. France and other U.S. allies have said they want any coordinated response on Syria to be controlled by the U.N. The report is being created by inspectors who traveled to the site of the chemical weapons attack in the suburban Damascus that the United States estimates killed more than 1,400 people. It could be a first step toward generating support for a Security Council resolution. The world is waiting. CNN's Barbara Starr, Steve Brusk, Jamie Crawford, Jake Tapper, Elise Labott, Barbara Starr, John King, Jake Tapper and Dana Bash contributed to this report.","completion":"Today marks a crucial day in the push to rid Syria of chemical weapons, as Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov meet in Geneva, Switzerland for the second day of meetings.

On an island near Antarctica, a male penguin named Peter sees a female named Polly, and attempts to woo her. First he offers her an ice cream made of snow and icicle, which she accepts. Next, he tries catching her a fish, but only succeeds in catching a pufferfish. Polly accepts it graciously, but when she swallows it, she begins inflating and deflating repeatedly until Peter makes her spit out the fish, which then returns to water. Peter shrugs in embarrassment, but, feeling humiliated, Polly slaps him and leaves to swim on a small iceberg. On the shore, Peter kicks himself for letting her get away, but then notices a sharkfin moving towards Polly's iceberg. He squawks a danger warning to her, but Polly ignores him, thinking that he's just begging for forgiveness that he won't get. Soon enough, the shark attacks Polly, who swims away in panic. Needing to act, Peter picks up a stick and charges out to help. The shark chases Polly around the bay for several minutes. When it looks like he has her cornered, Peter arrives and clobbers him on the nose. Enraged, the shark starts chasing after Peter. After several minutes of fighting and swimming away from the shark, Peter tries to escape by climbing up onto a cliff with a boulder on top. Peter unintentionally dislodges the boulder, which falls into the shark's mouth, who then swallows it. Due to the boulder's weight, the shark sinks to the bottom of the bay. The shark struggles until he's too tired to move. Passing fish begin to poke fun at him. Meanwhile, Polly and Peter reconcile and fall in love, thus Peter's wooing succeeded.

I want a cup of tea, however it means going downstair and having to face the family ass holes What is the sentiment of this tweet?","completion":"The sentiment of this statement appears to be predominantly negative, with hints of frustration, reluctance, and a sense of conflict. There are several elements at play that contribute to this overall sentiment. In this analysis, we will dissect the various components to provide a comprehensive understanding. First and foremost, the desire for a cup of tea indicates a simple, potentially comforting experience that the individual is seeking. This element, in isolation, could be perceived as neutral or even positive. It reflects that the person wants to satisfy their craving for a warm beverage. However, this sentiment quickly turns negative, as the individual expresses that they are hesitant to go downstairs due to the possibility of encountering their family members. The choice of words, \\"having to face the family,\\" implies a sense of obligation and a lack of enthusiasm. This reluctance suggests that they are not looking forward to interacting with their family members, which contributes to the overall negative sentiment of the statement. Additionally, the individual refers to their family members as \\"ass holes,\\" an unmistakably derogatory and impolite term. This use of strong language further confirms the negative sentiment. It implies that the person holds contempt or resentment towards their family members, creating an atmosphere of conflict and animosity. This hostility contributes to the overall frustration and reluctance the individual feels about going downstairs. In conclusion, the sentiment of this statement can be characterized as mainly negative, driven by the individual's aversion to interacting with their family members. While there is a hint of positivity or neutrality in the desire for a cup of tea, the reluctance, frustration, and sense of conflict outweigh it, leading to a predominantly negative sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Spreading a large tarp or sheet on the work surface can make it easier to clean up any spills or stray filling material. Make sure your work area is free from active drafts or air currents, as these can complicate the process by blowing the beads around. Start by opening the bean bag chair's zipper or velcro closure, following the manufacturer's instructions. In some cases, there may be a double closure system for added safety and to prevent bead spillage. If your bean bag chair includes a separate interior lining, ensure that it is properly aligned and secured before proceeding with the filling. Next, have your friend hold the opening of the bag open while you carefully pour the filling materials inside. Since the beads can create static and thus be difficult to handle, it's recommended to use a funnel with a wide opening to streamline the process. While pouring the beads, make sure to fill the chair evenly and consistently, filling each section and corner to ensure a well-distributed and comfortable seating experience. Periodically pause the filling procedure to check the firmness of your bean bag chair. You will want to strike a balance between support and comfort, according to your personal preferences. Some may prefer a firmer feel, while others may opt for a softer, more relaxed chair. Overfilling the bean bag chair can lead to reduced comfort and potential seam stress, while underfilling may not provide enough support. Once the desired firmness is achieved, carefully seal the zipper or velcro closure. If your bean bag chair includes a double closure system, ensure that both closures are properly fastened. Gently shake and adjust the chair to evenly distribute the filling inside. Finally, test the chair by sitting in it and making any necessary adjustments to the filling distribution or firmness. Depending on the type of filling material, you may need to periodically fluff and adjust the chair to maintain its comfort and support. Some types of beads can compress over time and may require periodic refilling to maintain the optimal firmness and comfort. With your bean bag chair now filled and ready to use, enjoy the versatile and comfortable seating it provides for any setting — from the living room to the bedroom or even an office space. Remember to follow the cleaning and maintenance instructions provided by the manufacturer to maintain the longevity and appearance of your bean bag chair."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It had been previously known as the Erlachhof, a traditional hunting estate and lodge of the Dukes of Württemberg that was destroyed in 1692, during the Nine Years' War. Eberhard Louis commissioned a replacement lodge that was built from 1697 to 1701. Construction was interrupted by the beginning of the War of the Spanish Succession, fought against France and Bavaria. Württemberg resisted entry into the war until late 1702. Two years later, Eberhard Louis participated in the Battle of Blenheim in August 1704 that was followed by the exile of the Bavarian Elector. The duke used the battle to press claims to Bavarian lands, but he illegally occupied those lands and was further weakened by a French invasion of Württemberg in 1707. As a result of this attack, the ducal residence in the capital, Stuttgart, was burned and the royal family fled to Switzerland. With the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, the occupied Bavarian territory and status of the exiled Elector were restored.Construction of Ludwigsburg Palace began in May 1704 with the laying of the Alter Hauptbau's cornerstone by Eberhard Louis. The year before, he sent Philipp Joseph Jenisch to study architecture abroad. Eberhard Louis made Jenisch director of construction upon his return the next year, but he only managed to finish the Alter Hauptbau's (Old main building) first floor and some of the southern garden before 1707. The duke spent the winter of 1705–06 at Nymphenburg Palace, residence of the Elector of Bavaria, and was impressed by what he saw there and in architectural publications. Unable to compete with Bavaria militarily or politically, and defiant following the loss of the Stuttgart residence, Eberhard Louis decided to follow the example of Bavaria, Baden-Durlach, and the Rhineland Palatinate.

Please answer the following question: Answer the question below: If you were trying to push a box and wanted the one with the most friction which would you push light box or Heavy box? Assuming that: Its harder to overcome friction between heavier objects and the floor than it is between lighter objects and the floor. Answer:","completion":"If you are trying to push a box and want the one with the most friction, you would push the heavier box. The reason behind this is based on the formula used to calculate friction. Frictional force (F) can be determined using the equation: F = μ x N where - F is the frictional force - μ (mu) is the coefficient of friction between the box and the floor - N is the normal force, which is the perpendicular force exerted by the floor on the box. In this scenario, the coefficient of friction (μ) remains constant as it depends on the materials of the box and the floor. The normal force (N) is mainly influenced by the weight of the box pressing down on the floor, which is directly related to the mass of the box and the force due to gravity (g). N = m x g where - m is the mass of the box - g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²) Since the frictional force (F) is directly proportional to the normal force (N) and the mass (m) of the box, a heavier box will create a larger normal force and therefore, result in a greater frictional force, making it more challenging to push compared to a lighter box."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

What is the answer: What did the British Museum purchase for £35,000 in 1816 from the aristocrat Thomas Bruce?","completion":"The British Museum purchased the Elgin Marbles from Thomas Bruce, the 7th Earl of Elgin, for £35,000 in 1816. The Elgin Marbles, also known as the Parthenon Marbles, are a collection of classical Greek marble sculptures, inscriptions, and architectural members that originally were part of the Parthenon and other buildings on the Acropolis of Athens. Thomas Bruce, the 7th Earl of Elgin and Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1799 till 1803, had obtained a controversial permit from the Ottoman authorities to remove pieces from the Acropolis. Amidst dubious circumstances, he acquired these precious artifacts during his tenure, transporting them back to Britain. At the time, Greece was under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire, and Lord Elgin acquired the sculptures under circumstances that some critics deem unethical, even by the standards of his own time. The legality and ethics of his actions have been the cause of international dispute ever since. Lord Elgin, who had been declared bankrupt due to the cost of obtaining the Marbles, sold the collection to the British Museum in 1816 to recoup his losses. The British government purchased the art pieces not directly, but through an Act of Parliament that authorized the purchase. The Marbles were bought for £35,000, a price significantly lower than the £75,000 the Earl's representatives had originally asked for, but the government had claimed that this was the true market value for the pieces. The museum has consistently refused to return them to Greece despite multiple requests. The British Museum's longstanding argument is that the Marbles are safer and better displayed in London than they could be in Athens, and that in the British Museum the Marbles have more visitors from all around the world than they could ever have in Greece. They also argue that the Marbles are a vital part of the museum’s collection where, in contrast to single-culture national museums, the public can see the cultural interconnections of Europe, Asia, and Africa. The transaction, acquisition, and subsequent retention of the Elgin Marbles remain a matter of ongoing diplomatic contest between the UK and Greece. To understand the intricate history associated with these artifacts is to appreciate not only early British efforts at preserving ancient relics but to acknowledge the complexities of ownership and cultural heritage."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By age 13, his father re-entered his life and traveled the country with him to basketball tournaments. Durant has one sister, Brianna, and two brothers, Tony and Rayvonne. Prior to the start of the 2010-11 season, Durant announced via Twitter that he had signed a five-year contract extension with the Thunder worth approximately 86 million. For the second consecutive year, he led the NBA in scoring, averaging 27.7 points a game. Behind his leadership, the Thunder won 55 games and earned the fourth seed in the Western Conference. In the playoffs, Oklahoma City defeated the Denver Nuggets and Memphis Grizzlies en route to a Conference Finals match-up versus the Dallas Mavericks, losing in five games. On February 19 of the lockout-shortened 2011-12 season, Durant recorded his first career 50-point game, scoring 51 points against the Denver Nuggets. At the All-Star Game, he scored 36 points and was awarded the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award. He finished the year with a scoring average of 28 points per game, representing his third straight scoring title. Behind his play, the Thunder won 47 games and entered the playoffs as the Western Conference's second seed. In Game 1 of the first round against the Mavericks, Durant hit a game-winner with 1.5 seconds remaining. Oklahoma City would go on to defeat Dallas, the Lakers, and the San Antonio Spurs before losing to the Miami Heat in the Finals. For the NBA Finals, Durant led all players with 30.6 points per game, doing so on a 54.8 shooting rate. With a scoring average of 28.1 points per game to finish the 2012-13 season, Durant failed to defend his scoring title; however, with a 51 percent shooting rate, a 41.6 percent three point shooting rate, and a 90.5 free throw shooting rate, he became the youngest player in NBA history to join the 50-40-90 club. Finishing the year with a 60-22 record, Oklahoma City earned the first seed in the Western Conference. In the first round of the playoffs against the Houston Rockets, Russell Westbrook tore his meniscus, forcing him to miss the remainder of the postseason.

Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"Plants are multicellular eukaryotes with cell walls composed primarily of what?\\" with the following options: - protein - plants - leaves - chemicals - Energy. - lignin - eukaryotes - Energy A:","completion":"Plants are multicellular eukaryotes with cell walls composed primarily of lignin and cellulose. To provide a more detailed explanation, allow me to expand on the key concepts mentioned within the facts and the question: 1. Multicellular eukaryotes: Multicellular organisms are those that consist of more than one cell, as opposed to unicellular organisms, which only consist of a single cell. Eukaryotes are organisms whose cells contain a nucleus and other organelles enclosed within membranes. Plants are classified as multicellular eukaryotes due to their complex cellular structure and ability to form specialized tissues and organs. 2. Cell walls: The cell wall is a rigid structure that surrounds the cell membrane and provides support and protection to the cell. In plant cells, it additionally aids in maintaining the cell's shape, allowing the plant to withstand external forces, and determines the direction and extent of cellular expansion during growth. 3. Cellulose: Cellulose is a complex carbohydrate (polysaccharide) composed of long chains of glucose molecules. It is one of the most abundant organic compounds on Earth and a primary component of plant cell walls. It provides the rigidity and structural support needed for plants to grow upright and maintain their shape. 4. Lignin: Lignin is a complex organic polymer that is deposited in the cell walls of many plants, making them rigid and woody. It strengthens the cell walls and provides resistance to environmental stresses, such as mechanical pressure, pathogen attacks, and water-induced degradation. Lignin is crucial for the proper functioning of vascular tissues in plants, such as the xylem and the phloem, which transport water and nutrients throughout the plant. Given all the information from the facts and the definitions above, it can be concluded that plants are multicellular eukaryotes with cell walls composed primarily of lignin and cellulose."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Test sentence: \\"Shouldn't Mary taste the soup?\\" Is this test sentence a correct grammatical English sentence?","completion":"Yes, the test sentence \\"Shouldn't Mary taste the soup?\\" is a correct grammatical English sentence. To better understand why it is correct, let's break down the sentence structure and its components. 1. Subject: The subject of the sentence is Mary, who is the main focus of the question and the person performing the action (tasting the soup). 2. Auxiliary verb: This sentence uses the auxiliary verb \\"should,\\" which is a modal verb that indicates advice, probability, or a suggestion. In this case, the speaker is suggesting or questioning whether Mary should taste the soup or not. 3. Negative contraction: The apostrophe and \\"n't\\" create a contraction of \\"should\\" and \\"not,\\" resulting in \\"shouldn't.\\" Contractions are commonly used in English, especially in informal writing and speech. The negative contraction adds a sense of questioning or doubt to the speaker's suggestion. 4. Verb: \\"Taste\\" is the verb in this sentence, describing the action that Mary potentially should perform. The verb is in its base form, which is appropriate following a modal verb like \\"should.\\" 5. Object: The object of the sentence is \\"the soup,\\" which is the item Mary is potentially supposed to taste. This noun phrase consists of the definite article \\"the\\" and the noun \\"soup.\\" Considering these elements, the sentence is grammatically correct and follows the typical English sentence structure consisting of subject, verb, and object.

Translate to English.","completion":"\\"Les titulaires d’une charge publique désignée qui seront touchés par l’art.\\" Translated to English: \\"The holders of a designated public office who will be affected by the art.\\" In this sentence, the French phrase refers to individuals holding a specific public position or office that will somehow be influenced or impacted by \\"the art,\\" which could denote a piece of artwork, a movement, or a creative expression. It is important to note that context is essential for providing a more accurate interpretation of the intended meaning behind this phrase, as art might represent different concepts in various situations. For example, if the context is related to a discussion about public policy or the legislation surrounding art, it might refer to how individuals in public office are affected by the laws, regulations, and aspects of the art world. This could range from their involvement in decision-making related to art initiatives, budgeting for art programs, or overseeing the implementation of art-related projects. On the other hand, if the context revolves around a specific piece or body of artwork, the phrase might imply that the public officials' perception, opinions, or actions are influenced by the artistic expression. This could be translated in the way they make decisions or respond to public opinion. Some individuals in public office might be inspired by art in their management or policy strategies, while others might be swayed to advocate for further support or accessibility of art within society. In any case, the sentence emphasizes the role that art plays in affecting individuals who hold public office or a designated position within governmental structures or public organizations. It is a reminder of the power of art in shaping not only personal perspectives but also in influencing the actions and decisions of public officials."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: In mid-1917 nine-year-old Frances Griffiths and her mother—both newly arrived in the UK from South Africa—were staying with Frances' aunt, Elsie Wright's mother, in the village of Cottingley in West Yorkshire; Elsie was then 16 years old. The two girls often played together beside the beck (stream) at the bottom of the garden, much to their mothers' annoyance, because they frequently came back with wet feet and clothes. Frances and Elsie said they only went to the beck to see the fairies, and to prove it, Elsie borrowed her father's camera, a Midg quarter-plate. The girls returned about 30 minutes later, \\"triumphant\\".Elsie's father, Arthur, was a keen amateur photographer, and had set up his own darkroom. The picture on the photographic plate he developed showed Frances behind a bush in the foreground, on which four fairies appeared to be dancing. Knowing his daughter's artistic ability, and that she had spent some time working in a photographer's studio, he dismissed the figures as cardboard cutouts. Two months later the girls borrowed his camera again, and this time returned with a photograph of Elsie sitting on the lawn holding out her hand to a 1-foot-tall (30 cm) gnome. Exasperated by what he believed to be \\"nothing but a prank\\", and convinced that the girls must have tampered with his camera in some way, Arthur Wright refused to lend it to them again. His wife Polly, however, believed the photographs to be authentic. Towards the end of 1918, Frances sent a letter to Johanna Parvin, a friend in Cape Town, South Africa, where Frances had lived for most of her life, enclosing the photograph of herself with the fairies. On the back she wrote \\"It is funny, I never used to see them in Africa.

Tallahassee International Airport is located at 30.3965° N, 84.3503° W. Step 2: Look up the longitude of Grand Canyon West Airport (GCW). Grand Canyon West Airport is located at 35.9874° N, 113.8160° W. Step 3: Analyze the longitude coordinates to determine which airport is farther west. Longitude coordinates are measured in degrees (°), ranging from -180° to 180°. The Prime Meridian (0° longitude) in Greenwich, England, divides the world into the Western Hemisphere (negative longitudes) and the Eastern Hemisphere (positive longitudes). In this case, Tallahassee International Airport has a longitude of -84.3503°, while Grand Canyon West Airport has a longitude of -113.8160°. Since the longitudes are negative values, we will compare the absolute values. The larger absolute value indicates a location farther west. |TLH_longitude| = |-84.3503°| = 84.3503° |GCW_longitude| = |-113.8160°| = 113.8160° Step 4: Compare the absolute values. 84.3503° (TLH) < 113.8160° (GCW) Conclusion: Grand Canyon West Airport (GCW) is farther west than Tallahassee International Airport (TLH)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

A Jewish barber saves the life of a wounded pilot, Schultz (Reginald Gardiner), but loses his own memory through concussion. Chaplin as Adenoid Hynkel Twenty years later, still suffering from amnesia, the barber escapes from his care-home to return to the ghetto. The ghetto is now governed by Schultz, who has been promoted in the Tomainian regime under the ruthless dictator Adenoid Hynkel, who looks like an identical twin of the barber (both played by Chaplin). The barber falls in love with a neighbor's daughter Hannah (Paulette Goddard), and together they try to resist persecution by storm troopers. The storm troopers capture the barber and are about to hang him, but Schultz remembers that the barber had saved his life during the war, and restrains them. Hynkel tries to finance his military forces by borrowing money from a Jewish banker, but the banker refuses to lend him the money. Furious, Hynkel orders a purge of the Jews. Schultz protests this inhumane policy, and is removed from office and sent to a concentration camp. He escapes and hides in the ghetto with the barber. Schultz tries to persuade the Jewish family to mount an assassination attempt against Hynkel, but they sensibly decline to participate in his violent plan. Stormtroopers search the ghetto, arresting Schultz and the barber. They are sent to a concentration camp. Hannah and her family flee to freedom in the neighboring country of Osterlich. Hynkel has a dispute with the dictator of the nation of Bacteria, a man named Napaloni (a spoof of Mussolini played by Jack Oakie), over which country should invade Osterlich. After signing a treaty with Napaloni, Hynkel invades Osterlich. The Jewish family is trapped by the invading force.

Both Na+ and Ca2+ are found primarily in extracellular fluids, such as blood plasma, whereas K + and Mg2+ are found primarily in intracellular fluids. Substantial inputs of energy are required to establish and maintain these concentration gradients and prevent the system from reaching equilibrium. Thus energy is needed to transport each ion across the cell membrane toward the side with the higher concentration. The biological machines that are responsible for the selective transport of these metal ions are complex assemblies of proteins called ion pumps. Ion pumps recognize and discriminate between metal ions in the same way that crown ethers and cryptands do, with a high affinity for ions of a certain charge and radius. Defects in the ion pumps or their control mechanisms can result in major health problems. For example, cystic fibrosis, the most common inherited disease in the United States, is caused by a defect in the transport system (in this case, chloride ions). Similarly, in many cases, hypertension, or high blood pressure, is thought to be due to defective Na+ uptake and/or excretion. If too much Na+ is absorbed from the diet (or if too little is excreted), water diffuses from tissues into the blood to dilute the solution, thereby decreasing the osmotic pressure in the circulatory system. The increased volume increases the blood pressure, and ruptured arteries called aneurysms can result, often in the brain. Because high blood pressure causes other medical problems as well, it is one of the most important biomedical disorders in modern society. For patients who suffer from hypertension, low-sodium diets that use NaCl substitutes, such as KCl, are often prescribed. Although KCl and NaCl give similar flavors to foods, the K + is not readily taken up by the highly specific Na+-uptake system. This approach to controlling hypertension is controversial, however,.

At very low pressure, the particles of the substance are far apart from one another and the substance is in the gas state. As the pressure is increased, the particles of the substance are forced closer and closer together. Eventually the particles are pushed so close together that attractive forces cause the substance to condense into the liquid state. Continually increasing the pressure on the liquid will eventually cause the substance to solidify. For the majority of substances, the solid state is denser than the liquid state and so putting a liquid under great pressure will cause it to turn into a solid.

Yūki Mizuhara is Japanese","completion":"Yes, based on the information provided, we can draw the conclusion that Yūki Mizuhara (水原ゆう紀) is a Japanese actress. Her Japanese name and association with the Japanese film industry through the Nikkatsu \\"Roman Porno\\" film and the 1982 production \\"Red Scandal: Affair\\" further support this conclusion. Yūki Mizuhara was highly recognized for her acting prowess, as she won the award for best actress at the 1st Yokohama Film Festival. This achievement highlights her significant contribution to the Japanese film community. Furthermore, her involvement in a local Japanese film company such as Nikkatsu, which has a long history in the industry dating back to 1912, strengthens the argument for her Japanese heritage. The Nikkatsu \\"Roman Porno\\" film genre is a unique Japanese film movement that originated in the early 1970s. It aimed to revitalize the national film industry by incorporating erotic themes and elements into various storylines, which at times, challenged existing social norms. As Yūki Mizuhara won the best actress award for her work in a film belonging to this specific Japanese genre, this emphasizes her connection to and representation of Japanese culture. Additionally, the reference to Nikkatsu's 1982 production, \\"Red Scandal: Affair,\\" in which she participated, shows her continued involvement in the Japanese film scene. This particular movie draws inspiration from a world-renowned film by director Luis Buñuel's \\"Belle de Jour,\\" showcasing the Japanese film industry's ability to adapt and interpret global artistic works while still maintaining their own artistic vision. In conclusion, based on Yūki Mizuhara's Japanese name, her accomplishments within the Japanese film industry, and her involvement in notable productions such as the Nikkatsu \\"Roman Porno\\" film and \\"Red Scandal: Affair,\\" it is reasonable to assert that Yūki Mizuhara is indeed Japanese."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the 1660s and early 1670s, the Swedish Empire experienced a financial crisis. In hope of subsidies, Charles XI of Sweden had entered the anti-French Triple Alliance with the Dutch Republic and the Kingdom of England, which broke apart when Charles II of England rapproached France in 1670, after the War of Devolution. In April 1672, Sweden and France concluded an alliance, with France promising 400,000 riksdalers of subsidies in peace time, to be raised to 600,000 in war time, for Sweden maintaining a 16,000 men strong army in her German dominions. Also, Sweden maintained good relations to the Dukes of Holstein-Gottorp south of Denmark. By September 1674, Sweden had enlarged her army to 22,000 men after France had increased the subsidies to 900,000 riksdalers, which she threatened to withdraw if Sweden was not using this army, stationed in Swedish Pomerania, for an attack on her adversaries. By December, the Swedish army had grown to 25,000 to 26,000 men, 4,000 to 5,000 of whom stationed in Bremen, 2,000 to 3,000 in Wismar, 6,000 to 7,000 in Pomeranian garrisons, and 13,000 free to operate under Lord High Constable and field marshal Carl Gustaf Wrangel.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: James' father unfortunately had Huntington's disease. This is a disease that can be passed down from generation to generation. His mother Got cancer at one point but it has been treated and has been eliminated. But I can use this background: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. What is an answer for this question: Given Huntington;s disease can be passed down, is it a mutation in phenotype or body cells? A:","completion":"Given the information provided and the fact that Huntington's disease can be passed down from generation to generation, it is a germline mutation.

Costumes, set pieces, cinematography all embrace the delicious and beautiful in this story of courtesans of a certain age whose lives, now more concerned with grown children and investments in oil rather than in men, live in great luxury and wealth. When (still ravishing) Pfeiffer becomes reacquainted with her erstwhile friend's 19 year son, (also incredibly ravishing), the two begin an often haunting, life long journey steeped in love, lust, jealousy and desire. They are soul mates and their story bites deep into the tragic and the hilarious. Direction, script and acting, by all major players and even the minor ones, are all first rate. Tastefully sexy and sensual, sad and lovely and funny all at once, a film to capture awards and hearts worldwide.It is turn of the century in Belle Epoque Paris and a scandalous romp is underfoot.

On his way home he saw two balloons, balloon A and balloon B. Balloon A was flat, but balloon B was inflated. He was wondering how balloons go up so effortlessly. Would balloon B have higher or lower inside pressure than balloon A? The answer is:","completion":"Balloon B would have higher inside pressure than balloon A. A hot air balloon operates on the principle of buoyancy, which states that an object will float if it displaces a weight of fluid (in this case, air) equal to its own weight. When a balloon is inflated, like balloon B, the air inside the balloon is heated, making it less dense than the cooler air outside. This creates a pressure difference between the inside and outside of the balloon. The higher pressure inside the balloon pushes against the lower pressure outside, causing the balloon to expand and become lighter than the surrounding air. As a result, the balloon rises. In contrast, balloon A is flat, meaning it is not filled with air and therefore has a much lower internal pressure. Since there's no heated air inside to increase the pressure and make it lighter than the surrounding air, balloon A won't rise. To sum up, balloon B has a higher inside pressure than balloon A due to the heated air inside, which creates a pressure difference that allows the balloon to rise effortlessly in the presence of cooler air outside."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Image copyright Other Image caption It is thought the Mashco-Piro tribe had not been spotted by outsiders before August 2011 (file photo) Authorities in Peru have decided to evacuate a remote Amazon community after it was raided by members of an indigenous tribe. About 200 Mashco-Piro Indians armed with bows and arrows arrived at Monte Salvador looking for food. They are said to have killed domestic animals and taken cooking pots and other metal goods. No-one was injured, but police say it is safer for villagers to move to a bigger town. This is the third time this year that the Mashco-Piro Indians have arrived in Monte Salvador searching for food and metal objects. But last Thursday they came while most of the villagers were away and ransacked their homes before retreating into the forest. The villagers say they also killed some of their animals. Two days later, the Mashco-Piro Indians returned and the villagers fled. The Peruvian police are sending boats to take them to Puerto Maldonado, a busy town in south-eastern Peru near the borders with Bolivia and Brazil. A local indigenous organisation (Fenamed) has asked the government to protect the Mashco-Piro's land, much of which has been taken over by logging concessions and drug-traffickers. ||||| At least 39 people taken to Puerto Maldonado as officials search for motive behind latest bow-and-arrow attack by members of Mashco-Piro tribe Authorities in Peru have sent riverboats to evacuate a remote jungle village after it was raided by an indigenous tribe that has long lived in voluntary isolation in the country’s south-eastern Amazon. Around 200 men armed with bows and arrows raided the remote community of Monte Salvado near the border with Brazil on Friday, Patricia Balbuena, Peru’s vice-minister of intercultural affairs, told the Guardian. The raiders – members of the Mashco-Piro tribe – took machetes, rope, blankets and food in the attack on the village, which sits on the Piedras river in Peru’s south-eastern Madre de Dios region, she said. “There were no injuries although the men fired off arrows. The villagers took refuge in a guard post. They are safe but have no food and are terrified,” Balbuena said. Weather had prevented police and army helicopters from reaching the community. At least 39 people from Monte Salvado – 16 of whom are children – and 22 from the nearby settlement of Puerto Nuevo will be evacuated to the regional capital, Puerto Maldonado. Most of the adult population had already gone there to vote in elections when the raid took place, Balbuena said. “Our worry is the large number of children,” Lorena Prieto, director of Peru’s office of Peoples in Isolation and Initial Contact who was co-ordinating the evacuation, told the Guardian by telephone from Madre de Dios. “We believe the Mashco-Piro are still in the area.” The appearance of up to 200 armed men marks a serious escalation from previous encounters with the isolated tribe, anthropologists said. “We’ve never heard reported such a large movement of uncontacted people,” said Prieto. In August 2013, a group of more than 100 men, women and children appeared across the Piedras river from Monte Salvado. Men from the group brandished spears and aimed bows at villagers in a three-day standoff before disappearing into the forest again. “Normally what happens is family groups arrive and ask for tools and food then they leave,” Prieto said, adding there had been three Mashco-Piro visits already this year, in July, August and October. “But this time the attitude was different,” she said. “This time it was just men, who were armed with bows and arrows, far outnumbering the villagers. They shot arrows and they sacked the whole village – they smashed windows, tore up clothing and killed all the domestic animals. “On seeing their dogs and chickens dead and their village destroyed, the villagers were very frightened. This was a far more violent incursion than is usual. That’s why we’ve decided to evacuate everyone,” Prieto said. Balbuena said: “These encounters are becoming more and more frequent. We are evaluating whether to permanently relocate these communities.” Peru’s vice ministry of intercultural affairs was considering broaching a dialogue with the Mashco-Piro through Yine interpreters to better understand their needs, she added. Balbuena said the vice-ministry would seek advice from its Brazilian counterpart, Brazil’s National Indian Foundation or FUNA, which uses strategic food stores and specialised medical teams and to support indigenous populations in voluntary isolation. Around 15 “uncontacted” tribes with up to 15,000 members are believed to live in the dense forests of the Peruvian Amazon. Direct contact with them is banned out of concern that they could succumb to common illnesses. Anthropologists are trying to understand what caused this latest incident. Balbuena said climate change, which was causing abrupt drops in temperature in this area of the Amazon, may have been a driver. Balbuena, though, dismissed the idea that the tribe had been the subject of threats from drug-traffickers or illegal loggers, saying no “illicit activity” had been detected in the Madre de Dios indigenous reserve, where several hundred Mashco-Piro are believed to live in several nomadic clans. “When there’s pressure on their territory or attacks against them, that’s when there are these violent reactions,” Beatriz Huertas, an anthropologist working with Peruvian indigenous organisations, told the Guardian. “The state shouldn’t be thinking about sending helicopters. These situations should be handled with more care,” Huertas added. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Peruvian authorities have evacuated a remote Amazon community after it was raided by members of the Mashco-Piro indigenous tribe.

Q:What is the final step of the following process: - Rock begins as magma from a volcano - The magma cools - Crystals form and the magma become igneous rocks - The igneous rocks break down into sediment - Become sedimentary rocks - If subjected to heat and/or pressure from plate-tectonic activity the sedimentary rocks become metamorphic rock - The metamorphic rocks melt A:","completion":"The final step of this geological process, after the metamorphic rocks melt, is the formation of new magma. This new magma can then be involved in the process of creating more rocks through the rock cycle. Here is a detailed explanation of this final step and how it fits into the overall process: 1. When the metamorphic rocks melt, they transform back into a molten state, similar to how they started. This melting occurs due to extreme temperatures and pressures caused by the Earth's internal geological processes. 2. The resulting molten material, or magma, is now back at the beginning of the rock cycle. It exists within the Earth's mantle and crust, and it may find its way to the surface or remain beneath the surface for extended periods. 3. If the magma finds its way to the Earth's surface through volcanic eruptions or tectonic activity, it will be exposed to the atmosphere and can cool down and solidify. When this happens, it once again forms igneous rock, completing a full cycle within the process. 4. Alternatively, the magma can also cool and solidify below the Earth's surface, creating intrusive igneous rocks that don't come into contact with the atmosphere. In either case, the formation of igneous rocks marks the beginning of the process all over again. 5. As the igneous rocks break down into sediment through weathering and erosion, the sediment can accumulate in various environments such as ocean floors, rivers, deserts, or lakes. Over time, these sediments may become compacted and cemented together, forming sedimentary rocks. 6. Sedimentary rocks can then be subjected to heat and pressure from plate-tectonic activity, leading to their transformation into metamorphic rocks once more. 7. Finally, through continuous exposure to intense heat and pressure, the metamorphic rocks may melt again, forming magma and restarting the entire geological process anew. In conclusion, the final step of the geological process, after the metamorphic rocks melt, is the formation of new magma. This new magma serves as the starting point for the rock cycle to repeat itself, ensuring that rocks are continuously being created, transformed, and destroyed within the Earth's dynamic geological environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In Dickens what was Mr Micawber's christian name","completion":"Mr. Micawber's full name in Charles Dickens' novel \\"David Copperfield\\" is Wilkins Micawber. Mr. Wilkins Micawber is a memorable and beloved fictional character primarily due to his optimistic outlook on life, penchant for providing aphorisms, and his financial struggles. As a central character introduced early in the novel, Mr. Micawber serves as a representation of Dickens' father, John Dickens, who, much like Micawber, had faced similar financial difficulties and landed in debtors' prison during Charles Dickens' childhood. This experience greatly shaped Dickens' views on social issues and is mirrored in Micawber's character. Wilkins Micawber initially meets David Copperfield when the young protagonist is sent to live in a boarding house by his cruel stepfather. David quickly becomes friends with Wilkins Micawber, who gives him advice and tries to impart his positive outlook on life despite being constantly in debt. Micawber's character is best known for his ability to maintain his composure and deliver catchy phrases throughout his hardships. One of the most famous Micawber's quotes is his \\"Micawber's Law\\": \\"Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen nineteen and six, result happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six, result misery.\\" As the story progresses, both Wilkins Micawber and his loyal wife Emma, with whom he shares a brood of children, face several challenges, including imprisonment for debt. However, Wilkins Micawber never loses his optimism and resourcefulness. He eventually moves to Australia with his family, where his fortune changes, and he becomes a successful magistrate. Wilkins Micawber's character in \\"David Copperfield\\" symbolizes the idea that maintaining hope and a positive attitude can help one overcome adverse circumstances and reach happier outcomes.

Short movie review: a film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , waiting for happiness Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"Based on the provided short movie review, it seems that the critic has a mixed opinion of the movie, with both positive and negative elements. On the positive side, the title of the movie, \\"Waiting for Happiness\\", can be seen as a clever play on the film's central theme, and the fact that the critic mentions the film will be \\"best appreciated\\" by certain viewers may suggest that the movie has a niche target audience that will find value in it. The use of the word \\"happiness\\" might also imply that the story or message of the film could be uplifting or thought-provoking, which can be seen as a positive aspect. However, there are also some negative elements present in the review. The critic describes the movie as having \\"extremely languorous rhythms\\", which could mean that the pacing of the film is slow and might feel sluggish, potentially making it difficult for some viewers to engage with the story or its characters fully. \\"Languorous\\" suggests a lack of energy or enthusiasm, which could indicate that the movie might lack compelling, dynamic storytelling. Additionally, the review implies that viewers need to \\"endure\\" the film, which in turn, hints that watching the movie might be a challenging experience. This might not be appealing to a general audience who may prefer a more accessible or fast-paced film. The critic's use of the word \\"endure\\" also brings forth an assumption that the slow pacing may not be enjoyable for every viewer. In conclusion, the critic's opinion of the movie appears to be a mix of both positive and negative sentiments. While they acknowledge the film's potential to be appreciated by a certain group of viewers and may have a redeeming message, they also emphasize its slow pacing and the fact that watching it might be an endurance test for some. Ultimately, the critic seems to believe that the movie caters to a specific taste and that it may not appeal to a broader audience due to its languorous nature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Wile E., after recovering, blinks his eyes and visualizes a wonderful Road Runner feast. Seeing no need for a comparatively tawdry can, he chases the Road Runner. Wile's low stance reduces his drag and allows him to approach the Road Runner until the bird rockets away. The coyote's eyes pop out of his sockets and he is left dejectedly planning his next scheme. 1. First, the coyote uses a pulley, rope and rock trap to smash the passing Road Runner, evidently hoping the extra complexity will stop himself from being squashed instead. No dice; Wile E. is squashed by the rock as the Road Runner stops and mocks him. 2. The clearly angry coyote, with a lasso in the road, listens for the Road Runner, but a truck trips the lasso first, dragging the coyote across the hard ground. Wile E. is left with a bare rear end from friction as he paces off the road. 3. The coyote builds a Burmese tiger trap according to a How-To book: dig a square pit in the road and fill it with a sheet camouflaged as road. He hides behind a rock and, hearing the Road Runner beep and the trap activate, dives in to capture his prey... only to instantly re-emerge and flee in terror, after which a real Burmese tiger (Surprisibus!

The camera displays a road with a pop-up grate intended to block the Road Runner; Wile tests its crank control successfully, but it fails to deploy against the speeding Road Runner.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"No, Nantong and Jingdezhen are not situated in the same province in China. Nantong is a city located in the eastern coast of China, specifically in the Jiangsu Province, which is a part of the Yangtze River Delta. Jiangsu Province borders Shanghai and Zhejiang Province to the south, Anhui Province to the west, Shandong Province to the north, and the Yellow Sea to the east. Nantong has a rich history dating back to over a thousand years, and it was one of the first cities in China that opened up to the Western world during the late Qing Dynasty. Today, Nantong is regarded as a regional hub and is known for its economic prosperity as well as its rapid urban and industrial development. On the other hand, Jingdezhen is a city in the southeast of China, specifically located in Jiangxi Province, which is part of the South China region. Jiangxi Province is bordered by Hubei Province and Hunan Province to the west, Fujian Province to the east, Guangdong Province to the south, and Zhejiang Province and Anhui Province to the north. Jingdezhen is a city with a rich and illustrious history, particularly due to its significance in the production of Chinese ceramics and porcelain. The city has been producing pottery for over 1700 years, and it is world-renowned as the \\"Porcelain Capital\\" due to its exquisite ceramics and furnaces that contributed significantly to the development of the Chinese ceramic industry. While both Nantong and Jingdezhen are situated in the eastern part of China, they have distinct geographical, historical, and cultural contexts that differentiate them from one another. These cities are located within different provinces and play unique roles in Chinese history, society, and economy. Nantong is more focused on industrial and urban development, while Jingdezhen is deeply rooted in the traditional ceramics industry. In conclusion, Nantong and Jingdezhen are not situated in the same province, with Nantong belonging to Jiangsu Province and Jingdezhen belonging to Jiangxi Province.

Plot title: La ragazza che sapeva troppo Movie plot: Nora Davis (Leticia Roman) is a young, sexually frustrated American woman who journeys to Rome, Italy to visit her elderly Aunt Edith. On the flight from New York to Rome, Nora is befriended by a young man sitting next to her on the plane who offers her a cigarette, and she accepts. He gives her his pack as a token of appreciation. Upon arrival at the airport, the man is arrested for smuggling drugs by custom officials who recognize him as a infamous drug smuggler.Upon arrival later that afternoon at her aunt's apartment, Nora is greeted by Dr. Marcello Bassi (John Saxon). Marcello tells Nora that her aunt is very ill and that she needs absolute quite and rest. After giving her instructions in case of an emergency, the doctor leaves. Nora is obviously smitten with him.Later that same night, as a violent thunderstorm rages, Nora checks on her aunt who suddenly dies of a heart attack. After trying to phone Marcello at his house in which there is no answer, Nora flees from her aunt's apartment. On the street, Nora is attacked by a sailor-dressed purse snatcher. In the ensuing struggle with the thief, Nora is knocked unconscious. A few hours later, she is awakened by a woman's scream. To her horror, Nora looks up to see a young woman collapsing to the ground a few yards from her with a knife in her back. She also sees a strange man crouching over the dead woman's body.

Premise: yeah i mean i can see paying the interest and some small penalty but they really stick it to you big time Hypothesis: Loans are very hard to come by in the current economic climate. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"In order to determine whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, let us first analyze and break down the premise and the hypothesis. Premise: The premise is about the person feeling that paying interest and a small penalty on a loan is reasonable, but they feel that the penalties are excessively high. This statement suggests two main points: 1. The speaker accepts that there should be some interest and small penalty payments associated with loans. 2. They believe that the actual penalties imposed can be disproportionately large, making it difficult for borrowers. Hypothesis: The hypothesis claims loans are very hard to come by in the current economic climate. This statement implies that it is challenging for individuals to get a loan in the present situation. To determine whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we must examine if the premise leads to the same conclusion as the hypothesis. In this case, the premise discusses the perceived unfairness of high penalties on loans, while the hypothesis focuses on the difficulty of obtaining loans in the current economic scenario. While high penalties on loans might be one of the factors that contribute to the difficulty in obtaining loans, there can be various other factors at play, such as stricter lending criteria, economic instability, or reduced income among borrowers. The premise might be a contributing factor to the hypothesis, but it does not necessarily entail it. Therefore, the hypothesis is not directly entailed by the premise. The two statements discuss different aspects of loans – one tackles the penalties imposed on loans, while the other addresses the challenge of obtaining loans in the current economic climate. Though related, they do not entail one another."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. I haven't yet read Kurt Vonnegut's Mother Night (though I've read other books of his, all outstanding pieces of satire and game-changing novel pieces). After seeing Keith Gordon's film adaptation of his book, it will be an immediate must-read in the near future. It's the kind of material that I'm sure if it wasn't made in 1995/96 as a film, it would be picked up right away today in the time period when many period post/present-Holocaust/WW2 movies are quite popular. Except that this is much darker, though even more resonant, about the nature of playing roles and the real underlying horror of living with life after war than say The Reader. It's about the very real danger of pretending in wartime, which is what being a spy in WW2 is really all about. It would be one thing if Mother Night had a script with a lot of emotional depth and complexity about the moral choice and constant role- even after the war ends- for Howard W. Cambpell (Nick Nolte), which is does. But it's also just a really strong feat of cinematic technique. Keith Gordon is not someone I usually think of as a director of really strong material (more-so I think back to him as an actor, oddly enough featured briefly with Vonnegut himself in Back to School), but this is a revelation. He takes the story of Campbell as a story of a fractured life: a German propaganda master (the \\"only American left in Berlin\\"), who is actually a spy for the Americans but can never have his identity revealed, and was before a playwright who really belonged to \\"a nation of two\\", himself and his wife (Sheryl Lee). It follows him from his prison cell, awaiting trial in Israel in 1961, as he writes his memoir and tells of his disillusionment about being a 'pretend' Nazi, and then in 1960 in semi-hiding in a New York apartment, which is where the bulk of the film takes place. Mother Night can be quite heavy, like on a level one might associate with the Pianist, but on another more emotional-cerebral level than the stark poetry of that film. Gordon, by way of Vonnegut, is trying to give us a strong look at a man who has nothing, except the memory (and then later a weird transposition) of his long lost love in a \\"sister\\" who has come back to him in NYC, so he's left to his own devices when he befriends a painter (Alan Arkin, very very good here), and then is found out as a Nazi-in-hiding by a white supremacist newsletter, leading wackos to his apartment. On the surface this should be just a straightforward spy story, but not a thing is straightforward. The 'something' of this man's life is staggering, but it's ultimately of his own choosing. Campbell is one of those characters that could be analyzed for hours on end, but the same conclusions might be reached (and, in a way, mirrors the line Goebbels said): the bigger the lie, the more people believe it. That is except for the select few who started the lie and know its secret and power. But oh, it would be one thing if it were just a wonderful and tragic-comic tale, or another if it were featuring some really fantastic performances (which is does: Nolte is at his very best here, and Sheryl Lee, who we might remember from Twin Peaks as Laura Palmer, stuns in multiple roles, especially in the scene when she reveals she's not 'really' Helga). It's also a gorgeously shot film, with brilliant lighting and shots that reflect the state of mind of the character, or just the starkness or sickening colors of the time (watch the scene where an old Campbell watches a film of his younger self spouting out a rant, the juxtaposition of faces is great). And the music selections rise the level of tragedy. It could be argued some of the music is too much, but at other times it elevates the material past its own usual dramatic dimensions and makes it operatic, solemn about human nature. It's not always an easy film to take emotionally, and some of the twists do have that tinge of \\"whoa\\" as in any spy story. But it's the subversion from Vonnegut that sticks through, the way of taking appearance and performance, of life imitating art imitating life imitating death, and making it into something worth remembering. I have no idea just yet if the book is better than the film (or the other way around), but at the moment it's hard for me not to recommend this to anyone looking for a masterpiece of post WW2/holocaust storytelling. What is the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is highly positive, with the reviewer expressing strong appreciation for the film adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut's \\"Mother Night.\\" They praise the emotional depth and complexity of the script, the strong performances of the actors, the brilliant cinematography, and the impact of the music selections.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person given the appointment of Professor at the Conservatoire? It is not clear why, in 1873, Alkan decided to emerge from his self-imposed obscurity to give a series of six Petits Concerts at the Érard piano showrooms. It may have been associated with the developing career of Delaborde, who, returning to Paris in 1867, soon became a concert fixture, including in his recitals many works by his father, and who was at the end of 1872 given the appointment that had escaped Alkan himself, Professor at the Conservatoire. The success of the Petits Concerts led to them becoming an annual event (with occasional interruptions caused by Alkan's health) until 1880 or possibly beyond. The Petits Concerts featured music not only by Alkan but of his favourite composers from Bach onwards, played on both the piano and the pédalier, and occasionally with the participation of another instrumentalist or singer. He was assisted in these concerts by his siblings, and by other musicians including Delaborde, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Auguste Franchomme.Those encountering Alkan at this phase included the young Vincent d'Indy, who recalled Alkan's \\"skinny, hooked fingers\\" playing Bach on an Érard pedal piano: \\"I listened, riveted to the spot by the expressive, crystal-clear playing.\\" Alkan later played Beethoven's Op. 110 sonata, of which d'Indy said: \\"What happened to the great Beethovenian poem ...

March 22 is World Water Day, which has the theme \\"Water and culture \\"this year. There are more than one billion people in the world who live without safe drinking water. The United Nations hopes to cut this number in half by 2015. Solving such a big problem seems like an unreal challenge. But everyone, even teenagers, can do something to help. A teenage girl in the U.S. has set an example to others of her age around the world. Rene Haggerty, 13, was awarded the 2004 Gloria Barron Prize for her work of collecting deserted batteries which pollute water. In 2003, Haggerty went on a field trip to the Great Lakes Science Centre in Ohio. There, she saw an exhibit about how chemicals in old batteries harm the water of Lake Erie. Haggerty learnt that recycling the batteries was an easy solution. \\"I think everybody can do it, because everyone uses batteries, and it can make a big difference.\\" With these words, she began to increase awareness in her area. She talked to her county government and school board. She got permission to start a recycling programmed in schools as well as the public libraries, hospitals, and churches. With the help from her family, friends and local waste-management officials, she gathered containers, arranged transportation, and made an educational video. Over the past two years, she collected four tons of batteries and drew the attention of officials, who were in charge of a battery recycling programmed but had made little progress. When asked if she feels like a hero, Haggerty is quite modest . \\"Not really.

Context: For those of us who struggle with thoughts about our size and shape, sometimes we don’t like our bodies and our behaviour very much. It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps. I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3.

A UK regulator had recommended the inspection after a fire broke out on a 787 Dreamliner jet parked at Heathrow airport earlier this month. It was traced to the upper rear part of the plane where the part - Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) - is fitted. Boeing said it had asked operators of 717, Next-Generation 737, 747-400, 767 and 777 planes to inspect aircraft. \\"We're taking this action following the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) Special Bulletin, which recommended that airplane models with fixed Honeywell ELTs be inspected,\\" Randy Tinseth, vice president marketing for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in a blog post. \\"The purpose of these inspections is to gather data to support potential rulemaking by regulators.\\" As a result of the fire on the parked Ethiopian Airlines plane, London's Heathrow airport was closed for 90 minutes. After the fire, the regulator had asked all Boeing 787s switch off an electrical component until further notice and suggested a safety review of similar components in other aircraft. In a statement, the AAIB had said that the component needed more \\"airworthiness action\\". It had said that \\"it was not clear whether the combustion in the area of the ELT was initiated by a release of energy within the batteries or by an external mechanism such as an electrical short\\". It added that as the the ceiling space where the ELT is located does \\"not typically carry the means of fire detection... had this event occurred in flight it could pose a significant safety concern and raise challenges for the cabin crew in tackling the resulting fire\\". Honeywell International, the company that makes the emergency transmitters, had said that it backed the proposal to switch them off while investigations continued, but added that it was \\"premature to jump to conclusions\\". Last week, two airlines disclosed issues with the wiring on their Boeing 787's emergency transmitters, Japan's All Nippon Airways (ANA), the world's biggest operator of Dreamliners, said last week it found damage to the battery wiring on two 787 locator transmitters during checks. And the US carrier United Airlines said that it found a pinched wire during an inspection of one of its six 787s.

Answer the following question: The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill Thursday that would protect from arbitrary dismissal the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The measure, backed by 10 Democrats and four Republicans, would codify Justice Department regulations that the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or a designee for \\"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.\\" The proposal would give the special counsel 10 days to challenge a dismissal in court. If a court determines the firing was not for \\"good cause,\\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation. While marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea. The legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller. Mueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign. Trump has said there was no collusion and repeatedly denounced the probe as a \\"witch hunt.\\" Despite his harsh criticism of the Special Counsel and the Justice Department, Trump has dismissed reports that he's privately talked about firing Mueller.

The given equation is: -10*i + 2 = -8*i Our first step is to eliminate the '-8*i' term from the right side of the equation. To do this, we will add '8*i' to both sides of the equation: -10*i + 8*i + 2 = -8*i + 8*i This simplifies to: -2*i + 2 = 0 Next, we want to eliminate the constant term '2' from the left side of the equation. To do this, we will subtract '2' from both sides of the equation: (-2*i + 2) - 2 = 0 - 2 This simplifies to: -2*i = -2 Now, we want to isolate the variable 'i'. To do this, we need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of 'i', which is -2: (-2*i) / -2 = (-2) / -2 This simplifies to: i = 1 Therefore, the value of 'i' that satisfies the given equation is i = 1."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 1861, it was announced that a Provisional Theatre would be built in Prague, as a home for Czech opera. Smetana saw this as an opportunity to write and stage opera that would reflect Czech national character, similar to the portrayals of Russian life in Mikhail Glinka's operas. He hoped that he might be considered for the theatre's conductorship, but the post went to Jan Nepomuk Maýr, apparently because the conservative faction in charge of the project considered Smetana a \\"dangerous modernist\\", in thrall to avant garde composers such as Liszt and Wagner. Smetana then turned his attention to an opera competition, organised by Count Jan von Harrach, which offered prizes of 600 gulden each for the best comic and historical operas based on Czech culture. With no useful model on which to base his work—Czech opera as a genre scarcely existed—Smetana had to create his own style. He engaged Karel Sabina, his comrade from the 1848 barricades, as his librettist, and received Sabina's text in February 1862, a story of the 13th century invasion of Bohemia by Otto of Brandenburg. In April 1863 he submitted the score, under the title of The Brandenburgers in Bohemia. At this stage in his career, Smetana's command of the Czech language was poor. His generation of Czechs was educated in German, and he had difficulty expressing himself in what was supposedly his native tongue. To overcome these linguistic deficiencies he studied Czech grammar, and made a point of writing and speaking in Czech every day. He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in the Czech language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; The Three Riders and The Renegade were performed at concerts in early 1863. In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Umělecká Beseda, a society for Czech artists. By 1864 he was proficient enough in the Czech language to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech language newspaper...

Officials say tourism push will. create 1,600 direct jobs and 6,500 indirect jobs. Critics say government needs to focus on giving citizens clean water, reliable electricity and pavements. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: A Paradigm Shift: Haiti Turns to Tourism for Economic Revitalization In an ambitious drive towards positive growth and economic restructuring, the Haitian government has highlighted its intention to use tourism as a catapult towards progressive development. A noteworthy increase in tourism infrastructure, including the construction of a new airport, is currently underway, with optimistic expectations that such investments will stimulate both job and economic growth. The inspiration for this strategic shift derives, in part, from the neighboring Dominican Republic's laudable success in the tourism sector. The country saw an astonishing influx of 1.7 million tourists between January and April of 2013 alone. The Haitian government, noting the boost such an industry might bring to their economy, has begun its journey down a similar path. Haiti, known for its rich culture and unique history, is keen to leverage these strengths to attract visitors. One major focus of this development initiative is the coastal town of Jacmel. Recognized for its vibrant arts scene and traditional Haitian architecture, Jacmel is already popular among local tourists. Therefore, enhancing tourism facilities in Jacmel is a strategic move by the government to draw international attention. Moreover, the construction of a new airport forms a significant part of this tourism-focused initiative. By building better air transport links, the country aims to ease accessibility and entice a larger number of foreign tourists to explore its picturesque landscapes and cultural heritage. According to officials, this intensified emphasis on tourism is projected to create roughly 1,600 direct jobs and an estimated 6,500 indirect jobs in Haiti. This could potentially alleviate a chunk of Haiti's employment challenges, significantly reducing its unemployment rate, currently one of the highest in the Caribbean region. Despite the evident enthusiasm amongst officials, this tourism push has been met with some criticism. The critics of the government's initiative argue that though economic growth is indeed a laudable goal, the focus should rather be inclined towards refurbishing and improving the fundamental facets of living standards for its citizens. Items such as clean water supply, reliable electricity, and accessible pavements continue to be areas where Haiti languishes on the bottom rung, critics argue. Addressing these basic needs, they assert, would not only improve the quality of life for Haiti’s citizens but also create a more stable and inviting environment for potential tourists. A concerted effort to build a strong foundation of public services might enhance the effectiveness of Haiti's bid to become a tourist hotspot. Ultimately, striking a balance between infrastructure development pertinent to tourism and improving the fundamental public needs of its citizens will be critical for Haiti. If executed correctly, this move could potentially rejuvenate the Caribbean nation's economy and lead it down a path of sustainable growth, benefiting both its citizens and visitors alike. Through these endeavors, Haiti is forging its path in the global tourism landscape, aspiring to illustrate its unique appeal to the world while simultaneously uplifting the nation's economy and job prospects. The world will be closely watching Haiti's journey as it tries to transform its potential into tangible growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Two prominent black Democrats in the House of Representatives are vowing to skip Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to Congress next month, a move that a White House insider says was put in motion by the Obama administration. John Lewis of Georgia and G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina both said Friday that they disapproved when House Speaker John Boehner invited the Israeli leader to address a joint session of Congress on March 3 without consulting President Barack Obama first. That disapproval apparently was orchestrated, or at least strongly encouraged, by the White House through comamunications with lawmakers connected to the Congressional Black Caucus.","completion":"The decision by Representatives John Lewis and G.K. Butterfield to skip Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech highlights the growing rift between the Obama administration and Netanyahu's government. Consequently, the White House has aimed to subtly showcase its disapproval of the Israeli leader's address and utilize the Congressional Black Caucus as a platform to express its discontent. This move by the two prominent black Democrats is symbolic on various levels. First, it serves as a clear message of solidarity with President Obama, emphasizing the importance of diplomacy and communication between the White House and Congress. Both Lewis and Butterfield have criticized Speaker Boehner for not consulting with the president before extending the invitation, painting the situation as a disrespectful act against the leader of their own party. Secondly, their decision underscores the broader divide within Congress concerning U.S. foreign policy towards Israel, specifically in regards to issues such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and negotiations relating to Iran's nuclear program. By forgoing the speech, Lewis and Butterfield indicate that they align with the Obama administration's more cautious and diplomatic approach as opposed to the more aggressive stance advocated by Netanyahu and his right-wing allies in the U.S. Congress. Furthermore, the White House's involvement in this decision could potentially strain the relationship between the Executive Branch and the Congressional Black Caucus. Although the caucus has been historically supportive of President Obama, politicizing the group may lead to increased tensions within the Democratic party as well as further polarization between Democrats and Republicans. In the days leading up to Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech, it is likely that the debate surrounding his presence will continue to intensify, with more Democrats potentially joining Lewis and Butterfield in skipping the event. This could lead to a further erosion of bipartisan support for Israel in the U.S., as well as worsening the already troubled relationship between President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu. In summary, the decision by Representatives John Lewis and G.K. Butterfield to skip Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to Congress in March 2015 highlights an increasingly strained relationship between the U.S. and Israel and emphasizes the tensions within Congress itself. The White House's orchestration of this political move, by utilizing the support of the Congressional Black Caucus, serves to amplify the dissatisfaction with Speaker Boehner's breach of diplomatic protocol, signaling potential shifts in the foreign policy landscape at that time. As the situation unfolded, it further exemplified the complexities and delicate nature of international diplomacy and the necessity for proper communication, respect, and collaboration among all branches of government."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. pick from the following. (i) negative (ii) positive Short movie review: several cliched movie structures Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"Based on the given short movie review, which states \\"several clichéd movie structures,\\" it seems the critic is thinking negatively about the movie. A detailed explanation for this conclusion can be broken down into the following areas: 1. Use of the word \\"clichéd\\": When a critic refers to an aspect of a movie as being \\"clichéd,\\" they usually mean that it isn't original or has been overused in other films. In the context of the review, it implies that the movie's structures are not innovative and fail to provide a fresh or unique experience for the viewer. This, by itself, demonstrates that the critic is leaning towards a negative outlook. 2. Mention of \\"movie structures\\": It is important to underscore that the critic didn't just pinpoint one clichéd aspect of the movie; they focused on \\"several movie structures.\\" By emphasizing this, the critic implies that numerous aspects of the film suffer from a lack of originality. This broad critique doesn't leave much room for positive interpretation. 3. Absence of positive elements: Given that the review doesn't mention any positive aspects of the movie, we can assume that the critic finds it difficult to praise the film. If the critic had truly been thinking positively, they might have mentioned an element they enjoyed or appreciated, even if it was just to balance out the negative remark. However, the absence of such compliments or highlights suggests that the critic's overall impression is negative. 4. Overall tone: The tone of the short review is dry and unsupportive of the movie. Reading between the lines, it seems that the critic is unimpressed by the film and dismisses it as a cookie-cutter or formulaic production. This is in line with other reviews written by critics who view the movie in a negative light. In conclusion, based on the use of the term \\"clichéd,\\" the focus on multiple movie structures, the absence of positive comments, and the overall tone of the review, it is safe to deduce that the critic is thinking negatively about the movie. Without further insights from the critic, we cannot evaluate whether the negative assessment is isolated to the movie's structure or extends to other elements, such as the acting, direction, or cinematography. However, it is clear that the critic's short review conveys a disapproval of the film's lack of originality, subtlety, and innovation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The pain was so severe, she became immobile. She began begging dentists to see her over the weekend. She finally was able to move up her surgery by one day. Can we infer the following? Dentists contain a t","completion":"Yes, from the given information, we can infer various points about the situation and about dentists in general: 1. Severity of the pain: From the passage provided, it is clear that the individual was experiencing a great amount of pain, as highlighted by the use of the words \\"miserable,\\" \\"severe,\\" and \\"immobile.\\" These words indicate that the pain she was feeling was of a high intensity and was negatively affecting her life, limiting her functionality over the weekend. 2. Dentists' availability during the weekends: The fact that the individual was \\"begging dentists to see her over the weekend\\" suggests that it can be difficult, but not necessarily impossible, to find a dental clinic open on weekends. This detail hints that dentists typically operate during weekdays but have limited availability or special arrangements for weekend appointments. 3. Use of pain relief measures: The individual opted to use a hot compress on her jaw as a method of alleviating the pain. This indicates that using physical techniques for pain relief, such as hot compresses, can provide a temporary solution to dealing with dental-related pain. 4. Flexibility in rescheduling dental appointments: The individual managed to move her surgery up by one day, which suggests that dentists may have some flexibility when it comes to scheduling appointments and surgeries. Dentists might understand that sudden pain or other changes in patients' conditions can warrant adjustments to the original schedule, and they may have room to accommodate such requests. 5.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Measure the 4 interior sides of your box and write the measurements down on a piece of paper so that you can easily refer to them later when you’re cutting. You are going to build a railing for the base of your planter to rest flat, so the railing has to run from each interior edge of your legs to the adjacent interior edges. Your length should be 33 inches (84 cm) and your width 10.5 inches (27 cm) if you’re building a medium-sized planter box. Using your 2 in × 2 in (5.1 cm × 5.1 cm) cedar boards, cut 2 longer pieces and 3 shorter pieces. Push your longer pieces in between the legs on the 2 longer sides, using the tension between the legs to hold them in place against the side. Push 2 smaller pieces in between the interior edges of the legs at both ends, and push 1 smaller piece in between the two sides in the middle, relying on tension to hold them still. You need the third piece in the middle to support the weight in the center of your box. Lay a level on top of each section of railing to make sure that they’re flat. If they aren’t, tap each section lightly with a mallet until they’re level. With your pieces forced into place and level, screw your railings into place with 2 1⁄2 in (6.4 cm) wood screws placed 6–8 inches (15–20 cm) apart across each side of your railing. Hold each screw on the outside of your box, and place them so that they’re level with the center of the railing. Drill a pilot hole using both hands to guide the screw into the correct location. Once the screw punctures the exterior, brace the inside of the railing with your nondominant hand and hold it in place while the screw goes all the way through the wood. A pilot hole refers to any small incision that you make with a drill head or screw to make the threading on the screw catch easily. To drill a pilot hole in your planter, simply take your drill head and pull the trigger for 1-2 seconds at the exact location where you want your screw to go. Brace the railing 6–12 inches (15–30 cm) away from the location that you’re drilling so you don’t drill into your hand. Make sure that you drill through the center of your center railing. If your center railing seems loose, you can use wood glue to provide some additional support. Summary:","completion":"The article provides detailed instructions on measuring and building a railing for a medium-sized planter box using cedar boards, ensuring it is level and secure with wood screws and pilot holes, while also highlighting the importance of a center support and the option to use wood glue for additional stability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By Daily Mail Reporter PUBLISHED: 15:29 EST, 18 September 2013 | UPDATED: 03:41 EST, 19 September 2013 A doctor who froze embryos with her boyfriend after she was diagnosed with cancer is now battling him in court after he broke up with her and said he no longer wants children. Karla Dunston, 42, maintains that she has the right to have her biological children and should control the future of the embryos, while her ex-boyfriend Jacob Szafranski, 32, argues that he never agreed to give up his say in the matter. The Illinois Supreme Court is expected to reach a decision on whether it will hear Szafranski v. Dunston this month - a decision which will no doubt affect thousands of future would-be parents. They met up with an attorney and a second agreement that gave OPTIONS: - Daily Mail sole control of the fertilized eggs was drawn up - but the couple never signed it. - Dunston sole control of the fertilized eggs was drawn up - but the couple never signed it. - Illinois Supreme Court sole control of the fertilized eggs was drawn up - but the couple never signed it. - Jacob Szafranski sole control of the fertilized eggs was drawn up - but the couple never signed it. - Karla Dunston sole control of the fertilized eggs was drawn up - but the couple never signed it. - Szafranski sole control of the fertilized eggs was drawn up - but the couple never signed it.","completion":"This legal battle between Karla Dunston and Jacob Szafranski revolves around the control of frozen embryos created after Dunston, 42, was diagnosed with cancer. She wishes to have her biological children, while her ex-boyfriend Szafranski, 32, insists that he never agreed to give up his say in the matter. The couple's disagreement has reached the Illinois Supreme Court, which will decide whether to hear Szafranski v. Dunston, a decision that could potentially impact thousands of future would-be parents. During their relationship, the couple met with an attorney to discuss their options related to the embryos' future. As a result, a second agreement was drafted, stating that Dunston would have sole control over the fertilized eggs. However, this crucial document was never signed by the couple, leaving room for interpretation and legal debate. This situation has pushed the case to the Illinois Supreme Court, which will have to determine the fate of the embryos considering the absence of a legally binding and signed agreement. When examining this case, it is essential to acknowledge the complexities that arise in situations involving medical advancements, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments, and the associated legal gray areas. As technology progresses and more people opt for treatments like IVF to start or expand their families, legal disputes like this one might become increasingly common, prompting the need for more explicit guidelines and legislation regarding the use and control of frozen embryos. The future direction of this case will undoubtedly impact not only Dunston and Szafranski, but also other couples who find themselves in similar situations. If the court leans towards granting Dunston sole control, it might set a precedent that, in cases where no clear agreement is made, the individual with urgent health-related reasons, such as cancer, could potentially be favored by the courts. On the other hand, if the court sides with Szafranski, it may emphasize the importance of both parties having a say in the future of any joint genetic material. Regardless of the outcome, this case highlights the need for couples considering IVF treatments to communicate effectively and establish clear, legally binding agreements on the rights and obligations of each party involved. Ensuring proper documentation and mutual understanding of the implications of embryo creation and storage can prevent legal disputes like Szafranski v. Dunston from arising in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The Bears hosted the Jacksonville Jaguars in week six, their first game since a 41-3 Bears victory in 2012 and the first in Chicago since the Bears won 23-10 in 2008. In six games, the Bears led the series 4-2. Jeff Joniak wrote the offense should employ a run-based attack with Jordan Howard, interspersed with short passes by Brian Hoyer. The Bears led the league in passes of at least four yards and rushes of at least six yards on first down. Defensively, the Bears needed to disrupt quarterback Blake Bortles' rhythm; when his consistency is broken, he is prone to throwing interceptions. To do so, Joniak stated the Bears should apply a pass rush as \\"young quarterbacks don't like pressure.\\" Meanwhile, Jacksonville's rushing attack, while not seeing much action, was spearheaded by T. J. Yeldon and Chris Ivory. Joniak also believed a crucial factor of the game is the battle on third down, where the Jaguars had struggled during the season. Of his six interceptions in 2016, Bortles had thrown four on third down, while the Jaguars were ranked 29th and 32nd on third down defense and offense, respectively. The Bears escaped a 7-0 deficit when Tracy Porter intercepted Bortles in the endzone to stop an 84-yard drive, instead taking a three-point lead on Connor Barth's 36-yard field goal in the second quarter. After the Jaguars punted, the Bears drove 86 yards and scored on Jordan Howard's one-yard touchdown run. By halftime, the Bears led 10-0, the first time they had shut out an opponent in the first half since 2012 against the Lions. The first five drives of the second half failed to result in a score, instead ending with punts before the Bears widened the margin to 13 points with Barth kicking a 24-yard field goal. The Jaguars responded with Ivory's one-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter; after a Chicago punt, they reclaimed possession when Willie Young stripped the ball from Bortles and Akiem Hicks recovered the fumble. Barth kicked a 32-yard field goal, but Jacksonville's Jason Myers narrowed the margin to six points with a 30-yard field goal. The Bears eventually punted again and four plays into the Jaguars' following drive, Bortles threw a pass to Arrelious Benn, who took advantage of Porter slipping to score on a 51-yard play and give the Jaguars the lead. With 2:49 left in the game, Brian Hoyer attempted to lead the Bears downfield, reaching as far as the Jaguars' 44-yard line when a holding penalty on Howard forced the Bears back. On fourth down, Hoyer's pass for Cameron Meredith was broken up by Jalen Ramsey and the Jaguars ran out the clock to claim the 17-16 win. The Bears dropped to 1-5, their worst start since 2004, and their 16th home loss in the last 20 games. The loss was also the first time the Bears lost despite a 13-point lead entering the fourth quarter since a 1999 loss to the Seattle Seahawks.

His father was a railway signalman of Irish extraction, and his mother worked as a weaver at Harrowby Mill. His father left the family 18 months after Lawton was born, and Elizabeth moved back into her parents' home in Bolton. Elizabeth's father, James Hugh \\"Jim\\" Riley, became Lawton's surrogate father. Context: Lawton played his first game for Burnley Reserves against Manchester City Reserves in September 1935, and though he struggled in this game he went on to become a regular Reserve team player by the age of 16. After a poor run of form from Cecil Smith, Lawton was selected ahead of Smith for the Second Division game against Doncaster Rovers at Turf Moor on 28 March 1936; aged 16 years and 174 days, this made him the youngest centre-forward ever to play in the Football League. Rovers centre-half Syd Bycroft, also making his league debut, marked Lawton out of the game, which ended in a 1-1 draw. Burnley had played poorly, though Lawton was praised for his \\"keen and fearless\\" performance by the Express & News newspaper. He retained his place for the following game, and scored two goals in a 3-1 victory over Swansea Town at Vetch Field. He picked up a groin strain in his third appearance which caused him to miss two fixtures, before he returned to the first team for the final four games of the 1935-36 season; he claimed three more goals to take his season tally to five goals from seven games. Lawton continued to train his heading skills intensely in the summer of 1936, and also played cricket for Burnley Cricket Club as a batsman in the Lancashire League. He scored a six against both Learie Constantine and Amar Singh. He scored 369 runs in 15 completed innings for an average of 24.06. He turned professional at Burnley at the age of 17 on wages of PS7 a week. His grandfather attempted to negotiate a PS500 signing-on fee on his behalf but was rebuffed after the club alerted Charles Sutcliffe, Secretary of the Football League, who informed them that any attempt to circumvent the league's maximum wage was illegal. Lawton scored in his first appearance since signing the contract after just 30 seconds, before going on to record a hat-trick in a 3-1 win over Tottenham Hotspur, scoring a goal with either foot and one with his head. Question: How did he play? Answer:","completion":"Thomas Lawton was a highly skilled and talented football player, known for his exceptional heading ability, strong goal-scoring instincts, and versatility. Starting his career with Burnley Reserves, he made his debut in the Football League at the age of 16 as a Centre-forward, which made him the youngest player in that position at the time. His initial performance was described as \\"keen and fearless,\\" and he quickly showed his potential by scoring two goals in his second appearance. Throughout his career, Lawton continued to develop and refine his skills, particularly in heading. He often trained intensively during off-seasons, and even played cricket as a batsman in the Lancashire League, which further showcased his athletic aptitude. After turning professional at Burnley, he scored a hat-trick in a match against Tottenham Hotspur, finding the net with both feet and his head, demonstrating his remarkable versatility as a striker. As a player, Thomas Lawton brought youthful energy, fearlessness, and excellent goal-scoring talent to the pitch. He consistently proved himself to be a valuable asset for his team, quickly adapting to new challenges and capitalizing on opportunities to score. His ability to score with both feet and his head set him apart from other players of his time, and his keen determination to improve his skills ensured that he had a lasting impact on the game."},{"prompt":"What is the final step of the following process: - Blood sugar levels increase after a meal - Cells in the pancreas release insulin - Insulin causes the body to absorb glucose from the blood - Blood sugar goes back to normal - Blood sugar is too low - The amount of insulin goes down - Cells in the pancreas release glucagon - The liver turns stored glycogen into glucose - The liver releases the glucose into the blood The answer to this question is:","completion":"The liver releases the glucose into the blood"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This amendment holds significant importance, as it addresses the need for more adaptability in the allocation of resources for regional fisheries consultative councils. These councils play a crucial role in maintaining the balance between economic development and the sustainable use of marine resources. They bring together stakeholders, including representatives from the fishing industry, regional authorities, academia, and environmental organizations, to share their expertise and knowledge. The proposal aims to allow regional fisheries consultative councils to access funds in a more efficient and flexible manner, which would facilitate their efforts in providing advice and recommendations on various aspects of fisheries management. This would include topics such as the conservation of fish stocks, the implementation of management plans, and the reduction of the negative impact of fishing activities on the marine environment. The enhanced flexibility in funding would enable the councils to better adapt to changing circumstances, such as fluctuations in fish stocks, advances in fishing technologies, and emerging environmental challenges. It would also allow them to allocate resources efficiently and effectively, according to the most pressing needs of their respective regions. Furthermore, this amendment could potentially encourage increased collaboration between the councils, as they could share their resources and expertise to address common challenges in the fishing industry.

In the year 2000, Dick Harper has been promoted to Vice President of Communications for a large media corporation known as Globodyne. The following day, he is on a television program with presidential candidate Ralph Nader, who calls Globodyne \\"perverters of the American dream\\", claiming it helps the super-rich get even wealthier. As they speak, Globodyne's stock value collapses, rendering all investments – including all the employees' savings and pensions – worthless. Dick arrives home, where his wife Jane tells him that she quit her job as a travel agent following his promotion to spend more time with the family. Dick breaks the news of the company's failure over dinner. Despite his attempts, Dick is unable to find another job with comparable pay, and within a short time, the family faces bankruptcy. After accepting the prospect of being poor, Dick and Jane apply for low-paying jobs. Both are unable to keep them, and soon their utilities are cut off, forcing them to sell off personal property to stay afloat. When they are confronted with a 24-hour eviction notice, Dick decides to turn to a life of crime. After several failed robbery attempts, Dick and Jane successfully rob a head shop. They begin nightly robbing sprees and become more comfortable and professional over time. They soon steal enough money to pay off their debts including their house and car, both of which were about to be repossessed. For one last heist, Dick and Jane plan to rob a local bank. All goes as planned until the Petersons – another couple formerly employed at Globodyne – make an amateurish attempt to rob the same bank.

Article: The real trick to motivating yourself to exercise is to not think about it, and just throw yourself into it. Taking action and getting moving can stimulate a response in you emotionally and encourage you to keep at it. You might be dreading going for a run or lifting some weights, but generally once you’re going your feelings will change. Exercise allows more oxygen into your brain, which in turn releases more chemicals that make you feel good. Once you’re exercising you will have more positive feelings, and your mood will improve. This is why exercise is a great natural anti-depressant, and is often recommended for people suffering from mild depression. One of the most important factors in maintaining your motivation is finding something that you actually enjoy doing. Exercise shouldn’t be a chore that you have to force yourself to do. It might start out like that, but finding forms of exercise that you like will make a huge difference in getting motivated. Keep an open mind and try new things. Don’t be put off by the memory of freezing cold cross-country runs when you were at school — there’s more to exercise than this. You could do anything from a ballroom dancing class, to badminton, horse riding, or martial arts. When you find something fun, keep it in your routine, but still look for some variety. This won’t be possible for everyone, but if you live within running or cycling distance to where you work, turn your commute into part of your exercise routine. Often people struggle to put time aside to exercise, but by exercising on your way to and from work you are being active without having to set aside any extra time. Running or cycling to and from work will also help you clear your mind in preparation for, or to recover from, a stressful day in the office. Cycling to work is a great workout and will help you get into the habit of cycling and exercising more generally. If you are busy it can be tough to find time to exercise, but you are more likely to stick to it if you firmly book it into your schedule. Go through your diary carefully and try to carve out a regular window that is free most weeks, if not every week. If you do exercise at the same time and on the same days every week, you have a better chance of maintaining it. Sooner or later the exercise will become as deeply embedded in your schedule as everything else. You’ll even find yourself looking forward to it as a break from the everyday grind. Habits and routines take a while to form, but they can be very powerful once they are in place. A good way to get more exercise in your day is just to add in little bits of physical activity whenever you can. Making small changes can add up to a big change in the long-term, as well as helping you change your outlook and get more used to being physically active. Some examples of small changes you can make include: Taking the stairs instead of using the elevator Walking or cycling to the shops instead of driving Taking a brisk walk when you have a break at work Put yourself in a position where you have to walk and don't think about it being a form of exercise. This could be done by getting off the bus a few stops earlier to home or work, or by walking anywhere you can in a reasonable distance such as to the grocery store, school, the post office, or a friend's house. For example, you could park further from stores so that you have further to walk to start shopping. The more often you do this the easier it will become as you get used to it. What is a summary?","completion":"Summary: To motivate yourself to exercise, start by taking action without overthinking it. Exercise can improve your mood and act as a natural anti-depressant. Find activities you enjoy and try new forms of exercise to maintain motivation. Incorporate exercise into your daily routine, such as commuting to work by running or cycling. Schedule regular exercise sessions and gradually build habits. Make small changes in your lifestyle to increase physical activity, such as taking the stairs, walking more, and parking farther away from destinations. As you get used to these activities, they'll become easier and more enjoyable."},{"prompt":"What type of details about alin alexuc-ciurariu can be gathered from the following bio?

The man -- identified by Xinhua as a bus driver with the surname Chen -- was hospitalized in Shenzhen on December 21 as he battled a fever. He tested positive for the H5N1 avian influenza virus, the provincial health department said in a statement, according to the official news agency. The man had not traveled out of the city of Shenzhen, nor did he have direct contact with poultry in the month before he came down with the fever, according to the department.

The proximity of Shenzhen to Hong Kong raises concerns on the possible transmission of the H5N1 avian influenza virus across the border. Hong Kong has been vigilant in enforcing strict biosecurity measures to prevent the spread of the virus, including regular monitoring and inspection of poultry markets and farms. The decision to cull the chickens in Hong Kong was made after the discovery of the H5N1 virus in a sample taken from a local poultry market. This highlights the importance of constant surveillance and swift action to contain any potential outbreaks. Culling infected or potentially infected animals is a standard method of controlling the spread of contagious diseases, and it is crucial for maintaining the health and well-being of both animals and humans. However, the fact that Chen did not have direct contact with poultry in the month before he developed the fever raises questions about how he contracted the virus. This could potentially suggest that the virus has become more adaptive and may be transmissible through other means, such as close contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. It could also point to a possibility of limited human-to-human transmission, although more investigations are needed to confirm this theory. In light of this case, health authorities in China, Hong Kong, and the surrounding areas should increase their efforts to monitor and control the spread of the H5N1 virus. This includes enhancing surveillance of live poultry markets, conducting more thorough inspections, and enforcing stricter biosecurity measures on commercial poultry farms and processing facilities. Additionally, public health awareness campaigns should be launched to educate people on the dangers of avian flu and to provide guidance on how to minimize potential exposure to the virus. Furthermore, close coordination among regional governments, international health organizations, and the World Health Organization (WHO) is paramount in the global fight against avian flu. The WHO recommends that countries experiencing outbreaks of the H5N1 virus should share their data and samples with the global community, as this ensures that adequate resources and knowledge can be directed towards developing effective containment strategies and preventative measures. In conclusion, the death of Chen from a contagious strain of avian flu serves as a stark reminder of the need for heightened vigilance and cooperation in managing the threat of infectious diseases. By working together and implementing strong biosecurity measures, regular surveillance, and public education campaigns, the regional and global communities can curb the spread of the H5N1 virus and protect both the animal and human populations from further harm."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

He held the IBU world flyweight title in 1916, the EBU European flyweight title twice; firstly in 1914 and again from 1916 to 1917, the BBBofC British flyweight title in 1916 and the National Sporting Club’s British flyweight title from 1916 to 1918. Often regarded as the greatest British fighter of all time, he was the first official world flyweight champion and was rated by American boxing writer Nat Fleischer, as well as many other professionals and fans including former boxer, trainer, manager and promoter, Charley 'Broadway' Rose, as \\"the Greatest Flyweight Boxer Ever\\". Wilde earned various nicknames such as, \\"The Mighty Atom,\\" \\"Ghost with the Hammer in His Hand\\" and \\"The Tylorstown Terror\\" due to his bludgeoning punching power. While reigning as the world's greatest flyweight, Wilde would take on bantamweights and even featherweights, and knock them out.

Monteux believed that the trouble began when the two factions began attacking each other, but their mutual anger was soon diverted towards the orchestra: \\"Everything available was tossed in our direction, but we continued to play on\\". Around forty of the worst offenders were ejected—possibly with the intervention of the police, although this is uncorroborated.

At the end there were several curtain calls for the dancers, for Monteux and the orchestra, and for Stravinsky and Nijinsky before the evening's programme continued.Among the more hostile press reviews was that of Le Figaro's critic, Henri Quittard, who called the work \\"a laborious and puerile barbarity\\" and added \\"We are sorry to see an artist such as M.

It was renamed in 2005 when Regina-based agricultural equipment firm Brandt Industries bought its naming rights. - In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time. - The Seattle Totems were a professional ice hockey franchise in Seattle, Washington. Under several names prior to 1958, the franchise was a member of the Pacific Coast Hockey League (renamed the Western Hockey League in 1952) between 1944 and 1974. In their last season of existence, the Totems played in the Central Hockey League in the 197475 season. They played their home games in the Civic Ice Arena and later at the Seattle Center Coliseum.

Two more championships were won under current head coach Red Berenson in 1996 and 1998. - Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually in a rink, in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent's net to score points. Ice hockey teams usually consist of six players each: one goaltender, and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team. - Gordon Arthur \\"Red, The Red Baron\\" Berenson (born December 8, 1939) is a former Canadian professional ice hockey centre and is currently in his 32nd year as head coach of the Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey team. - The Regina Pats are a junior ice hockey team that plays in the Western Hockey League.

Q:Companies, communities, families, clubs, and other clumps of humans all have some inherent social dynamics. At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that. Many leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance. This is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP. As such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization. Sadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in. So much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn’t be…frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach. I believe though, that there are a lot of relatively simple things we can do to make organizations feel more engaging.

The equation is -2*i + 344 - 304 = 2*i. First, let's combine the numbers that are not with \\"i\\". So, 344 - 304 = 40. Now the equation looks like this: -2*i + 40 = 2*i. Next, we need to get all the \\"i\\" terms on one side of the equation and the numbers on the other side. To do this, let's add 2*i to both sides of the equation. (-2*i + 2*i) + 40 = 2*i + 2*i. This simplifies to: 40 = 4*i. Now, we just need to find the value of \\"i\\". To do that, we will divide both sides of the equation by 4. 40 ÷ 4 = (4*i) ÷ 4. This gives us: 10 = i. So, i equals 10.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Brendan Rodgers felt the Chelsea game would be the biggest of Liverpool’s week. After an extraordinary night in Madrid on Tuesday, it has now become bigger than even he could have imagined. I was in Madrid as a fan. These occasions sum up what Liverpool are about: the Champions League, a capacity crowd in a magnificent stadium, supporters travelling in vast numbers, dreaming they will be able to say in years to come: ‘I was there the night we beat Real Madrid.’ It turned out to be a game that will live in the memory but not for the reasons anyone hoped would be the case. The team sheet that Rodgers handed in before kick-off — and the relentless debate that followed — has seen to that. Scroll down for video. Martin Skrtel reflects on the first-half, leaving the famous Bernabeu turf with Liverpool a goal down. Matchwinner Karim Benzema celebrates his strike after Liverpool's rearguard were caught flatfooted. Rodgers has received some scathing criticism for making seven changes but I am not going to join the chorus of disapproval. Some of his decisions I didn’t agree with, others I could completely understand. This is how I saw it. When we got into the Bernabeu before kick-off, the full extent of how much Rodgers had altered his team had circulated and it left many high up in the away section, who already viewed the fixture with trepidation, fearing a night even more painful than the one Madrid inflicted at Anfield. So then I began to study the team sheet. Javier Manquillo instead of Glen Johnson? I could understand that. Manquillo has been Liverpool’s best right back this season. Kolo Toure for Dejan Lovren? Again, no problem. Lovren’s erratic form meant he didn’t deserve to be picked. Fabio Borini for Mario Balotelli? No issue there. Borini covered more ground in one game than Balotelli had done in 10. The absence of Philippe Coutinho didn’t bother me, either, as he can’t be trusted to deliver in big away games. Those players who came in all deserve to start against Chelsea. Kolo Toure (left) had one of his best games in a Liverpool shirt, frequently frustrating Madrid's stars. The ever-willing Fabio Borini (centre) put in more effort than the mercurial Mario Balotelli. Rodgers, remember, wasn’t ripping up a team that had won six straight matches. Nobody knows what Liverpool’s best XI is at present, not even the manager. And if we think the best he had were on show when Madrid came to Anfield, being on the end of a 3-0 battering weakens those claims. What’s more, Liverpool were never going to attack Madrid, so the changes didn’t alter tactics. Anyone who believes Liverpool, under Gerard Houllier and Rafa Benitez, took on top teams away in Europe are living in a dream world. We didn’t. Neither did the all-conquering sides in the 1970s and 1980s. Yet what I couldn’t fathom were the omissions of Steven Gerrard (Rodgers’s captain), Jordan Henderson (his vice-captain) and the best attacker, Raheem Sterling. Those three, along with Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge, were the reason they came so close to winning the title and returned to Europe’s elite. After their efforts last season, they deserved to start in the Bernabeu. The reason players love the Champions League so much is the thought of playing in an arena such as the Bernabeu. What are the chances of Stevie playing there again? Will Jordan and Raheem ever have the opportunity in the future? You believe that you will get plenty of chances but I played for Liverpool for 17 years and a trip to the Bernabeu only came around once. Jamie Carragher (right) stifles Raul with Xabi Alonso's help during Liverpool's 1-0 win in Madrid in 2009. Steven Gerrard (left) watches from the bench, alongside Glen Johnson and Jordan Henderson. I felt those three deserved to be in the team and it had nothing to do with sentiment. They deserved to play because they are part of Liverpool’s best team. I can imagine how they would have felt when Rodgers told them they were out. They would have been professional but they would have been devastated. When you grow up, you dream about playing against Real Madrid in the Bernabeu. During my career, I won several big trophies but, believe me, nights in the Nou Camp, the San Siro and the Bernabeu, three of football’s cathedrals, are up there in my memories; victories against Barcelona (February 2007), Inter Milan (March 2008) and Real (February 2009) were special. This squad had a similar opportunity. Yes, Liverpool played reasonably well and showed more than they had for a number of weeks but relief that they didn’t suffer a heavy defeat is not what following Liverpool in Europe should be about. What confuses me is the importance the Chelsea game has been given. It is big, of course it is. But there are 28 matches to go. Winning won’t guarantee Liverpool’s place in the top four this season, in the same way a defeat won’t leave them with too much ground to make up. Gerrard (left) and Raheem Sterling were introduced in the 69th minute. Both should have started the game. The travelling fans were in good voice as ever, but left the Bernabeu with a narrow defeat. It baffles me when teams are more interested in qualifying for the competition next season than doing their best in the competition they are already in. Chelsea isn’t make or break. Had Manchester United — a side with no European commitments — been the visitors to Anfield and Liverpool had played abroad on Wednesday night, I could have seen why Rodgers wanted Gerrard, Henderson and Sterling refreshed, but not on this occasion. They are playing a Chelsea side who have been away in Europe and had 24 hours less to recover. Liverpool stayed in Madrid after the game to train on Wednesday, too, so the players haven’t had a disrupted night’s sleep to contend with. The physical demands haven’t been so severe. This, however, is where we are. When you are involved with Liverpool, things can be moving along quietly when an issue explodes and takes over. This is one of those times. Chelsea were held by Maribor in Slovenia and played a day after Liverpool in midweek. When Jose Mourinho makes an appearance at Anfield, it is usually an eventful one. City’s Euro excuses just don’t stack up. Manchester City now need a miracle to reach the Champions League knockout stages. We keep hearing how they are unlucky because they have been drawn in tough groups but that does not wash. Manuel Pellegrini has enough quality at his disposal and should have got out of this group with Bayern Munich. Why are they behind Roma? The Italians have improved in the past two seasons but their squad does not boast the depth of City’s. Why have they failed to beat CSKA Moscow over two games? Last season, City did the double over CSKA, who lost five out of six matches. Vincent Kompany is in disbelief during City's costly Champions League defeat to CSKA Moscow. Pablo Zabaleta sums up the mood after City concede a second early goal to Ajax in 2012. They drew 2-2. Carlos Tevez leads the troops as they trudge off after City sank to a 1-0 defeat in Dortmund in 2012. This isn’t like how it was for Manchester United and Arsenal when they were new to the competition. In the 1990s, they had British squads who were not used to playing in Europe, and it took time to adjust. Yes, City have had some tough draws against Dortmund, Real Madrid and Munich but they were knocked out of a group by Napoli and failed to beat Ajax, home or away, in 2012 under Roberto Mancini. City have men who have played in Champions League and World Cup finals. They should be able to negotiate these tests. The excuses don’t stack up. I said last week City’s squad needs to be broken up. Defeat by CSKA provided confirmation. This week I'm looking forward to... seeing James McCarthy continue to dazzle. Everton have a rich history of building teams around influential central midfielders, headed by the ‘Holy Trinity’ of Alan Ball, Howard Kendall and Colin Harvey. In the 1980s, the team I grew up watching was inspired by Peter Reid and Paul Bracewell, and it is looking more and more like James McCarthy, the Republic of Ireland international, is going to keep up past traditions. He has the potential to be one of the best in the Barclays Premier League. McCarthy was outstanding in Thursday’s 3-0 Europa League triumph over Lille and he will have a key role again at the Stadium of Light, as Everton look to apply pressure to the teams near the top. James McCarthy (left) was again impressive in midweek as Everton strolled past Lille in the Europa League. Peter Reid (right) is challenged by Sheffield Wednesday's Gary Shelton during 1985's FA Cup semi-final. Paul Bracewell controls the ball during the 1989 Simod Cup final, which Everton lost to Nottingham Forest. Liverpool wanted to sign him when he was 16 and the better he plays for Everton, the more it is looking like a mistake that we allowed him to slip through our fingers. He didn’t want to leave Scotland at that age but Liverpool’s loss has been Everton’s gain. I am a big fan of McCarthy and I never fail to be impressed when I see him. I do feel he needs to add more goals to his game but, if he can do that, he will be the real deal. Everton have a top player on their hands. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

Air is pulled into the lungs: Asthma can cause difficulty in pulling air into your lungs due to the narrowing of the airways. This may make you feel short of breath. 2. Oxygen moves from the lungs into the bloodstream: With asthma, the reduced airflow and inflamed airway linings can decrease the amount of oxygen that is able to move from the lungs into the bloodstream. As a result, there is a \\"less\\" effect on this particular stage. 3. Air is pushed through the vocal chords: Asthma may also cause difficulty in pushing air through your vocal cords, which can impact your ability to speak during an asthma attack. 4. A person talks: It might be difficult to talk during an asthma attack, as not enough air is passing through the vocal cords. 5. Other air is pushed out of the lungs into the environment: Asthma poses a challenge in exhaling the air from the lungs due to the constricted airways. This may lead to increased shortness of breath and difficulty in breathing. In summary, when you have asthma, it has a \\"less\\" effect on the second step mentioned - oxygen moving from the lungs into the bloodstream. The constriction and inflammation of the airways lead to a decreased ability to breathe, which in turn affects the oxygenation of the blood. It is essential to manage your asthma effectively with appropriate medication and follow your doctor's advice to minimize these effects and maintain optimal respiratory health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

People can be exposed to asphalt in the workplace by breathing in fumes or skin absorption. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a Recommended exposure limit (REL) of 5 mg/m3 over a 15-minute period. Asphalt is basically an inert material that must be heated or diluted to a point where it becomes workable for the production of materials for paving, roofing, and other applications. In examining the potential health hazards associated with asphalt, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) determined that it is the application parameters, predominantly temperature, that effect occupational exposure and the potential bioavailable carcinogenic hazard/risk of the asphalt emissions. In particular, temperatures greater than 199 °C (390 °F), were shown to produce a greater exposure risk than when asphalt was heated to lower temperatures, such as those typically used in asphalt pavement mix production and placement.

Therefore, if you were watching a game between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Philadelphia Flyers, you would be witnessing a match of ice hockey. Ice hockey is a fast-paced, physical team sport played on an ice rink and is considered to be one of the major professional sports in North America and Europe. The game involves two teams of six players each, which include one goaltender and five skaters, who compete to outscore their opponents by shooting a rubber puck into the net of the opposing team. The players use their ice skates to swiftly navigate the rink and their hockey sticks to pass, shoot, and control the puck during the game. The standard size of an ice hockey rink measures 200 feet (61 meters) long and 85 feet (26 meters) wide, and its surface is marked with various lines and markings that ensure proper gameplay. Players wear specialized equipment like helmets, shoulder pads, elbow pads, gloves, and shin guards for protection since collisions and falls are quite common. The NHL, founded in 1917, currently consists of 32 teams—25 from the United States and 7 from Canada. The season runs from October to April, followed by the prestigious Stanley Cup Playoffs, which is the primary goal for every team in the league. The Pittsburgh Penguins, established in 1967, have won the Stanley Cup five times, whereas the Philadelphia Flyers, founded in 1967 as well, have won it twice.

A:","completion":"The first step of the process for the development of a hurricane begins with the formation of a weather disturbance, often occurring as a result of warm ocean waters and conducive atmospheric conditions. This disturbance is typically a disorganized cluster of thunderstorms, and it plays a crucial role in setting the stage for the potential development of a tropical cyclone or a hurricane. In order for a weather disturbance to evolve into a more organized system, several key factors must be present. Firstly, warm ocean waters, with surface temperatures of at least 26.5°C (80°F), are required as they serve as a primary energy source. This warmth helps to fuel the growth of the thunderstorms and provides the necessary moisture for the system. In addition to warm sea surface temperatures, a relatively moist and humid atmosphere is crucial for the growth and organization of the thunderstorms. This aids in the development of the convection currents, which are essentially the updrafts and downdrafts of air that contribute to the formation and strengthening of the tropical cyclone. There must also be a favorable atmospheric environment with minimal vertical wind shear – the change in wind speed or direction with height. A high degree of vertical wind shear can tear apart the developing storm or prevent the thunderstorms from organizing around a common center, resulting in the eventual dissipation of the storm system. Lastly, the disturbance should be located sufficiently close to the Earth's equator (typically within 5-20 degrees latitude). This ensures that the system is subject to the Coriolis effect, a phenomenon caused by Earth's rotation. The Coriolis effect imparts a spin to the developing weather system, helping it to organize around a low-pressure center and promoting cyclogenesis – the process of cyclone formation. When all these factors come together, the weather disturbance can develop further and begin spinning around a low-pressure center, with the potential to eventually intensify into a tropical depression, tropical storm, and ultimately, a hurricane under the right conditions. The monitoring and tracking of these early-stage weather disturbances play a crucial role in predicting the development and potential impact of hurricanes and other tropical cyclones."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this: Fungi communicate to coordinate and organize their growth and development such as the formation of Marcelia and fruiting bodies. Fungi communicate with their own and related species as well as with non fungal organisms in a great variety of symbiotic interactions, especially with bacteria, unicellular eukaryote, plants and insects through biochemicals of biotic origin. The biochemicals trigger the fungal organism to react in a specific manner, while if the same chemical molecules are not part of biotic messages, they do not trigger the fungal organism to react. This implies that fungal organisms can differentiate between molecules taking part in biotic messages and similar molecules being irrelevant in the situation. So far five different primary signalling molecules are known to coordinate different behavioral patterns such as filamentation, mating, growth, and pathogenicity. Behavioral coordination and production of signaling substances is achieved through interpretation processes that enables the organism to differ between self or non-self, a biotic indicator, biotic message from similar, related, or non-related species, and even filter out \\"noise\\", i.e. similar molecules without biotic content. How do fungi communicate with insects? What is the answer? (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"Fungi communicate with insects through biochemicals of biotic origin, as the source text implies. While the exact nature of these biochemicals can vary, they carry specific messages that can trigger certain reactions within fungal organisms. The five different primary signaling molecules known to coordinate different behavioral patterns such as filamentation, mating, growth, and pathogenicity, may also play a role in this form of interspecies communication. These messages sent by fungi are highly specific, and only trigger reactions if they are recognized as part of biotic messages. This means that fungi can differentiate between molecules that are part of these messages and similar molecules that are not part of them. This form of selective communication allows fungi to react accordingly to interactions with insects and other organisms. To understand the fundamentals of this communication process, it is critical to know that interpretation processes play a key role in these interactions. Not only do they enable the fungi to tell apart self or non-self, but they also allow the fungi to tell apart a biotic indicator, a biotic message from similar, related, or non-related species. They're even equipped with the ability to filter out \\"noise\\", i.e., similar molecules without biotic content. In case of interaction with insects, these analysis processes may trigger specific responses from fungi ranging from change in growth patterns to mating based on the nature of the biochemical signal received.

To protect its seagoing interests and trade routes, Portugal established strategic garrisons in Goa (India), Malacca (East Indies), and Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau (now Macao), the Congo, and various other parts of Africa, including the Sudan. The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history. Adventures abroad, however, proved disastrous during the second half of the 16th century. In 1557 the 14-year-old boy-king Sebastião ascended the throne, the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of Alcacer-Quiber (Morocco) in pursuit of a vain crusade. Sebastião's untimely demise, alongside some 18,000 ill-prepared, badly led followers, set the stage for a crisis of succession. For many years afterwards, legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive, and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne; those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executed. In fact, the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry. But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed, he died, heirless. Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity, Spain occupied the power vacuum, and Portugal's neighbor and long-time antagonist became its master. Spanish rule dictated Portugal's inadvertent involvement in Spain's ongoing wars. In 1587 a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a \\"legitimate target\\" as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator. Nine years later Faro was torched. The 1386 Treaty of Windsor, by which Britain and Portugal had pledged eternal friendship, seemed a distant memory. Portugal's empire was gradually eroded, and many of its trading posts (with the notable exception of Brazil) were picked off by the British and Dutch. Finally, after 60 years of Spanish rule, Portuguese noblemen (aided by the French, then at war with Spain) organized a palace coup and restored independence.

Article: Just as some people think that certain numbers are lucky or unlucky, others believe that we can use numbers to understand our personalities, or predict what will happen to us in the future. Numerology is a way of using numbers to describe a person's character, and to make predictions about future life events. Numerologists use the numbers 1-9, 11 and 22 -- also known as the \\"master\\" numbers -- to help a person understand his or her personality, life goals, and destiny. Numerologists consider yourLife Path number to be the most significant because this number describes your character. To find this number, add together all the numbers in your date of birth. For example, a person born on April 25, 1985 would add the month (4), to the numbers of the date (2+5), plus the numbers of the birth year (1+9+8+5). In this case the total is 34, so this person's life path number is 7(3+4). Numerologists believe that people with this number are peaceful and affectionate but can also be very reserved. Your Expression numberdescribes your talents and predicts how you should use these to fulfill your destiny in life. Numerologists assign a number between 1 and 9 to each of the letters in your name. These numbers are then added together in the same way as before to find your Expression number. Numerologists can also do calculations to predict when the most challenging periods of your life will be. Numerologists also believe that the day a person is born is important. Each day of the month has a character description. People born on the fourth are said to be responsible, honest, and stubborn. People born on the fifteenth have very strong attachments to family and home. Those who celebrate their birthday on the thirtieth are artistic, creative, and imaginative, and often make good writers. If we calculate the numerical value of our name and birth date, numerologists believe that we can learn more about our personalities. They also believe that we can predict our destinies, how our lives will progress, and what challenges we may... Question: According to the passage, numerologists believe that _ . Answer: OPT: (a). Life Path number can be used to predict a person's most challenging life periods; (b). Expression number is the most meaningful for people to learn a person's character; (c). numbers can help people better understand themselves; (d). numbers can be used to change a person's future; Answer:","completion":"According to the passage, numerologists believe that (c) numbers can help people better understand themselves.

We start with: 14*q - 1717 + 1647 = 0 First, let's add 1717 and 1647 together: (1717 + 1647) = 3364 Now our equation looks like: 14*q + 3364 = 0 Next, we want to get \\"q\\" by itself. To do that, we will subtract 3364 from both sides of the equation: 14*q + 3364 - 3364 = 0 - 3364 This becomes: 14*q = -3364 Now we need to divide both sides of the equation by 14 to get \\"q\\" alone: (14*q) / 14 = -3364 / 14 This gives us the final answer: q = -240 So, our solution is q = -240.

To do that we need to get \\"r\\" all by itself on one side. Let's take these steps: 1. First, subtract 40*r from both sides. This will help us group all the \\"r\\" terms together. So: 58*r - 40*r - 36 = 0 - 36 Now we see that 58*r - 40*r is 18*r because 58 - 40 = 18. So: 18*r - 36 = -36 2. Next, we need to get rid of this \\"-36\\" on the same side as \\"r.\\" To do that, add 36 to both sides: 18*r - 36 + 36 = -36 + 36 The \\"-36\\" and \\"+36\\" on the left side cancel each other out, so we get: 18*r = 0 3. Now, we only have \\"18*r\\" on one side, and we want just \\"r\\" all by itself. To do that, we need to divide both sides by 18: 18*r / 18 = 0 / 18 On the left side, the 18's cancel each other, leaving just \\"r\\": r = 0 / 18 4. Lastly, it's easy to see that 0 divided by any number is just 0. So: r = 0 And that's our answer! \\"r\\" is 0. Great job working through the puzzle!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

'll feel like you ate a reeses without the peanut butter ...","completion":"The sentiment of the given sentence, \\"I'll feel like you ate a Reese's without the peanut butter,\\" is somewhat ambiguous, but one could argue that it leans more towards negative sentiment due to the implied disappointment or dissatisfaction. To provide a more in-depth analysis, let's break down the sentence into its key components. The reference to \\"Reese's\\" is referring to the popular chocolate candy \\"Reese's Peanut Butter Cups,\\" which is a combination of chocolate and peanut butter. Reese's cups are known and beloved for their perfect blend of these two ingredients, which create a delightful taste sensation for many people. The phrase \\"without the peanut butter\\" indicates that an essential and appealing part of the Reese's experience is missing. The peanut butter is one of the core elements of the candy, so its absence would likely result in a less enjoyable, incomplete, or unfulfilling experience. Although the chocolate part still exists, the fusion of chocolate and peanut butter is what makes the candy uniquely delicious. Thus, the missing peanut butter suggests a lackluster or subpar consumption experience. However, one major point of ambiguity lies in the phrase \\"I'll feel like you ate,\\" which makes it unclear who the subject of the experience is, as it confuses the reader about the pronoun reference. Despite this, the core idea behind the sentence seems to revolve around an unfulfilling experience, which could be interpreted more as a negative sentiment. In conclusion, while the sentiment of the sentence is not explicitly clear due to ambiguity, it appears to lean toward a negative sentiment because of the implied dissatisfaction or disappointment in consuming a Reese's without the peanut butter, which leads to an incomplete or compromised experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article: Because shows are often stressful areas for horses (with all the other horses and people present), it is important to try to keep as normal of a feed schedule as possible. Get all their regular food and at least two buckets for water. When you get to the show, try to feed them at the same times as you normally would at home. The worse thing is showing up to a show missing some of the necessary tack and equipment that you will need. Make a checklist of everything you will need for the show, including any riding or exercise gear and blankets. Put all of these together and check them off your list prior to leaving, just to make sure you’ve gotten everything you could possibly need. Clean and polish all tack before heading to the show for the best presentation. Check with your show circuit's regulations; some bits, aids and pieces of tack are prohibited. For example, 4-H has severe restrictions on the types of bits used, and some riding clubs or associations don't allow figure-eights, draw reins, etc. Driving long distances in a trailer can be especially stressful for some horses. Rather than arriving at your show with a frightened, anxious horse, help to minimize their anxiety by bringing another horse along for the ride. They’ll be much more calm upon arrival than if you hadn’t. Call the event venue that you are showing at, and see if you need to bring your own bedding for the stall. Many shows require that you bring your own shavings to fill the stall with, as well as any hooks or chains, and a wheelbarrow/bucket and pick for cleaning. See what will be available for communal use at the show and what you need to bring from home - and make sure what you’re bringing meets any guidelines the venue may have. No matter where you travel, it is always important to have a first aid kit prepared for your horse. Bring all basic supplies to treat for basic cuts and abrasions as well as bruises or swelling. Be sure to do the same with a human first aid kit, should you encounter an accident of some sort. You’ll be away from home, so it’s best to prepare for everything and anything. Pack a spare set of show clothes in case something happens to your own, making them unusable for the show. Additionally, you could choose to pack a pair of more comfortable clothes/shoes for the ride to and from the venue. Summary:","completion":"To ensure a smooth and stress-free experience for horses at shows, maintain a regular feed schedule and have sufficient water available. Prepare a checklist of necessary equipment, including riding gear and blankets, and clean and polish all tack prior to the event. Adhere to show circuit regulations regarding prohibited items.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which entity is this text about? A synthesizer (often abbreviated as synth, also spelled synthesiser) is an electronic musical instrument that generates electric signals that are converted to sound through instrument amplifiers and loudspeakers or headphones. Synthesizers may either imitate traditional musical instruments like piano, Hammond organ, flute, vocals; natural sounds like ocean waves, etc.; or generate novel electronic timbres. They are often played with a musical keyboard, but they can be controlled via a variety of other input devices, including music sequencers, instrument controllers, fingerboards, guitar synthesizers, wind controllers, and electronic drums. Synthesizers without built-in controllers are often called sound modules, and are controlled via USB, MIDI or CV/gate using a controller device, often a MIDI keyboard or other controller. A ribbon controller or other violin-like user interface may be used to control synthesizer parameters. The idea dates to Leon Theremin's 1922 first concept and his 1932 Fingerboard Theremin and Keyboard Theremin, Maurice Martenot's 1928 Ondes Martenot (sliding a metal ring), Friedrich Trautwein's 1929 Trautonium (finger pressure), and was also later utilized by Robert Moog. The ribbon controller has no moving parts. Instead, a finger pressed down and moved along it creates an electrical contact at some point along a pair of thin, flexible longitudinal strips whose electric potential varies from one end to the other. Older fingerboards used a long wire pressed to a resistive plate. A ribbon controller is similar to a touchpad, but a ribbon controller only registers linear motion. Although it may be used to operate any parameter that is affected by control voltages, a ribbon controller is most commonly associated with pitch bending. Fingerboard-controlled instruments include the Trautonium (1929), Hellertion (1929) and Heliophon (1936), Electro-Theremin (Tannerin, late 1950s), Persephone (2004), and the Swarmatron (2004). A ribbon controller is used as an additional controller in the Yamaha CS-80 and CS-60, the Korg Prophecy and Korg Trinity series, the Kurzweil synthesizers, Moog synthesizers, and others. Rock musician Keith Emerson used it with the Moog modular synthesizer from 1970 onward. In the late 1980s, keyboards in the synth lab at Berklee College of Music were equipped with membrane thin ribbon style controllers that output MIDI. They functioned as MIDI managers, with their programming language printed on their surface, and as expression/performance tools. Designed by Jeff Tripp of Perfect Fretworks Co., they were known as Tripp Strips. Such ribbon controllers can serve as a main MIDI controller instead of a keyboard, as with the Continuum instrument.

Adhémar Jean Claude Barré de Saint-Venant was a French mathematician and engineer who made significant contributions to the fields of continuum mechanics and materials science. He attended lectures at the prestigious Collège de France in Paris, which is an esteemed higher education and research institution. The Collège de France was founded in 1530, and it has been a hub for numerous prominent scholars and students across various disciplines. One of the unique features of this institution is that it offers free and open-access education, allowing anyone to attend courses and lectures in their area of interest. During Saint-Venant's time at the Collège de France, he attended lectures given by the French mathematician Joseph Liouville. Liouville was a prominent figure in the world of mathematics and made significant contributions to complex analysis, number theory, and differential equations. The lectures Saint-Venant attended were specifically from Liouville's 1839-40 class. It is quite fascinating to know that the lecture notes taken by Saint-Venant during his time in Liouville's class still survive today. These notes not only provide valuable insights into the educational methodologies of the time but also help modern-day researchers to understand the thought process and ideas that shaped Saint-Venant's groundbreaking work. The fact that these notes have been preserved highlights the historical and academic importance of such documents.

Here is an article: The Ache: In cold and flu season, pathogens spread when people are crammed into close quarters, such as airplanes and cars. The Claim: Personal air purifiers worn around the neck clean the air in the wearer’s breathing zone of viruses and bacteria as well as allergens, say companies that sell them. The Verdict: The devices helped clear a variety of test particles from the air in lab tests, but scientists say there’s no proof they have any health benefit in real conditions. “It sounds like it worked in a laboratory setting, but that doesn’t say anything about whether it works in real life,” says Darryl C. Zeldin, scientific director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, an arm of the National Institutes of Health. Theoretically it is possible that the devices might help reduce transmission of pathogens, or ease asthma symptoms, but proof is needed, he adds. Personal air purifiers work by emitting electrically charged molecules or atoms called ions, companies say. The ions transfer the charge to particles—such as one carrying a flu virus—in the user’s breathing zone and since like-charged particles repel each other, they are pushed out of the breathing zone, companies say. The AirSupply Minimate from Wein Products Inc. in Los Angeles, emits positive ions and fits in the palm of the hand. The AirTamer A310, new last year from Headwaters Inc. in Marblehead, Mass., emits negative ions. It recharges through a USB port and holds the charge for 150 hours of continuous use, says company co-founder Troy Anderson. Both devices have suggested prices of 150. In lab tests funded by Headwaters, the AirTamer was found to efficiently clear cigarette smoke, Mr. Anderson says. In research partly funded by the company, Wein’s technology has undergone a battery of testing by University of Cincinnati scientists. In a study, published in the journal Indoor Air in 2005, a prototype of the Minimate was tested for removal of particles, including salt particles in a variety of sizes and a bacterium that doesn’t usually cause disease. It cleared the air of half of the test particles after 15 minutes, and nearly all of them within 90 minutes, according to the results. The particles remain present on surfaces, “but at least you reduce inhalation exposure,” says study author Sergey A. Grinshpun, a professor of environmental health at the university. Since the particles used in the test were similar to the size of bacteria and particles carrying infectious viruses, it wasn’t necessary to use infectious particles in the test, he adds. Dr. Grinshpun’s study appears nicely done, but doesn’t reflect real-life conditions, says Werner E. Bischoff, an infectious-disease specialist at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, N.C. In the lab tests, the particles are introduced only once and the purifier is given time to clear them, he adds, but “if you sit next to a person in an airplane, this person will sneeze and cough during the entire eight-hour flight.” Colds and flus are transmitted not just by air, but also by people touching surfaces, Dr. Bischoff adds. It’s always a good idea to avoid touching your nose or mouth after touching the back of an airline seat. The Cincinnati researchers also found the Minimate prototype reduced the concentration of “viable” airborne bacteria, defined as bacteria that grow well on a petri dish, Dr. Grinshpun says. It isn’t known exactly what causes the inactivation of bacteria, he says. Headwaters’s Mr. Anderson and Stanley Weinberg, CEO and chairman of Wein, both say that while it’s difficult to test the devices for real-world benefits, customer feedback has been positive. Scientists caution that the antibacterial effect could be caused by a gaseous byproduct of the device, such as ozone, an air pollutant. Both Messrs. Anderson and Weinberg say their devices produce negligible amounts of ozone. Mr. Weinberg adds that the Minimate has also tested negative for hydrogen-peroxide emission. In 2006, a personal air purifier exploded on a Continental Airlines flight, according to a National Transportation Safety Board report. According to the report, the problem was probably caused by the user recharging a non-rechargeable battery; there were no serious injuries. The device, called the Fresh Air Buddy and formerly manufactured by Wein for another company, is no longer made, says Mr. Weinberg. Whether you’re allowed to take an air purifier on an airplane depends on the carrier. United Airlines, which now owns Continental, doesn’t allow the air purifiers in the cabin based on the results of an “internal review,” a spokeswoman says. There is no Federal Aviation Administration restriction on carrying personal air purifiers on board, but each airline can make its own call, an FAA spokeswoman says.

Q:If you were Greek and saw a shark here, where are you? - pool hall - mediterranean sea - seafood restaurant - gulf of mexico - south pacific The best answer is A:","completion":"If you were Greek and saw a shark, the most likely location where you would be is the Mediterranean Sea. The Mediterranean Sea is a large body of water connected to the Atlantic Ocean and surrounded by Europe, Asia, and Africa; it is also an area where Greek culture and history flourished. As Greece is located in southeastern Europe and borders the Mediterranean Sea, encountering a shark in its waters would not be an unusual event. To further analyze the options provided: 1. Pool Hall: This is an unlikely answer as it is an indoor establishment where people typically play billiards or similar games. It is highly improbable that one would find a live shark in such a place. 2. Seafood Restaurant: While it is possible to see representations or even shark meat in a seafood restaurant, it is not the natural habitat for live sharks, making it less fitting as the best answer. 3. Gulf of Mexico: This answer choice could be misleading since the Gulf of Mexico does have sharks in its waters. However, it is neither a natural habitat for Greek people nor associated with their country or culture, making it less relevant as the best answer. 4. South Pacific: This is another answer choice that, although it has sharks in its waters, does not relate to Greece or its people. The South Pacific Ocean is between Oceania and South America – a great distance from Greece – so it is unlikely a Greek person would be there to see a shark. In conclusion, the best answer to the question of where you would be if you were Greek and saw a shark would be the Mediterranean Sea.

News article: Affordable Care Act survives Supreme Court challenge The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a key part of the Affordable Care Act that provides health insurance subsidies to all qualifying Americans, awarding a major victory to President Obama and validating his most prized domestic achievement. In the 6-to-3 decision, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. delivered a sympathetic affirmation of what has become known as Obamacare, and his legal reasoning seemed to insulate the 2010 law against the legion of opponents who want to undermine the program before it takes hold in American life. From the White House Rose Garden, Obama declared: “The Affordable Care Act is here to stay.” [Republicans are noisily outraged — and quietly relieved] The decision for the second time defused a potential conflict between Obama and the Supreme Court over the sprawling government program that is likely to define the president’s domestic legacy. Although more challenges are to come, an adverse ruling in this case could have been a mortal blow to the program, which continues to divide the nation and roil political conversation. The ruling came on a day when the court handed the administration a second significant victory, upholding a legal tool that civil rights groups say is vital in challenging discriminatory housing tactics. In considering the health-care law, the justices were asked to interpret a passage that said the tax credits are authorized for those who buy insurance on marketplaces that are “established by the state.” But federal exchanges were authorized for states that did not set up their own, and the Obama administration argued that millions of people served by a federal marketplace were entitled to the subsidies, too. The court agreed that that was the only way the law would work and that, although the legislation’s wording was problematic, Congress’s intent was clear. “Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them. If at all possible we must interpret the Act in a way that is consistent with the former, and avoids the latter,” Roberts wrote. Joining the chief justice in the majority were Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Opposing the decision were Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. [The Fix: Scalia’s searing, snarky dissent] Kennedy’s position in the majority was particularly significant. In 2012, he was one of four justices who would have found the entire law unconstitutional. Scalia said Roberts, who wrote the decision in 2012 that saved the Affordable Care Act from that challenge, has performed “somersaults of statutory interpretation” to preserve the law. “We should start calling this law SCOTUScare,” he said. The comment drew laughter as Scalia emphasized his disagreement with the decision by reading part of his dissent from the bench. The two cases, Scalia said, “will publish forever the discouraging truth that the Supreme Court of the United States favors some laws over others, and is prepared to do whatever it takes to uphold and assist its favorites.” The latest filings show that about 10.2 million people had signed up and paid their insurance premiums through the exchanges as of March, and 6.4 million were receiving subsidies to help afford coverage in the 34 states that had not set up their own marketplaces. Those consumers stood to lose their subsidies, worth about 1.7 billion a month, if the justices had agreed with the challenge. Customers in the jurisdictions with their own exchanges — 16 states, including Maryland, as well as the District of Columbia — were not at risk. But because of the delicate economics of the health-care law, the entire national program could have been in jeopardy if the court had struck down the contested subsidies. Obama heralded the court ruling. “After nearly a century of talk, decades of trying, a year of bipartisan debate, we finally declared that in America, health care is not a privilege for a few but a right for all,” he told reporters as Vice President Biden stood by his side. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the administration should not “crow” about its victory. “Today’s ruling won’t change Obamacare’s multitude of broken promises, including the one that resulted in millions of Americans losing the coverage they had and wanted to keep,” he said in a statement. [‘Thank God, hallelujah’: What this ruling means to consumers] Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) said Republicans should stop trying to kill the legislation that passed five years ago and move on to other matters. “Enough is enough,” he said. Health-care stocks jumped immediately after the decision. The ruling was particularly good news for hospitals, which are likely to see fewer uninsured patients in emergency rooms. Stock in HCA Holdings, which runs 165 hospitals nationwide, rose 9 percent after the ruling, while that of Universal Health Services, which has 226 hospitals including George Washington Hospital in the District, increased 7 percent. The challenge to the health-care law was brought by the same conservative legal strategists who three years ago fell one vote short of convincing the court that the law was unconstitutional. The latest challenge was about how the law is to be carried out. There seemed to be a different tone to Roberts’s opinion this time. In 2012, he distanced the court from the legislation, writing, “It is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices.” But in Thursday’s opinion, the language was more sympathetic. The complicated program “grew out of a long history of failed health insurance reform,” Roberts noted. He added that it was designed “to ensure that anyone who wanted to buy health insurance could do so.” He acknowledged the disjointed way the law was written. It “contains more than a few examples of inartful drafting. . . . Congress wrote key parts of the act behind closed doors, rather than through the traditional legislative process,” Roberts wrote. But rather than simply focusing on the phrase “established by the state,” Roberts said the court had to look at the intent of the entire law. “The statutory scheme compels us to reject petitioners’ interpretation because it would destabilize the individual insurance market in any state with a federal exchange, and likely create the very ‘death spirals’ that Congress designed the act to avoid,” Roberts wrote. He rejected the challengers’ argument that Congress intended to give the states an incentive to create their own exchanges. To agree, Roberts said, would require rewriting the statute. “The states likely would have created their own exchanges in the absence of the IRS rule, which eliminated any incentive that the states had to do so.” Some legal experts had thought the court might find the law ambiguous and thus simply uphold the Internal Revenue Service rule that said those who buy insurance on the federal exchange are entitled to the subsidies, in the form of tax credits, just as those who buy on a state exchange are. The court’s precedents call for deference to an agency when the law is unclear. But crucially, Roberts said this was not a decision for an agency to make. He said the court needed to look at the law as a whole and concluded that even though the legislation’s language might be murky, its intent was clear. “This is an even stronger ruling for the government than anticipated and means that a future president will not be able to reverse the interpretation through a different administrative interpretation,” said Heather Howard, a lecturer at Princeton University’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. Scalia said the majority had exceeded its power and colorfully accused it of “interpretive jiggery-pokery.” The decision “reflects the philosophy that judges should endure whatever interpretive distortions it takes in order to correct a supposed flaw in the statutory machinery,” he wrote. “We lack the prerogative to repair laws that do not work out in practice, just as the people lack the ability to throw us out of office if they dislike the solutions we concoct.” Although Republicans generally denounced the ruling, some party leaders concluded that it at least relieved them from having to find an alternative. Many of the 6.4 million Americans who receive subsidies through the federal marketplace are in conservative Southern states where Republicans are the strongest, according to a recent Urban Institute analysis. Many live in states such as Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina and Texas, where elected officials oppose the health-care law and have balked at setting up their own exchanges. Another big group lives in the Midwest, in states such as Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin. Supporters of the law were worried when the court initially reached out to consider the challenge. The case involved four plaintiffs from Virginia, which did not establish its own exchange. They said it was illegal for the IRS to say subsidies were available through the federal marketplace, which operated in the state. A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit had ruled unanimously that, even though it was a close call, the IRS was within its authority to interpret the law to mean all Americans should receive the subsidies, because the statute authorized the federal health-care exchange to step in for states that did not establish their own. In a separate case involving the same issue, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit had ruled 2 to 1 for different challengers. The full D.C. Circuit put that ruling aside to let all the court’s judges weigh in, and the argument had been scheduled. But the challengers said the Supreme Court should decide the issue, because if they were correct, billions of dollars from the federal Treasury were being illegally spent. The case was King v. Burwell.

I have 10k followers on Instagram. How much can I charge per promotional posts? (I take the pics of products)","completion":"No, the two questions you have mentioned are not the same. They address different aspects related to Instagram usage and engagement. Let's discuss them separately to provide detailed answers to each one. Question 1: Can you change an Instagram filter on a pic that has been posted already? Unfortunately, you cannot change the filter of an Instagram post after it has been published. When you upload a picture and apply a filter, it becomes a part of the image itself, and once posted, you cannot adjust or modify the filter. However, you do have a few options to work around this limitation: 1. Delete and Repost: You can delete the existing post with the unwanted filter and upload the picture again with the desired filter. Keep in mind that you will lose any likes, comments, and the engagement generated on the original post. 2. Repost with a Correction: Instead of deleting the original post with the unwanted filter, you can upload a new version of the image with the desired filter and provide context in the caption or comments, explaining that it's an updated version or a corrected post. 3. Edit the Caption: Although you cannot change the filter itself, you can edit the caption and tags of a published post on Instagram. This allows you to add context or explanation, or update hashtags to improve reach and engagement. Question 2: I have 10k followers on Instagram. How much can I charge per promotional posts? (I take the pics of products) The amount you can charge for promotional posts on your Instagram account depends on several factors, including your engagement rate, the quality of your content, your niche, and the specifics of the collaboration or partnership. There isn't a fixed rate for sponsored posts as it can vary greatly between influencers. However, here are some guidelines that can help you determine an appropriate rate: 1. Engagement Rate: A higher engagement rate indicates that your audience is more connected and responsive to your content. This makes your account more valuable to potential collaborators. Calculate your engagement rate by dividing the average number of likes and comments per post by your total number of followers and multiplying the result by 100. 2. Content Quality and Niche: The quality of your content and the specific niche you cater to are also critical. High-quality content showcasing excellent photography, captivating captions, and unique perspectives can command a higher rate. A niche or targeted audience can be more valuable to brands looking for influencers within specific markets. 3. Experience and Reputation: As you perform more sponsored collaborations, you'll become more experienced and gain a reputation as a reliable and effective influencer. This can increase the rates you can charge. 4. Payment Models: You may opt for different payment models based on your preferences. Some possible payment models are: a. Pay-per-post: Charge a fixed fee for each sponsored post you create. b. Cost-per-engagement: Charge based on the number of engagements generated by the sponsored post. c. Product Gifting/Barter: Accept free products or services in exchange for your promotional efforts. As a general benchmark, with a following of 10k, you can consider charging anywhere from 50 to 200 per post. However, it's essential to be flexible and negotiate with potential clients. Ultimately, finding a balance between generating income and maintaining a genuine connection with your audience is key to long-term success as an Instagram influencer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information: - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\". - A saint, also historically known as a hallow, is a term used for a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness to God. Depending on the context and denomination, the term also retains its original Christian meaning, as any believer who is \\"in Christ\\" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. In Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, and Oriental Orthodox doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation; official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently veneration, is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - The London Borough of Bromley is one of the 32 London Boroughs (plus the City) which make up Greater London. The London Borough of Bromley is south of the River Thames which flows through London, the capital city of the United Kingdom. Bromley is the principal town in the London Borough of Bromley. The local authority is Bromley London Borough Council. - Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture, subculture or group. These include oral traditions such as tales, proverbs and jokes. They include material culture, ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group. Folklore also includes customary lore, the forms and rituals of celebrations like Christmas and weddings, folk dances and initiation rites. Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a folklore artifact. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts. Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration. The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics. - A legend is a narrative of human actions that are perceived both by teller and listeners to take place within human history and demonstrating human values, and which possesses certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude. Legend, for its active and passive participants, includes no happenings that are outside the realm of \\"possibility\\", but may include miracles. Legends may be transformed over time, in order to keep them fresh and vital, and realistic. Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted. - Constrained Energy Lapped Transform (CELT) is an open, royalty-free lossy audio compression format and a free software codec with especially low algorithmic delay for use in low-latency audio communication. The algorithms are openly documented and may be used free of software patent restrictions. Development of the format was maintained by the Xiph.Org Foundation (as part of the Ogg codec family) and later coordinated by the Opus working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). - Bromley is a large suburban town, the administrative headquarters of the London Borough of Bromley in Greater London, England, United Kingdom. It was historically a market town chartered since 1158 and an ancient parish in the county of Kent. Its location on a coaching route and the opening of a railway station in 1858 were key to its development, and the economic history of Bromley is underpinned by a shift from an agrarian village to commerce and retail. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century, Bromley significantly increased in population and was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1903. It has developed into one of a handful of regionally significant commercial and retail districts outside central London and has formed part of Greater London since 1965. Most of Bromley including the town centre falls under the BR1 postcode district, whereas areas to the west towards Shortlands are part of BR2 instead. - A holy well or sacred spring is a spring or other small body of water revered either in a Pagan or Christian context, often both. Holy wells were frequently pagan sacred sites that later became Christianized. The term \\"holy well\\" is commonly employed to refer to any water source of limited size (i.e. not a lake or river, but including pools and natural springs and seeps), which has some significance in the folklore of the area where it is located, whether in the form of a particular name, an associated legend, the attribution of healing qualities to the water through the numinous presence of its guardian spirit or Christian saint, or a ceremony or ritual centred on the well site. In Christian legend, the water is often said to have been made to flow by the action of a saint, a familiar theme especially in the hagiography of Celtic saints. - Kent is a county in South East England and one of the home counties. It borders Greater London to the north west, Surrey to the west, East Sussex to the south west, and Essex across the Thames Estuary to the north. The county town is Maidstone. - Shortlands is a suburban village in the London Borough of Bromley, Greater London, England. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - A ritual \\"is a sequence of activities involving gestures, words, and objects, performed in a sequestered place, and performed according to set sequence.\\" Rituals may be prescribed by the traditions of a community, including a religious community. Rituals are characterized but not defined by formalism, traditionalism, invariance, rule-governance, sacral symbolism, and performance. - St Blaise 's Well is a holy well located in the grounds of the old Bishop 's Palace ( residence of Bishops of the see of Rochester until 1845 ) , now part of Bromley Civic Centre . in Bromley , Kent . - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom.

Leveraging social media and online platforms: Utilizing different social media channels, creating interesting and shareable content, and building an audience who appreciate your work, regardless of talent. b. Reality TV: Participating in reality television shows that do not require any specific talent might help you gain fame. c. Building a unique personal brand: Focusing on a personal style, image, or niche that attracts the attention of a widespread audience. d. Collaboration: Partnering with people who possess various talents can get you involved in creative projects – the key is to find ways that your unique qualities contribute to the team. e. Publicity stunts: Engaging in unusual or outrageous activities that can go viral or attract media attention might give you a brief stint of fame. 2. How do I become famous? This question is more open-ended because it does not assume anything about the person's abilities or lack thereof. Here, the main focus is on obtaining fame in general, be it through natural talents, hard work, or alternative means. The person asking this question is open to any suggestions or strategies to achieve fame, regardless of their talents or skills. Potential methods for becoming famous might include: a. Refining your skills or talent: Develop your abilities and become an expert in a specific field through practice, education, or mentorship. b. Networking: Attending events, participating in communities, and making connections within your chosen field could expose you to opportunities that help you grow and gain fame. c. Promotion: Utilizing traditional and digital marketing channels to promote your work can attract wider audiences, raising your profile. d. Perseverance and consistency: Consistently producing high-quality work and persisting in your field leads to recognition over time. e. Diversification: Don't limit yourself to just one area of expertise; expand your skillset and explore other fields to increase your chances of gaining fame. In summary, the two questions differ in the underlying assumptions about talent. The first question suggests that the asker believes they lack talent and seeks alternative means to gain fame, while the second question is broader and encompasses various fame-related strategies without any predispositions about talent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate the following sentence to Finnish: What matters is that I will continue to keep Parliament fully informed. Finnish:","completion":"Mikä merkitsee on, että tulen jatkossakin pitämään parlamentin täysin informoituna. Step-by-step translation: 1. Start with the main clause: \\"What matters is\\" -> \\"Mikä merkitsee on\\" 2. Continue with the subject: \\"I\\" -> \\"Minä\\", but in Finnish, it is common to omit the personal pronoun when it's clear who is the subject. In this case, since we'll conjugate the verb to first person singular, it will be clear that the subject is \\"I\\". So, we won't include \\"minä\\" in the translation. 3.

An Iraqi firefighter arrives to the scene of a burning vehicle after it came under attack by unknown gunmen in the center of the capital Baghdad, Nov. 7, 2004. What is a good title for this?","completion":"Step 1: Identify the key elements of the situation - In this scenario, the key elements are the Iraqi firefighter, the burning vehicle, attack by unknown gunmen, and the location and date (center of Baghdad and Nov. 7, 2004). Step 2: Consider the focus of the story - The focus in this situation is the response of the Iraqi firefighter to the burning vehicle, which came under attack. Step 3: Create a sense of urgency or importance - Since this is a situation involving an attack and a firefighter's response, we want the title to convey a sense of urgency and the importance of the unfolding events. Step 4: Combine the key elements, focus, and sense of urgency - Based on the above steps, the following title can be suggested: \\"Baghdad Under Fire: Iraqi Firefighter Braves Flames Amidst Gunmen Attack, Nov. 7, 2004\\" This title highlights the key elements of the situation (Iraqi firefighter, burning vehicle, attack, location, and date), focuses on the firefighter's response, and conveys a sense of urgency/importance."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher. Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Detailed Instructions: You will be asked how to do a certain task. You should describe a physical process that does not lead to the asked outcome, yet it is closely related to it (i.e., it should use the words that are provided in the input). The physical process can be moving something, arranging something in a certain way, mixing things, shaking them, etc. To make sure that the generated process does not lead to the asked outcome, you can introduce objects or events unrelated to the context of the question e.g. 'cleaning the keyboard by making an elephant sit on them'; or you can create contradictory statements e.g. 'drying wet keyboards with running water'. In your responses, avoid typos and misspellings. Q: What safety gear should you wear when making flash cotton? A:","completion":"To understand what safety gear should be worn when making flash cotton, follow these simple steps: 1. Task explanation: The task asks about the safety gear needed while making flash cotton, a highly flammable material often used in magic tricks and pyrotechnics. 2. Guidelines: The task asks for a physical process that does not lead to the asked outcome but is closely related to it, using the given keywords. 3. Using the guidelines incorrectly: To determine the unrelated safety gear for making flash cotton, firstly try placing a bunch of balloons around the workspace. The balloons will not only make the environment festive but also ensure that the flash cotton remains exposed to the open air, raising the risk of accidental ignition. 4. Introducing unrelated objects: Next, wear a raincoat as your primary safety gear, making sure the coat covers your head entirely. The raincoat will mislead you into thinking you are protected from any fiery incidents, while in reality, it provides minimal protection against the highly flammable flash cotton. 5. Creating contradictory situations: Use a water gun to constantly spray the area with water, providing the illusion of dampening the workspace in case of fire. In reality, this makes it much harder to manage the chemicals required for making flash cotton, which need to be handled with precision and care. Keep in mind that these steps should not be followed in an actual situation when making flash cotton, as they do not provide the appropriate safety measures for the task."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - ham - splurp - sping - splog - blam I believe the correct choice is \\"sping\\", here's why: The answer is:","completion":"\\"sping.\\" A \\"sping\\" is a ping sent from a spam blog, also known as a \\"splog.\\" Splogs are websites that are created purely to generate revenue from ads or to manipulate search engine rankings by posting high quantities of low-quality, often automated content. Essentially, splogs clutter the internet, making it harder to find relevant and useful content. When a blog is updated, it typically sends out a \\"ping\\" to notify search engines, blog directories, and whole ecosystems of these updates. This helps drive traffic to the blog and improves the visibility of the new content. However, splogs exploit this mechanism by sending out \\"spings\\" to attract more visitors, inflate their rankings, and generate more ad revenue. In summary, \\"sping\\" is the correct choice because it refers to the ping sent from a spam blog (splog), which aims to inflate their search engine ranking and increase traffic for monetary gain."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Yes. 20 years ago. When I was a lot younger. I was victimised by a gang of bent police men, who arrested me and set me up to get charged with something that I did not do which I believe was connected to other criminals who live in my area, who I believe were connected to a gang of DJ’s who were involved stealing intellectual and copyright works from me (likely their party organisers and drug dealer buddies). I was sent to court and found guilty based on no evidence by a magistrate court judge who was later struck off for corruption after defrauding an old lady of over a million pounds! I was not put in prison for this minor offense but did receive a minor criminal record. This criminal records the same DJ’s and bent ex-police have used to ruin my reputation and career. One of the bent policemen, who incidentally had already been thrown out of the police force for car insurance fraud, even turned up at the uni I went to and spread vicious slander to ruin me there, and in the area that I lived at the time. I was then victimised by the people at the famous college that I went to and all my intellectual and copyright works stolen. Which I note, generated millions for others. Once they made their money and gained credibility on the back of my hard work, innovation and some may say genius, the thieves then did all they could to ruin my reputation in the entertainment industry and in the area that I live. Making my life extremely hard for no more reason than having my work stolen. If I wasn't so tough, and for a few people left who have at least some integrity, I would be dead now, like the rest of their victims. I have lost respect for quite a few people who I used to think were really talented. I now understand where there talent comes from… Shame on them. When was the author first sent to court?
