Chungaung Piao, 27, of Allenby Gardens in Adelaide's west, appeared in the Adelaide Magistrates Court on Monday after being arrested on Saturday. He is charged with murdering sex worker Ting Fang, 25, whose body was found in a room at the Grand Chancellor Hotel in the city centre. Scroll down for video. Ting Fang, 25, was found murdered in an Adelaide city hotel room with a slashed neck on New Year's Day. Chungaung Piao, 27, of Allenby Gardens, appeared in the Adelaide Magistrates Court two days after he was arrested. He has been charged with Fang's murder. Ms Fang was found deceased in the hotel room with her neck slashed open. The court heard that, 'there was an extremely serious injury to (Ms Fang's) neck, both her (internal and external) jugular veins were cut,' she said. Police at the time said she had been in Adelaide for three or four days. It's understood she was working as a sex worker. Prosecutor Lucy Boord alleged that Piao's fingerprint was found on the victim's shoe, according to the Adelaide Advertiser. Defence lawyer Julian Kelly said Piao denied involvement in the murder. Police at the time said she had been in Adelaide for three or four days. It's understood she was working as a sex worker. Ms Fang was found deceased in the Hotel Grand Chancellor Hotel when the hallway and the level below her twelfth-floor apartment began to flood. A tap was running in the room where she'd been killed. Ms Fang was found murdered in her twelfth-floor hotel room in Adelaide's city. 'My client voluntarily attended the police station on Saturday night... the fingerprint as I understand was found on a shoe, which is not inconsistent with his version of events to police,' Mr Kelly said. The court heard that Piao is married with an eight-month-old son. He is a Chinese national and has been living in Australia for four years on a bridging visa. For this reason, the magistrate Luke Davis ruled that Piao is a flight risk and he was refused bail, according to the Advertiser. The 27-year-old was seeking release on home detention bail so he could return to his family. Piao was remanded in custody until January 19 when he will formally apply for bail. The man who has been charged with her murder, Chungaung Piao, is a 27-year-old father-of-one who is from Allenby Gardens in Adelaide's west. Police at the time said she had been in Adelaide for three or four days. It's understood she was working as a sex-worker. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"A man named Chungaung Piao is accused of murdering a woman named Ting Fang. Piao is 27 years old, and he was arrested and went to court. The woman, Ting Fang, was 25 years old and she was found dead in a hotel room. Piao's fingerprint was found on Ting Fang's shoe, but Piao says he didn't do it. The judge decided that Piao cannot leave jail yet, because they think he might try to run away.

Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Bogota is a very old country\\"?","completion":"Based on the paragraph provided, we cannot conclude that \\"Bogota is a very old country.\\" In fact, there is a misconception in the statement itself: Bogota is not a country; it is the capital city of Colombia, a country located in South America. The paragraph discusses attacks in Bogota attributed to drug trafficking cartels. Moreover, it informs the reader about bombings that took place in the offices of various political parties and a bank office. While this information grants insight into the political violence and conflict occurring in Bogota at that time, it does not provide any details about the city's age or history. To understand Bogota's history and whether it could be considered \\"very old,\\" one must delve into the origins of the city. Bogota was founded on August 6, 1538, by Spanish conquistador Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada. Its original name was \\"Bacatá\\" in the indigenous Muisca language, referring to the powerful zipa or king who ruled in this region. Bogota then became an important hub for trade and administration during the Spanish colonial period. While over 480 years of history can be considered \\"old,\\" it's important to note this age is specific to the city rather than the country. Furthermore, age perception is subjective; what is considered old in one context could be seen as relatively young in another, especially when compared to ancient civilizations with histories spanning thousands of years. Thus, while Bogota possesses a rich historical background, it may not be accurate to label it as a \\"very old country,\\" especially since it is not a country but rather the capital city of Colombia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Queen are a British rock band that formed in London in 1970. Their classic line-up was Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (lead guitar, vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals), and John Deacon (bass guitar). Queen's earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock, into their music. At the end of 2004, May and Taylor announced that they would reunite and return to touring in 2005 with Paul Rodgers (founder and former lead singer of Free and Bad Company). Brian May's website also stated that Rodgers would be \\"featured with\\" Queen as \\"Queen + Paul Rodgers\\", not replacing Mercury. The retired John Deacon would not be participating. In November 2004, Queen were among the inaugural inductees into the UK Music Hall of Fame, and the award ceremony was the first event at which Rodgers joined May and Taylor as vocalist. Between 2005 and 2006, Queen + Paul Rodgers embarked on a world tour, which was the first time Queen toured since their last tour with Freddie Mercury in 1986. The band's drummer Roger Taylor commented; \\"We never thought we would tour again, Paul [Rodgers] came along by chance and we seemed to have a chemistry. Paul is just such a great singer. He's not trying to be Freddie.\\" The first leg was in Europe, the second in Japan, and the third in the US in 2006. Queen received the inaugural VH1 Rock Honors at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 25 May 2006. The Foo Fighters paid homage to the band in performing \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\" to open the ceremony before being joined on stage by May, Taylor, and Paul Rodgers, who played a selection of Queen hits. On 15 August 2006, Brian May confirmed through his website and fan club that Queen + Paul Rodgers would begin producing their first studio album beginning in October, to be recorded at a \\"secret location\\". Queen + Paul Rodgers performed at the Nelson Mandela 90th Birthday Tribute held in Hyde Park, London on 27 June 2008, to commemorate Mandela's ninetieth birthday, and again promote awareness of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The first Queen + Paul Rodgers album, titled The Cosmos Rocks, was released in Europe on 12 September 2008 and in the United States on 28 October 2008. Following the release of the album, the band again went on a tour through Europe, opening on Kharkiv's Freedom Square in front of 350,000 Ukrainian fans. The Kharkiv concert was later released on DVD. The tour then moved to Russia, and the band performed two sold-out shows at the Moscow Arena. Having completed the first leg of its extensive European tour, which saw the band play 15 sold-out dates across nine countries, the UK leg of the tour sold out within 90 minutes of going on sale and included three London dates, the first of which was The O2 on 13 October. The last leg of the tour took place in South America, and included a sold-out concert at the Estadio Jose Amalfitani, Buenos Aires. Queen and Paul Rodgers officially split up without animosity on 12 May 2009. Rodgers stated: \\"My arrangement with [Queen] was similar to my arrangement with Jimmy [Page] in The Firm in that it was never meant to be a permanent arrangement\\". Rodgers did not rule out the possibility of working with Queen again.","completion":"This text is about the British rock band, Queen, and their various line-ups and collaborations over the years, including the period when they teamed up with Paul Rodgers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer this question: who sings love grows where my rosemary grows??","completion":"\\"Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)\\" is a popular song performed by the English band Edison Lighthouse. The band, formed in 1969, featured singer Tony Burrows as its main vocalist. This hit single, released in 1970, was written by the successful British songwriting duo, Barry Mason and Tony Macaulay. The song quickly achieved commercial success, reaching the number one spot on the UK Singles Chart and peaking at number five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States. It became Edison Lighthouse's signature song, as well as their biggest hit. The catchy tune and memorable chorus have made this song a classic of its time. Although Tony Burrows played a pivotal role in the success of \\"Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes),\\" he would not remain part of Edison Lighthouse for long. After a brief period, Burrows would depart the band to focus on his other musical projects, such as The Pipkins, First Class, and Brotherhood of Man. Nonetheless, Edison Lighthouse continued to make music without him, albeit with limited success compared to their early chart-topping hit. In summary, \\"Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)\\" is a much-loved track sung by Tony Burrows of Edison Lighthouse, with songwriting credits going to Barry Mason and Tony Macaulay.

Moreover, the reviewer explicitly presents their disapproval of putting words to \\"Deborah's Theme\\" from Once Upon A Time in America, referring to this action as a \\"crime.\\" The title of the review itself is a strong indication of the negative feedback – \\"Absolutely Awful.\\" This emphasizes the reviewer's complete dissatisfaction with the product.

Belafonte is great as a Brandoesque, menacing, swearing spirit who must earn his wings but is realistically ill-equipped from his past life to do so. He learns too late how empty his hustling, materialistic life was without love. Mostel is likewise great as an anguished man with his dying wife Fanny. In spite of his prayers for a miracle, his bitterness prevents him from accepting (or believing) in one. The two social worlds the characters represent alternately collide and complement the other, the result being hilarious and touchingly sad. The perplexing ending is actually quite consistent with the rest of the film. After looking everywhere for Belafonte, Mostel looks up to see a falling feather, and he frantically reaches for it as if he's finally willing to believe in angels and miracles. But Belafonte wasn't allowed to finish his miracle (either to restore Fanny's health or Mostel's faith), so he never got his wings. The feather floats tauntingly out of Mostel's grasp, a metaphor for both men's live: it's too late and you don't get a second chance.

The given information highlights that the data being discussed is notably higher than the estimates derived from the Canada Nutrition Survey conducted in 1973. The estimated seafood consumption from this survey ranged between 0.6 grams and 2.2 grams per day. However, it is crucial to understand that the disparity in the values could primarily be attributed to the methodology employed in the 24-hour recall survey. A 24-hour recall survey does not provide an accurate representation of actual seafood consumption, mainly because it only takes into account a small percentage of seafood consumers. This is due to the fact that the frequency of seafood consumption is generally low. Therefore, through a survey conducted in such a short timeframe, it becomes challenging to gauge the true extent of seafood consumption across the population.

In an outcome few could have imagined several weeks ago, Jones defeated controversial Republican candidate Roy Moore, who had the backing of President Donald Trump. In the wake of Jones' victory, Democrats are more confident about success in next year's congressional midterm elections, and Republicans are looking for a way to rebound. Late Tuesday, Jones paid tribute to the voters and staffers who supported him in his longshot victory over Moore. \\"This campaign has been about common courtesy and decency and making sure everyone in this state, regardless of which ZIP code you live in, is going to get a fair shake in life!\\" he told supporters. Moore was unable to overcome allegations of sexual misconduct stemming back decades involving several women who were teenagers at the time while Moore was in his 30s. Moore stopped short of conceding the race, however, saying, \\"We have been painted in an unfavorable and unfaithful light. We have been put in a hole, if you will, and it reminds me of a [Bible] passage in Psalms 40, 'I waited patiently for the Lord.' That is what we have got to do.\\" Moore had the full backing of the president in the final days of the campaign after Trump initially held back his endorsement in the wake of the allegations against Moore. The president responded Wednesday to questions at the White House about the Alabama race and said that he had hoped for a different result. \\"I wish we would have gotten the seat. A lot of Republicans feel differently. They are very happy with the way it turned out,\\" he said. \\"But as the leader of the party, I would have liked to have the seat. I want to endorse the people who are running.\\" Jones won in large part because of a strong Democratic turnout, especially by African-Americans.

Politics The CNBC Republican Debate Was A Total Trainwreck CREDIT: AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill John Kasich, left, and Donald Trump, second from right, argue across fellow candidates during the CNBC Republican presidential debate at the University of Colorado, Wednesday, Oct. 28, 2015, in Boulder, Colo. Reporters from both conservative and liberal-minded news organizations seem to agree: the CNBC Republican presidential debate was kind of a trainwreck. That wasn’t really because of the candidates, though — it was because of the moderators. For the first hour, CNBC moderators Becky Quick, John Harwood, and Carl Quintanilla didn’t let candidates interact with each other, resulting in multiple moments of incomprehensible yelling. This may have been because of stricter time limits — this particular 10-candidate debate was only two hours, while the previous Republican debates have spanned three hours. But constant interruption wasn’t the only problem. Candidates were also highly critical of the CNBC crew, accusing them of being part of the “liberal media.” At one point, Ted Cruz ripped into the moderators for asking what he called unfair and non-substantive questions. And in two instances, audience members actually booed at questions the moderators asked of Ben Carson and Mike Huckabee. There was even a moment when moderator Becky Quick admitted she was unsure of Donald Trump’s position on high-skill immigrant visas after questioning him about it. She first asserted that Trump was critical of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg, who wanted to increase H-1B visas for highly skilled immigrants. This is true — Trump has been critical of Zuckerburg for that reason. But when Trump said he hadn’t been, and Quick admitted she was confused. “Where did I come up with this?” she asked, “That you were..?” Trump interrupted: “I don’t know. You people write this stuff.” Quick then apologized to Trump for ostensibly misquoting him — she accused Trump of calling Marco Rubio “Mark Zuckerburg’s personal senator,” and Trump said he “never said that.” But Trump did say that — the statement is literally on his campaign site. Watch: The debacle garnered a lot of Twitter angst from journalists: These moderators are CRASHING and burning. Holy crap. I have never seen anything this bad. — Mollie (@MZHemingway) October 29, 2015 Even liberal reporters in the press room are groaning about how terrible these CNBC moderators are. — Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) October 29, 2015 These moderators are just the worst. #GOPDebate — Lisa Friedman (@LFFriedman) October 29, 2015 ||||| Donald Trump and Ben Carson may have stood at the center of the stage at Wednesday's debate, but Marco Rubio stole the show. It was a sharp contrast from the first two contests, when Trump dominated the discussion. On Wednesday, the braggy billionaire reverted to almost just another candidate on the stage, not even involved in one of the debate’s defining moments. Story Continued Below That came when Jeb Bush, in need of a jolt after money woes forced him to slash his campaign payroll in the last week, attacked Rubio, his onetime Florida ally, for his Senate attendance record. Bush lectured Rubio that if he wanted to continue skipping votes he should “just resign and let someone else take the job.” “Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term,” Bush said. “And you should be showing up to work.” Rubio was ready, dismissing Bush as a political opportunist turning on an old friend. “Someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you,” he said. It was the end of discussion. The mentor had gone after the protégé but came away bruised. While that exchange got the audience going, many of the candidates scored ovations by attacking the moderators and, more broadly, the mainstream media. “This is not a cage match,” said Ted Cruz, blasting the CNBC moderators' questions for almost every candidate in the field. “How about talking about the substantive issues people care about?” As the crowd roared in approval, Cruz didn’t let up. “Nobody watching at home believes that any of the moderators have any intention of voting in a Republican primary,” he added. Facebook and Twitter said Cruz’s media assault was the most talked-about moment of the debate on their influential platforms. And focus-group guru Frank Luntz gushed on Twitter that, “Ted Cruz's focus group dials hits 98 with his attack on media bias. That's the highest score we've ever measured. EVER.” Rubio also scored big with his media slam. When Rubio declared that, “Democrats have the ultimate super PAC. It’s called the mainstream media,” it was the second-most tweeted moment of the debate. Carson, meanwhile, delivered another low-key performance, dispassionately refuting critical questions about his flat-tax plan and his business relationship with supplement company Mannatech. But if his past unheralded performances are any indicator, it won’t likely hurt him at the polls. Carson has soared, especially in Iowa, even recently eclipsing Trump in some surveys. With Trump as headliner, the 2016 debates have become must-see TV and, as a result, taken on outsize importance in the contest. That is bad news for Bush who, on Wednesday, spoke the least of any candidate on stage just as most political analysts believed he needed a lift. Off stage, Danny Diaz, Bush’s campaign manager, could be seen in a heated conversation with a CNBC producer. Rubio didn’t just shine in his showdown with Bush. He turned around a tough question on how he’d managed his personal finances, including cashing out a retirement account early and paying thousands in fees, despite earning a six-figure Senate salary and writing a best-selling book. Rubio dismissed the inquiries as “a series of discredited attacks,” though they were accurate, pivoting smoothly to his family narrative as the son of a bartender and maid. And Rubio earned laughs when he said he had to explain to his wife why “someone named Sallie-Mae was taking 1,000” every month to pay down his student loans. When CNBC’s Becky Quick tried to follow up that some of his questionable financial decisions came after Rubio had earned large sums from his book, Rubio quipped back, “And it's available on paperback, if you're interested.” Rubio’s campaign was soliciting their email list for money even before the debate was over. “Marco is winning,” one email read. “If you’re not watching, get in front of a TV or computer — a radio, even — ASAP.” It was a different story for Trump, who shrank on stage after a combative start in which he challenged the CNBC moderators about the tone and substance of their questions. He began the event on his heels when the opening question from John Harwood was about whether his big promises amounted to running a “comic-book” campaign for president. “Not a very nicely asked question, the way you said that,” Trump replied. Trump insisted he would build a 1,000-mile wall on the border with Mexico, and make Mexico pay for it. “We can do a wall. We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall” for legal immigrants,” Trump said. Harwood followed up, saying he had talked to economic advisers who have served presidents of both parties about Trump's tax plan: \\"They say you have as much chance of cutting taxes that much without increasing the deficit as you would of flying away from that podium by flapping your wings.\\" Trump exploded. \\"Then you would have to get rid of Larry Kudlow … who came out the other day and said 'I love Trump’s tax plan.” Ohio Gov. John Kasich was one of the few candidates to cast himself as the adult in the debate from the opening seconds, when he said he worried that the Republican Party was “on the verge perhaps of picking someone who cannot do this job.” \\"Folks, we've got to wake up,\\" Kasich said. He also mocked Carson's tax plan and said his health plan amounted to \\"getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.\\" \\"We cannot elect somebody who doesn’t know how to do the job,\\" Kasich said. Trump struck right back at Kasich on the Ohio economy. “John got lucky with a thing called fracking,” Trump said, adding that Kasich once worked for Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street bank that failed in the 2008 financial crisis. And he dismissed Kasich as desperately launching attacks on him. “His poll numbers tanked,” Trump said. Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina used some of her familiar and well-received lines against Clinton but did not star as she did in September, when she surged in the polls following the debate, before dropping back into the middle of the pack. She did defend her corporate record, including 30,000 layoffs under her watch, as tackling “entrenched problems head-on.” \\"I cut bureaucracy down to size, reintroduced accountability focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market and every product segment,\\" she said. \\"And yes, it was a very difficult time. However, we saved 80,000 jobs, we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business.” Chris Christie, who along with Kasich, Rand Paul and Mike Huckabee is on the bubble to make the next debate, delivered a confident performance, pleasing the audience with his barbs against two popular targets: Democrats and the media. Of the Democratic field, Christie said, “I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist. And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.” He added of Clinton, “You put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House. Take it to the bank.” And Christie mocked a question about fantasy football gambling as a needless media aside. “We’re talking about fantasy football?” he asked incredulously. “Enough on fantasy football. Let people play. Who cares.” Huckabee piled on the media, too: “This is just a great big game and we’re just the players.” Cruz delivered perhaps the oddest pitch of the night, selling himself as America’s designated driver. “If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy,” he said. “But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.” Whatever momentum comes from the CNBC bout, it could be short lived. The next debate, in Wisconsin, is already less than two weeks away. ||||| Photo by Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images Marco Rubio was strong but not quite spectacular during the first two Republican debates, picking up some fans but largely failing to stand out on a stage dominated by Donald Trump. On Wednesday, though, the freshman senator finally lived up to his billing as the candidate who could sell his party’s more conventional views to its anti-establishment base. Josh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City. Rubio was polished and poised in Colorado, delivering a superior performance that included well-timed one-liners and powerful counterattacks. As important for Rubio, though, was that his biggest rival in the establishment lane—Jeb Bush—failed to turn in the type of performance that would soothe the fears of his nervous-and-getting-more-so backers inside the Republican Party. Advertisement It was clear early that Rubio came ready to fight. When CNBC’s John Harwood pressed him to respond to a newspaper in his home state, the Sun-Sentinel, calling on him to resign his Senate seat while he seeks the presidency over his history of missed votes, Rubio ticked off the percentage of votes Barack Obama and John Kerry missed when they were running for president and called media bias. “This is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservatives,” Rubio shot back. The partisan crowd went wild. Rubio was even better when Bush tried to pile on—a decision he’ll probably regret if he rewatches the tape. “I don’t remember you ever complaining about John McCain’s voting record,” Rubio said in a reference to Bush’s recent adoption of the 2008 nominee as his spirit animal. “The only reason you're doing it now is because we’re running for the same position,” Rubio told his former mentor. “Someone convinced you attacking me is going to help you.” Later, when CNBC’s Becky Quick pressed Rubio about whether his past personal bookkeeping problems suggest he doesn’t have the “maturity and wisdom” to be president, Rubio played the “think-of-the-children” card to great affect. “My four children received a good Christian education and I’ve been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did,” he said. “I’m not worried about my finances, I’m worried about the finances of everyday Americans who struggle in the economy that is not making good jobs.” When the moderator continued to press, Rubio spun it into an attack on the Democratic front-runner. “I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children and how expensive it is for working families,” he said. “We can’t afford another four years of that. Which is what we will get if we elect a big-government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.” It was somewhere between a nonanswer and a non sequitur, but it landed in the room. MSM attack? Check. Hillary attack? Check. The only question left was whether Rubio could combine the two. Before the night was over, though, he’d done one better by finding a way to check off Benghazi from his hit list. “The mainstream media is saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign,” he said. “It was the week she got exposed as a liar. But she has her super PAC helping her out: the American mainstream media.” While Rubio was shining, Jeb was stumbling. His suggestion that fantasy football be “looked at in terms of regulation” was overshadowed by his decision to get way too specific about his own fantasy football team, boasting about his record (7-0) and his starting QB (Ryan Tannehill). Christie mocked the very premise of the question, making Bush’s answer look even smaller: “Wait a second, we have 19 trillion in debt, people out of work, ISIS and Al Qaeda attacking us and we’re talking about fantasy football? Can we stop?” Earlier while talking about budget compromises, Bush had gone for laughs and missed badly: “The deal is gone, you find a Democrat that is for cutting spending 10 dollars, I’ll give them a warm kiss.” ||||| Tweets from https://twitter.com/politico/lists/debate-night-w-politico The 2016 Blast The latest POLITICO scoops and coverage of the 2016 elections.

(Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) Republican presidential candidates sparred over experience, took jabs at their Democratic opponents and even shared a few laughs during CNBC's main debate in Boulder, Colo., on Oct. 28. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) The third Republican presidential debate on Wednesday evening ended with a handful of winners – Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz – and one clear loser, former Florida governor Jeb Bush. Bush, who was the well-financed front-runner at the beginning of the year, had one good moment in the beginning of the debate, when he attacked Rubio for his record of absences in the Senate. But that moment quickly became a devastating one for Bush, as Rubio responded with a faux-friendly cutdown: “Someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you,” he told Bush. “It’s not.” After that, Bush was a minor presence – a night so bad for him that his campaign manager confronted CNBC producers off the stage, angry about Bush’s lack of airtime. Rubio, by contrast, used the debate to cast himself as someone who understood middle-class concerns about student debt and income. By taking down Bush, he blunted an entire line of questioning about his withdrawal from the daily work of the Senate. [Full coverage: Republican presidential debate] During the third GOP debate, candidates got feisty with the CNBC moderators. They took aim at the questions asked, at the \\"mainstream media\\" and at the moderators interrupting their answers. (Victoria M. Walker/The Washington Post) Cruz and Christie also had strong moments while criticizing the moderators: Cruz attacked their questions as too negative, and Christie criticized them for asking about whether government should regulate the lucrative ‘daily fantasy” sports business. Christie mocked the moderators for focusing on “fantasy football” with so many other problems in the country. It was certainly not a good night for the moderators, who were booed on at least two occasions for questions the audience thought were unfair. One of the strongest moments for Donald Trump, the billionaire front-runner, came at the very end of the debate, when he said he had teamed up with neurosurgeon Ben Carson to force CNBC to shorten the debate. There, Trump said, was proof of his basic campaign promise: nobody was better than him at getting a good deal. Moderator John Harwood denied Trump’s assertion. Earlier, Trump denounced gun-free zones in public places as “target practice for the sickos,” underlining his pro-gun credentials during the third main GOP presidential debate. “That’s target practice for the sickos, and the mentally ill. That’s targets. They look around for gun free zones,” Trump said, talking about recent shootings at schools and military installations. “I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe. They are feeding frenzy for sick people.” Trump had been uncharacteristically quiet during the first hour and a half of the debate. But he used this moment to talk about his experience with guns, including his permits to carry weapons in New York City. “I like to be unpredictable,” about when he actually carries a gun, Trump said. “Unlike our country, by the way, which is totally predictable.” The next question was to former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, who was asked – as a minister – if Trump had the moral authority to be president. Some in the crowd booed. Huckabee rejected the question: “The last [thing] I need is to give him some more time,” Huckabee said. 1 of 18 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × The top quotes from the third Republican presidential debate View Photos Memorable quotes from the third GOP debate.

Christie interjected himself into a discussion about whether the government should regulate the huge, high-earning “daily fantasy” sites that let people win huge amounts of money through the success of sports players. Bush, who got the question, seemed to indicate it should be treated as gambling, and regulated. Christie jumped in, apparently incredulous that the question was even being asked: Why would the government, with all of its problems, bother with something like this? “Enough on fantasy football! Let people play! Who cares?” he said. Later, Christie continued in his confrontational mood, stopping after Harwood had talked over him. “Do you want me to answer, or do you want to answer? Even in New Jersey, what you’re doing is called rude,” Christie said. Earlier, Rubio called Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton a liar, and said that the mainstream media had worked to cover up Clinton’s falsehoods about the attacks that killed four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012. “You know, the Democrats have the ultimate Super PAC, it’s called the mainstream media,” Rubio said. He mentioned an 11-hour hearing about Benghazi on Capitol Hill last week, in which Republicans grilled Clinton about her conduct as secretary of state at the time of the attacks. “It was the week she got exposed as a liar. But she has her Super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.” That comment came on a night when the media – and CNBC itself – became a punching bag for the GOP candidates. An exchange between a CNBC moderator and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson – which began with questions about Carson’s ties to a nutritional-supplement company – ended with the crowd booing the moderator himself. The boos seemed to indicate that the crowd believed Carson when he said he had no real relationship with the company, Mannatech, which news reports have said has a history of legal actions and accusations of false claims. When moderator Carl Quintanilla pressed Carson to say if he had made an error in judgment, the crowd itself booed. “See, they know,” Carson said. Rubio used a sharp comeback to defuse Bush’s attack on his voting record in the Senate, and turned a question about his personal financial struggles into a chance to empathize with voters’ own money worries. “I didn’t inherit any money. My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid…I know what it’s like to owe that money,” Rubio said, after a moderator asked about his personal debts, including student loans. “I’m not worried about my finances. I’m worried about the finances of everyday Americans.” Rubio defended his record of missed votes in the Senate in the third GOP presidential debate, saying he was rebelling against a GOP establishment that wanted to keep him out of the presidential race. “That’s exactly what the Republican establishment says too, wait in line. Wait for what?,” he said when asked by a moderator why he was in such a rush to leave his work in the Senate. Rubio, making an argument he’s made several times in recent weeks, said his ambitions for American could not wait on the slow-moving Senate. “The time to act is now. The time to turn the page is now.” That brought an attack from Bush – a onetime ally of Rubio’s, now a bitter rival as they battle for the establishment’s support in this race. Bush, a Florida resident, cast himself as a wronged constituent of Rubio’s. “I expected that he would do constituent service, which means he shows up to work,” Bush said. “Marco, when you signed up for this, this is a six year term, and you should be showing up to work…Or just resign, and let somebody else take the job.” Rubio clearly had been expecting this attack, and responded with a sharp attack on Bush – followed by a pledge that he would not attack people, as Bush just had. “Someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you….It’s not,” Rubio said. “I’m not running against Gov. Bush. I’m not running against anyone else on the stage. I’m running for president.” Cruz attacked the moderators, for asking too-hard questions of the other candidates. “The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than any participant in the Democratic debate,” Cruz said. In that attack, Cruz used up the time he’d been allotted to answer a question about the debt ceiling, and why Cruz opposed a bill to raise it. When that was pointed out, Cruz offered to answer the question. When moderators didn’t let him, he seemed outraged. “You’re not interested in an answer? You’re not interested in an answer?” Earlier, Carson, a new front-runner in the Republican race, faced strong criticism of his tithing-based tax plan, when Kasich called Carson’s plan “fantasy.” “You can’t do it with empty promises. You know, these plans would put us trillions of dollars in debt,” Kasich said. “We cannot elect somebody that doesn’t know how to do the job.” Even at the moment when Kasich was attacking his rival, Carson, Trump – unable to let a chance to insult pass by -- intervened to attack Kasich for his low poll numbers. “That’s why he’s on the end,” Trump said. A few minutes earlier, the third Republican presidential debate had begun like an awkward job interview, with a moderator asking candidates to name their biggest weakness. The result, as in most job interviews, was a group of people who didn’t actually answer the question. “Good question,” said Kasich, who then ignored the question to insult his colleagues. “We’re on the verge of picking somebody who could perhaps not do this job.” “If I have a weakness, it’s that I try to play by the rules,” said Huckabee. “I share an optimism” about the country’s future,” said Rubio. “I’m a fighter,” said Cruz. The closest thing to a weakness that anyone admitted came from an unlikely source: Trump. “I’m too trusting,” Trump said. “And if they let me down, when they let me down, I never forgive.” Earlier on Wednesday, four low-performing Republican candidates faced off in another dinnertime “undercard” debate. The dominant figures in that debate were Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), the jokester; Lousiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, the hard-right conservative; and a large and growing cast of CNBC moderators, who at times seemed loathe to let the actual candidates speak. Graham – showing his trademark combination of humor and deadly seriousness – closed out the earlier debate by mocking Donald Trump, and then swinging to an emotional plea that American make him commander in chief. Graham (S.C.) joked that he’d heard – or maybe read it on a hat – that somebody wanted to “Make America Great Again.” That was a jab at Trump, who had made the slogan -- and the hats that bear it -- famous this year. Then Graham turned to his own message. “America is great. I intend to make America strong again,” he said, pledging to help the middle class, and to back American troops, even as he sent them into a new land war in Syria. “They have had our back. God knows, they have had our back. And I intend to have their back…Make me commander in chief.” [Transcript: CNBC undercard GOP debate] Jindal, formerly known as a wonk-Republican, made an appeal to pugnacious hard-core conservatives and Christian right. In the course of the debate, Jindal derided Democrats as socialists, and Republicans in Washington as weak and too quick to surrender. Jindal ended the first debate with an appeal for Americans to think of their country in Christian terms: with faith that a frightening situation could be saved. “The idea of America is slipping away. As Christians, we believe that the tomb is empty. As Americans we believe that our best days are ahead of us,” Jindal said, meaning the tomb of Jesus Christ, which Christians believe was found empty because Christ had been resurrected after death. “We can save the idea of America,” Jindal said. “Before it’s too late.” Former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum sought to play the role of a business-focused realist: asked about the Export-Import Bank, a conservative bogeyman, Santorum defended the institution as a crucial aid to U.S. manufacturing. Without it, he said, other countries would use similar state-sponsored institutions to give their own industries a leg up over American firms. “In order to have a level playing field which is what conservatives talk about all the time, then we have to have export financing,” Santorum said. At one point, Graham launched into a diatribe about the state of the Republican Party, complaining that other candidates were making unrealistic promises – and that the GOP nominee might lose to a weak Democrat in 2016. “At the end of the day folks, I am trying to solve a problem and win an election. I am tired of losing!” Graham shouted, as moderators tried to quiet him. He complained that the Democratic front-runner, Hillary Rodham Clinton, had made misleading claims that she’d been flat broke” after leaving the White House, and about Sen. Bernie Sanders’s long ties to socialism. “The number two guy [in the Democratic race] went to the Soviet Union and I don’t think he came back. If we can’t beat these people, then who in the hell are we going to beat!” Graham’s speech may have been the emotional high point of a rather sleepy undercard, in which four long shots debated soberly about their tax plans. Jindal had touted his plan to make poor people a 2 percent federal income tax, a change from the present system where 45 percent of Americans pay no federal income tax. Former New York governor George Pataki said his plan was better than Jindal’s tax plan because he had the political skills to get it passed. At one point, Pataki talked over another candidate in order to condemn Washington politicians for…interrupting. “In Washington, they talk over each other!” he said, while talking over Graham. “I’m not used to that. I listen when people talk.” Jenna Johnson, in Sioux City, Iowa, and David Weigel, in Boulder, Colo., contributed to this report. ||||| Cruz was also in fine fettle, delivering strong answers. The Texan offered far more specific economic policies than any of his rivals, though some of those ideas were politically risky or economically suspect. Cruz recommended partially privatizing Social Security, an idea that was roundly rejected when President George W. Bush attempted it. He called for auditing the Federal Reserve—stealing thunder from Rand Paul, who stood elsewhere on stage—and for abolishing the IRS, replacing it with a postcard-sized tax return. Somewhat bizarrely, Cruz also appeared to call for a return to the gold standard. But Cruz skipped a chance to deliver a specific answer about the budget deal under consideration in Congress right now—as did most of his fellow candidates. While the candidates discussed jobs and income inequality, their prescriptions tended toward the superficial: Get government out of the way, they said, and growth would follow. Perhaps the only policy that united most of the candidates was the need to protect existing federal entitlements for today’s seniors. Carly Fiorina, who proved to be one of the strongest debaters in the last two meetings but has fallen off the map since the last debate, was comparatively subdued and didn’t dominate as she did before. She called for a three-page tax code (to the moderators’ incredulity), on populist grounds. She attacked Hillary Clinton, and yet again, she defended her record at HP, where she was fired by the board. Moderators seem to insist on asking this question over and over, even though her answer has remained consistent—that she was sacked in a political struggle and did what was needed to save the company. Ben Carson was also, as usual, subdued—though so far it’s worked for him. Carson has been shaky when discussing policy, but he mostly managed to avoid potholes. However, when pressed by Becky Quick on the fact that his plan would create huge deficits, he insisted it wouldn’t, saying growth would replace it—the classic Laffer Curve argument. But his answer doesn’t conform with any serious analysis. Carson also parried a question about Mannatech, a questionable supplement company for which he cut ads, by saying it was a liberal attack and that he wasn’t really involved. That worked on stage, but it’s likely to bring new, unwelcome scrutiny to his relationship with Mannatech—a story that, by the way, was broken by the conservative National Review. This wasn’t Donald Trump’s night: He remained silent for long stretches, and much of the time he spent didn’t make him look good. After he denied to Becky Quick that he’d criticized H1B visas, Quick came back after break and pointed out that she read the quote on Trump’s own website. (Whoops!) Early on, Trump attempted a return to his political roots—way back in June!—with a stirring rant about the need to secure the border, the issue that took him to the top of the polls. Yet just as he delivered a strong defense of progressive taxation at the last debate, Trump sounded like a liberal Democrat on campaign finance Wednesday night: “Super PACs are a disaster, they're a scam, they cause dishonesty, and we've got to get rid of them.” ||||| A:","completion":"The CNBC Republican presidential debate, held yesterday in Boulder, Colorado, has been widely criticized for the performance of the moderators.

SEOUL, South Korea — On his first mission to reassure an important American ally, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis met on Thursday with top South Korean officials, who agreed to push ahead with the deployment of a new missile defense system. “Thaad is for defense of our allies’ people, of our troops who are committed to their defense,” Mr. Mattis told reporters, using the acronym for Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, the American antimissile system. It is meant to intercept North Korea’s medium-range missiles. “Were it not for the provocative behavior of North Korea, we would have no need for Thaad out here,” Mr. Mattis added. “There is no other nation that needs to be concerned about Thaad.” South Korea was a logical first stop for Mr. Mattis, who will also visit Japan on the trip. Tensions have risen in the region after Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, proclaimed during his New Year’s Day address that his military was preparing to conduct its first test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile. ||||| (CNN) New US Defense Secretary James Mattis on Thursday defended the planned deployment of a missile defense system in South Korea, saying only North Korea had anything to fear from it. After arriving at the Osan Air Base outside Seoul, Mattis said Pyongyang's \\"provocative behavior\\" was the only reason the US-developed system was on the agenda. South Korea's decision to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system, known as THAAD, has drawn sharp criticism from China, which sees it as part of a broader US strategy to extend its military alliance network from Japan all the way down to the South China Sea. \\"There is no other nation that needs to be concerned about THAAD other than North Korea if they're engaged in something that's offensive,\\" Mattis said. On Thursday afternoon, Mattis met with acting South Korean President Hwang Kyo-ahn in Seoul and reiterated the strength of the US-South Korean alliance. \\"I talked to President Trump and he wanted to make a very clear statement about the priority that we place on this alliance between our two nations,\\" the US defense chief said. \\"Our new administration inherits a very strong, trusted relationship between our two countries, and it's our commitment to make it even stronger.\\" Mattis' arrival in South Korea comes at a time of relative quiet from Kim Jong Un's regime , which hasn't tested a ballistic missile since October 20 after firing off projectiles at a record rate earlier in 2016. The question North Korea watchers are asking: How long will Kim keep his missile program grounded? Some analysts expect testing to resume soon. \\"They have a wonderful tradition of greeting every new US president with a bit of fireworks, sometimes a nuclear test, sometimes ICBM launch, and they're not going to break this tradition,\\" Korean studies professor Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University in Seoul told CNN. But Bruce Bennett of the Rand Corp. think tank said Kim's testing hiatus is focused not on Washington, but on Seoul and the recent impeachment of President Park Geun-hye in a corruption scandal. Her fate is now before South Korea's Constitutional Court. A decision against her could trigger elections earlier than the mandated December 20 deadline. \\"I believe that North Korea's No. 1 objective between now and the ROK presidential election is to ensure that the new South Korean president will be a progressive and certainly not a conservative,\\" Bennett said, using the acronym for the Republic of Korea. \\"But any provocations that it commits would give support to conservative candidates,\\" the senior defense analyst said.

On the campaign trail last year, he said he might be willing to meet the North Korean leader for discussions over a hamburger. Mattis said Thursday he's in South Korea to listen to its leaders before deciding on what strategy the Trump administration will adopt concerning Pyongyang. \\"I need to get some data from them, I need to get their appreciation of the situation before I start making statements about where I stand,\\" Mattis said.

A lot of mainstream coverage of the issue, which has China and South Korea at loggerheads, correctly notes that China is worried about the system, but doesn’t quite get at what exactly THAAD is, what it does, and why its deployment on the Korean peninsula is so threatening to China. China’s anxiety over THAAD has gotten to the point where its ambassador to South Korea would suggest that its implementation would destroy their bilateral relationship in “an instant.” THAAD is a relative recent addition to the United States’ anti-ballistic missile/interceptor toolkit. It entered production in 2008 and is primarily tasked with taking out threatening ballistic missiles in what’s known as their “terminal” phase (the ‘T’ in the acronym). This is actually the first part where a clarification is due. As Jeffrey Lewis recently highlighted in a Foreign Policy column, THAAD, and systems like it, including the Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3) interceptor, are designed to hit things as they zoom downward toward the earth–not as they go up. This may seem like a trivial point, but Japan made a show of deploying its PAC-3 interceptors in Tokyo ahead of North Korea’s latest satellite launch. Of course, the Kwangmyongsong satellite had a one-way ticket out of the atmosphere and wouldn’t be coming back, making PAC-3, or hypothetically THAAD, useless. (North Korea does have a bunch of short- and medium-range SCUDs that THAAD would be great against, though.) THAAD is particularly well-suited to intercept and destroy short, medium, and intermediate-range ballistic missiles in their terminal phase. Rod Lyon, in a recent post at the National Interest, helpfully catalogues some of THAAD’s tried-and-tested abilities, which attest to that fact. THAAD’s overall operation is similar to many other missile interceptor and surface-to-air missile systems: an X-Band active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar (AN/TPY-2) kicks off THAAD’s interception, detecting the target projectile. THAAD’s fire control and support equipment identifies, verifies, and initiates the launcher. The launcher–a road-mobile erector launcher, to be precise–finally releases the infrared seeker head-equipped THAAD missile which, according to the system’s manufacturer, then uses “kinetic energy to destroy [the] incoming missile.” In plain English, missile meets missile in mid-air; both missiles go “Boom.” There’s a lot more to THAAD’s feature set. The “high altitude” part of the acronym isn’t there for show: THAAD is able to intercept incoming missiles at endo- and exo-atmospheric altitudes, with a maximum engagement altitude of roughly 93 miles above the earth’s surface. The missile itself can travel at speeds over Mach 8, placing it in the “hypersonic” category. Indeed, THAAD manufacturer Lockheed Martin is interested in developing an extended range THAAD variant to counter hypersonic glide vehicles, including China’s own WU-14. Keeping this feature set in mind, why is China so upset about a potential THAAD deployment? The answer, I think, has to do more with the monitoring capabilities that are part of the THAAD package. Beijing isn’t, for instance, worried that a THAAD deployment in South Korea would threaten any ballistic missiles it would plausibly fire at the United States–again, THAAD only works against ballistic missiles in the terminal phase and not against inter-continental ones anyway. Lyon evaluates China’s concerns: China’s right to believe that THAAD surveillance data could be transferred to other BMD assets protecting [the continental United States (CONUS)]. Indeed, one of THAAD’s missions would be to strengthen U.S. defenses against the possibility of North Korean ballistic missile attack on CONUS. So it has to be able to transfer data to CONUS-based radars and interceptors. But the United States already has a THAAD battery deployed on Guam, two AN/TPY-2 radars deployed in Japan (at Shariki and Kyogamisaki), space-based assets, plus a range of ship-borne radars and larger land-based radars in other parts of the Pacific theatre. Would a THAAD deployment in South Korea change much? The short answer is that it could improve early tracking of some Chinese missiles, depending on their launch point. Still, that might not make actual interception of those missiles much easier. ICBM warheads move fast. And sophisticated penetration-aids help to confuse missile defenses. So, from the Chinese perspective, a THAAD deployment could shift the strategic stability needle ever so slightly away from its status quo equilibrium and advantage the United States, giving Washington better early warning and tracking of Chinese ICBMs. That, in itself, doesn’t seem like a serious impingement on China’s security or its nuclear deterrent. What’s interesting is reading China’s worries about a THAAD and AN/TPY-2 deployment on the Korean peninsula together with murmurs that Beijing is growing increasingly interested in a launch-on-warning nuclear posture. Does a THAAD deployment affect the credibility of China’s second-strike capabilities by giving the United States a greater early warning edge? Perhaps, but, as Lyon notes above, the difference would be marginal given the AN/TPY-2s already in Japan. Assessing China’s position on THAAD in light of the system’s real capabilities, we should concede that Beijing does have some legitimate reasons to be upset, but I question if the negative implications for China’s security really outweigh the diplomatic cost to the bilateral relationship with South Korea, which had seen a sharp uptick over the past year. Moreover, it’s clear that South Korea’s security would benefit in important ways from a THAAD deployment–Pyongyang’s Toksa, SCUDs, and No Dong missiles would be a lot less threatening. China and South Korea should be able to come to an understanding, but this won’t be possible as long as Beijing holds to its maximalist position on THAAD, refusing to abide a deployment of the interceptor on the peninsula. Are there alternatives? If you ask South Korea and the United States, then the answer is yes: China could change its approach to North Korea, making this THAAD business less necessary in the short-term. I wouldn’t count on that happening anytime soon, despite news of the United States and China making some progress on harsher sanctions. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has defended the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) anti-missile system in South Korea. In a meeting with acting South Korean President Hwang Kyo-ahn in Seoul, Mattis stated the planned missile defence system is purely in response to North Korea's \\"provocative behavior\\". However, China has voiced criticism, regarding Thaad as part of a wider US strategy to expand its military alliance network on the Asian continent.

The first - which took place on 11 May - involved a prisoner taken hostage inside a cell. Both episodes, which ended without injury, are now under investigation. Live: Leaked prison report revealed hostage situation The three incidents were revealed in an internal prison report seen by the BBC. On 12 May, five staff members were taken hostage in an office by a prisoner armed with a weapon. Three officers were quickly released. The inmate demanded a transfer, to be re-categorised and taken off the prison wing. Prison Service Gold Command, the national group convened during serious incidents and disturbances, was deployed and the prisoner surrendered. The incident was also reported to police. The previous day, staff had found four prisoners barricaded in a cell, and when they were able to see in, they saw one was tied up with a sheet over his head. The prisoners surrendered five hours later. Also on 11 May, a prisoner used a toilet brush studded with razor blades to slash and stab another inmate at HMP and YOI Swinfen Hall, Staffordshire. The attack was filmed on a mobile phone smuggled in, the prison service said. The victim suffered deep gashes to his head, face and ear before staff intervened and he was taken to Good Hope Hospital in Birmingham.

Article: Traditional fairytales are being given up by parents because they are too scary for their young children, a study found. Research uncovered that one in five parents has got rid of old literature such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarves and Rapunzel in favour of more modem books. One third of parents said their children have been left in tears after hearing the _ details of Little Red Riding Hood. And nearly half of mothers and fathers refuse to read Rumplesliltshin to their kids as the themes of the story are kidnapping and killing. Similarly, Goldilocks and the Three Bears was also a tale likely to be left on the book shelf as parents felt it forgives stealing. The survey of 2,000 adults was completed to mark the launch of the hit US drama GRIMM , which starts tonight at 9pm on Watch, and sees six drama series based on traditional fairytales. The survey found a quarter of parents questioned wouldn't consider reading fairytales to their kids. And 52 percent of the parents said Cinderella didn't send a good message to their children as it describes a young woman doing housework all day. Steve Hornsey, General Manager of Watch, said: \\"Bedtime stories are supposed to calm children down and send them off to sleep soundly.But as we see in GMMM, fairytales can be dark and dramatic so it's understandable that parents worry about reading them to young 'children.As adults we can see the innocence in fairytales, but a five - year - old child could take them too literally.Despite the dark nature of classic fairytales, as: we see in GRIMM, good will defeat evil and there is always a moral to the story.\\" The study also found two thirds of mums and dads try to avoid Stories which might give their children nightmares.

Furthermore, they demand a frank debate about the pressures on the health service, exploring new models for delivering care to ease the pressure on hospitals and improve collaboration between health professions. Health Secretary Shona Robison insists on the progress made and highlights plans to integrate health and social care to shift the balance from hospitals to the community. However, concerns are raised by other political parties about the crisis in A&E units, hospital bed cuts, and insufficient resources for NHS staff to meet the increasing demand."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He works as a marketing consultant but is also passionate about cooking in his free time. Seb remained quite secretive about his culinary talents until now. Scene: In the evening, Anton and Conrad return home from work earlier than expected. They open the door to find their housemate and friend, Seb, cooking a spectacular meal. Clearly, they are caught by surprise as they had never imagined Seb as a good cook before. Anton (shocked): Woah! What's going on here? Conrad (smirking): Is MasterChef holding auditions in our kitchen today, or something like that? Seb (laughing): You guys are back early! I was hoping to surprise you when you return home later. Well, the cat's out of the bag now. Anton (still surprised): Honestly, we couldn't be more shocked! How long have you been hiding your cooking skills from us, Seb? Conrad (nodding): Yeah, mate! And why hide such an amazing talent in the first place? Seb (smiling): Well, it's something I've always been passionate about, but I never really had the time to indulge due to my hectic schedule. But lately, I've been enjoying trying out new recipes and experimenting in the kitchen. Anton (intrigued): So, what's on the menu tonight? It smells incredible! Seb (enthusiastically): I'm glad you asked! Tonight, we'll be having a garlic herb-crusted roasted chicken, served with lemon butter sauce. Accompanying that, we have Parmesan-roasted cauliflower and garlic mashed potatoes. Conrad (impressed): Seb, honestly, I never knew you were this good! It smells and looks amazing already, and I'm sure it tastes incredible too. Anton (smiling): Yeah, we're lucky to have such a talented housemate! Now we can take turns cooking instead of our usual pasta-and-takeout routine. Seb (grinning): Well, I can't promise to cook like this every day, but I'll do my best to keep our meals interesting from now on. Conrad (enthusiastically): How about we plan a friends get-together soon? You can showcase your culinary talents, and we can finally impress our friends with something else than pizza and beer. Anton (agreeing): Absolutely! It'll be such a great way to showcase our newfound gem of a chef among our friends! Seb (happily): Sounds like a plan, guys!

Both are speaking about the geographic location of the Central Mainland of the Shetland Islands. They both indicate that it is a part of the Mainland, which is the main island of the Shetland Islands in Scotland, located between three places: Hellister, Aith, and Voe. The sentences' structures are slightly different, but they do not alter the overall meaning. In sentence (1), \\"The Central Mainland of the Shetland Islands is the part of the Mainland, between Hellister, Aith, and Voe.\\" the structure indicates that the Central Mainland is the part of the area under discussion and it specifies where this area lies by stating it's between Hellister, Aith, and Voe. Sentence (2), \\"The central mainland of the Shetland Islands is part of the mainland between Hellister, Aith, and Voe.\\" also carries the same meaning. The small difference here is the absence of the word \\"the\\" before \\"part of the mainland\\", however, this absence doesn't change the conveyed message about the location of the Central Mainland of the Shetland Islands. So, both sentences explain the same geographical detail about the Shetland Islands. They describe that the Central Mainland is a portion of the Mainland that lies between the same geographical landmarks: Hellister, Aith, and Voe.

Please answer the following question: Dan studied multicellular organisms that presented mutations. Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations. He was fascinated by these organisms. Which group had fewer organisms having mutations that can be passed to the next generation? Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

These questions can range from a variety of topics like simple arithmetic, solving equations, converting a quantity from one unit to another, finding remainders/GCD/LCM, finding probabilities etc. Each question has only one correct answer. This answer can be a positive or negative integer, a fraction or a decimal number. If the answer is a negative number use the hyphen (e.g. -42) symbol for the minus sign.

((-26)/(-6)) can be calculated as 26/6 = 4.33 (to 2 decimal places). Then divide this by (1/(-36)), that calculates to -4.33 * -36 = 156. This value is a decimal number and there are no extra zeros after the decimal point, so it satisfies the conditions given. l = 156 Next simplify the expression for which we need a common denominator: 3 + (-2 - l/(-40)) = 3 + (-2 - 156/(-40)) We can simplify further: = 3 + (-2 + 3.9) = approximately 4.9 (to 1 decimal place). Now, we have to find the common denominator of 4.9 and 1/4. Here, since the first number is not a fraction, we simply convert it to a fraction format, which would be 49/10. So, now we need to find the common denominator of 49/10 and 1/4. For this, we can take the least common multiples (LCM) of 10 and 4. The multiples of 10 are: 10, 20, 30, 40, ..... The multiples of 4 are: 4 , 8, 12, 16, 20, ..... The first common multiple of 10 and 4 is 20; therefore, 20 is the least common multiple (LCM).

A:","completion":"A: Based on the information provided, it can be concluded that Ben learned less about the most dramatic decrease in ozone. While both Ben and Harry were studying the climatic history of Earth, their interests and focus areas were different. Ben was more attracted to learning about early Ice Ages, which may encompass studies about glaciation and the effect of climate change on ice coverage. On the other hand, Harry was curious about the Earth's atmosphere, specifically reading about ozone depletion and its consequences. Since the most dramatic decrease in ozone is a crucial aspect of the topic Harry was exploring, it's likely that he would have learned about it while researching ozone depletion. The background information provided about the ozone hole, its steady increase over the years, and the efforts in recent times to restore the ozone layer may have been within the scope of Harry's research, while Ben's study on early Ice Ages would not necessarily involve learning about ozone depletion.

The court where sepaktakraw is played is the size of one used for badminton doubles. A net and a plastic ball a little larger than a baseball are used. Two teams of three players(left inside, right inside, and server) take their places on either side. A teammate passes the ball to the server who kicks it over the net. Points are scored when the ball touches the court surface on the other side. How sepaktakraw began has been a hot topic. Many Asian cultures once had their own names and rules for it. In Thailand the sport can be found on a famous mural . It was also played to celebrate the writing of the nations' first constitution in 1933. however, various nations discussed to decide the official name and rules in 1960, At last, sepak is a Malay word for \\"kick\\", and takraw is Thai for \\"woven ball\\".

Roger Ailes told tall tale about belly dancer, boa constrictor: New book Roger Ailes, LEFT, and Rupert Murdoch in 1996, at a press conference announcing the creation of Fox News. (Richard Drew/Associated Press) In an appearance today on “CBS This Morning,” Gabriel Sherman, the unauthorized biographer of Fox News chief Roger Ailes, took aim at a central part of the network boss’s history. The issue concerns a great anecdote from Ailes’s early years as a professional. It was January 1968, and Ailes was executive producer of the Mike Douglas Show. Booked to appear on the Jan. 9 program was then-presidential hopeful Richard Nixon. Ailes ended up face-to-face with Nixon in his office, an encounter that came about via strange circumstances. Here’s how Ailes described those circumstances in a 2001 interview with Charlie Rose: “So somebody ran into me and said, ‘We’re having former Vice President Nixon come in and we have Little Egypt the belly dancer in the green room with a boa constrictor.’ So I said, ‘Put one of them in my office.’ And they ended up putting Nixon in my office. And I didn’t want to scare the boa constrictor or Nixon so I decided I had to keep them apart. I don’t think Nixon ever knew he was on the same show with a boa constrictor until maybe a week later somebody told him. And a belly dancer, by the way: Little Egypt was a famous belly dancer. Anyway, I went back to my office, there’s Nixon sitting there and he’s grumbling about, you know, it’s too bad a guy has to rely on a gimmick to get elected.” In his research for “The Loudest Voice in the Room,” Sherman has determined that things didn’t quite go down that way. “There was no belly dancer; there was no snake on the set of the Mike Douglas Show,” Sherman said this morning on CBS. He breaks things down on a just-posted mini-excerpt at New York magazine: [A]ccording to several of Ailes’s Mike Douglas colleagues who were present, there was no belly dancer named Little Egypt booked that day. Their assertion is backed up by the show’s talent logs, which I viewed. The guests during the Nixon taping, which took place on January 9, were the singer Margaret Whiting, the actress Stella Stevens, the Philadelphia Brass Ensemble, and Tony Sandler’s children. According to the talent log for that week’s shoots, the dance duo John Brascia and Tybee Arfa had been scheduled to come into the studio when Nixon was there, but were bumped back a day. Tybee, as she was known, was certainly exotic. But she never performed under the name Little Egypt. And the snake? “No one has any recollection of Tybee ever dancing with a boa,” recalled John Brascia’s daughter, Christina. On CBS, Sherman said that the story is “a wonderful cocktail party story that shows roger Ailes’s unrivaled ability to be a myth-maker.” The meeting with Nixon, insists Sherman, came in a “formative” period in the life of the then-27-year-old Ailes, who didn’t exactly stumble into a one-on-one with Nixon. “He wanted to work for Nixon. He wanted to become a media strategist,” said Sherman. This could be fun.

Can you tell me the answer to what is the most common subject of cycladic sculptures??","completion":"Cycladic sculptures refer to the artistic creations originating from the ancient Cycladic civilization, which flourished around 3200-2000 BCE on the Cyclades islands in the Aegean Sea (part of modern-day Greece). The Cycladic culture is one of the three significant early Aegean civilizations, along with the Minoan and Mycenaean cultures. The most common subject of Cycladic sculptures is the so-called \\"Cycladic figurines\\" or \\"Cycladic idols.\\" These figurines are predominantly found in the Early Cycladic II period (2800-2300 BCE) and are characterized by their simple, geometric and abstract forms. The majority of the sculptures depict female figures, nude and in various poses, suggesting that they may have represented goddesses or served a religious purpose, linked to beliefs in fertility, death, and afterlife. The aesthetic appearance of these figures emphasizes the aspects of minimalism and abstraction, which later became influential in the art world, especially in modern art movements like Cubism. Cycladic figurines are mainly made of local, high-quality marble that is abundant in the Cyclades and were carved using a variety of tools such as chisels, blades, and abrasives for a smoother finish. These figures are depicted standing or reclining, with their arms folded across their chest and elongated necks supporting their distinctive, lyre-shaped heads with prominent noses. They have little to no facial features other than the nose, and the lack of other details can be attributed to their symbolic or, perhaps, metaphysical nature. Although female figures dominate Cycladic sculptures, some male figures have been discovered as well. Male figurines are thought to have portrayed warriors, hunters, or possibly musicians, and are often classified as being anatomically distinguishable and engaged in an activity. For example, some figures hold weapons, musical instruments, or have their hands in positions indicating they would be handling tools. There are also a few abstract examples of Cycladic art in which the gender of the figure is difficult to identify. In addition to the figurines, Cycladic sculptures also involve pottery and smaller, functional objects such as stone vessels and tools. There are examples of engraved or painted pottery with themes related to the natural world, geometric patterns, and maritime scenes. However, the main fascination surrounding Cycladic art and its most common subject overwhelmingly revolves around the striking and enigmatic marble figurines. In summary, the most common subject of Cycladic sculptures is the Cycladic figurines, primarily representing female figures with minimalistic, abstract, and almost otherworldly characteristics. These marble figures not only provide unique insight into the artistic expressions of the ancient Cycladic civilization but have also played an influential role in shaping the course of modern art."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tumble liked to walk around outside in the garden and dig small holes to sleep in. Billy loved Tumble and would visit him outside when he got home from school. Tumble's favorite food was oatmeal. So, every day after school, Billy would make Tumble a big bowl of oatmeal and take it outside for Tumble to enjoy. Tumble would see Billy and walk up to him as fast as a turtle can go. Billy would put the bowl down and wait for Tumble to come up to the bowl to eat from it. When Tumble reached the bowl, he put his nose on it. But, the oatmeal was too hot to eat. Billy reached down and blew on the hot oatmeal, to cool it down for Tumble to eat. Once the oatmeal was cool enough, Tumble could dig in and eat his big bowl of oatmeal.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw... I am facing a new situation today: Two continents were known for the strange discrepancies in animal populations. Asia was mostly populated by reptiles of all species, while Africa was mostly populated by birds and very few reptiles. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which continent was inhabited by fewer turtles? A:","completion":"Based on the provided background article, reptiles are a diverse group of animals that includes turtles, among other species. In the new situation presented, Asia is known to have a higher reptile population, while Africa has a larger bird population and very few reptiles. Considering this information, it would be reasonable to deduce that the continent inhabited by fewer turtles is Africa. Since turtles are classified as reptiles, and Africa has a lower reptile population in comparison to Asia, it is likely that there are fewer turtles residing in Africa than in Asia."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The war was successful for Great Britain, which gained the bulk of New France in North America, Spanish Florida, some individual Caribbean islands in the West Indies, the colony of Senegal on the West African coast, and superiority over the French trading outposts on the Indian subcontinent. The Native American tribes were excluded from the settlement; a subsequent conflict, known as Pontiac's War, was also unsuccessful in returning them to their pre-war status. In Europe, the war began disastrously for Prussia, but a combination of good luck and successful strategy saw King Frederick the Great manage to retrieve the Prussian position and retain the status quo ante bellum.

The first symbol is 14, which is shorthand for the \\"14 Words\\" slogan: \\"We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.\\" The second is 88, which stands for \\"Heil Hitler\\" (H being the 8th letter of the alphabet). Together, the numbers form a general endorsement of white supremacy and its beliefs. As such, they are ubiquitous within the white supremacist movement - as graffiti, in graphics and tattoos, even in screen names and e-mail addresses, such as aryanprincess1488@hate.net. Some white supremacists will even price racist merchandise, such as t-shirts or compact discs, for 14.88. The symbol is most commonly written as 1488 or 14/88, but variations such as 14-88 or 8814 are also common. Additional Images ||||| On Inauguration Day, Shia LaBeouf launched an art project called “He Will not Divide Us” at the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens, New York. Outside the museum is a camera and people can come and stand in front of it for as long as they want repeating the words “He will not divide us.” The video will be streamed continuously for four years, or as long as Donald Trump is President. Yesterday, the “He Will Not Divide Us” official Twitter account tweeted out this video of a White Supremacist who showed up and started talking into the camera, including saying, as our cousin site Gossip Cop pointed out, something that sounds like “praise Hitler.” White supremacist yells into the camera and Shia LaBeouf shuts him down. This has been a very interesting live stream. #HeWillNotDivideUs pic.twitter.com/CqY9pLobWi — #HeWillNotDivideUs (@HWNDUS) January 23, 2017 LaBeouf, who has made multiple appearances in the live stream was there at the time, got into his face and screamed “he will not divide us” into the man’s ear. Before things got (more) physical, the man left, and the crowd cheered. Other moments have been much more positive. At one point, a man was there by himself for a while. Eventually, a woman came and joined him, saying she had been watching from home and had become inspired. [featured image via Featureflash Photo Agency/Shutterstock, Inc.] Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com ||||| He Will Not Divide Us/Twitter “He Will Not Divide Us,” the four-year-long anti-Trump participatory art installation from Shia LaBeouf, Nastja Sade Ronkko, and Luke Turner, was the site of a showdown between actor LaBeouf and an unidentified white supremacist on Sunday, Raw Story reports. The project, at the Museum of the Moving Image in New York, invites visitors to say the words “He will not divide us” into a camera for a 24-hour livestream, which will be broadcast on the web for the entirety of the Trump presidency. The problem was that not everyone wanted to say “He will not divide us.” To be more specific, a Nazi showed up who wanted to say “1488,” instead. (Calling modern-day white supremacists Nazis may be imprecise in many cases, but this guy was literally wearing a SS M43 field cap, though he at least was ashamed of himself enough to remove the Totenkopf.) “1488,” of course, is a white supremacist code number that combines white supremacy’s 14-word creed with a reference to “Heil Hitler,” H being the eighth letter of the alphabet. It was created by white supremacist murderer David Lane, the same charmer who invented the “white genocide” myth. (Saying “Heil Hitler,” even in code, is another cutoff point where it probably ought to be ok to call someone a Nazi.) Advertisement LaBeouf, who was there at the time, sensed that a man wearing the uniform of a long-defeated army of racists might not be in the spirit of the thing, and, as can be seen in a video posted to a fan account for the project, successfully shut him down:* White supremacist yells into the camera and Shia LaBeouf shuts him down. This has been a very interesting live stream. #HeWillNotDivideUs pic.twitter.com/CqY9pLobWi — #HeWillNotDivideUs (@HWNDUS) January 23, 2017 Rather than engaging in the morally controversial act of Nazi-punching, LaBeouf decided that the answer to hate speech was more speech. He followed the guy around until he returned to the microphone (to tell the world, “We must secure the existence of the white race”) then simply out-yelled him while edging him out of frame. Watching the Nazi try to work his way back to the camera (and fail) is another bittersweet pleasure of the Trump era. Yes, the Nazi looks pathetic, and yes, this is a punch-free Nazi fiasco that we can all enjoy. But a funny web video is a poor consolation for the time—not so long ago!—when fewer Americans thought it was ok to become Nazis to begin with. ||||| Add a location to your Tweets When you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

Louise Eccles and Keith Gladdis In Mombasa, Kenya. PUBLISHED:. 17:08 EST, 26 May 2013. |. UPDATED:. 05:11 EST, 27 May 2013. Anti-terror police in Kenya have accused the British of ignoring their warnings that Woolwich murder suspect Michael Adebolajo was a dangerous radical. Adebolajo was arrested in Kenya in 2010 on suspicion of leading a jihadist plot to cross the border into lawless Somalia and join the ranks of the Al Shabaab terrorist group. But the Kenyans claim that when they presented their evidence to the British Embassy, it was insisted Adebolajo had no criminal record. Scroll down for video. Michael Adebolajo in a Kenyan court in 2010 with five other men after he attempted to cross the border. Adebolajo (centre in black top) was sent back to Britain after claiming he had been tortured in Kenya. Sources in Kenya also claim the. British Embassy put them under pressure to release Adebolajo after he. complained he had been tortured, starved for two days and denied access. to a lawyer. And another Kenyan source yesterday claimed the British failed to help them build a case against Adebolajo. Adebolajo was detained for several days before being deported to the UK. It came as Adebolajo’s family claimed harassment by MI5 in the months before the attack may have ‘pushed him over the edge’. On his return to the UK from Kenya,. family members claim he was ‘pestered’ by MI5 agents who tried to. recruit him as an informant and infiltrate Islamic extremist groups. Adebolajo’s brother-in-law Abu Zuybyr. claimed the intelligence services put Adebolajo under pressure to spy on. Muslim clerics and become an informer. Mr Zuybyr, who is married to. Adebolajo’s sister Christiana, said: ‘That is what [Adebolajo’s] family. is saying: that the secret service pushed him over the edge.’ He said Adebolajo was ‘elated’ following the birth of his child, but ‘then things became a little strange’. The family of Adebolajo, pictured during a 2007 march in London, said he was harassed by MI5 in the months before the attack. Speaking to The Independent on Sunday, Mr Zuybyr said Adebolajo went to Nairobi in 2010 to study Arabic and Islam. Following his return to England, Mr Zuybyr said authorities repeatedly questioned family members about Adebolajo. His elder brother, Jeremiah, who had. gone to Saudi Arabia to teach English, was arrested and quizzed. And Mr. Zuybyr said he was questioned at gunpoint when he visited Yemen four. years ago to learn Arabic with his wife. He said: ‘When I came back to Britain,. MI5 contacted me and showed significant interest in Michael. I was. harassed for a while, with constant calls from people claiming to be. from the FBI.’ In Kenya, Adebolajo was seized with. five others after travelling by speedboat to an island off the coast. near Lamu Island, 68 miles from the Somali border. A married couple who owned a guest house where they had been staying and a worker were also arrested. The Kenyans believed Adebolajo, 28,. had played a crucial role in recruiting his co-accused, including two. secondary school-aged boys, after they were radicalised during weekly. visits to a mosque in Mombasa. It is believed the Kenyan cleric Sheikh Aboud Rogo – who was killed by gunmen in Mombasa last year – had helped to fund the men. Adebolajo was eventually deported without charge but the Kenyans insist they warned the British that he was dangerous. Mombasa’s anti-terrorist police chief Elijah Rop said: ‘We advised the British police about the man but they ignored us. ‘That is the man we deported to the UK. in 2010 after discovering he is among Islamic radicals who were. recruited to train as Al Shabaab in Somalia three years ago.’ A man identified as Michael Adebolajo, 28,. brandishes a meat cleaver with bloodied hands near the scene of the. killing. It was claimed that MI5 offered Adebolajo a job six. months ago. Adebolajo, right, is pictured at an English Defence League march in 2009. Michael Adebowale, 22, of Greenwich, south-east London, with a knife in his hand at the scene where Lee Rigby was stabbed to death. At the. time of Adebolajo’s arrest, the security services were aware of the risk. that radicalised British Muslims were heading to Somalia to join with. Al Shabaab, which has links to Al Qaeda. Only two months before, the then-head. of MI5 Jonathan Evans had warned Britons were training in Somalia and it. was ‘only a matter of time before we see terrorism on our streets. inspired by those who are today fighting alongside Al Shabaab’. It is now accepted that Al Qaeda cells in Mombasa were at their peak around 2010. Samantha Lewthwaite, the fugitive. ‘white widow’ of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay is still on the run over. her role in a suspected plot to bomb western hotels in the city. However the security forces appear to. have been relaxed that Adebolajo – who was travelling under the name of. Michael Olemindis Ndemolajo – may have been prepared to train and fight. with the brutal Al Shabaab. Kenyan government spokesman Muthui. Kariuki said: ‘We handed him to British security agents in Kenya and he. seems to have found his way to London and mutated to Michael Adebolajo. The Kenyan government cannot be held responsible for what happened to. him after we handed him to British authorities.’ Father Lee Rigby was killed in the attack on Woolwich last week. Father of one and soldier Rigby, of Greater Manchester, pictured relaxing on Army leave. After their arrest Adebolajo and the. eight co-accused were taken to Mombasa and spent a number of days in. prison before appearing before a magistrate. Kenyan detectives suspected Adebolajo. may have been a ringleader because he was most vocal in court and. appeared to know how to ‘play the system’. In court he claimed: ‘We are being tortured by police and we haven’t eaten for two days now. ‘We have been denied the right to talk. to our family members and lawyer. We are being treated as criminals and. we are innocent.’ The court told police it had three. days to build a case but after the clean bill of health from the British. embassy Adebolajo was deported. Another Kenyan source yesterday. accused the British of failing to help them build a case against. Adebolajo. He said: ‘It was a major anti-terror investigation and we. were given three days by the courts to build up a case.’ Last night the Foreign Office. confirmed Adebolajo had been arrested in 2010 and it gave consular. assistance ‘as normal’ in the circumstances. A Foreign Office statement said: ‘We. can confirm a British national was arrested in Kenya in 2010. The. Foreign and Commonwealth Office provided consular assistance as normal. for British nationals.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.

But he said he was \\"taken aback\\" by the way the Welsh film industry was organised when he applied for support from the Welsh government's media investment fund. He told BBC Wales: \\"We have put together a lot of financing for this movie, we've got some big stars in it. \\"I went through a process with the Welsh government and they basically passed on it, and it looks like we are going to have to be shooting it in England or Ireland later this summer.\\" The Welsh government said it was supporting the creative industries in Wales, which have a \\"global reputation\\" and a \\"very strong pipeline of projects seeking to film here\\". It said independent industry experts provided advice on commercial investments and the Welsh government's media investment budget, backed by advice from Pinewood Pictures, was \\"delivering tangible results\\". \\"We would be rightly criticised for not taking strong measures to protect and bring value from our investments,\\" a spokesman said. \\"It is therefore inevitable that this will bring disappointment to some producers, but we will continue to work with them to find ways in which to assist their productions to be filmed in Wales.\\" Young has had a successful career in animation and film since TV series SuperTed launched on S4C in 1982 and his latest film Norm of the North had its Welsh premiere in Brynmawr, Blaenau Gwent, on Tuesday. Young said public funds that support the creative industries should be directed at commercial projects, and criticised the involvement of \\"bureaucrats\\" in making decisions about funding new films. He said the Welsh government had \\"got to gather around them people who really know how to package films and how to market and sell them, rather than bureaucrats\\".

His movie, which is about former Cardiff City player Robin Friday, did not receive financial backing from the Welsh government's media investment fund. As a result, Young has decided to shoot the film elsewhere, most likely in England or Ireland. Young criticized the organization of the Welsh film industry and questioned the involvement of bureaucrats in funding decisions. He believes that public funds should be allocated to commercial projects and stresses the importance of having industry experts to package, market, and sell films. The Welsh government responded by stating that they are supporting creative industries in Wales and that independent industry experts provide advice on commercial investments. They emphasized that their media investment budget is delivering tangible results, but acknowledged that some producers may be disappointed when their projects are not funded. The government's focus is on protecting and bringing value from their investments, while continuing to work with producers to find ways of supporting their productions in Wales. Mike Young has had a successful career in animation and film since the 1980s, with notable works like SuperTed and Norm of the North.

To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis. and the situation: Bob is a biologist. Today, he has four samples of organisms to test, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. He induced higher respiration rate in sample A. Then he induced no respiration rate in sample B. Next, he classified sample C as heterotrophic and sample D as autotrophic. Answer the following question: In which organism ATP molecules would be produced, sample A or sample B? Answer:","completion":"ATP molecules would be produced in sample A. This is because sample A has a higher respiration rate, and during cellular respiration, energy is converted from glucose, in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. In contrast, sample B has no respiration rate induced, which means that it is not converting glucose into ATP molecules through cellular respiration."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

(CNN) -- For Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, it was a global virtual black eye. Instead of seeing his photo on the new European Union site, launched this week as Spain took over the presidency, visitors were greeted by Rowan Atkinson's comic character of Mr. Bean. And if you clicked over to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's Web site, you'd see that hackers took him on, too. The text on his site was replaced with a note remarking on the death of \\"my favorite singer Michael Jackson\\" and \\"my favorite voice Neda,\\" the woman killed last year during protests over Iranian elections. It ended with a request that God smite Ahmadinejad and \\"my favorite dictator [Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei in 2010.\\" Ironically, cybersecurity is one of the issues","completion":"that the European Union is keen on addressing during Spain's tenure as president. These high-profile hacks serve as a stark reminder of the importance of bolstering internet security and combatting cybercrimes across the globe. Several steps have been taken by the EU to strengthen its cybersecurity infrastructure. One such initiative includes collaborating with member countries to develop advanced cybersecurity strategies and exchanging best practices in a bid to safeguard their online presence. Furthermore, the EU has been working on enhancing public-private partnerships to ensure comprehensive protection for both government and private sector institutions. In light of these embarrassing hacks, the Spanish government has reportedly acted swiftly to rectify the situation, restoring the original images and content on the EU and Ahmadinejad's websites. Spain's Ministry of Industry, which oversees the country's internet infrastructure, has also launched an investigation into the breach, aiming to identify the perpetrators and enforce strict penalties on those responsible. While the hackers' motives may have been to ridicule prominent figures, they inadvertently drew attention to the crucial issue of cybersecurity. As the world continues to evolve digitally, threats to privacy and security are on the rise. It is imperative that governments recognize the significance of investing in comprehensive cybersecurity solutions to protect their citizens and defend their virtual borders. The recent blunders witnessed on the EU and Ahmadinejad's websites underscore the need for better collaboration among countries and the urgency of addressing this increasingly pressing global concern."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Translate this to English?","completion":"We are finishing the day with a short excursion through Tel Aviv and the ancient city of Jaffa. Tel Aviv is a vibrant city located on the Mediterranean coast of Israel, known for its beautiful beaches, bustling nightlife, and rich cultural scene. It was founded in 1909 as a modern city on the outskirts of the ancient port city of Jaffa. Over the years, Tel Aviv has expanded and encompassed Jaffa, making it an inseparable part of the city's story. Our short excursion begins in Rabin Square, a large public square in the heart of Tel Aviv. Named in memory of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated here in 1995, the square is a center for gatherings, events, and protests. The square is surrounded by notable buildings like the Tel Aviv City Hall and the architecturally unique government complex known as \\"The Culture Square.\\" Next, we stroll down Rothschild Boulevard, a tree-lined avenue that features many cafés, restaurants, and shops, as well as some of Tel Aviv's most famous Bauhaus-style buildings. This architectural style, prevalent in Tel Aviv, has earned the city the nickname \\"The White City.\\" Rothschild Boulevard is also the location of Independence Hall, where David Ben-Gurion declared the State of Israel in 1948. Taking a brief detour from the bustling streets of Tel Aviv, we visit the peaceful Yitzhak Rabin Park, where you'll find lush lawns, scenic walking paths, and a picturesque pond. It's an ideal place to relax and take a moment to enjoy the diverse and vibrant cityscape around us. As we approach the ancient city of Jaffa, the scenery changes from modern Tel Aviv's high-rises and urban landscape to a fascinating mix of old and new. Jaffa, one of the oldest port cities in the world, is steeped in history dating back thousands of years. Here, you can explore narrow streets, marvel at the well-preserved architecture, and enjoy breathtaking views of the Mediterranean Sea. Our first stop in Jaffa is the historic port, where archeological excavations have unearthed evidence of a bustling harbor dating back to the Bronze Age. As we explore the port area, we'll learn about its significant role in ancient trade, the biblical story of Jonah and the whale, and other historical events that have shaped this fascinating city. From the port, we continue to the famous Jaffa Clock Tower, built by the Ottoman Empire in 1903. It's one of several clock towers throughout Israel and serves as a symbol of the city's rich and diverse history. The next attraction on our itinerary is St. Peter's Church, a centuries-old Franciscan church that commemorates the visit of Saint Peter to Jaffa. The church's impressive baroque architectural style and stunning artwork provide a serene atmosphere for prayer and reflection. Finally, we conclude our short excursion with a visit to the Jaffa Flea Market, a lively and vibrant marketplace where you can find an assortment of antiques, vintage items, and modern treasures amongst the lively stalls and alleyways. As the sun sets over the Mediterranean, we say goodbye to the ancient city of Jaffa and the modern marvel that is Tel Aviv, having enjoyed a fascinating journey through time and history, seasoned with a flavor of Israel's diverse and rich culture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Williams High School to make way for equally successful black coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington). Yoast debates pursuing opportunities elsewhere, but when most of his white players vow to sit out the season unless he coaches, he changes his mind and stays on as Boone's assistant.Throughout training camp and the season, Boone and Yoast's black and white players learn to accept each other, to work together, and that football knows no race. As they learn from each other, Boone and Yoast also learn from them and in turn, the whole town learns from the team, the Titans.

For this, we can use dynamic programming to build a 2D matrix that stores the lengths of the common substrings found in both strings. Then, we can iterate through the matrix to find the maximum length and extract the longest common substring. Step 2: Convert this substring to all lowercase and sort it alphabetically. We can use the built-in \`lower()\` function to convert all the characters in the substring to lowercase, and the \`sorted()\` function to sort the characters alphabetically. Finally, we can join the sorted characters back into a string using the \`join()\` function. Step 3: Replace the substring at its respective positions in the two lists with the updated substring. We can find the starting indices of the longest common substring in both strings A and B, and then use slicing to replace the original substring with the updated substring.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: The Vedic period or Vedic age (c. 1500 - c. 600 BCE) is the period in the history of the Indian subcontinent intervening between the end of the urban Indus Valley Civilization, and a second urbanisation which began in c. 600 BCE. It gets its name from the Vedas, which are liturgical texts containing details of life during this period that have been interpreted to be historical and constitute the primary sources for understanding the period. The Vedas were composed and orally transmitted by speakers of an Old Indo-Aryan language who had migrated into the northwestern regions of the Indian subcontinent early in this period. The associated Vedic culture was tribal and pastoral until c. 1200 or 1100 BCE, and centred in the Punjab. The commonly accepted period of earlier Vedic age is dated back to the second millennium BCE. After the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilisation, which ended c. 1900 BCE, groups of Indo-Aryan peoples migrated into north-western India and started to inhabit the northern Indus Valley. The Indo-Aryans were a branch of the Indo-Iranians, which--according to the most widespread hypothesis--have originated in the Andronovo culture in the Bactria-Margiana era, in present northern Afghanistan. Some writers and archaeologists have opposed the notion of a migration of Indo-Aryans into India. Edwin Bryant and Laurie Patton used the term \\"Indo-Aryan Controversy\\" for an oversight of the Indo-Aryan Migration theory, and some of its opponents. These ideas are outside the academic mainstream. Mallory and Adams note that two types of models \\"enjoy significant international currency\\" as to the Indo-European homeland, namely the Anatolian hypothesis, and a migration out of the Eurasian steppes. According to Upinder Singh, \\"The original homeland of the Indo-Europeans and Indo-Aryans is the subject of continuing debate among philologists, linguists, historians, archaeologists and others. The dominant view is that the Indo-Aryans came to the subcontinent as immigrants. Another view, advocated mainly by some Indian scholars, is that they were indigenous to the subcontinent.\\" The knowledge about the Aryans comes mostly from the Rigveda-samhita, i. e. the oldest layer of the Vedas, which was composed c. 1500-1200 BCE. They brought with them their distinctive religious traditions and practices. The Vedic beliefs and practices of the pre-classical era were closely related to the hypothesised Proto-Indo-European religion, and the Indo-Iranian religion. According to Anthony, the Old Indic religion probably emerged among Indo-European immigrants in the contact zone between the Zeravshan River (present-day Uzbekistan) and (present-day) Iran. It was \\"a syncretic mixture of old Central Asian and new Indo-European elements\\", which borrowed \\"distinctive religious beliefs and practices\\" from the Bactria-Margiana Culture. What were differences after inhabiting the northern Indus Valley?","completion":"The article doesn't specifically detail the changes or differences that occurred after the Indo-Aryan peoples migrated and started to inhabit the northern Indus Valley. The most relevant information connected to this query suggests that these peoples brought their distinctive religious traditions and practices with them. Additionally, it's noted that their religion emerged as \\"a syncretic mixture of old Central Asian and new Indo-European elements\\", borrowing \\"distinctive religious beliefs and practices\\" from the Bactria-Margiana Culture.

Call Loretta Lynch for a vote, get her confirmed, let her do her job. This is embarrassing,\\" Obama told reporters during a joint White House press conference with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. \\"There are times where the dysfunction in the Senate just goes too far,\\" the President added. \\"This is an example of it.\\" If confirmed, Lynch would be the first African-American woman to lead the Justice Department. It has been 160 days since Obama nominated her on Nov. 8, and the delay in her confirmation is the longest since Ronald Reagan tapped Edwin Meese for the post in 1984. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is holding up Lynch's nomination as leverage to push Democrats to drop a filibuster on an unrelated anti-human trafficking bill. Democrats object to that measure because it contains an abortion provision. McConnell has said he won't bring up Lynch for a vote until the dispute is resolved. Obama called on Congress to move her nomination forward, saying that no one could articulate a reason beyond political gamesmanship as to why she has not been confirmed. READ: Loretta Lynch fast facts The moment was a particularly politically-charged one during a press conference largely focused on international trade and the Iranian nuclear agreement. Republicans in the Senate have yet to offer a timeline as to a possible vote on Lynch's confirmation, and Eric Holder continues to serve as attorney general. McConnell's office insisted Friday that the majority leader is working to resolve Lynch's nomination. \\"The leader has already announced that the Lynch nomination will get a vote,\\" McConnell's Deputy Chief of Staff Don Stewart told CNN. \\"Members are continuing to work to find a way to overcome the Democrats' filibuster of a bipartisan bill that will help prevent women and children from being sold into sex slavery. Once that bill's complete, the Lynch nomination is next.\\" RELATED: Jeb Bush says Loretta Lynch deserves a vote Both Republican and Democratic leaders in the Senate maintain they are working towards a resolution on the sex-trafficking bill. McConnell said Thursday that bipartisan negotiations on an unrelated bill that have tied up the chamber \\"continue to make progress\\" and he hopes to pass the bill \\"early next week.\\" Minority Leader Harry Reid appeared to share McConnell's optimism Thursday. \\"Ms. Lynch's nomination will not remain in purgatory forever,\\" Reid said. RELATED: Senators narrowing in on deal that paves the way for Lynch vote But for all the optimism, the Senate wrapped up its business for the week Thursday without tackling Lynch's nomination. Some Republicans in the House have defended the delay. Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, a member of the Republican Study Committee, said that while he believes Lynch will eventually get a vote, the vetting process must be as thorough as possible. \\"I certainly think they ought to have a right to actually examine her positions, her views. You know, the attorney general's office—which used to be an independent office that actually enforced the law—no longer is that,\\" he told CNN on Friday. \\"So I actually think there are reasonable questions on both sides of the aisle about how the new attorney general will handle [issues].\\" CNN's Dana Bash, Athena Jones and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Nits, Blondels, Skots, Lamberts, and Footlamberts are measures of? What is the answer?","completion":"Nits, Blondels, Skots, Lamberts, and Footlamberts are various units of luminance used to describe the perceived brightness of light emitted, transmitted, or reflected by a surface. Luminance refers to the intensity of light per unit area of a surface in a specific direction. These units are employed in various fields such as photography, optics, lighting design, and display technology. Let's take a closer look at each unit to better understand their applications and conversions: 1. Nit: A Nit (also known as candela per square meter, or cd/m²) is a standard unit to describe the luminance of a surface and is part of the International System of Units (SI). One Nit represents a luminance value of one candela per square meter. It's a widely used unit to measure the brightness of TV screens, monitors, and any other flat panel displays. 2. Blondel: The Blondel (also known as the millilambert or mL) is another unit of luminance, where 1 millilambert represents 1/1000 of a lambert. The Blondel can be converted to Nits using the following relationship: 1 Blondel equals 3.18309 Nits (i.e., 1 Nit equals 0.31416 Blondels). Since it is a non-SI unit, it is rarely used today, but can still be found in some older texts and materials. 3. Skot: The Skot is a supplementary unit of luminance derived from the photometric system, which represents the brightness of a surface as perceived by the human eye. It is defined as 1/10,000 (0.0001) cd/m² or 0.0001 Nits. The Skot is often used to measure the brightness of a surface under extremely low light levels, such as in dimly lit spaces or at nighttime. 4. Lambert: The Lambert (L) is a unit of luminance named after the French physicist Johann Heinrich Lambert. One Lambert represents the luminance of a perfectly diffusing surface that uniformly emits light at a rate of 1/π (approximately 0.31831) candelas per square centimeter. To convert Lamberts to Nits, use the following equation: 1 Lambert = 3,183.099 Nits (1 Nit = 0.00031416 Lamberts). While not an SI unit, it played a significant role in photometry until being largely replaced by the Nit. 5. Footlambert (fL): The Footlambert is a non-SI unit of luminance used primarily in the United States. One Footlambert is equal to the luminance of a perfectly diffusing surface that emits light at a rate of 1/π (approximately 0.31831) candelas per square foot. To convert Footlamberts to Nits, use the equation: 1 Footlambert = 3.4262591 Nits (1 Nit = 0.2919 fL). The Footlambert is commonly used in the film industry to calibrate projector screens and in the design of commercial lighting fixtures. In summary, Nits, Blondels, Skots, Lamberts, and Footlamberts are all measures of luminance used to express the perceived brightness of light emitted, transmitted, or reflected by a surface. Though some of these units are not part of the SI system and have become less common over time, they still hold significance in certain contexts and industries. Understanding the relationships between these units is essential for accurate luminance calculations and conversions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The kind-hearted Manning gives her his handkerchief to dry her tears. She then runs off taunting Manning as an April-fool prank. He stumbles and raises a fist at her – and this is witnessed by Mrs Zunz. The girl is later found murdered on the bomb site, strangled as she sang 'Oranges and Lemons' while feeding the ducks. Manning is picked up by Scotland Yard for questioning and is later arrested and charged with murder, with circumstantial evidence including his handkerchief (found under the body of the girl), a fibre from his coat under the dead girl's fingernail and the testimony of Mrs Zunz. A wartime pilot who suffered a head-wound, even Manning himself started to doubt his mind, and wondered if he had suffered from a \\"blackout\\"?Manning's wife, Jill, convinced he is innocent, contacts lawyers, but the defending barrister refuses to see her and her imprisoned husband, because he wants to preserve an \\"objective view\\" on the case.

A set number of times A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, I would choose the option (viii). A set number of times. Justification: The teacher's first hint suggests that \\"cells are programmed to divide only a set number of times\\". This means that cells can not divide as many times as they like or infinite numbers of time, ruling out options (i) and (iv). The teacher's second hint states \\"parts means something has been divided\\". This gives no direct answer, but further helps to conclude cells indeed go through division hence eliminating the option (iii) which means \\"No times\\". Options (ii), (v), (vi) and (vii) seem irrelevant to the given context as they mention about damage, day, heat, and temperature, respectively, none of which connect to the cell division process.

Combine like terms on the right-hand side of the equation: 0 = (-3*p + 11*p) + 8 The sum of -3*p and 11*p is: -3*p + 11*p = 8*p So, the simplified equation is: 0 = 8*p + 8 Step 2: Isolate the variable p. To do this, we will move the constant term (+8) from the right side of the equation to the left side by subtracting 8 from both sides: 0 - 8 = 8*p + 8 - 8 -8 = 8*p Step 3: Solve for p. Now, we will divide both sides of the equation by 8 to isolate p: -8/8 = 8*p/8 -1 = p So, the value of p that satisfies the equation 0 = -3*p + 11*p + 8 is p = -1."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Bjorn Borg was born in Stockholm, Sweden, on 6 June 1956, as the only child of Rune and Margaretha Borg. He grew up in nearby Sodertalje. As a child, Borg became fascinated with a golden tennis racket that his father won at a table-tennis tournament. His father gave him the racket, beginning his tennis career. With 11 Grand Slam titles, Borg ranks sixth in the list of male tennis players who have won the most Grand Slam singles titles behind Roger Federer (20), Rafael Nadal (16), Pete Sampras (14), Roy Emerson (12), and Novak Djokovic (12). The French Open--Wimbledon double he achieved three times consecutively was called by Wimbledon officials \\"the most difficult double in tennis\\" and \\"a feat considered impossible among today's players.\\" Only Nadal (in 2008 and 2010) and Federer (in 2009) have managed to achieve this double since, and Andre Agassi, Nadal, Federer and Djokovic are the only male players since Borg to have won the French Open and Wimbledon men's singles titles over their career. Ilie Nastase once said about Borg, \\"We're playing tennis, and he's playing something else\\". In his 1979 autobiography, Jack Kramer, the long-time tennis promoter and great player himself, had already included Borg in his list of the 21 greatest players of all time. And in 2003, Bud Collins chose Borg as one of his top-five male players of all time. In 2008, ESPN.com asked tennis analysts, writers, and former players to build the perfect open era player. Borg was the only player mentioned in four categories: defense, footwork, intangibles, and mental toughness--with his mental game and footwork singled out as the best in open era history. Borg famously never won the US Open, losing in the final four times. Borg also never won the Australian Open, as he only played in the event once, in 1974 as a 17-year-old. The only players to defeat Borg in a Grand Slam final were fellow World No. 1 tennis players John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors. Even though it was then played on grass, a surface where he enjoyed much success, Borg chose to play the Australian Open only once, in 1974, where he lost in the third round. Phil Dent, a contemporary of Borg, has pointed out that skipping Grand Slam tournaments--especially the Australian Open--was not unusual then, before counting Grand Slam titles became the norm. Additionally, another contemporary Arthur Ashe told Sports Illustrated, \\"I think Bjorn could have won the U.S. Open. I think he could have won the Grand Slam, but by the time he left, the historical challenge didn't mean anything. He was bigger than the game.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: It may have taken you a long time to reach a point in your life when you decided you needed to start over. Alternatively, you could have been in a negative family situation since you were born and then decided that you needed to make life better. Whatever your case, try to determine the contributing factors to the situation. Think about things people said and did, patterns of behavior (your own and others’), tones of voice, and patterns of your own thinking. Make a list of negative things you tend to repeat to yourself. Find evidence for and against this thought. Look for facts, rather than opinions. Ask yourself what makes you think this way. Put systems in place that will ensure that you don’t repeat the negative things that happened in the past. Create plans to follow whenever you notice feelings that trigger behavior that you regret. For example, perhaps you’ve noticed that when you feel sad, you tend to drink alcohol: form a plan for dealing with your sadness that will keep you from drinking. Talk to a friend and ask him to help you with this problem. When you’re feeling sad, you can call him and ask them to come over. You can both play a sport or do something different. You could even try to talk about what is making you feel sad to help you deal with the situation. Try to come up with more than one plan to follow in these situations in case something prevents you from following your original one. If you understand why things happened the way they did, try to think of solutions that will prevent history from repeating. If other people are the reason that your life was negative, it can be more difficult to change the situation. For example, if you’re a teenager and your parents make your home life difficult, maybe you can encourage your parents to seek help for their lifestyle. You know your loved one best. It can be difficult to convince others to seek the help they need to better their life. Think of ways that you can help him yourself, consult with others on how best to approach the situation or read psychology articles related to your issue. You can’t simply stop doing things -- you have to start doing other activities to replace them. For example, if you had a habit of coming home from school and smoking in your room, form a routine that will help you achieve your goals instead. Plan ahead and ask a friend to help you, if you like. Once you come home, wash up, eat lunch then immediately leave for the public library to study. New habits may be harder to form than new routines. Start by consciously engaging in behavior that you want to become habit. Take for example, trying to maintain your personal hygiene. Make a conscious effort to brush your teeth before going to bed and after waking up in the morning. Set a daily reminder on your phone to help you or ask a parent to check that you’ve brushed your teeth. Once this becomes habit, you’ll feel uncomfortable if you don’t brush your teeth at these times. In your day to day life and in the long run, keep your goals in mind when you’re making decisions. Think about how your decision will affect your day and your future. Remember the poor choices you’ve made in the past. Choose that which is better for you. Sometimes, you might make a decision that would have worked for you in the past but doesn’t any more. Maybe playing video games used to refresh your mind and now it doesn’t bring you that same peace of mind. This is okay. You can outgrow anything. Don’t force yourself to do something that no longer serves you well.","completion":"This article is about recognizing negative patterns in your life, making a plan to change them, and creating new habits for a happier and better future."},{"prompt":"Question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

Given the question: Information: - The Alpine Rhine Valley is a glacial alpine valley, formed by the part of the Alpine Rhine (German: ) between the confluence of the Anterior Rhine and Posterior Rhine at Reichenau and the Alpine Rhine's mouth at Lake Constance. From Reichenau, the Alpine Rhine flows east, passing Chur and turning north, forms the border between the canton of St. Gallen of Switzerland on the left, west side and first Liechtenstein and then Vorarlberg, Austria on the right, east side. The Swiss-Austrian border follows the historical bed of the Rhine, but today the river follows an artificial canal within Austria for the final . The Rhine Valley in this area extends to about . Its upper third has the character of an Alpine valley, enclosing a bottom plain of about across. Downstream of Vaduz, the valley widens considerably, developing into a broad plain, measuring some across at its lower end along the southern shores of Lake Constance. From the point of the Rhine's emergence from Lake Constance, it is known as High Rhine. - The Alps are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately across eight Alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 metres (just over 13,000 feet). - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe.

The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - A principality (or princedom) can either be a monarchical feudatory or a sovereign state, ruled or reigned over by a monarch with the title of prince or by a monarch with another title within the generic use of the term \\"prince\\".

The prince's estate and wealth may be located mainly or wholly outside the geographical confines of the principality. - The Swiss Plateau or Central Plateau constitutes one of the three major landscapes in Switzerland alongside the Jura Mountains and the Swiss Alps. It covers about 30% of the Swiss surface. It comprises the regions between the Jura and the Alps, partly flat but mostly hilly, and lies at an average height between 400 and 700 m AMSL.

The concept of Central Europe is based on a common historical, social and cultural identity. Central Europe is going through a phase of \\"strategic awakening\\", with initiatives such as the CEI, Centrope or V4. While the region's economy shows high disparities with regard to income, all Central European countries are listed by the Human Development Index as very highly developed. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate.

The Multiple Sclerosis Society's report suggests there is a \\"wait-and-see\\" approach by doctors which needs to end. But drug watchdog NICE says while this \\"disease-modifying therapy\\" can help in some cases, the benefits need to be weighed carefully against side-effects. It is reviewing exactly when and how some of these relatively new treatments should be used. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an incurable condition that can lead to sight loss, pain, fatigue and disability. It affects around 100,000 people in the UK. Many have a relapsing, remitting version - where they experience flare-ups of symptoms and then have periods where symptoms ease or disappear. The new review - a result of meetings between patients, medics, charities and researchers - suggests that contrary to some previously held views, the disease may continue to get worse during the remitting phase. It argues that prompt treatment with disease-modifying medicines may help in these cases. Michelle Mitchell, of the MS Society, said: \\"Relapsing, remitting MS has been redefined - we now know the clock never stops with this disease and neither should our fight against it. \\"In the UK, the most common treatment option for MS in its early stages is currently no treatment and this needs to change for the sake of tens of thousands of people's health.\\" The organisation is encouraging doctors and patients to agree plans for treatment quickly - within six months of diagnosis. But Dr Paul Cooper, a brain specialist who advises the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says although disease-modifying drugs have a role in established relapsing, remitting disease, there is still debate about their use early on in the condition. He added: \\"These drugs are potent with potentially long-term side-effects and consequences, therefore we have to balance the risks and benefits. \\"NICE is looking into these issues but the analysis is not yet complete and the data needs to be looked at carefully.\\" He says there are other things that can help people with multiple sclerosis, including better accesses to specialists and physiotherapy. NICE plans to publish a new appraisal of drugs used to treat MS in 2017. In the meantime, doctors can prescribe these drugs, guided by specific criteria, including the number of previous relapses. People with multiple sclerosis can also be diagnosed with a primary progressive form of the condition where symptoms get gradually worse over time - without periods of remission. According to the NHS, there is currently no treatment that can slow the progress of this form of the disease.

The two scenarios do not have a direct connection, as they describe two different activities set in two different locations. It is possible for either situation to occur independently or at different points of time, but the premise does not necessarily support or lead to the hypothesis. The premise involves an outdoor activity, taking place likely during the autumn season when leaves fall from trees, accumulating on the ground in a pile that can be jumped on. The boy's action, jumping onto the pile of leaves, suggests that he is likely engaging in playful behavior, enjoying the feeling of leaping into the soft cushion of autumn foliage. Moreover, this situation implicates that the environment is suitable and safe for outdoor play, and the weather conditions possibly allow for such activities. On the other hand, the hypothesis describes a boy sitting on a couch indoors, which is a completely different context from the premise. It is not connected to the season, weather conditions, or outdoor activities. This scenario could take place at any time of the year and is not dependent on the presence of a pile of leaves for jumping. The act of sitting on a couch implies relaxation, rather than the active play suggested by the premise. The hypothesis, a boy sitting on a couch inside, is a separate situation unrelated to the premise about jumping into a pile of leaves. In summary, the premise about a boy jumping onto a large pile of leaves does not support or lead to the conclusion of the hypothesis, which states that a boy is sitting on a couch inside.

Here is a news article: DENVER – A missing elderly man who authorities discovered dead in an elevator at a Denver apartment complex last month may have reached out for help by pressing the elevator’s emergency button. Isaak Komisarchik, 82, had early-onset dementia and was last seen July 5. He was reported missing, and Denver Police made a concerted effort with Komisarchik’s family to locate him. Despite their efforts, Komisarchik’s body was located in an elevator car at the Woodstream Village apartments, 10050 East Harvard Avenue, on July 31. Tenants at the apartment complex complained of an awful smell coming from the parking garage elevator, leading to the discovery of the body. Denver Police continue an active investigation into the man’s death, and Denver Fire officials are now revealing new details about the events leading up to Komisarchik’s death. First reported by the Denver Post, Denver Fire officials say they’ve learned Komisarchik pressed an emergency button in the elevator twice on July 6 before he died. “Something is not right, and police are going to make a determination on what that is,” Capt. Greg Pixley, of Denver Fire, said. Pixley said the activation of the elevator’s emergency button was recorded electronically twice, although officials never received the call. Pixley said Denver Fire was never notified that the elevator was taken out of service and it met the appropriate fire code standards for 2016 and had the appropriate permits for operation in 2017. Tenants say the elevator wasn't working and that few people parked in the garage during summer months. If that's the case, it raises questions about why an elevator company wasn't called. Pixley said MEI Total Elevator Solutions monitors the elevator for Woodstream Village. The company issued the following response. \\"We are saddened by the tragic loss of life and extend our deepest condolences to Mr. Komisarchik's family and friends. The elevator cab where he was found is located in a parking garage that is under renovation construction and not currently in active use. We are continuing to investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident with the local authorities,\\" a Greystar Management Services representative said Thursday. Denver Police said MEI Total Elevator Solutions received the distress call from the elevator and notified Woodstream's management. However, police say apartment workers failed to check the parking garage elevator after checking two other elevators in the building. Police in Denver are now working to learn why Komisarchik wasn’t able to escape the elevator and why authorities weren't notified of the emergency call. Read past reporting here. ||||| An elderly man who died in a parking garage elevator pushed the emergency button twice during an 8-minute span on July 6, but got no response despite Denver code requiring elevator operators to monitor emergency notifications around the clock. Unable to escape the elevator car — possibly because of dementia — 82-year-old Isaak Komisarchik died some time between the morning of July 6 and Aug. 2, when elevator repair workers finally discovered the body after multiple residents of the apartment complex reported a terrible stench. When a Denver firefighter responded she watched an elevator maintenance worker push the button. The elevator doors opened. Elevator maintenance workers had just found Komisarchik’s body inside the car, Denver Fire Department spokesman Capt. Greg Pixley said. A criminal investigation confirmed the number of times the emergency button was pushed, Pixley said. Now detectives are trying to determine why no one responded. “Something is not right,” Pixley said. Komisarchik died in an elevator that served a parking garage at the Woodstream Village apartments, 10050 E. Harvard Ave., that had been closed for renovation. On Aug. 8, Pixley said MEI Total Elevator Solutions monitors the elevator for Woodstream. He later said that he may have misspoken. MEI is not Woodstream’s elevator’s monitor, he said on Aug. 16. On Aug. 15, Mike Klehr, MEI Vice President of Field Operations, sent an email to the newspaper saying that although the company provides maintenance for the elevators for Woodstream, the company does not provide the elevator emergency monitoring service. “On behalf of MEI – Total Elevator Solutions, we offer our deepest condolences to Mr. Komisarchik’s family. MEI has fully cooperated with local authorities in their investigation of this matter,” Klehr wrote in the message. “We are saddened by the tragic loss of life and extend our deepest condolences to Mr. Komisarchik’s family and friends,” Greystar Management Services, which manages Woodstream, said in a statement released by spokeswoman Lindsay Andrews. She wrote that the elevator was not in use due to the renovation and said Greystar is “continuing to investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident with the local authorities.” She declined to comment about why no one responded to the emergency calls. Denver Medical Examiner’s spokesman Steven Castro said the cause of Komisarchik’s death has not yet been determined. Pixley said it can be difficult to determine a cause of death when a body is badly decomposed. Numerous Woodstream residents complained to managers of a strong odor emanating from the garage area but nothing had been done. Andrews declined to comment about the complaints. The fact that Komisarchik pushed the emergency button twice adds a new perplexing dimension to the incident. It appears Komisarchik did what he needed to do to get help and yet the closely regulated system for rescuing people trapped in elevators failed. “The elevator wasn’t inoperable,” said John White, spokesman for Denver police, contradicting numerous reports that elevator was not working. “How he got in there and when he got in there is obviously what we’re trying to figure out.” Misconceptions about the discovery of Komisarchik’s body make it impossible to fully grasp just how bizarre the incident was, according to officials and residents of the apartment complex. Some officials initially reported that Komisarchik’s body was found in the elevator shaft, Pixley said. Komisarchik was last seen wearing pajamas at 2:30 p.m. on July 5 at a nearby nursing facility on the 9900 block of East Yale Avenue. His disappearance sparked a large dragnet in which missing persons posters were distributed and Denver firefighters searched five ponds near Woodstream in an attempt to find him. According to city codes adopted in 1981, the interior of all elevator cars must have signaling devices including an emergency switch labeled “alarm” adjacent to the car’s operating panel and a phone or intercom labeled “help” allowing two-way communication with security. In some cases the alarms are connected to the Denver Fire Department or an elevator monitoring company, which is responsible for investigating an emergency call. When the two-way communication phone or intercom is not connected to on-site security, a call must automatically be forwarded within 30 seconds to the elevator-monitoring company. Elevators are regularly inspected by the fire department. The garage elevator at Woodstream Village was last inspected in December and found to be in good working order, Pixley said. The fire department did not receive any emergency calls from that particular elevator car during the period of time Komisarchik was in it. When police checked, two elevator calls from the same elevator car where Komisarchik was found were electronically logged at 9:09 a.m. and 9:17 a.m. on July 6, the morning after he disappeared. Nearly a month later, a Denver fire lieutenant was inspecting an apartment complex adjacent to Woodstream that is also managed by Greystar when the maintenance manager received a call from elevator repair staff saying they thought there was a body in the elevator. The fire lieutenant followed the manager to the nearby parking garage, Pixley said, but when she reached the garage, she smelled an odor so intense that she knew it was a body.

Answer a question about this article: Infrared reflectography (fr; it; es), as called by art conservators, can be applied to paintings to reveal underlying layers in a completely non-destructive manner, in particular the underdrawing or outline drawn by the artist as a guide. This often reveals the artist's use of carbon black, which shows up well in reflectograms, as long as it has not also been used in the ground underlying the whole painting. Art conservators are looking to see whether the visible layers of paint differ from the underdrawing or layers in between – such alterations are called pentimenti when made by the original artist. This is very useful information in deciding whether a painting is the prime version by the original artist or a copy, and whether it has been altered by over-enthusiastic restoration work. In general, the more pentimenti the more likely a painting is to be the prime version. It also gives useful insights into working practices.

In his realistic genre paintings he used mythological themes, making modern interpretations of classical subjects, with an emphasis on the female human body. During his life he enjoyed significant popularity in France and the United States, was given numerous official honors, and received top prices for his work. As the quintessential salon painter of his generation, he was reviled by the Impressionist avant-garde. By the early twentieth century, Bouguereau and his art fell out of favor with the public, due in part to changing tastes.

Title: Orgy of the Dead Movie plot: The film opens to two muscle-bound men dressed in loincloths approaching a crypt. They open the doors, revealing a coffin. They remove the lid and exit the crypt, then the inhabitant of the coffin (Criswell) sits up to deliver an opening narration. This narration mostly matches the prologue of Night of the Ghouls (1959), with one minor variation and an additional line. The phrase \\"world between the living and the dead\\" of the original is changed to \\"void between...\\". There is also a new line at the end: \\"A night with the ghouls, the ghouls reborn, from the innermost depths of the world!\\"[1] The opening credits feature the image of \\"an immobile young woman clad in gold\\". The image was probably inspired by a memorable scene of Goldfinger (1964).[1] Following the credits, the camera shifts to a lone Chevrolet Corvair driving down a California desert road. Its passengers Bob (William Bates) and Shirley (Pat Barrington) are arguing over the decision to use this night to search for a cemetery. Bob is a horror writer who hopes that the scene of a cemetery at night will bring him inspiration. The conversation ends when Bob accidentally drives the car off the road and over a cliff.[1] The next scene opens to a nocturnal image of a fog-shrouded cemetery. The lonely figure of the Emperor (Criswell) walks towards a marble altar, sits, and then summons his \\"Princess of the Night\\", the Black Ghoul (Fawn Silver), who appears and bows before him. The Emperor warns that if the night's entertainment fails to please him, he will banish the souls of the entertainers to eternal damnation, indicating that he is an all-powerful demonic being.[1] As the full moon appears, the Black Ghoul summons the first dancer of the night, a Native American woman (Bunny Glaser). The Black Ghoul explains that this woman loved flames, and that both she and her lovers died in flames. The woman dances and strips before the flames of the cemetery.[1] The Black Ghoul then introduces the second dancer of the night, a street walker in life. While the...

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: Cannes review: Ryan Goslingâs Lost River The heartthrob actorâs directorial debut is unlike anything youâd expect, critic Nicholas Barber writes. Has ambition become pretension? You have to hand it to Ryan Gosling. He could have kept his multitude of devoted fans happy by coasting through romantic comedies and action movies for decades. But instead he gravitated towards edgier indie fare, including Nicolas Winding Refn’s Drive and Derek Cianfrance’s Blue Valentine and A Place Beyond the Pines. Now he’s venturing even further from Hollywood’s comfort zone, not just by making his first film as a writer-director, but by making a film that is extravagantly, spookily odd. Quite a number of his devoted fans may rip up their Gosling posters after they’ve seen it. Still, Lost River should earn him some new fans to take their place. It’s the work of a surprisingly confident and experimental young filmmaker, even if he’s not yet confident enough to move beyond his influences. In the film’s opening minutes, the most obvious of those influences are Terrence Malick and David Gordon Green. The setting is the poverty-ravaged rural Deep South, where lyrical views of meadows lit by the low sun are contrasted with stark shots of derelict wooden houses. During the closing credits, a logo informs us that Lost River was filmed in Michigan, the go-to location for grimly post-apocalyptic decay, and it affords some striking imagery here. One scene is set in a defunct zoo, now engulfed in vegetation – the former residence of jungle animals is becoming an actual jungle. One of the few remaining family homes in the area is occupied by a single mother (Christina Hendricks from Mad Men) and her two sons. Falling behind on her mortgage payments, she accepts a mysterious job offer made by her bank manager (Ben Mendelsohn). At this point, just as we’re settling into a gritty, naturalistic report from recession-era America, Gosling makes a sharp turn into David Lynch territory. The woman’s new job is in a creepily retro nightclub where the ghoulish cabaret involves gory faked stabbings and the ironic crooning of easy-listening songs. To give him his due, Gosling is so open about his debt to Lynch that he chooses Deep Purple as the film’s theme song – which is as close as you can get to Blue Velvet without it being Blue Velvet. And there’s plenty more Lynchian weirdness where that came from. The woman’s son (Iain De Caestecker) meets a girl (Saoirse Ronan) who lives with her pet rat and her mute, reclusive grandmother. But their romance is threatened by a vicious thug named Bully (Matt Smith, the last Doctor Who), a man so nasty that he once removed his henchman’s lips with a pair of scissors. Why the henchman sticks by him is never explained, but nothing much makes sense in Lost River. Gosling is having so much fun with slow-motion, garish colours and offbeat editing that he soon gives up on logic. When he introduces a town at the bottom of the local reservoir, you start to wonder if he will ever be able to pull all of the macabre freakishness together into something coherent. He doesn’t. As a piece of storytelling, Lost River is so hazy and fanciful that it could easily be dismissed as a bored A-list star’s pretentious self-indulgence. But as a fever dream of memorably strange visuals and disconcerting atmospherics, there’s no denying that it’s quite an accomplishment. When Gosling makes his next film, he should probably leave his Lynch and Malick DVDs on the shelf and hire a co-writer. But, if the skill and boldness he demonstrates in Lost River are any indication, his career behind the camera is worth following. If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter. Summary:","completion":"Lost River is a movie directed by Ryan Gosling. Ryan is a famous actor who did something very different by directing this movie. The movie has beautiful scenes of nature, but also shows very old and broken houses. It's a little scary and strange, but also very interesting. In the movie, there's a mother and her two sons who live in a broken house and she has to do a weird job to pay for it. The movie might confuse some people because it's not like a normal story, but it shows that Ryan Gosling is good at making movies, not just acting in them."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have this equation: -342 * t + 931 + 779 = 0 First, let's add 931 and 779 together: 931 + 779 = 1710 Now our equation looks like this: -342 * t + 1710 = 0 Now, we want to get \\"t\\" by itself. To do that, we will move the 1710 to the other side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides: -342 * t = -1710 Now, we need to divide by -342 to find the value of \\"t\\": t = -1710 / -342 When we do this division, we get: t = 5 So, the solution to the math problem is t = 5. That means if we put 5 in place of \\"t\\" in our original equation, both sides will be equal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Options: A: Because it was naughty. B: Because Da Niu was unfriendly to it. C: Because it wanted to save Da Niu's life. D: Because it wanted to throw it. A:","completion":"To answer the question, let's go through the article step by step: 1. Da Niu finds a hurt bird in the forest and takes it home. 2. Da Niu looks after the bird carefully every day. 3. The bird recovers from its injuries. 4. One morning, Da Niu is sitting next to a wall, enjoying the sunshine. 5. The bird takes Da Niu's hat and flies away. 6. Da Niu chases the bird, angry and shouting at it. 7. The wall Da Niu had been sitting next to suddenly falls down. From these points, we can analyze the possible reasons behind the bird's action: A: Because it was naughty - This could be a possibility, but the bird may have had another reason, given that Da Niu took care of it during its recovery. B: Because Da Niu was unfriendly to it - This option seems unlikely, as Da Niu had been taking care of the bird when it was hurt. C: Because it wanted to save Da Niu's life - This option seems most plausible, as the bird's actions led Da Niu away from the wall that collapsed shortly after. D: Because it wanted to throw it - This option is vague and doesn't provide a clear motive for the bird's actions.

The Blitz was only authorised when the Luftwaffe had failed to meet preconditions for a 1940 launch of Operation Sea Lion, the provisionally planned German invasion of Britain. By May 1941 the threat of an invasion of Britain had passed, and Hitler's attention had turned to Operation Barbarossa in the East.

Here are possible answers to this question: - office - bar - barn - industrial area - museum I believe the correct choice is \\"barn\\", here's why:","completion":"The correct choice is indeed \\"barn\\", and here's why: A milking machine is a device used to extract milk from animals, particularly cows and goats. It is designed to ease the process of milking and improve efficiency, especially in large commercial dairy farms. In addition to increasing productivity, milking machines also help maintain hygiene and reduce the risk of contamination. Now let's examine the potential locations listed and why a barn is the most appropriate place for a milking machine: 1. Office: An office is a space where business operations take place, and employees perform administrative tasks. It is unsuitable for housing a milking machine as it is not designed to accommodate farming activities or animals. 2. Bar: A bar is an establishment where alcoholic beverages are served and consumed. It is not an appropriate location for a milking machine because it primarily focuses on providing drinks and socializing opportunities for patrons rather than agricultural activities. 3. Barn: A barn is a structure used to house livestock, store agricultural products, or serve as a workspace for farmers. This makes it the ideal location for a milking machine, as it is designed to accommodate animals, provide suitable conditions for efficient milking, and ease the process of milk collection. 4. Industrial area: Industrial areas are dedicated to housing factories, warehouses, or manufacturing plants where various products are produced or processed. While milking machines are produced in factories, once they are set up, they need to be located near the animals they are designed to milk. As a result, an industrial area is not the best location for a milking machine. 5. Museum: A museum typically houses and displays objects of historical, artistic, or cultural significance. While it is possible that a milking machine might be placed in an agricultural museum for exhibition purposes, it would not be used for its intended purpose as it would not be connected to the live animals being milked.

Although this statement briefly explains the primary purpose of clothing, it is essential to understand all facets of the role clothing plays in providing advantages and improvements to the wearer. Clothing serves multiple purposes in our lives. The most apparent improvement it provides is maintaining a comfortable level of warmth, protection, and support against natural elements such as weather conditions, temperature changes, ultraviolet (UV) rays, and other environmental hazards. Protection from weather conditions: Different types of clothing shield us from various weather conditions, including rain, snow, wind, and heat. The materials used in the construction of our garments, like waterproof and thermal fabrics, help keep us dry, warm, and safe from harsh weather conditions. Temperature regulation: Clothing is essential in maintaining an optimal body temperature, especially during extreme conditions. For instance, during cold temperatures, the layers we wear trap a layer of air that is warmed by our body heat, offering insulation against the cold. In warmer temperatures, lighter fabrics and loose-fitting clothing allow air circulation, facilitating the evaporation of sweat to keep us cool and comfortable. Ultraviolet protection: Clothing acts as a barrier against harmful UV rays emitted by the sun. Some specifically designed fabrics even offer ultraviolet protection factors (UPF) that block or absorb these damaging rays to protect our skin from sunburn, aging, and skin cancer risks. Protecting from physical harm: Apart from weather conditions, clothing offers a layer of protection against injuries caused by accidents, cuts, abrasions, and burns. For example, people who work at construction sites wear protective clothing like helmets, gloves, and steel-toed boots to prevent injuries. Hygiene: Clothing helps maintain good hygiene by acting as a barrier against dirt, dust, and bodily fluids. It also prevents our bodies from spreading or catching contagious germs, bacteria, and viruses, protecting us from diseases and infections. Social and cultural purposes: Clothing also plays a significant role in expressing our individuality, social status, and cultural identity. It helps us adhere to societal norms, professional dress codes and communicates aspects of our personality and affiliations without verbally addressing them. In conclusion, the statement mentioned initially does indeed answer the question by outlining the most apparent function of clothing, which is to improve the wearer's comfort. However, it is essential to realize that the benefits of clothing extend beyond that, offering long-lasting protection, temperature regulation, social expression, and overall well-being."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Pick your answer from: -Insert the tape into the VCR and press fast forward.; -Insert the tape into the VCR and press play.;...I think the answer is","completion":"Although both methods technically allow you to play a VHS tape, the more reasonable and efficient method for accomplishing the goal of playing a VHS tape is to insert the tape into the VCR and press play. First, let's briefly analyze both options: 1. Insert the tape into the VCR and press fast forward: This method initially fast forwards through the content of the tape, meaning you will not watch the tape's content in real-time, nor from the beginning. The primary purpose of the fast forward feature is to quickly move to a specific part or segment of the tape that the user wishes to view, not to play the entire tape. If you choose this method, you would have to stop fast-forwarding at a specific point, then press play to actually view the content. This method works, but it is not the most reasonable choice for simply playing a VHS tape. 2. Insert the tape into the VCR and press play: This method ensures that the tape is played from the beginning, assuming the VHS tape's position is reset. By pressing play, the VCR initiates the playback process, and the tape's video and audio content is transmitted to the connected display device, such as a television, for immediate viewing. This is the primary function of the VCR, and this method is the most straightforward and effective way to begin watching a VHS tape from the start. In conclusion, the more reasonable method for accomplishing the goal of playing a VHS tape is to insert the tape into the VCR and press play.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Carson was feeling sad about his breakup and told Kai he couldn't hang out that day. Given the context: How would Carson feel as a result? A:","completion":"Carson would likely feel a mix of emotions as a result of his breakup and decision to not hang out with Kai that day. Here is a detailed analysis of the various emotions Carson might experience: 1. Sadness: Carson is already feeling sad about his breakup, which shows that he was attached to the person he was in a relationship with. This sadness can manifest in various ways, such as feeling down, crying, or a sense of emptiness. 2. Loneliness: Since Carson decided not to hang out with Kai, he might experience a sense of loneliness. Being alone at a time when he is emotionally vulnerable can intensify his feelings of sadness and make coping with the breakup more difficult. 3. Regret: It's possible that Carson may feel regret over his decision to not hang out with Kai. He might later recognize that the support and companionship of a friend could have helped him deal with his emotions more effectively. 4. Guilt: Carson may feel guilty for canceling plans with Kai, especially if they had been looking forward to spending time together. This guilt can add to his emotional burden and could potentially strain his friendship with Kai. 5. Anxiety: Breakups can cause anxiety as people worry about their future without the person they were partnered with. Carson might worry about how he will cope with his new-found single status, whether he will find love again, or if he will be able to maintain his friendships. 6. Loss of self-esteem or confidence: Depending on the circumstances of the breakup, Carson might feel inadequate or question his worth. These feelings can result in lowered self-esteem and a loss of confidence in his ability to form and maintain meaningful relationships. 7. Denial or disbelief: If the breakup was sudden or unexpected, Carson could experience denial or disbelief. He may struggle to accept that the relationship is truly over and fluctuate between hope and despair. 8. Relief: In some cases, ending a relationship can lead to feelings of relief, especially if it was causing significant stress or unhappiness. Carson might experience a sense of liberation from a situation that was no longer fulfilling or healthy. These emotions are not mutually exclusive, and Carson could experience several or all of these feelings at different times or concurrently. As time passes and he begins to heal from the breakup, some of these emotions may fade, while others may evolve or persist for an extended period. Various factors, such as the length of the relationship, the nature of the breakup, his personality, and his support system, can all impact how Carson processes his emotions and navigates this challenging time in his life."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Doctors studied Dan, a normal patient, whit a normal number of red blood cells, and Jim, a patient that had sickle-cell anemia. The differences were remarkable in terms of overall well-being and health. Which patient had more red blood cells, Dan or Jim? Hint: The primary role of red blood cells in the circulatory system is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness.","completion":"In terms of the number of red blood cells, Jim, the patient with sickle-cell anemia, may have a similar count or even slightly higher count compared to Dan, the normal patient. However, it is important to note that the main issue in sickle-cell anemia is not related to the number of red blood cells, but rather their functionality and shape. Sickle-cell anemia is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the hemoglobin protein. Hemoglobin is responsible for binding to oxygen and transporting it throughout the body. In patients with sickle-cell anemia, the abnormal hemoglobin, known as hemoglobin S, causes red blood cells to become misshapen and crescent or sickle-shaped. These sickle-shaped red blood cells are prone to clumping together and can cause blockages in small blood vessels, restricting blood flow to tissues and organs. As a result, the tissues don't receive an adequate amount of oxygen, leading to various health complications and causing the patient to feel unwell. Furthermore, normal red blood cells have a life span of about 120 days, whereas sickle-shaped red blood cells only last for about 10-20 days before they break apart. This rapid breakdown leads to a shortage of red blood cells, causing a condition called hemolytic anemia in sickle-cell patients. To compensate for this shortage, the bone marrow of these patients may produce more red blood cells, which could sometimes result in a higher red blood cell count. However, even with a higher count, the overall functionality of these cells is severely reduced due to their abnormal shape and the altered hemoglobin protein. In summary, while Jim may have a similar or slightly higher number of red blood cells in comparison to Dan, Jim's overall well-being and health are significantly affected due to the compromised functionality of his red blood cells."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Airman Joe Kelly, who is Ace's enlisted crew chief, is about to wed a Japanese woman, Katsumi, in spite of the disapproval of the United States military establishment, which will not recognize the inter-racial marriage. The Air Force, including Ace, is against the marriage. Ace and Joe have an argument during which Ace uses a racial slur to describe Katsumi. Ace eventually apologizes, then agrees to be Joe's best man at the wedding.

Write a title for this article: “HIS WEREN’T CANVASES to be framed,” curator and historian Mark Rosenthal says about the renowned French artist Jean Dubuffet, whose early work in painting and sculpture is the focus of a new show at Acquavella Galleries, opening today. Indeed Dubuffet, who, alongside artists like Alberto Giacometti and Francis Bacon, is often associated with the generation of Europeans who emerged in and around World War II, made work that refused to bend to convention—it’s an attitude that also shaped Dubuffet’s life. Born in Le Havre, France in 1901 to a family of bourgeoisie wine merchants, Dubuffet’s early involvement with art was marked by periods of inactivity, during which time he preoccupied himself with the family business. But in 1942, he decided to devote himself to his art full time. But unlike Giacometti and Bacon, whose disquieting works directly reflected the wartime period, Dubuffet explored subtler terrain—many times depicting in his work caricatured representations of friends, women, and even, cows. “Dubuffet never painted a tortured figure in his life. Rather, he took off on another existential path as if to say, I’m going to do what I want to do—he was more concerned with subverting conventional ideas of art,” says Rosenthal, formerly of the Detroit Institute of Art. At the same time, a number of portrait shows went up in Paris, featuring paintings of handsome war heroes and members of the elite. “He was doing everything to transgress against that,” says Rosenthal. “He made paintings that had very rough surfaces, often containing stones and plaster and tar. He deliberately made his figures look wild and grotesque.” Later, his resistance to the traditional led Dubuffet to champion outsider art— which he coined art brut (“raw art”)—in the form of a collection of art works by African artists as well as those suffering from mental illness. Of course, as Rosenthal is quick to point out, these subjects weren’t unknown—Picasso was interested in African art as far back as the turn of the century, as was Paul Klee—but it’s undeniable that Dubuffet certainly furthered the idea that such art was as legitimate as that by European traditionalists. This latest exhibition at Acquavella surveys Dubuffet’s work from 1943 to 1959, on view together for the first in over two decades, showcases an passion that influenced countless neo-avant-garde artists like Georg Baselitz and Anselm Kiefer. “Dubuffet was one of the great disruptors of art history,” says Rosenthal. “He utilized the most humble of materials, all of which projected new visions of beauty.” Jean Dubuffet: Anticultural Positions is on view at Aquavella Galleries in New York City through June.","completion":"\\"Exploring the Unusual Art of Jean Dubuffet: From Silly Cows to Bumpy Paintings\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Within the cradle of ancient civilization empires are built, wars fought, alliances forged, and heroes born.Agamemnon (Brian Cox), king of Mycenae, has united most of Greece's kingdoms under his rule and now advances his army upon the nation of Thessaly, hoping to include it in his collection of ever-growing conquests. King Triopas (Julian Glover) bargains with Agamemnon to each let one of their best fighters decide who wins the battle rather than engaging in open war. Triopas calls upon the giant Boagrius (Nathan Jones) while Agamemnon calls to Achilles, but the legendary warrior is nowhere to be found. A messenger boy (Jacob Smith) is sent to fetch him and Agamemnon curses the stubborn nature of the fiercest warrior Greece has ever seen. A half-god and blessed with incomparable strength and skill, Achilles lives to fight but he refuses to associate with Agamemnon, preferring instead to seek his own destiny and be immortalized in history. Achilles easily defeats Boagrius, sealing Agamemnon's control over the nation, and calls out if there is anyone else worthy enough to fight him.Meanwhile, Prince Hector (Eric Bana) and Paris (Orlando Bloom) of Troy feast in the banquet hall of King Menelaus of Sparta (Brendan Gleeson) as honored guests and peace ambassadors to their home nation.

He convinces her to come back with him to Troy, stowing her away on his brother's ship. When Hector finds out he is clearly angry but it is too late to return to Sparta with Helen and seek pardon. Finding Helen gone, Menelaus vows revenge on Troy and seeks the approval of his brother, Agamemnon, who is only too happy to oblige, though Agamemnon's decision comes mostly from his desire to sack Troy.Odysseus (Sean Bean), king of Ithaca and under command of Agamemnon, goes to convince Achilles to accompany them in the...

QPR boss Harry Redknapp has suggested his side's shock cup loss at Burton could hasten the departure of several players. Redknapp paid the price for making nine changes as League Two Albion claimed a 1-0 win in their Capital One Cup second-round tie at the Pirelli Stadium. The likes of Shaun Wright-Phillips, Nedum Onuoha, Karl Henry, Junior Hoilett and Adel Taarabt were among the players to come in and Redknapp was far from impressed by most of them. Redknapp did single out Taarabt - who was making his first appearance for the R's in 16 months - for praise but, with Monday's transfer deadline looming, many of the rest could be heading out. Asked if any business was possible, Redknapp said: 'Absolutely. I still think we need a bit of quality in one or two areas. 'There are one or two who played last night or are not going to get in my team who I think might be better moving on.' The future of former Manchester City, Chelsea and England winger Wright-Phillips at Loftus Road is again in question. The 32-year-old has faded from the limelight since joining Rangers three years ago in a move that was supposed to rejuvenate his career. On Wednesday he was completely overshadowed - almost literally - and outplayed by his marker, the towering 6ft 5in defender George Taft, and was withdrawn after 78 minutes. Goal: Burton celebrate Adam McGurk's 77th-minute winner to knock QPR out. Out? Shaun Wright-Phillips' QPR future is in doubt after struggling against Burton on Wednesday night. Hoilett hit the bar in one of Rangers' better moments, but the Canadian is also in danger of drifting to the periphery. Redknapp said: 'I wanted an awful lot more (from the wide areas). I thought Junior did all right first half but Shaun had a tough night.' Redknapp did say he would like Taarabt to stay but did not know the intentions of the Moroccan, who spent last season on loan at Fulham and AC Milan and has a buy-out clause. Struggle: Taarabt is another player who could be leaving Loftus Road, despite Redknapp's desire to keep him. As well as any transfer business, Redknapp is also anxious to get QPR's season up and running this weekend. The Londoners have lost all three of their games, with the Burton defeat compounding woes after last weekend's 4-0 defeat by Tottenham. Redknapp said: 'Saturday is important, it's massive for us. It won't be easy against Sunderland, that's for sure. 'They were a team in form at the end of last season and have started decent this year. We have got to pick ourselves up and get ready to go on Saturday.' Out: Redknapp watches on in disappointment as his QPR side crash out of the Capital One Cup to Burton. The mood was considerably different at Burton, the modest but well-run Staffordshire club who have made steady progress since promotion to the Football League in 2009. After missing out on promotion in the play-offs last season, the Brewers have made a solid start to the new campaign and are unbeaten in six games across all competitions. Striker Adam McGurk, who curled home the 77th-minute free-kick that settled the tie, said: 'Everyone is buzzing. It's a great win. We worked as hard as we could and we nicked the goal to get the win. 'We have had the likes of Wigan, Stoke and Derby here and given everyone a game. We just work away and stick to the game plan and it is paying off. 'When the goal went in and at full-time you could hear the roar. 'It is great for the fans to get memories like this. It's brilliant for them. 'But these are bonuses for us. Our main aim is obviously promotion. We can't get sidetracked from that. 'We have to get back down on Friday morning and make sure we keep our run going in the league.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"QPR manager Harry Redknapp has hinted that several players may depart from the team after their unexpected Capital One Cup second-round loss to Burton.

Magnets are able to place a force on certain materials. This force is called a magnetic force. The force a magnet exerts is a little different from the forces you may normally think about. You exert a force on a book when you lift it. You also exert a force on the pedals of your bicycle. In both those cases, those forces cause a change. The change you see in both these cases is called motion. Magnets, too, can produce change. They can produce motion just like you do. Unlike you, magnets do not have to touch something to exert a force. A magnetic force is exerted over a distance. Thats right, a magnet can push or pull certain items without ever touching them. Thats how the maglev train works. Do you know another type of force that does not require objects to touch? These forces are known as non-contact forces. Another type of non-contact force you may be familiar with is gravity. Gravity too can cause changes in motion. Gravity holds our moon in orbit without touching it.

This indicates that Carson's primary intention was to spend meaningful time with their daughter and bond over the activity of reading together. Answer A (teach their daughter to read) and Answer B (show what they read when they were an adult) are both related to the specific activity of reading, but they do not capture the main purpose of the situation as much as Answer C does. In the context, it's evident that Carson wants to create a shared experience with their daughter and foster a positive relationship. This can be achieved by engaging in activities that they both enjoy, like reading. Choosing a book as the medium for their bonding experience can also spark conversations, evoke emotions, and stimulate imagination. This helps create lasting memories between the parent and the child. Furthermore, spending quality time together is essential for the overall well-being and growth of a child. It fosters emotional closeness, builds trust, and strengthens family bonds.

Theories ranged from it being Martian art to a volcanic eruption– but now geologists believe there could be a simpler explanation. They claim it was caused a geologic condition called 'collapsible soils' where refilling of a lake caused soil to collapse, creating a small eruption. Gary Dalton and his two brothers recently discovered a round hole or crater in the bottom of their irrigation pond on their farmland in Circleville, in Piute County, Utah. The outer ring is a depression filled with algae. An inner circle looks as though something erupted from beneath, forming what looks like a small volcanic crater WHAT ARE 'COLLAPSIBLE SOILS'? This type of soil that can rapidly settle or collapse the ground is known as collapsible soil. 'Hydrocompactive soil' is the most common type of collapsible soil. The term hydro – implies the introduction or presence of water, which is the case with the mystery crater. The pond has been drained and refilled more than a dozen times in the last two years. The theory is that the repeated loading of weight on the soil eventually led some of the soil under the pond to collapse, creating a small eruption. 'As it collapsed and compacted,' said geologist Bill Lund, 'it forced some air and some water up and created this thing. It looks like a one-off thing. It just happened one time. That's it.' The crater was discovered last month by Gary Dalton of Circleville after he saw an unusual hole in a lake. 'The sun was just right,' Mr Dalton said. 'So, I saw this blasted thing that no one had ever seen.' He noticed it after most of the water was drained from the pond for irrigation. Just beneath the surface he saw concentric circles in the pond bottom with a diameter of about 25ft (7.6 metres). The outer ring is a circular depression filled with algae. An inner circle looks as though something erupted from beneath, forming what looks startlingly like a small volcanic crater. 'My heck, I guess that's Martian art,' Mr Dalton said. 'I don't know.'

But Mr Lund said that theory was quickly disproved by aerial photos that were taken before the pond was excavated two-and-a-half years ago. 'This was an alfalfa field and there was no spring here,' Mr Lund said. 'It's not a spring.' The central depression is about 17.8cm (7in). The Dalton family were able to push the handle of a pitchfork another 33cm (13in) or so straight down in the soft centre THE THEORIES SO FAR Some had speculated that the feature was caused by a natural spring, pushing up from under the pond after being supercharged by recent rains. Another theory was that a buried pipeline had been punctured during construction of the pond. But experts said there is no pipeline. Scientists then proposed that there was a burp of methane gas from decaying organic material under the pond. Earthquakes sometimes will cause similar features in sand or mud, due to liquefaction of soils. But there have no earthquakes in the Circleville area powerful enough.

Passage:HMS Defender was a D-class destroyer built for the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. The ship was initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet before she was transferred to the China Station in early 1935. She was temporarily deployed in the Red Sea during late 1935 during the Abyssinia Crisis, before returning to her assigned station where she remained until mid-1939. Defender was transferred back to the Mediterranean Fleet just before World War II began in September 1939. She briefly was assigned to West Africa for convoy escort duties in 1940 before returning to the Mediterranean. The ship participated in the Battles of Calabria, Cape Spartivento, and Cape Matapan over the next year without damage.

Here is a goal: To make Oreo cookies look like a spider, How would you accomplish this goal? Options: (I). make four pretzel stick pieces stick out of either side.; (II). stick M&M candies all along the edges of the cookie.;","completion":"To make Oreo cookies look like a spider, I will follow these steps: Step 1: Gather materials I will need the following materials: 1. Oreo cookies 2. Pretzel sticks 3. M&M candies, preferably in brown or black 4. A knife or scissors (to cut the pretzel sticks) Step 2: Prepare spider's legs Using a knife or pair of scissors, I will carefully cut the pretzel sticks into smaller pieces that will serve as the spider's legs. Step 3: Insert legs into Oreo Given that a spider has eight legs, I will choose option (I) to make the Oreo look like a spider. I will carefully insert four pretzel stick pieces on each side of the Oreo, sticking out like a spider's legs. To do this, I can gently push the sticks into the cream filling of the Oreo, making sure not to break the cookie. Step 4: Add M&M candies as eyes To make the spider look more realistic, I will use two M&M candies (preferably brown or black) as the spider's eyes. To attach them, I can add some frosting or edible glue on the back of each M&M and stick it on the top edge of the Oreo, above the legs. Alternatively, I can gently push the M&Ms into the cream filling, making sure not to break the cookie. Step 5: Adjust the legs I can arrange the pretzel stick pieces so that they're evenly spaced and angle them in a way that makes them look like real spider legs. Step 6: Evaluate and repeat Finally, I will evaluate the outcome and decide if the Oreo spider looks realistic. If it needs adjustment, I will do so and repeat the process with other Oreos until I am satisfied with the result. In summary, I will create an Oreo spider by inserting pretzel sticks as legs and adding M&M candies for the eyes. These steps will help transform ordinary Oreo cookies into a fun and creative edible spider."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, based on the given premise, it is possible to conclude that the hypothesis is true. The premise states that setting up a college fund for them was extremely important, mainly to avoid putting them through the same experiences the speaker went through. This strong emphasis on the importance of creating a college fund serves as the basis for the hypothesis, which simply restates the significance of the action. The hypothesis, \\"It was very important to us to set up a college fund,\\" is a reiteration of the core message conveyed in the premise. Therefore, if the premise is true, it logically follows that the hypothesis is also true. The reasoning behind this conclusion is that the premise and the hypothesis present the same idea: the importance of establishing a college fund for the children. The premise effectively communicates the urgency and significance of taking this step for the speaker, stemming from difficult personal experiences. On the other hand, the hypothesis distills this concept into a straightforward statement that encapsulates the central sentiment shared in the premise. In conclusion, if the premise, \\"a um college fund for them because it was just so important i said i don't want them to go through what i went through,\\" is true, then the hypothesis, \\"It was very important to us to set up a college fund,\\" is also true. This is because both the premise and the hypothesis convey the same idea—the significance of establishing a college fund for the children.

Given the question: Given the background: As a young man, Bohr worked in Rutherford’s lab in England. Because Rutherford’s model was weak on the position of the electrons, Bohr focused on them. He hypothesized that electrons can move around the nucleus only at fixed distances from the nucleus based on the amount of energy they have. He called these fixed distances energy levels, or electron shells. He thought of them as concentric spheres, with the nucleus at the center of each sphere. In other words, the shells consisted of sphere within sphere within sphere. Furthermore, electrons with less energy would be found at lower energy levels, closer to the nucleus. Those with more energy would be found at higher energy levels, farther from the nucleus. Bohr also hypothesized that if an electron absorbed just the right amount of energy, it would jump to the next higher energy level. Conversely, if it lost the same amount of energy, it would jump back to its original energy level. However, an electron could never exist in between two energy levels. These ideas are illustrated in the Figure below . and the situation: Greg was studying Bohr's model. He found it helpful to categorize different scenarios in the model. First, he labeled electron with higher energy as cat A, and electron with lower energy as cat B. Then he labeled electron that gained energy as cat C, and election that lost energy as cat D. Answer the following question: Which electron would be farther from the nucleus, cat A or cat B? The answer is:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background, electrons with more energy are found at higher energy levels, farther from the nucleus. Comparing Greg's categorization of electrons, cat A represents an electron with higher energy while cat B represents an electron with lower energy.

Answer the following question: SEOUL — North Korea’s recent threat to pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S. has added new urgency to South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s visit to Washington next Tuesday. President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors. According to the above context, answer the following question. Why does Trump want North Korea to denuclearize? Available choices: (a). because it will benefit North Korea, the US, and other nations; (b). because President Moon wants him to; (c). because he said he would; (d). not enough information; Answer:","completion":"(a). because it will benefit North Korea, the US, and other nations;"},{"prompt":"Question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: How tall is the player that was selected first by the Portland Blazers in the 1984 draft?

Can you fix that?","completion":"Absolutely, the corrected sentence would read as follows: \\"But this teaching provided no analysis.\\" As a point of reference for future writings, here's why we capitalize and punctuate it in that manner: 1. The first word of each sentence in English is always capitalized. It doesn't matter if it is a one-word sentence or a full paragraph, the first word always starts with a capital letter. This is a fundamental rule of English writing and is used to clearly delineate where one thought ends and another begins. In this case, \\"but\\" is the first word of the sentence, so it should be \\"But\\". 2. Proper nouns in English are always capitalized, but, in this sentence, there are no identifiable proper nouns. 3. The next important point to note about this sentence is the need for periods (full stops). In English, every complete thought or sentence must end with some form of punctuation. For most declarative statements (those sentences that are simply stating a fact, like the sentence in question), this punctuation is a period, or a full stop. 4. The term 'this teaching' represents a singular entity, therefore, it doesn't need to be capitalized unless it is at the starting of a sentence. 5. The word 'no' is used in the negative form, emphasizing the absence or lack of something. In this context, 'no' is indicating the lack of 'analysis' provided by the teaching. Neither 'no' nor 'analysis' are capitalized unless they begin the sentence or are part of a title. By fixing the capitalization and punctuation in accordance with those rules, we reform the sentence into: \\"But this teaching provided no analysis.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Administration of Nuffield's donation was the responsibility of the University, as the college did not become an independent body until after the Second World War. A sub-committee, consisting of three heads of Oxford colleges (Sir William Beveridge from University College; Alfred Emden from St Edmund Hall; and Linda Grier from Lady Margaret Hall), was appointed to choose the architect; Emden appears to have played the major part in the group's work. Eight architects were initially asked to compete, including Louis de Soissons, Vincent Harris, Austen Harrison, Charles Holden, Edward Maufe, and Hubert Worthington. All but Holden and Maufe submitted photographs of their work, and the sub-committee then recommended Harrison, a decision confirmed after he was interviewed on 17 June 1938. At that time, Harrison had never worked in Britain: although he had qualified there, he had practised in Greece and Palestine. Indeed, the college seems to have been his only project in the country, and remains his best known work, along with his later University of Ghana. Harrison was not given any restrictions or limitations on style; Nuffield agreed to Harrison's appointment, but was not consulted on the architectural style of the college before Harrison started work. When Nuffield's donation was announced, it was reported that the \\"general idea\\" was that the college buildings should be sited behind gardens, similar to the memorial gardens at Christ Church, Oxford, so that those entering Oxford from the west would be faced with a \\"beautiful vista of well-planned gardens seen through railings\\"; this idea did not form part of Harrison's designs. After Harrison's preliminary studies, it became clear that the proposed site could not contain a college and an institute for social science research as planned; Nuffield agreed to provide an additional plot of land on the opposite side of Worcester Street. Harrison proposed to build the college on the main site, with the institute on the second site. The hall was to be at the east end...

The premise and the hypothesis are separate statements that describe different scenarios, and there is no direct connection between them. In the premise, we learn that there is a man walking with two donkeys, and one of those donkeys is carrying a heavy load. This statement focuses on the man and the donkeys, explaining the situation in which they find themselves. There is no mention of any harmful interaction between the man and the donkeys. This statement seems to describe a peaceful, uneventful scenario, where the donkeys are presumably helping the man transport the heavy load. On the other hand, the hypothesis, \\"A donkey eating a man,\\" describes a completely different and violent situation. This statement is disturbing and implies a dangerous situation where a donkey is attacking and consuming a human being. This action is highly unlikely, as donkeys are herbivorous animals, and they do not naturally possess predatory instincts towards humans or other animals. In conclusion, the premise provided does not give us any information or evidence to determine the truth of the hypothesis. The two statements describe separate events without a direct connection, and one cannot be used to support or discredit the other. The premise describes a scenario involving a man and two donkeys working together to transport a load, while the hypothesis details a surreal and unlikely situation in which a donkey harms a human."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2.

Q: Article: The young policeman, Constable Rider, walked more quickly than usual, because of the cold, but he did not consciously neglect any part of his work. His torch flashed on doorways and windows as he looked for anything that was at all suspicious, and when he ever thought that anything was unusual, he went to try the door and window, probably unheard by the people sleeping in the room just above his head. As he turned a corner, he heard a slight rustling sound -- it might be a cat, it could even be a dog, although few dogs wandered about at night. Rider saw nothing. A cat then? Usually if you disturbed a cat, it ran off and jumped, and you heard or noticed something else. By doing a lot of night, you learned to notice these things, but now all Rider noticed was the silence which had followed the rustling sound. So he acted cautiously. He did not flash his torch about the houses near the corner but walked on, and, a little way from the spot where he heard the sound, stopped and bent his head, as if he was lighting a cigarette. A policeman who stopped to light a cigarette seemed the most unsuspicious policeman in the world. There was still no sound. There were bushes in the garden of the house where Rider had first heard it and he knew that a man could hide there out of sight. But if he went back, it would warn any such man. So instead he stood and shone his torch at the window nearest him, and as if he had noticed something unusual, he walked towards it and opened the wooden gate, which made no sound at all. He reached the entrance and shone the torch on the keyhole of the front door -- and as he did so, the rustle came again, this time much more softly. He looked round quickly.

Question: Given the following context: As a result of Henry's expansion, St Peter ad Vincula, a Norman chapel which had previously stood outside the Tower, was incorporated into the castle. Henry decorated the chapel by adding glazed windows, and stalls for himself and his queen. It was rebuilt by Edward I at a cost of over £300 and again by Henry VIII in 1519; the current building dates from this period, although the chapel was refurbished in the 19th century. Immediately west of Wakefield Tower, the Bloody Tower was built at the same time as the inner ward's curtain wall, and as a water-gate provided access to the castle from the River Thames. It was a simple structure, protected by a portcullis and gate. The Bloody Tower acquired its name in the 16th century, as it was believed to be the site of the murder of the Princes in the Tower. Between 1339 and 1341, a gatehouse was built into the curtain wall between Bell and Salt Towers. During the Tudor period, a range of buildings for the storage of munitions was built along the inside of the north inner ward. The castle buildings were remodelled during the Stuart period, mostly under the auspices of the Office of Ordnance. In 1663 just over £4,000 was spent building a new storehouse (now known as the New Armouries) in the inner ward. Construction of the Grand Storehouse north of the White Tower began in 1688, on the same site as the dilapidated Tudor range of storehouses; it was destroyed by fire in 1841. The Waterloo Block, a former barracks in the castellated Gothic Revival style with Domestic Tudor details, was built on the site and remains to this day, housing the Crown Jewels on the ground floor. answer the following question: What building as it currently stands dates from the period of Henry VIII? Answer:","completion":"The building that currently stands and dates from the period of Henry VIII is the St. Peter ad Vincula chapel. It was originally a Norman chapel, and it was incorporated into the Tower of London during Henry's expansion. Henry VIII had the chapel rebuilt in 1519, and although it was refurbished in the 19th century, the current building mostly dates from his reign."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: She's the One Context: The film tells the story of two Irish Catholic Fitzpatrick brothers, Mickey (Edward Burns) and Francis (Mike McGlone) and the tribulations of love, family and betrayal. Mickey is a New York City blue-collared taxi driver, unhappy over an act of infidelity committed by Heather (Cameron Diaz), his ex-fiancÃ©e. Francis is a white-collared Wall Street stock investor, who unknown to his wife, Renee (Jennifer Aniston), is having an affair. During weekends, Mickey and Francis visit their parents who live on Long Island. Their mother is never seen on screen, while they have better time interacting with their father, Frank (John Mahoney), who always gives Mickey and Francis advice to live out their lives any way they can and to always go for what drives them to succeed. While driving his cab one day, Mickey picks up Hope (Maxine Bahns), an NYU art student with whom he becomes infatuated and impulsively marries after a few days. This causes consternation for his brother, largely because he was not asked to be best man at the wedding. Mickey moves in with Hope, but later becomes disillusioned with aspects of their lifestyle, including frequent power cuts in their ramshackle apartment. Francis is also having problems in his marriage. He is concerned that he is being unfair to Heather, his mistress, the same woman Mickey left, by continuing to stay with Renee. At the same time, Renee's Italian-American family, mostly her younger sister Molly (Amanda Peet), suggest the problem with Francis' lack of interest in her is that he may be gay, so she has Mickey and their father, Frank, confront him about it. He denies being gay, but admits to being unfaithful. Meanwhile, Francis' arrogance leads him to take potshots at his brother for the apparent lack of forward progression in his life with his wife, while Francis argues with Heather about her own sexual infidelity with a much older man referred to as \\"Papa\\".

Plot title: Enemies of the People Movie plot: A personal journey into the heart of the Killing FieldsOne of the most harrowing and compelling personal documentaries of our time, ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE exposes for the first time the truth about the Killing Fields and the Khmer Rouge who were behind Cambodias horrific genocide. More than simply an inquiry into Cambodias experience, however, ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE is a profound meditation on the nature of good and evil, shedding light on the capacity of some people to do terrible things and for others to forgive them.Winner of a dozen top documentary festival awards, including a Special Jury Prize at Sundance and the Grand Jury Award at the Full Frame Documentary Festival, this is a riveting film that takes audiences as close to witnessing evil as they are ever likely to get. It is also a personal journey into the heart of darkness by journalist/filmmaker Thet Sambath, whose family was wiped out in the Killing Fields, but whose patience and discipline elicits unprecedented on-camera confessions from perpetrators at all levels of the Khmer Rouge hierarchy. This is investigative journalism of the highest order.In 1974, Thet Sambaths father became one of the nearly two million people who were murdered by the Khmer Rouge when he refused to give them his buffalo. Sambaths mother was forced to marry a Khmer Rouge militiaman and died in childbirth in 1976, while his eldest brother disappeared in 1977. Sambath himself escaped Cambodia at age 10 when the Khmer Rouge fell in 1979.Fast forward to 1998, and Sambath, now a journalist, got to know the children of some senior Khmer Rouge cadre and gradually earned their trust. Then, for a decade, he spent weekends visiting the home of the most senior surviving leader, Nuon Chea, aka Brother Number Two under Pol Pot. But he never used to say anything different from what he told Western journalists, says Sambath, I was low-ranking, I knew nothing, I am not a killer.

Jonathan Swift said, “Everybody wants to live forever, but nobody wants to grow old.” Wouldn’t it be nice if we could stay healthy and young and live as long as possible? Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier. According to the above context, answer the following question.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Hearing is the ability to sense sound waves, and the ear is the organ that senses sound. Sound waves enter the auditory canal and travel to the eardrum (see Figure below ). They strike the eardrum and make it vibrate. The vibrations then travel through several other structures inside the ear and reach the cochlea. The cochlea is a coiled tube filled with liquid. The liquid moves in response to the vibrations, causing tiny hair cells lining the cochlea to bend. In response, the hair cells send nerve impulses to the auditory nerve, which carries the impulses to the brain. The brain interprets the impulses and “tells” us what we are hearing.

She found particularly offensive the Foreign Secretary, Lord Palmerston, who often acted without consulting the Cabinet, the Prime Minister, or the Queen. Victoria complained to Russell that Palmerston sent official dispatches to foreign leaders without her knowledge, but Palmerston was retained in office and continued to act on his own initiative, despite her repeated remonstrances. It was only in 1851 that Palmerston was removed after he announced the British government's approval of President Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte's coup in France without consulting the Prime Minister. The following year, President Bonaparte was declared Emperor Napoleon III, by which time Russell's administration had been replaced by a short-lived minority government led by Lord Derby.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The scenario mentioned above, where a person undergoes a complete physical more often, could have an indirect impact on kidney function. While the regular physical checkups themselves might not directly affect kidney function, the information obtained during these checkups can be employed to make lifestyle adjustments and decisions that might help the individual to maintain proper kidney health. 1. Directly impacting a step of the process: In this case, undergoing more frequent physical exams does not directly affect any step of the kidney functioning process. Kidneys will continue carrying out their tasks of filtering waste, regulating blood composition, maintaining blood volume, and preserving pH levels, regardless of how often an individual goes for a checkup. 2. Indirectly impacting a step of the process: It is possible that, by having a complete physical exam more often, one would become more aware of their overall health status and any potential risks to their kidneys. Consequently, they may adopt a healthier lifestyle and engage in practices that promote better kidney function. For instance, they could monitor their blood pressure, maintain a balanced diet, drink sufficient water, and exercise regularly. These actions could indirectly contribute to improved kidney function and may help in preventing or delaying the onset of kidney-related problems. 3. Not impacting any step of the process: If an individual with regular physical checkups does not make the required lifestyle changes or is unable to achieve better kidney function through preventive strategies, it is possible that frequent physicals would not have any significant impact on their kidney health. In such cases, additional medical intervention may be required to manage or treat kidney-related issues. In summary, frequent complete physical exams can indirectly impact the kidney functioning process by raising awareness about health issues and encouraging individuals to adopt healthier habits that promote better kidney function. However, these checkups do not directly determine how well the kidneys perform their tasks, and it is essential to make necessary lifestyle adjustments to sustain proper kidney health."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer:","completion":"Beno Gutenberg, a prominent German-American seismologist, made numerous significant contributions to the field of seismology throughout his career. He was born on June 8, 1889, in Darmstadt, Germany, and later moved to the United States. Gutenberg is best known for his collaborative work with Charles Francis Richter, who developed the Richter scale for measuring the magnitude of earthquakes. Gutenberg and Richter formed their collaborative working relationship while they were both located at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, California. Founded in 1891, Caltech is a renowned private research university known for its strengths in engineering and the natural sciences. At Caltech, the two seismologists conducted groundbreaking research on earthquakes, leading to the development of the Richter scale in 1935, which quantifies the energy released during an earthquake. During his tenure at Caltech, Beno Gutenberg focused on a wide range of topics in seismology, including the study of earthquake waves, crustal structure of the Earth, temperature gradients in the Earth's mantle, and energy released during earthquake phenomena. Importantly, he played a pivotal role in establishing the depth of the Earth's core-mantle boundary, as well as in determining the Earth's inner core structure. As colleagues and mentors at Caltech, Gutenberg and Richter worked in close collaboration, sharing a mutual interest in quantifying seismological phenomena and enhancing our understanding of the Earth's interior. Their combined efforts led to many significant discoveries and advancements in the field, laying a strong foundation for future seismologists. In summary, Beno Gutenberg and Charles Francis Richter were colleagues and mentors at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, California.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? triple x","completion":"To provide a detailed and long analysis of the sentiment in the provided phrase, \\"triple x,\\" we must first break down the components involved in the phrase and provide context where necessary. In this specific instance, we can infer that \\"triple x\\" possibly refers to the action film \\"XXX\\" (pronounced as \\"Triple X\\") released in 2002 and starring Vin Diesel as the lead actor. However, since the provided phrase doesn't offer any explicit information about the reviewer's opinion or sentiment toward the film, it is insufficient to determine whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. The statement itself could be seen as neutral, as it does not contain any information or terms that would definitively indicate the writer's opinion on the movie. To better analyze the sentiment of a movie review, it's important to take into account the context in which the phrase appears. Typically, movie reviews contain statements about the plot, characters, acting, special effects, and the overall experience of watching the movie, including emotional reactions, thoughts, and opinions. These can range from feelings of happiness and excitement to boredom and disappointment, which define whether the overall sentiment of the review is positive, negative, or neutral. To ensure an accurate sentiment analysis, the statement should contain adjectives, adverbs, or other descriptive phrases that indicate the reviewer's feelings. For example, the statement \\"I loved Triple X because of its adrenaline-pumping action sequences\\" would be considered positive, while a statement like \\"I hated Triple X for its weak acting and nonsensical plot\\" would be considered negative. A neutral statement might be something like \\"Triple X is an action movie released in 2002 that stars Vin Diesel,\\" which does not convey the reviewer's opinion or emotions. In conclusion, the sentiment of the provided phrase \\"triple x\\" cannot be accurately determined based on the information given, as it lacks contextual details and emotional descriptors that would specify whether it's positive, negative, or neutral. For a more comprehensive sentiment analysis, it's crucial to have a broader understanding of the context and emotions expressed within the movie review."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate from Spanish to English: Pero si ofrecemos primero nuestros alimentos a Krishna antes de comerlos, somos liberados del karma de matar.","completion":"\\"But if we first offer our food to Krishna before eating it, we are freed from the karma of killing.\\" This translation from Spanish to English relates to a concept within the Hare Krishna movement and other sects of Hinduism. In these faiths, Krishna is considered a supreme deity, and by offering your food to Krishna first, it's traditionally thought that it purifies the meal and absolves those who consume it from any negative karma associated with the killing of the plants or animals that were harvested for the food. The specifics of this belief can vary among different traditions or interpretations. Some believe that by making a conscientious act of devotion, such as offering your food to a deity, it helps foster an attitude of mindfulness and gratitude about everything. Others interpret it more literally and believe such an offering can actually change the spiritual nature of the food. It's important to note that this interpretation can also vary depending on a person's specific beliefs about how karma operates. For example, some people might interpret karma only in terms of intentional actions, while others might believe seemingly \\"indirect\\" actions, such as consuming food that indirectly came from causing harm, can also generate karma. The phrase could be part of a larger conversation or text regarding these philosophical and theological concepts.

Can you tell me what it is? The answer is:","completion":"The area that has been largely neglected by China's economic rise, according to the provided text, is the public healthcare system, particularly in inland areas such as Sichuan. The issue is further intensified by a widening disparity between the prosperous urban dwellers and the struggling rural inhabitants. The public health care system's inadequacies directly impact these populations, reflecting the neglect of some regions amid China's economic surge. Numerous individuals in these regions have limited or no insurance, an issue that has gained attention following the earthquake that struck Sichuan. This state of underinvestment and inattention is made clear by the quotes from Vice Minister of Health Gao Qiang, who asserted that Chinese public healthcare's capacity is insufficient, and the government should cover the medical treatment costs for earthquake victims, most of whom lack adequate insurance. So, the area that remains untouched by the economic prosperity of China, as underlined by experts in the text, is the public health care system with more emphasis on the more rural and inland regions, reflecting a broader systemic neglect rather than a specific geographic region. This issue highlights the social inequality prevailing in China despite its fast-paced economic growth. This reality paints a picture of two Chinas: one urban and prospering, and the other rural and struggling. The government's role in addressing these healthcare disparities, particularly following unprecedented events like the Sichuan earthquake, underscores the gravity of these inequities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Speakers of different languages not only describe the world differently but think about it differently too, according to a new study. Researchers used a cartoon cat Sylvester to study how language was reflected in the gestures people made. Dr. Sotaro Kita of the University of Bristol's Department of Experimental Psychology , showed the cartoon to a group of native English, Japanese and Turkish speakers and then watched their gestures as they described the actions they had seen. He found speakers of the three different languages used different gestures to describe the same event, which appeared to reflect the way the structure of their languages expressed that event. For example, when describing a scene where the cat swings on a rope, the English speakers used gestures showing an arc trajectory and the Japanese and Turkish speakers tended to use straight gestures showing the motion but not the arc. Dr. Kita suggests this is because Japanese and Turkish have no proper verb to express the English meaning \\"to swing\\". While English speakers use the arc gesture as their language can readily express the change of location and the arc-shaped trajectory, Japanese and Turkish speakers cannot as easily express the idea of movement with an arc trajectory so they use the straight gesture. Dr. Kita said, \\"My research suggests that speakers of different languages cause different spatial images of the same event in a way that matches the expressive possibilities of their own languages. In other words, language influences spatial thinking at the moment of speaking.\\" Question: 70.What is mainly discussed in the text? Answer: OPTIONS: +Differences between languages. +Differences between gestures. +How people use different gestures to express the same event. +That language influences the way people think. Answer:","completion":"+That language influences the way people think."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What's the most logical way to complete this passage? By David Mccormack A shocking new video illustrates how race and color continue to play a major role in how someone is perceived in American society. The video, shot in Los Angeles, compares the general public’s reaction to first a white male, then a black male, attempting to break into a car. The social experiment was the idea of Jason Roberts, who hosts the YouTube channel Simple Misfits. Scroll down for video Jason Roberts, left, who hosts the YouTube channel Simple Misfits and his friend Quentin Brunson, right, carried out a social experience to film the different reactions to them breaking into a car The mechanic who arrived was black and","completion":"immediately noticed the disparity in reactions as he began to assist with the \\"break-in.\\" In the video, when Roberts, a white male, attempted to break into the car, passersby either ignored him or assumed he owned the vehicle and was experiencing technical issues. Some bystanders even stopped to help Roberts open the car without questioning his motives or calling the authorities. This demonstrated the implicit bias individuals may possess, associating a white person carrying out such an act with innocence or rightful ownership. On the other hand, when Quentin Brunson, a black male, attempted the break-in, the responses were alarmingly different. Many people stopped and stared at him suspiciously, recording his actions on their smartphones. Some openly accused him of theft, while others immediately called the police. The experiment revealed a stark contrast in perceptions, showing that people are more likely to associate criminal acts with black individuals. The black mechanic, witnessing these events, experienced a range of emotions, including frustration, disappointment, and sadness. The man realized how pervasive racism and prejudice continue to be in American society. He stated that his experience as a mechanic has exposed him to microaggressions and racial profiling in the past, but witnessing this social experiment brought a new perspective to the forefront. The video highlights the ongoing issue of racial bias, which still permeates various aspects of American life. It raises awareness about the implicit stereotypes that people may unknowingly carry, leading them to treat individuals of different races differently when encountering similar situations. The social experiment exposes the double standards that still exist, unintentionally contributing to systemic racism. Roberts and Brunson, in collaboration with the mechanic, hope that the footage sparks an open and honest discussion about race and inequality in the United States. They want to encourage individuals to question their biases and assumptions, fostering empathy, understanding, and positive change. In this way, the video serves as a sobering reminder that substantial progress is needed to rid American society of racial prejudice and disparities. Moving forward, the creators of the social experiment emphasize the importance of ongoing activism, promoting racial equity, and addressing the root causes of these biases. They hope that generating awareness will lead to policy changes, educational initiatives, and community-based efforts aimed at fostering a more just, equitable, and accepting society for all Americans, regardless of race, gender, or socioeconomic background. In conclusion, the video created by Roberts and Brunson reveals the deep-rooted racial biases present in American society. It highlights the need for a shift in mindset and emphasizes the urgency of addressing the issue of racial inequality. By generating a thought-provoking conversation, the creators of the social experiment hope to inspire change and bring awareness to the systemic racism that continues to plague the United States."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Troian Bellisario Opens Up About Her Anorexia Battle in Voting PSA Troian Bellisario knows firsthand what it feels like to have a mental illness — anorexia — and she’s imploring voters to elect Hillary Clinton in a new PSA. The Pretty Little Liars star says she supports Clinton because of her work to improve the health care system, particularly for those suffering from mental illnesses. Bellisario opened up about her battle with anorexia as a child. “With anorexia, a lot of it is presenting a front of ‘everything is okay’ as you’re slowly killing yourself,” she says in the voting PSA for ATTN. “Gone were the days when I was just a happy, carefree kid who was running around, and suddenly I felt this inability to interact with people and to nourish myself.” Bellisario first shared that she struggled with an eating disorder in 2014, but didn’t explicitly say it was anorexia. Now, Bellisario’s experience pushed her to campaign for Clinton. “[Mental illness] is a huge issue, and I am such a huge supporter of Mrs. Clinton for so many reasons. Specifically because she’s been such a huge advocate for health care,” she explains. “And her definition of health care includes mental health care. And that to me is just — it’s the deciding factor between both candidates.” RELATED VIDEO: Naya Rivera Reveals She Battled Anorexia as a Teen, Had an Abortion While on ‘Glee’ Bellisario says that getting treated for her anorexia was life-changing. “If I had just been sort of shunned to the side as not having real problems, I don’t know that I would be living today,” she says. “I just want to make sure that everybody has the same opportunity for treatment that I have, and I think that we have to make sure our government invests in those programs.” “What matters is that we continue to make our voices heard in this great democracy, so please vote.”","completion":"Pretty Little Liars star Troian Bellisario has opened up about her struggle with anorexia as a child and urged voters to support Hillary Clinton, who she praises for her commitment to improving the healthcare system and mental health care.

Musgrave has already prepared a team for Ethan: Declan Gormley, Zhen Lei, and his old partner Luther Stickell. The team rescues Lindsey and collects two damaged laptop computers. As they flee, Ethan discovers an explosive pellet implanted in Lindsey's head. Before he can disable it, it goes off and kills her. Back in the U.S., Ethan and Musgrave are reprimanded by IMF Director Theodore Brassel. Ethan learns that Lindsey mailed him a postcard before her capture and discovers a magnetic microdot under the stamp. IMF technician Benji Dunn recovers enough data from the laptops to determine Davian will be in Vatican City to obtain a mysterious object called the \\"Rabbit's Foot\\". Ethan plans a mission to capture Davian without seeking official approval. Before leaving, he and Julia have an impromptu wedding at the hospital's chapel.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention.

Input: Context: The effect of in vitro expansion of human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) on stem cell properties is controversial. We examined serial subcultivation with expansion on the ability of ASCs to grow and differentiate into osteoblastic lineages.', 'Flow cytometric analysis, growth kinetics, cell population doubling time, light microscopy and confocal analysis, and osteogenesis induction were performed to assess growth and osteogenic potential of subcultivated ASCs at passages 2 (P2), P4 and P6.', 'Flow cytometric analysis revealed that ASCs at P2 express classical mesenchymal stem cell markers including CD44, CD73, and CD105, but not CD14, CD19, CD34, CD45, or HLA-DR. Calcium deposition and alkaline phosphatase activity were the highest at P2 but completely abrogated at P4.

Simplify the equation: The first step is to simplify the equation by combining like terms. In this case, we can combine the constant terms on the right side of the equation (43 and 3). 23*g = 43 + 3 Now, we simplify: 23*g = 46 2. Isolate variable g: The next step is to isolate the variable g by dividing both sides of the equation by 23. (23*g) / 23 = 46 / 23 As we are dividing both sides by the same number, we can simply cancel out 23 on the left side of the equation, leaving just g: g = 46 / 23 3.

Crock pots are great for making delicious meals for our family, but we need to keep it clean so it works properly and makes yummy food every time. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to clean your crock pot. 1. Remove Leftover Food After enjoying the lovely meal your mom or dad made using the crock pot, there may be some bits of food remaining inside. To start cleaning, we need to get those bits out of the pot. Use a spoon or a spatula to scoop them out and put them in the trash. Make sure you remove as much as you can to make the cleaning process easier. 2. Clean with Warm Soap and Water Now, let's clean the inside of the pot. Take the pot to the sink and fill it with warm water. Add a few drops of dish soap inside. Use a sponge or a soft cloth to scrub the inside of the pot gently. Make sure you reach all the corners and the bottom of the pot, too. This will help get any remaining food bits and stains out. 3. Wipe the Heating Base Once the inside of the pot is clean, we need to clean the base where the pot goes. This part gets hot when we cook food, so it's important to keep it clean too. Take a soft cloth (like a washcloth) and dip it in some warm, soapy water. Then, wipe the surface of the heating base gently. Be careful not to get any water in the electrical parts of the base! 4. Remove Water Spots with Vinegar After cleaning the pot and the base, you might notice some spots where hard water dried and left marks. Don't worry; we can easily clean those with some vinegar. Mix equal parts of water and white vinegar in a small bowl or cup. Dip a soft cloth in the vinegar solution, and then gently wipe the spots on the pot and the base. The vinegar will help remove the hard water spots and make the crock pot shiny and clean! 5. Finished! Great job, little helper! Now your crock pot is all clean and ready for the next delicious meal your mom or dad wants to cook. Remember always to ask for permission or help from an adult when cleaning kitchen appliances, and be careful with the warm water. Happy cleaning!"},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Ty Warner failed to report income in an offshore bank account. 25 million was hidden in secret Swiss bank accounts. 69-year-old plush toy-maker's 18-page plea deal calls for a prison term of four years. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Ty Warner Faces Four-Year Prison Term After Hiding 25 Million in Swiss Bank Accounts Hiding substantial income from Swiss Bank Accounts has landed Ty Warner, the 69-year-old plush toy-maker, a proposed four-year prison sentence as part of an 18-page plea deal. Highlighting the severity of tax evasion and the potential ramifications, this case stands as a reminder about the importance of tax compliance and the consequences of withholding information from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Ty Warner, the founder and owner of Ty Inc., a plush toy manufacturer known for producing the popular Beanie Babies amongst other soft toys, has been caught in the act of evading taxes by not disclosing income from an offshore bank account in Switzerland. The concealed sum of 25 million, a significant amount by any standard, prompted the IRS to take immediate action and initiate a legal procedure against the multi-millionaire. The plea deal, which is extensive in its content, outlines the charges against Warner for not reporting income from the offshore bank account, the details of the hidden money, and the legal implications of breaching tax laws. Furthermore, the plea agreement suggests a four-year prison term for the 69-year-old plush toy-maker to atone for his offense. Despite the prison sentence potentially impacting Warner's personal life and business substantially, the plea deal is aimed at ensuring a fair outcome for both parties and the wider society. Tax evasion is a serious offense with the potential for damaging consequences, not only for the individual, taxpayers but also undermining the entire tax system. The Ty Warner case demonstrates the importance of conforming to the established tax laws, as well as displaying transparency with financial institutions. The four-year prison term proposed for Warner is meant to both penalize the toy-maker and dissuade other potential tax evaders from engaging in similar activities. The high-profile nature of this case also serves to highlight the role played by Swiss banks in global tax evasion schemes. While Swiss banks have historically been perceived as the bastion of secretive banking and wealth management, pressure from various governments and international organizations has forced significant changes in transparency and cooperation regarding tax matters. Although there are ongoing efforts to curb the use of offshore bank accounts and secret financial dealings, this case shows that tax evasion continues to persist on a large scale. By levying substantial fines and prison sentences, the IRS seeks to discourage individuals from resorting to such strategies in the pursuit of wealth preservation and accumulation. Furthermore, the increase in global cooperation and information sharing between financial institutions has made it increasingly difficult for tax evaders to hide their wealth and avoid paying their fair share of taxes. In conclusion, the proposed four-year prison term for Ty Warner indicates that tax evasion is an offense that can have significant consequences for all. This case serves as a stark reminder of the importance of staying compliant with tax laws, maintaining transparency with financial institutions, and cooperating with legal authorities to ensure an equitable and just taxation system for all citizens. As global compliance standards continue to evolve, it remains crucial for everyone to understand the implications of tax evasion and to act responsibly in managing our financial affairs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

On the other hand, most of the seats he designed had padding. He marked it as case B. Keith needed to know pros and cons of both designs. and a hint : Extending the period of time over which a force acts in order to lessen the force is a common practice in design. Padding in shoes and seats allows the time to increase. The front of automobiles are designed to crumple in an accident; this increases the time the car takes to stop. Similarly, barrels of water or sand in front of abutments on the highway and airbags serve to slow down the stoppage time. These changes all serve to decrease the amount of force it takes to stop the momentum in a car crash, which consequently saves lives. Please answer this question : Would case B take less or more time for the force to act than case A? Answer:","completion":"Case B, with padding, would take more time for the force to act than case A, which doesn't have padding. This is because the padding allows for an extended period of time over which the force can be distributed, resulting in a decrease in the overall force experienced and increased safety."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the answer: Who was the first to meet with the risen Jesus?","completion":"According to the New Testament, Mary Magdalene was the first person to encounter the risen Jesus after his crucifixion and resurrection. The story is documented in the four canonical gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—which provide an account of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. Mary Magdalene was a dedicated disciple of Jesus and a pivotal figure in early Christianity. She is frequently mentioned throughout the New Testament and is described as a devoted follower who provided financial support to Jesus' ministry, accompanied him during his travels, and witnessed his crucifixion, burial, and resurrection. On the morning of the resurrection, Mary Magdalene, along with a few other women, went to Jesus' tomb to anoint his body with spices, as per the Jewish burial customs. Upon arrival, they found the large stone that sealed the tomb rolled away and the tomb empty. The accounts of the specific events that followed differ slightly among the gospels, but all four agree that Mary Magdalene was the first to encounter the risen Jesus. Here is a summary of the encounters according to each gospel: 1. Matthew (28:1-10): In Matthew's account, Mary Magdalene and \\"the other Mary\\" visit the tomb to find an angel who informs them that Jesus has risen. As they are leaving, Jesus appears to them and speaks with them. The women fall at his feet and worship him before going to inform the disciples of the encounter. 2. Mark (16:1-11): According to Mark's gospel, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome visit the tomb. They are met by a young man, presumed to be an angel, who tells them that Jesus has risen and is not there. Mary Magdalene is the first to see the risen Jesus, who instructs her to go and tell the disciples about his resurrection. Initially, the disciples do not believe her, but later Jesus appears to them as well, confirming her account. 3. Luke (24:1-12): In this gospel, Mary Magdalene and several other women visit the tomb and find it empty. Two angels appear to them and declare that Jesus has risen. They leave the tomb and report the event to the disciples, who are initially skeptical. Peter decides to go to the tomb to see for himself but finds it empty, and no mention of Jesus' appearance to Mary Magdalene is described in Luke’s account. 4. John (20:1-18): In John's version of the resurrection story, Mary Magdalene goes to the tomb alone and discovers it empty. Distraught, she turns away and notices a man whom she initially mistakes for the gardener. When he addresses her by name, she recognizes him as the risen Jesus. Jesus instructs her not to touch him but to go and tell the disciples about his resurrection, which she does. Despite slight variations in some elements of the story, all four New Testament gospels agree that Mary Magdalene was the first individual to encounter Jesus after his crucifixion and resurrection. This consensus highlights the significance of Mary Magdalene's role as a close follower of Jesus and establishes her place in the Christian tradition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: It was an early September day, cool and bright and just right for running, and I was in the first few miles of a lO-knownmile race over a course with a few high hills. Still, I felt energetic; despite the hills it was going to be a fine run. Just ahead of me was Peggy Mimno, a teacher from Mount Kiseo, New York. She too was running easily, moving along at my speed. The pace felt comfortable, so I decided to stay where I was; why pay attention to pace when she was setting such a nice one? I'd overtake her later on when she tired. So I ran behind her. The course headed north for miles, wandered west for a hilly mile, then turned south again along a winding road. The race was getting harder. We had four miles left and already it was beginning to be real work. Peggy overtook a young runner. She seemed to know him, for they exchanged a few cheerful words as she passed him. Their exchange worried me. You don't chat during a race unless you feeling good, and Peggy plainly was. Still, I was close enough to overtake her if she tired, so I didn't give up hope completely. We were getting nearer to a long, punishing hill now and it would be the test. We were a mile from the finish line, so whatever happened on the hill would almost determine who crossed it first. As I moved up the hill, my attention wandered for a few minutes. When I looked up, Peggy was moving away--first five yards, then ten, then more. Finally it was clear that there was no help of catching her. She beat me soundly. There is an important lesson in that race. Women are thought to be weaker, slower and not nearly as skilled in sport. Yet as Peggy Mimno so clearly showed, the similarities between men and women runners are more important than differences. I have run with a number of women, and I can say it is often hard work.

The boy, Kurt, continued to scratch the imaginary itch, which had leapt magically from his right hand to the left. Eventually the falseness of the itch would be deduced, and the lab coated man would disappear out of the cell and return with... God knows what. He had seen torture hundreds-if not thousands-of times on TV, and he was glumly certain that there would be no commercial breaks for him. \\"Can I offer you a glass of water?\\" The question was repeated without urgency, like a forgetful waiter. The itch now leaped with the dexterity of a trained flea onto the boy's leg, and the dutiful fingers followed. He watched as the man in the lab coat, without name tag or company insignia, studied his stack of papers attached to the clipboard. Several yellow forms near the top half inch were labeled 27B. The man frowned and wrote a note on the top page. \\"Note: Find out who isn't duplicating 27B in Pink.\\" \\"I'm sorry,\\" he said, \\"I wasn't listening. Was that a yes or no to the water?\\" Kurt remained in his chair, almost motionless, except for the itching-and-scratching routine. It had leapt again, this time onto his scalp, and the twitching fingers followed. He wondered how long he could keep this up without drawing blood. Question: The boy is afraid: === The answer to the above question is Answer:","completion":"Yes, the boy, Kurt, is unquestionably afraid in this situation. There are several clues and indications in the passage that highlight his fear and anxious state. Firstly, one can observe that Kurt plays with his fingers, scratching an imaginary itch, as a means of trying to distract himself from the man in the lab coat who is sitting across from him. This fidgeting behavior is a classic sign of nervousness and anxiety, suggesting that he feels uneasy and threatened in this scenario. Furthermore, Kurt seems to be unable to concentrate on what the man is saying, which is evidenced by his lack of response when offered a glass of water. This is another hint that the boy is so afraid he can't even focus on something as simple as a question about whether or not he'd like a drink. Kurt's fear is heightened when he considers the potential for torture in his situation. The fact that he's speculated about experiencing something he's only ever seen on television, and the thought that there may be no relief, such as commercial breaks, in his own real-life experience, indicates that the boy is indeed very scared. Lastly, Kurt's increasing desperation to maintain the illusion of the imaginary itch emphasizes his fear and anxiety. He tries so hard to keep up this facade, going so far as to worry about drawing blood in the process, which ultimately suggests that he is struggling with deep fear. In conclusion, the boy in this passage is most certainly afraid, a fact that is evidenced through his various actions and thoughts as described in the text."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They meet Mathias (Joe Anderson), a German tourist, who is looking for his brother Heinrich. His last known location is an archaeological dig at a remote Mayan ruin in the jungle. They are also joined by Dimitri (Dimitri Baveas), Mathias's friend. The group reaches the ruins of a Mayan temple, and are confronted by Mayan villagers with guns and bows. Mathias tries to explain their purpose, but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English. When Amy accidentally touches some vines the villagers become increasingly agitated. Dimitri approaches the villagers, hoping to appease them, but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins. At the top, they find an abandoned camp and a shaft in the center. The group cannot call for help since Eric's phone has no signal. They hear a cell phone ringing from somewhere inside the ruins. Believing it is Heinrich's phone ringing, the rest of the group lowers Mathias down the shaft with a rope. The rope breaks and Mathias falls, becoming completely paralyzed. Amy and Jeff descend the temple steps hoping to reason with the Mayans, but to no success. In anger, Amy throws a clump of vines at them and hits a young boy, whom the Mayans promptly kill.

(CNN) -- Los Angeles Dodgers baseball manager Joe Torre's new book about his old club has been burning up best-seller lists even before it hits stores. Joe Torre speaks candidly with CNN's Larry King about his controversial new book, \\"The Yankee Years.\\" In \\"The Yankee Years,\\" Torre candidly details his life as the former skipper of the team he led to four World Series titles. In the book, Torre slams some of his old players such as Alex Rodriguez and longtime Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. In his first TV interview, Torre talked with CNN's Larry King about the controversial tell-all book. The following is an edited version of the interview. King: All right, here's some of what you say in the book about","completion":"Alex Rodriguez. You write, \\"In my years as his manager, Alex could never escape the fact that he was always compared to Derek Jeter. He was a tremendously talented player, but his constant need for approval and inability to handle pressure often held him back.\\" How did these issues affect his performance and relationships within the team? Torre: Well, Larry, it's a challenging situation for any player when they're constantly being compared to someone as iconic as Derek Jeter. Alex is an extraordinary athlete, but I think the pressure to live up to those comparisons took a toll on him mentally. It affected his on-field performance at times and created tension within the clubhouse. My goal in writing about this in the book was not to criticize Alex, but to offer a candid perspective on the difficulties he faced playing for the Yankees. King: In the book, you also discuss your relationship with George Steinbrenner. It seems to have been rocky at times. Can you share some of the challenges you both faced during your tenure as Yankees manager? Torre: Of course, George Steinbrenner was a larger-than-life character, and we certainly had our disagreements over the years. One of the challenges I faced was balancing his expectations for the team's performance with maintaining a positive atmosphere in the clubhouse. George was extremely passionate about winning and expected nothing less, but this often put immense pressure on me and the players. Despite these challenges, I have a deep respect for George and everything he accomplished as the owner of the Yankees. In \\"The Yankee Years,\\" I delve into these issues and more, hoping to give readers an honest look into my time with the team and the many ups and downs that come with managing a legendary franchise like the New York Yankees."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

North Korean forces struck massively in the summer of 1950 and nearly drove the outnumbered US and ROK defenders into the sea. However the United Nations intervened, naming Douglas MacArthur commander of its forces, and UN-US-ROK forces held a perimeter around Pusan, gaining time for reinforcement. MacArthur, in a bold but risky move, ordered an amphibious invasion well behind the front lines at Inchon, cutting off and routing the North Koreans and quickly crossing the 38th Parallel into North Korea. As UN forces continued to advance toward the Yalu River on the border with Communist China, the Chinese crossed the Yalu River in October and launched a series of surprise attacks that sent the UN forces reeling back across the 38th Parallel. Truman originally wanted a Rollback strategy to unify Korea; after the Chinese successes he settled for a Containment policy to split the country. MacArthur argued for rollback but was fired by President Harry Truman after disputes over the conduct of the war. Peace negotiations dragged on for two years until President Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened China with nuclear weapons; an armistice was quickly reached with the two Koreas remaining divided at the 38th parallel.

During the first quarter, the Redskins appeared to be in the position to score after Fred Smoot intercepted Tarvaris Jackson and returned the interception deep into Viking territory. However, the Redskins' offense was unable to score a touchdown. Mike Sellers appeared to score a touchdown on 4th and goal, but a replay challenge by Brad Childress nullified the touchdown and gave the Vikings the ball. However, the Redskins immediately tackled Tony Richardson in the end zone for a safety. Following the subsequent free kick, the Redskins marched down the field and took a 9-0 lead on a 33-yard pass from Todd Collins to Chris Cooley. In the 2nd quarter, the Redskins expanded their lead to 16-0 on a 32-yard pass from Todd Collins to Santana Moss. Later in the quarter, the Redskins took a 22-0 lead when Clinton Portis took a handoff from Todd Collins and threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to Antwaan Randle-El in the end zone. Although the Redskins were not successful on the 2-point conversion attempt, they had a commanding lead at this point in the game, and the previously rowdy Metrodome crowd was very disheartened and silent at this point. The Redskins stretched their lead to 25-0 on a 26-yard field goal by Shaun Suisham. Later in the quarter, the Vikings got the crowd back in the game when Tarvaris Jackson threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Jim Kleinsasser, cutting the Redskins' lead to 25-7. The Vikings further cut into the Redskins' lead around the 10-minute mark of the fourth quarter when Tarvaris Jackson scored on a 6-yard run, making the lead 25-14. The Metrodome crowd began sensing a comeback as momentum appeared to turn in the Vikings' favor. This came to a head midway through the fourth quarter when the Redskins appeared to complete a long pass to Santana Moss. Though initially ruled a catch by a referee on the sideline, the call was considered questionable by the game's announcers since Moss had to drag his toes to stay in-bounds as he caught the pass. Sensing an impending challenge by Childress, the Redskins raced down the field to snap the ball&#8212;since a play cannot be challenged after the ball has been snapped for the next play. However, the snap was fumbled and it appeared to be Vikings' ball after it was recovered by Vikings' defensive tackle Kevin Williams. As the Vikings rushed onto the field to take over on offense, coach Joe Gibbs challenged that Minnesota had twelve defensive players on the field at the time the Redskins snapped the ball and fumbled it. After review, Gibbs' challenge was upheld and the call on the field was reversed&#8212;a five-yard penalty was assessed to the Vikings for having too many men on the field and the Redskins maintained possession. After the Redskins had retain possession of the football they had eventually scored on a 13-yard touchdown run by Clinton Portis, making the score 32-14 capping off a 75-yard drive.

Some planets going around these stars might be similar to Earth.\\" In the past, it was hard to look for signs of intelligent life in the universe. But now, powerful telescopes allow scientists to discover smaller planets--the size of Mars or Earth in other solar systems. These planets might have intelligent life. Have beings from space already visited Earth? \\"Probably not,\\" says Shostak. \\"It's a long way away. However, intelligent beings may contact us in other way, such as radio signs.

Answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: What does the joker threaten to destroy? A hospital. Answer:","completion":"Title: Joker's Countdown Step 1: Establish the setting and main characters The story takes place in bustling Gotham City, focusing on its central hospital \\"The Gotham General.\\" Our story revolves around the main characters, Bruce Wayne/Batman (played by Robert Pattinson), Joker (played by Joaquin Phoenix), Dr. Emily Warren (played by Emily Blunt), a talented surgeon at the hospital, and Detective James Gordon (played by Gary Oldman). Step 2: Introduce the conflict The Joker, in a sinister quest for power, blackmails Gotham City by threatening to destroy the Gotham General, which serves as an essential care provider for thousands of residents. The hospital is filled with patients, staff, and the sick, which would cause numerous casualties if it were to be destroyed. Step 3: Escalate the situation To make matters worse, Joker releases a video giving Gotham City a 48-hour countdown to complete his set of undisclosed, perverse tasks or face the hospital's annihilation. As the time dwindles, the Joker deposits a mysterious box in the hospital, further heightening the tension. Step 4: Form an alliance Detective Gordon, Dr. Warren, and Batman team up to decode the series of riddles and ultimately reveal the Joker's morbid intentions. Clues lead them to various locations, unraveling the Joker's insidious plan step by step. Step 5: Character development and backstory Amidst this chaos, we delve into Dr. Warren's personal life. We learn that her mother is a patient in the hospital, battling a life-threatening disease. This knowledge only strengthens Dr. Warren's drive to save the hospital and protect the people within it. Step 6: Build to climax As the countdown approaches its end, Batman and Dr. Warren manage to solve the final riddle, leading them to the mysterious box's location. They discover the box contains a bomb rigged to detonate, and Dr. Warren relies on her medical expertise to disarm it carefully. Step 7: Confrontation and resolution In the eleventh hour, Batman and the Joker confront each other in an epic battle atop the hospital's roof. Despite the Joker's relentless mania, Batman manages to subdue and apprehend him, successfully preventing destruction on a massive scale. Step 8: Wrap up the story Following Joker's arrest, Gotham City returns to normalcy. Dr. Warren gains recognition as a life-saving hero, further inspired to continue her work at the Gotham General Hospital. Batman's legacy as the city's guardian is solidified, and he takes a moment to reflect on his difficult yet rewarding journey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: There are many travel destinations across the globe. What confuses a person most is which travel destination to choose. When choosing a destination for a vacation or a trip, you need to decide what that destination has to offer to you. Meanwhile, you should also take many factors into consideration, so that the decision-making will get easy. The amount of money you want to spend is an important factor and plays an important role in deciding a destination. For example, cities like London, New York, Vegas etc are expensive. On the other hand when you travel to Asia, the cost is generally lower and you don't need to spend much on traveling, lodging or shopping. Therefore, it is important to estimate your budget before selecting a destination. When you plan your vacation, another important thing to plan is the number of the days you want to spend. There are many travel destinations in the world that can be covered in a week's time. Some destinations like Africa, or Maldives beaches can be planned in a week's time. Some other destinations like New York, Thailand may require more than a few weeks to enjoy completely. Vacations are also planned according to the company you have. For example, if you travel with your family, then you'll need a place where you can enjoy with your family members. Similarly, if you are going with friends, a city full of amusement parks, museums, shopping centers will be an ideal destination. Therefore you need to consider whom you are going with, before deciding a destination. Question: Who are the intended readers of the text?

Hint: One reason radiation is dangerous is that it can’t be detected with the senses. You normally can’t see it, smell it, hear it, or feel it. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one in Figure below , has a tube that contains atoms of a gas. If radiation enters the tube, it turns gas atoms to ions that carry electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation.

(CNN) -- The new president of Egypt, Mohamed Morsy, is a 9-11 truther who doubts that America is telling the whole story about the collapse of the World Trade Center. He believes that a Christian or a woman should not be Egypt's leader. The ascent of his Muslim Brotherhood has been widely compared to Ayatollah Khomeini's rise to power in Iran, including most recently by Republican nominees Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. Egyptians recently breached the walls of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, immediately calling to mind the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis. Watching Morsy take to the podium at the U.N. General Assembly Wednesday for his first major address on the world stage, Americans could be forgiven for worrying that another anti-Western firebrand had just assumed power in Egypt, the Arab world's most populous country and its political bellwether.

As the political landscape in Egypt continues to evolve, along with the rise of new leaders like Mohamed Morsy, it is crucial for the international community to respect and understand the variety of perspectives that emerge. This includes acknowledging the historical context and unique cultural aspects that shape Egypt and its people. Inclusion of diverse perspectives allows for a greater chance of fostering open dialogue and enhancing political stability. By being receptive to the opinions and ideas of the Egyptian people, American policymakers and the broader international community can pave the way for a more cooperative and mutually beneficial relationship. This, in turn, contributes to global peace and security. It is important to bear in mind that Egypt's transition to democracy is still a relatively recent occurrence. As with any young democratic state, it will undergo a series of transformations as its leaders and institutions are refined. Therefore, it is essential to remain open to the possibility that some new leaders may hold views deemed controversial or unpopular by the international community. Moreover, as Egypt progresses in its democratic journey, its citizens must also be granted the opportunity to engage in the decision-making process. This includes having the freedom to express their thoughts and opinions on critical issues affecting their nation and the wider world. In acknowledging and respecting these views, the international community demonstrates its commitment to upholding the values of democracy and human rights - even when dealing with countries that might hold divergent political or social perspectives. In conclusion, as Egypt continues to grapple with the challenges of its newfound democracy, it is vital for the international community to demonstrate its willingness to listen and be receptive to the concerns and aspirations of the Egyptian people. Only by embracing the diverse range of voices from Egypt can the world truly work towards fostering understanding, enhancing stability, and promoting global peace."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: While you're hurrying around picking up gifts in the last few days before Christmas, do you have any time to think about how much your s, or friends will actually value what you find? WePay, a Website that helps people collect, manage and spend money online, has analysed tons of research, reports and surveys from different sources, and the results were surprising! Are Gift Cards a Good Idea? Rather than give someone a gift that they might not like, it's better just to pick up a gift card so they can buy what they really want, right? Wrong. This year, 2.5 billion in gift cards went unspent. Of that amount, 1.3 billion went unspent because people didn't bother making the time. Another I billion or so was forgotten altogether. How Much Do We Really Value the Gifts We're Given? The lucky recipient of a gift, like a cashmere sweater, will value it less than the amount it was purchased for. And ladies, contrary to what you might think, place less monetary value on the diamond ring they are given than the guys who have bought it for them. What Happens to Our Gifts After They're Given? Many complain that the holiday season means shopping and crazily spending money, but studies show that once the big day arrives, we are less focused on gifts than we think. Every year, at least one gift per person is regifted, returned or never even opened And How Do We Really Feel About Fruit Cakes? We all know that no one likes fruit cakes, right? Wrong, once again. Although fruit cakes continue to be taken away behind the rest of the holiday cookies and cakes on the dessert table, one in four people still consider giving them as gifts. What does this all really mean? To be clear, it's certainly not that you shouldn't enjoy the holiday spirit and feel great about giving gifts to those most important to you.

Parliament's environmental committee approved resolution urging Spain to carry out the Great Ape Project (GAP), designed by scientists and philosophers who say our closest genetic s deserve rights limited to humans. \\"This is a historic day in the struggle for animal rights and in defense of our evolutionary comrades, which will doubtless go down in the history of humanity,\\" said Pedro Poza, Spanish director of the Great Ape Project.

Question: I read this background article the other day: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. I am facing a new situation today: Two neighboring planets identical to Earth in size and atmospheric conditions behaved differently towards their environments. Planet A emitted a lot of air pollution, destroying its ozone layer, while Planet B respected the environment and used ecological products. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which planet had higher levels of UV reaching it? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information from the background article and the situation with the two neighboring planets, Planet A, which emitted a lot of air pollution and destroyed its ozone layer, would have higher levels of UV radiation reaching its surface. This is because the depletion of the ozone layer allows more ultraviolet (UV) radiation to penetrate the atmosphere and reach the surface, increasing the potential harm to life on the planet, as was mentioned with the consequences on Earth such as skin cancers, eye cataracts, disturbance of the nitrogen cycle, killing plankton, and disruption of ocean food webs. Meanwhile, Planet B, which respected the environment and used ecological products, would have maintained its protective ozone layer and thus, experienced lower levels of UV radiation reaching its surface."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The First Crusade was proclaimed by Pope Urban II (pope 1088–99) at the Council of Clermont in 1095 in response to a request from the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118) for aid against further Muslim advances. Urban promised indulgence to anyone who took part. Tens of thousands of people from all levels of society mobilised across Europe and captured Jerusalem in 1099. One feature of the crusades was the pogroms against local Jews that often took place as the crusaders left their countries for the East. These were especially brutal during the First Crusade, when the Jewish communities in Cologne, Mainz, and Worms were destroyed, and other communities in cities between the rivers Seine and Rhine suffered destruction. Another outgrowth of the crusades was the foundation of a new type of monastic order, the military orders of the Templars and Hospitallers, which fused monastic life with military service.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The First Crusade, which was initiated by Pope Urban II in response to a request for assistance from the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, concluded with the capture of Jerusalem in 1099. The objective of this crusade was to reclaim Jerusalem from Muslim control, and it mobilized tens of thousands of people across various social classes throughout Europe. After traversing a long and arduous journey, the crusaders successfully managed to capture Jerusalem, culminating in a bloody siege that led to the massacre of numerous Muslim and Jewish inhabitants. The Crusades as a whole are a complex and multi-faceted historical phenomenon, leaving a lasting impact on the relationship between Christianity and Islam. They were not only military expeditions, but also had far-reaching religious, societal, and political consequences. One significant aspect of the First Crusade was the violence committed against the Jewish population in various European cities, including Cologne, Mainz, and Worms, leading to widespread destruction and suffering. These pogroms were considered an early example of the religious intolerance and violent extremism that would come to define parts of the Crusades. In addition to the violence against Jews, the First Crusade facilitated the establishment of several innovative Christian military orders, such as the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller, organizations that combined monastic life with military service. The Templars and Hospitallers played crucial roles in subsequent crusades and influenced the development of Christian military organizations in the centuries that followed. In conclusion, the First Crusade, which began with Pope Urban II's proclamation in 1095, came to an end in 1099 with the successful capture of Jerusalem by the crusaders. This victory marked the beginning of over two centuries of religious conflict and interaction between Christians and Muslims in the Holy Land, as well as the rise of new military and religious institutions. However, the First Crusade also carried with it a dark legacy of violence and intolerance that continues to shape modern perceptions of the Crusades today."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Who does Grenouille want for his thirtennth scent? Movie title: Perfume: The Story of a Murderer Movie plot: The film begins with the sentencing of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), a notorious murderer. Between the reading of the sentence and the execution, the story of his life is told in flashback, beginning with his abandonment at birth in a French fish market. Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a tanner's apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in the new odors. He focuses on the scent of a kindly girl selling plums (Karoline Herfurth) and startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her until the scent fades.Afterwards, Grenouille becomes haunted by the desire to preserve the woman's scent forever. After making a delivery to a perfume shop, Grenouille amazes the Italian owner, Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), with his ability to create fragrances. He revitalizes the perfumer's career with new formulas, demanding only that Baldini teach him how to convert scents into perfume. Baldini explains that all perfumes are harmonies of twelve individual scents, and may contain a theoretical thirteenth scent. He also tells a story about a perfume discovered in an Egyptian tomb that was so perfect that it caused everyone in the entire world to briefly believe they were in paradise the moment the bottle was opened.When Grenouille discovers that Baldini's method of distillation will not capture the scents of all objects, such as iron chains and dead animals, he becomes depressed. After receiving a letter of presentation written by Baldini, Grenouille leaves to learn a different method in Grasse. En route to Grasse, Grenouille realises that he has no scent of his own, and is therefore a cipher.

Even when a bus does at last arrive, it's so full, it can't take any more passengers. The smallest unexpected event can bring about conditions of complete chaos. The strange thing is not that people stand these conditions, but that they actually choose them in preference to anything else. Large modern cites are too big to control. People living there are forced by their environment to take a wholly unnatural way of life. They lost touch with the land and rhythm of nature.

Answer the question...who led the attack on the british schooner the gaspee??","completion":"To answer this question, I will first need to gather information about the event and its key players. Step 1: Research the event in which the British schooner Gaspee was attacked. The Gaspee Affair was a significant event leading up to the American Revolution in 1772. The British naval schooner HMS Gaspee, commanded by Lieutenant William Dudingston, was tasked with enforcing the customs regulations in the Narragansett Bay area in Rhode Island. Due to the strict enforcement and subsequent mistreatment of local merchants, tensions were high between the colonists and the Gaspee's crew. Step 2: Identify who led the attack on the Gaspee. On the night of June 9, 1772, a group of American colonists, disguised as Narragansett Indians, rowed out to the grounded Gaspee and attacked it. The group was led by a prominent Rhode Island merchant named John Brown. Step 3: Verify the information. Cross-referencing multiple sources, such as historical texts and reputable websites, confirms that John Brown did indeed lead the attack on the Gaspee. In conclusion, John Brown led the attack on the British schooner Gaspee. The event known as the Gaspee Affair played a pivotal role in escalating tensions between the American colonies and the British Empire, ultimately culminating in the American Revolution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's the equation: -76*u + 312 = -37*u First, let's move all the terms with 'u' to the left side of the equation, and all the constant terms to the right side. Add 37*u to both sides: -76*u + 37*u + 312 = -37*u + 37*u Combine like terms: (-76+37)*u + 312 = 0 -39*u + 312 = 0 Now let's isolate 'u' by moving the constant term (312) to the right side of the equation. Subtract 312 from both sides: -39*u + 312 - 312 = 0 - 312 -39*u = -312 Now, to solve for 'u', we need to divide both sides by the coefficient of 'u' (-39): u = -312 / -39 u = 8 Therefore, the solution to the equation -76*u + 312 = -37*u is u = 8."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I end this small run of blog posts with the question posed by Professor Brian Boyd at the beginning of our evening: Do we want to close the achievement gap? We know we can close the gap. It’s been done or almost been done before in Scottish education, but the answers have been ignored as they pass us by. The simple clue is this: poverty is single biggest predictor of achievement, and according to research (Hammonds sic, reference required), aged 10, a child living in poverty is 60% less likely to get to university. Boyd borrowed from his own mother’s report card to ask us what kind of education we desire. Is it the academic success at all costs route, or is there another option we need to value as much, if not more? His mother’s report card, one that prevented her from becoming a secondary school pupil in Glasgow, is filled with G and FG, until the last point: Character and conduct - excellent. What kind of pupils do we want to develop in Scotland? What do we value in our assessment system? Opening up opportunity for all is a tough game to play when the examination system rewards only certain types of behaviour, few of them related to what the Curriculum for Excellence says we stand for. In his own small community in East Kilbride, three secondary schools enter a period of meltdown as the local rag sets about creating its own local league table of performance, with those three ‘teams’ in competition for the top spot (or at least not the bottom one). Therefore, we must stop basing “the gap” largely on attainment. First of all, Boyd would like us to remove the traditional, and non-sensical academic/vocational divide.

Answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: Cats are laying by the refrigerator why do they do that? Possible A: lie down, like heat, eating fish, drink water, come to dinner Why is \\"like heat\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Like heat\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it takes into consideration the behavioral traits and preferences of cats. In general, cats are known to be creatures that appreciate and are drawn to warmth. They often seek out and bask in warm spots, as it provides comfort and is reminiscent of the warmth they experienced as kittens from their mother's body. The connection between cats and warmth can be observed in their tendency to lounge in sunlit areas, rest near heaters, and even snuggle with humans for body heat. In the context of the question, cats are laying by the refrigerator, and \\"like heat\\" becomes a plausible explanation when we take into account that the refrigerator's motor can generate heat. The working mechanism of a refrigerator includes a motor and a condenser coil, which dissipate heat as a part of the cooling process. While it may not be the most obvious source of warmth, the heat generated by the refrigerator's components would still be noticeable, especially to a cat seeking warmth. Therefore, their actions of laying by the refrigerator can be attributed to their preference for heat. The other possible answers mentioned (\\"lie down,\\" \\"eating fish,\\" \\"drink water,\\" and \\"come to dinner\\") may apply to cats in general, but they don't specifically target the reason behind choosing the refrigerator as a resting spot. \\"Lie down\\" merely suggests that the cat is resting, but it does not provide insight into why they chose the refrigerator. \\"Eating fish,\\" \\"drink water,\\" and \\"come to dinner,\\" on the other hand, focus on feeding behaviors but don't take into account the location of the cats and their possible attraction to warmth, making them less aligned with human common sense in this particular context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: While you're hurrying around picking up gifts in the last few days before Christmas, do you have any time to think about how much your s, or friends will actually value what you find? WePay, a Website that helps people collect, manage and spend money online, has analysed tons of research, reports and surveys from different sources, and the results were surprising! Are Gift Cards a Good Idea? Rather than give someone a gift that they might not like, it's better just to pick up a gift card so they can buy what they really want, right? Wrong. This year, 2.5 billion in gift cards went unspent. Of that amount, 1.3 billion went unspent because people didn't bother making the time. Another I billion or so was forgotten altogether. How Much Do We Really Value the Gifts We're Given? The lucky recipient of a gift, like a cashmere sweater, will value it less than the amount it was purchased for. And ladies, contrary to what you might think, place less monetary value on the diamond ring they are given than the guys who have bought it for them. What Happens to Our Gifts After They're Given? Many complain that the holiday season means shopping and crazily spending money, but studies show that once the big day arrives, we are less focused on gifts than we think. Every year, at least one gift per person is regifted, returned or never even opened And How Do We Really Feel About Fruit Cakes? We all know that no one likes fruit cakes, right? Wrong, once again. Although fruit cakes continue to be taken away behind the rest of the holiday cookies and cakes on the dessert table, one in four people still consider giving them as gifts. What does this all really mean? To be clear, it's certainly not that you shouldn't enjoy the holiday spirit and feel great about giving gifts to those most important to you. While so many of us are worrying about how much money we're spending and who we still need to buy for, it simply helps to take a step back and rethink what it really means to give a gift.

I.S. = Invasive Species AN Iraqi official recently told me this story: When the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, took over Mosul in the summer, the Sunni jihadist fighters in ISIS, many of whom were foreigners, went house to house. On the homes of Christians they marked “Nassarah,” an archaic Arabic term for Christians. But on the homes of Shiites they marked “Rafidha,” which means “those who reject” the Sunni line of authority as to who should be caliph, or leader of the Muslim community, after the death of the Prophet Muhammad. But here’s what was interesting, the Iraqi official said, the term “Rafidha” was largely unknown in Iraq to describe Shiites. It is a term used by Wahhabi fundamentalists in Saudi Arabia. “We did not know this word,” he told me. “This is not an Iraqi term.” I was intrigued by this story because it highlighted the degree to which ISIS operates just like an “invasive species” in the world of plants and animals. It is not native to either the Iraqi or Syrian ecosystems. It never before grew in their landscapes. I find it useful at times to use the natural world to illuminate trends in geopolitics and globalization, and this is one of them. The United States National Arboretum website notes that “invasive plant species thrive where the continuity of a natural ecosystem is breached and are abundant on disturbed sites like construction areas and road cuts. ... In some situations these nonnative species cause serious ecological disturbances. In the worst cases, invasive plants ... ruthlessly choke out other plant life. This puts extreme pressure on native plants and animals, and threatened species may succumb to this pressure. Ultimately, invasive plants alter habitats and reduce biodiversity.” I can’t think of a better way to understand ISIS. It is a coalition. One part consists of Sunni Muslim jihadist fighters from all over the world: Chechnya, Libya, Britain, France, Australia and especially Saudi Arabia. They spread so far, so fast, despite their relatively small numbers, because the disturbed Iraqi and Syrian societies enabled these foreign jihadists to forge alliances with secular, native-born, Iraqi and Syrian Sunni tribesmen and former Baathist army officers, whose grievances were less religious and more about how Iraq and Syria were governed. Today, ISIS — the foreigners and locals together — is putting pressure on all of Iraq’s and Syria’s native species with the avowed goal of reducing the diversity of these once polycultural societies and turning them into bleak, dark, jihadist, Sunni fundamentalist monocultures. It is easy to see how ISIS spread. Think about the life of a 50-year-old Iraqi Sunni male from Mosul. He first got drafted to fight in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war that ended in 1988. Then he had to fight in the Persian Gulf war I after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. Then he lived under a decade of U.N. sanctions that broke Iraq’s middle class. Then he had to endure the years of chaos that followed the U.S. invasion, which ended with a corrupt, brutal, pro-Iranian Shiite regime in Baghdad led by Nuri Kamal al-Maliki that did all it could to keep Sunnis poor and powerless. This was the fractured political ecosystem in which ISIS found fertile ground. How do you deal with an invasive species? The National Arboretum says you should “use systemic herbicides carefully” (President Obama’s air war), while also constantly working to strengthen and “preserve healthy native plant habitats” (Obama’s effort to forge a national unity government in Baghdad with Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds together). Generally speaking, though, over the years in Iraq and Afghanistan we have overspent on herbicides (guns and training) and underinvested in the best bulwark against invasive species (noncorrupt, just governance). We should be pressing the Iraqi government, which is rich with cash, to focus on delivering to every Iraqi still under its control 24 hours of electricity a day, a job, better schools, more personal security and a sense that no matter what sect they’re from the game is not rigged against them and their voice will count. That is how you strengthen an ecosystem against invasive species. “It was misgovernance which drove Iraqis to contemplate a relationship with ISIS with the view that it was less detrimental to their interests than their own (Shiite-led) government,” explained Sarah Chayes, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment who is a former U.S. adviser in Afghanistan and author of the upcoming “Thieves of State: Why Corruption Threatens Global Security.” The Iraqi Army we built was seen by many Iraqi Sunnis “as the enforcer of a kleptocratic network.” That army got “sucked dry by the cronies of Maliki so it became a hollow shell that couldn’t withstand the first bullet.” The goal of ISIS now is to draw us in, get us to bomb Sunni towns and drive the non-ISIS Sunnis away from America and closer to ISIS, “because,” notes Chayes, “ISIS knows it can’t survive without the support of these non-ISIS Sunnis.” We always overestimate military training and force and underestimate what Arabs and Afghans want most: decent and just governance. Without the latter, there is no way to cultivate real citizens with a will to fight — and without will there is no training that matters. Ask any general — or gardener.

A:","completion":"Given the information provided, it appears to refer to a Polish prince from the Lubomirski family, most likely one by the name of Antoni Benedykt Lubomirski. Here's why: Several clues point to this conclusion. First and foremost, the title of “Prince” and the coat of arms (CoA) image file name containing 'Lubomirski' suggests that this individual is from the Polish noble Lubomirski family. The Lubomirski family was a powerful and influential noble family in Poland during the 16th to 18th centuries, and indeed many members of this family held the princely title. Coupled with this information is the note that this individual's mother's name was Magdalena Tarło. Historical records state that Prince Jerzy Dominik Lubomirski, a prominent member of the Lubomirski family, was married to Magdalena Tarło. Their son, Prince Antoni Benedykt Lubomirski, was a confirmed figure in the 18th century, which aligns with the supplied birth date. Moreover, 'Antoni Benedykt Lubomirski.png' being referred to as an image file could possibly suggest that this is a historical figure whose portrait or illustration might have been captured during his lifetime or could be a posthumous artistic representation of him. Lastly, the fact that his spouse is listed as Anna Zofia Ożarowska only confirms the identity of this figure. Detailed records list Anna Zofia Ożarowska as the spouse of Antoni Benedykt Lubomirski. Antoni Benedykt Lubomirski's death is also noted to have occurred in 1761, a fact that further supports this conclusion. Thus, examining these clues, the figure in question is most likely Antoni Benedykt Lubomirski, a Polish prince from the Lubomirski family. He was a notable figure in the 18th century, son of Jerzy Dominik Lubomirski and Magdalena Tarło, and was married to Anna Zofia Ożarowska. His death is recorded to have occurred in 1761. His significance is further highlighted by the existence of a named image file, suggesting he is a documented historical figure with relevance to Polish history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Heo Gyun finds Ha-sun, a lowly acrobat and bawdy joker who looks remarkably like the king, and just as feared, Gwang-hae is poisoned. Heo Gyun proposes Ha-sun fill the role as the king until Gwang-hae recovers fully and grooms Ha-sun to look and act every bit the king. While assuming the role of the king at his first official appearance, Ha-sun begins to ponder the intricacies of the problems debated in his court. Being fundamentally more humanitarian than Gwang-hae, Ha-sunâs affection and appreciation of even the most minor servants slowly changes morale in the palace for the better. Over time he finds his voice and takes control of governing the country with real insight and fair judgments.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: After lots of hype, the new iPhone 3GS has arrived, boasting an improved camera, better battery life, and speedier performance. But is it a must? The iPhone 3GS is available in two versions: 16GB and 32GB. The 16GB version costs 199, while the 32GB version costs 299. From the outside, the iPhone 3GS looks exactly like the iPhone 3G. Like the iPhone 3G, the new model comes in black and white versions, and sports a 3.5-inch touch screen. Most of the changes to the iPhone 3GS have been made on the inside. Apple says that battery life is better, but the biggest boost is in the iPhone's speed: The iPhone 3GS runs twice as fast as the iPhone 3G. Instead of a lot of software installed on it, the iPhone 3GS comes with the most recent version of the iPhone Software --version 3.0- installed, but it does come with easy access to Apple's App Store. The speedier performance of the iPhone 3GS extends to surfing the Web, too. You can see entire Web pages, and can zoom in and out with ease. The notable new messaging feature on the iPhone 3GS is support for MMS. You can send pictures and videos by SMS, rather than having to send them via e-mail. Other new and very-handy e-mail features include the ability to search through your e-mail messages and contacts, as well as the option to use a landscape-oriented keyboard when composing messages. The camera has been upgraded from 2 megapixels to 3 megapxiels, and adds auto-focus. If you already own an iPhone 3G, the iPhone 3GS may not be worth the additional cost, since you can get many of its cool features for free with the iPhone 3.0 software upgrade. But if you've been using an older iPhone or smart phone, or are new to the smart phone world, the iPhone 3GS will amaze you with its speed and plentiful features. According to the text, what is the notable advantage 3GS has in messaging? A) Pictures and videos can be sent more quickly. B) Pictures and videos can be sent through SMS. C) It's more convenient to send and receive messages. D) It's more convenient to compose messages via keys.

Would \\"Research suggests that pedophilia may be correlated with several different neurological abnormalities, and often co-exists with other personality disorders and psychological pathologies.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"The question seems to be asking about the age of a child involved in a pedophile crime and whether the provided statement about research on pedophilia is a reasonable answer to that question. The question's phrasing is unclear, but I will try to address both the age and research aspects separately. First, let us address the age of a child involved in a pedophile crime. Pedophilia is the primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children, typically under the age of 13. A pedophile crime occurs when an adult engages in sexual activity, grooming, or exploitation with a child who falls within that age range. Laws and age limits related to child sexual exploitation can vary depending on the country, but generally, any case where an adult engages in inappropriate sexual conduct with a minor falls under this category. As for the research statement provided: 'Research suggests that pedophilia may be correlated with several different neurological abnormalities, and often co-exists with other personality disorders and psychological pathologies.' This is indeed a reasonable statement, as multiple studies have shown correlations between pedophilia and neurological abnormalities or other psychological conditions. Pedophilia is considered a paraphilic disorder, which means that it is characterized by persistent and intense sexual fantasies, urges, or behaviors that involve unusual situations, objects, or activities. Although the exact causes of pedophilia are still not completely understood, several factors and conditions have been associated with it. Research has shown that pedophiles may have structural differences in the brain and exhibit abnormal brain circuits that can influence their sexual attraction to children. Some studies have reported that pedophiles have lower IQs, higher rates of head injuries during childhood, cognitive impairments, and altered neurodevelopmental pathways compared to non-pedophilic individuals. Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that pedophiles may have been exposed to physical, emotional, or sexual abuse during their childhood. This may contribute to the development of personality disorders or other psychological issues that can coexist with pedophilia, such as depression, anxiety, or substance abuse. In conclusion, while the provided statement does not directly address the age of a child involved in a pedophile crime, it is a reasonable answer in terms of discussing research on the possible causes and associations of pedophilia. It is important to understand the underlying factors that contribute to pedophilic tendencies in order to better address the issue and create more effective prevention and intervention strategies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Amy loved being around people but Maria found it exhausting, so","completion":"they often found it challenging to balance their differing social tendencies. Amy thrived in social connections, whereas Maria cherished solitude and quiet moments. Despite these differences, their bond was strong. They were inseparable throughout college and after graduation, they chose to live together. Yet their contrasting personalities often led to an interesting dynamic in their shared space. Amy would frequently invite friends over for lively gatherings. These get-togethers were a rainbow of laughter and chatter, of opinions colliding and ideas being shared, and Amy reveled in them. She would be at the center of the action, cooking up a storm, her laughter booming, her hands continuously moving, whether expressing a point or pouring another round of drinks. When she was around people, Amy's energy was unstoppable. She loved listening to her friends' stories, loved being the person people turned to, and most of all, she loved the exhilarating charge she got from being in the middle of it all. Maria, on the other hand, found it draining. She equated her energy levels to the drained battery symbol she'd see on her phone after a long day. Unlike Amy, she found the constant company of others tiring. She needed time to recharge, time to be by herself and with her thoughts. Maria often found solace in the calm glow of a reading lamp, accompanied by the rustle of turning pages of her favorite book, the soft hum of her playlist playing in the backdrop, and the occasional sips of her hot tea. Their shared apartment began to symbolize a blend of these starkly contrasting worlds. One half of it brimmed with liveliness, echoes of which could be heard in the hearty laughs that filled Amy's room. The other half was a sanctuary of serenity, with the silence occasionally broken by the flipping of pages and soft melodies in Maria's space. Regardless of their differences in temperament, Amy and Maria possessed a remarkable understanding of each other's needs. Amy, although she loved parties, understood Maria's need for personal time. Instead of forcing Maria to mingle, Amy allocated a quiet room during her parties or occasions where Maria could retreat to whenever the social activities got too intimidating. This empathetic gesture helped maintain a comfortable environment for Maria even during Amy's bustling gatherings. Maria, in return, respected Amy's need for social interplay. Even if she found it draining, she would make an effort to attend Amy's parties and engage in small moments of interaction. She would chip in with the cooking or setting up the party, offering her support to Amy. They had a rule - if Maria felt overwhelmed, Amy would not hold it against her if she needed to leave the party early. They found a rhythm, an ebb and flow, that turned their seemingly opposite personalities into harmonious coexistence. After all, differences do not always lead to discord. More often, they lead to learning, understanding, and mutual respect, something Amy and Maria learned to embody. They made room for each other's preferences, creating an environment that was equally comforting for both - something Amy loved and something from which Maria did not withdraw into exhaustion. Living with someone so different had its challenges, but Amy and Maria found ways to balance their differing social tendencies, proving that the basic foundation of any relationship relies on the ability to understand, respect and value each other's individuality."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A good headshot is critical to getting roles. Casting directors may see your headshot and call you in for auditions. Look online for photographers that specialize in headshots in your area and give them a call to schedule an appointment. Headshots exist to inform the casting director of your look, age, and who you are. Make sure to get makeup and hair done before the headshot so you look your best. Consider including a shot that shows your natural apprentice too. Professional level headshots can be expensive and range anywhere from 400 - 1,200 (US Dollars) Be as natural as you can in your headshot, and avoid over-editing or makeup so the casting director knows what to expect when you audition. A good agent will have existing network connections in the industry and be able to get you auditions for roles that you wouldn't be able to get yourself. Set up meetings with management agencies and talk to different people in the industry to get referrals. Agents also negotiate pay in some circumstances as well. Many agents charge you 10% of your earnings. Agents also help you prepare for auditions and can impart useful knowledge about a career in acting to you. Make sure to thoroughly look through any contract with an attorney or similar qualified professional before signing any agreements or contracts. Networking in the acting industry is critically important and it can help you land roles if you know the right people. Make sure to keep in touch with directors and other actors and actresses and you may be the first in mind for a specific role. Remember to be pleasant and be easy to work with and talk with. If you get a bad reputation, it may make it harder for your to get auditions. Many actors will continue to work with the same people through their career. Never turn down the opportunity to attend a meeting to talk about a potential role or a new project someone is working on. You won’t get all of the roles you audition for, but it doesn’t mean you should throw in the towel. Continue to hone your craft and network in the industry, and you’ll eventually you’ll be able to become a famous actress. Matt Le Blanc struggled to land a role for years before he ended up on the hit show “Friends” in 1994. If you keep getting rejected for the same roles, try to switch up the types of roles you’re auditioning for. Agent workshops or showcases are opportunities for actors to showcase their skills in front of casting directors or producers. Actors attend these workshops and do read scripts to potentially land roles in the future. Make sure that when you attend one of these workshops you’re dressed well and you’ve prepared a monologue. There are sometimes open opportunities for actors to land a role in a movie or play depending on where you live. Most open casting calls require the actor have a head shot, and a resume of past performance. Starting as an extra will give you insight into film production and performance. Don’t turn these opportunities down. Don’t turn down opportunities to do commercials. Dakota Fanning, Farrah Fawcett, and Jodie Foster all starred in commercials before hitting the big screen.","completion":"To become a famous actress, invest in a professional headshot, secure a good agent, network within the industry, attend auditions and workshops, be open to various roles such as commercials and extras, and continuously hone your craft."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Context: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationships between blood pressure (BP), insulin resistance as determined by a homeostasis model (HOMA-IR), and body fat distribution.', 'Anthropometric indices of adiposity, metabolic variables (fasting serum insulin and a homeostasis model assessment [HOMA] index of insulin sensitivity), BP and several cardiovascular risk factors were measured during a cross sectional survey of 53477 apparently healthy Korean subjects who requested a health status check. Hypertension was defined as a systolic BP > or = 140 mmHg or a diastolic BP > or = 90 mmHg and we excluded the subjects taking BP-lowering medication.', 'Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) were positively and significantly associated with age, body mass index, waist circumference, and waist/hip ratio. In addition, SBP and DBP were positively associated with fasting serum insulin levels and the HOMA index. By multiple regression analysis age, waist circumference, body mass index, HOMA index and female sex were independently associated with either increased SBP or DBP. When the population is divided into quintiles according to insulin resistance (measured by HOMA analysis) prevalence of hypertension in the second, third, fourth and fifth quintiles compared to subjects in the first quintile are 1.004(95% CI 0.875-1.152, p = 0.957), 1.200(95% CI 1.052-1.369, p = 0.007), 1.312(95% CI 1.151-1.494 p < 0.001 ), and 1.603(95% CI 1.408-1.825 p < 0.001).

While we cannot read Taylor's mind and know their exact intentions or desires, it is valid to assume that \\"sleep\\" could be a potential answer to the question, \\"What will Taylor want to do next?\\" There are a few reasons as to why \\"sleep\\" could be considered a valid option for Taylor after going to the gym with Kai: 1. Physical exhaustion: Engaging in a workout session, especially when trying to lose weight, can be physically challenging. Taylor and Kai may have pushed themselves during the workout, leading to fatigue and a desire to rest afterwards. 2. Muscle recovery: Sleep is crucial for muscle recovery and growth. After a workout, the body needs time to repair the muscle tissue that was stressed during the exercise. A good night's sleep can aid this process, allowing Taylor to make the most of their workout and see the results they desire. 3. Mental relaxation: Working out can be mentally taxing as well, especially if Taylor and Kai are trying to keep each other motivated and maintain focus on their weight loss goals. Some relaxation and mental downtime can be beneficial in staying committed to a long-term fitness plan. 4. Health benefits: Sleep offers numerous health benefits, including improved memory, increased focus, and better overall health. Given that Taylor is prioritizing their health by attempting to lose weight, it's reasonable to assume that they might also want to prioritize sleep for its benefits.

The premise doesn't clearly state that Stephanopoulos emphasized the rape charge need to be considered at face value. The sentence suggests that Stephanopoulos rephrased the rape charge, but it doesn't clarify what his stance was on the matter or how he presented it in his rephrasing. Stephanopoulos is only mentioned as changing the format of the rape charge from a straightforward accusation to a question form. Hence, the nature of his rephrasing alters the approach, making it rather inquisitive than assertive. Rather than placing emphasis on the rape charge itself, Stephanopoulos is portrayed as questioning the pertinence of candidates' private lives. He aimed to incite a discussion or considerations about how much a candidate's personal life should matter, if at all, in their ability to serve in a public role or how such charges might impact the overall perception of the candidate. In doing so, Stephanopoulos steers away from echoing the charge verbatim or emphasizing on the gravity or the truth value of the rape charge, and focuses more on how it fits into the broader scope of evaluating a political candidate. Thus, the claim that Stephanopoulos emphasized the rape charge in such a way that it must be addressed at face value does not align with the given premise. Additionally, the premise indicates Stephanopoulos's aim to bring relevance to the broader issue of candidate's private life in relation to their public life which again makes the hypothesis incorrect. Also, the premise doesn't provides any direct evidence to support the hypothesis that \\"Stephanopoulous emphasized that the rape charge must be considered at face value.\\" In conclusion, based on the provided premise, the hypothesis is incorrect as the information from the premise cannot be used to support it, neither does the premise provide any clear indication of Stephanopoulos's stance on the rape charge. The premise clearly suggests that he questioned the relevance of candidates' private life rather than focusing on the rape charge at face value."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In pictures: Queen at 90 - in 90 images She celebrated the occasion with a series of events, including a private black tie banquet at Windsor Castle with her friends and loved ones. The most arresting images can be the ones that leave you wanting to know more. In this instance, what was the wisecrack uttered by the son that made the mother want to laugh as the camera captured them together? On a day in May devoted to horses this photographic assignment was over in minutes. The significance of the image is obvious. This is a 90-year-old monarch with her heir by her side. As things stand, the future of the House of Windsor is secure. One of the most recognisable women on the planet has sat, countless times, for photographs and portraits. She never comments on the finished results. Others aren't so reserved. An oil painting by Lucien Freud was said by one art critic to have given the Queen six o'clock shadow and made her look more like a rugby player than a monarch. This latest addition to the genre prompts us to wonder about the nature of the joke cracked by Prince Charles; a joke the four people in the room when the shutter clicked may well now have forgotten.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: Almost everyone who has been driving a car has seen or been in a what? Possible A: getting tired, go somewhere, water pollute, backache, automobile accidents Why is \\"automobile accidents\\" an answer aligned with human common sense?","completion":"The phrase \\"automobile accidents\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because the question is referencing a shared and common experience among most people who have driven a car. The question is: \\"Almost everyone who has been driving a car has seen or been in a what?\\" This question implies some form of event that typically occurs while driving, and that it is prevalent enough that most drivers will either witness or be involved in such an event themselves. Out of the provided answers - getting tired, go somewhere, water pollute, backache, and automobile accidents - \\"automobile accidents\\" is the only answer that directly relates to a common occurrence happening on the road. To further illustrate the reasoning, let's discuss each of the options: 1. Getting tired - Some drivers might experience fatigue while driving, but it's not a universally shared experience or directly related to driving a car. 2. Go somewhere - While this is certainly an outcome of driving a car, it does not correspond to the shared experience or event that the question is referring to. 3. Water pollute - This might be related to cars indirectly (as automobiles can contribute to pollution), but it doesn’t represent a common occurrence or event happening on the road. 4. Backache - Although some drivers might experience backaches, especially after long drives, it isn't a shared event or experience related to the act of driving, and thus doesn't appropriately answer the question. 5. Automobile accidents - Car accidents are both common occurrences on the road and directly related to the act of driving. Most people who have driven a car have likely seen or been involved in an automobile accident at some point in time. This makes it the most appropriate response based on shared human experiences and aligns with human common sense."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Where do monks usually live?\\" Context: \\"There is no evidence that Mahāyāna ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism, but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines, for bodhisattvas. Initially it was known as Bodhisattvayāna (the \\"Vehicle of the Bodhisattvas\\"). Paul Williams has also noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate Vinaya or ordination lineage from the early schools of Buddhism, and therefore each bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī adhering to the Mahāyāna formally belonged to an early school. This continues today with the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage in East Asia, and the Mūlasarvāstivāda ordination lineage in Tibetan Buddhism. Therefore Mahāyāna was never a separate rival sect of the early schools. From Chinese monks visiting India, we now know that both Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna monks in India often lived in the same monasteries side by side.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Monks usually live in monasteries. The context indicates that both Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna monks in India often lived in the same monasteries side by side. The reasoning behind this answer comes from directly interpreting the provided context. The narrative talks about the existence and practices of Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna monks, clearly indicating that these monks lived together in monasteries.

Step 2: Eliminate choices that are not related to a crab's environment or that don't follow a logical path for a crab to reach the ocean. Step 3: Consider the natural habitats and behaviors of crabs. Step 4: Select the most appropriate choice based on the above analysis. 1. Analyzing choices: - Lakes: Freshwater environments, typically not the path for crabs to reach the ocean. - Shoreline: The boundary between land and sea, which a crab would likely cross to reach the ocean. - Shallow waters: A closer-to-shore region of water, but not necessarily a path that a crab has to cross to reach the ocean. - Tide pools: Naturally occurring rocky pools at the coastline, they can serve as habitats for crabs but not a specific path for them to reach the ocean. - Atlantic Ocean: A specific ocean among many, and not a path that a crab needs to cross. 2. Eliminating unrelated choices: - Lakes: Unrelated to a crab's path to the ocean, eliminated. - Shallow waters: Not necessarily a path that a crab has to cross, eliminated. - Tide pools: Habitat but not a specific path, eliminated. - Atlantic Ocean: One specific ocean, not a path, eliminated. 3. Considering natural habitats and behaviors: - Crabs mainly live in coastal areas or shallow waters, close to the shoreline. 4.

Background: Sir Richard Starkey (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, songwriter, singer, and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. He occasionally sang lead vocals, usually for one song on an album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"Good Night\\", and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". Starr was twice afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. Context: When Starr married Maureen Cox in 1965, Beatles manager Brian Epstein served as best man, with Starr's stepfather Harry Graves and fellow Beatle George Harrison as witnesses. Soon afterwards, the couple's matrimony became the subject of a US novelty song, \\"Treat Him Tender, Maureen\\", by the Chicklettes. Starr and Maureen had three children together: Zak (born 13 September 1965), Jason (born 19 August 1967) and Lee (born 11 November 1970). In 1971, Starr purchased Lennon's former home, Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill in Berkshire and moved his family there. Following Starr's repeated infidelities, the couple divorced in 1975. Maureen died from leukaemia at age 48 in 1994. In 1980, while on the set of the film Caveman, Starr met actress Barbara Bach; they were married on 27 April 1981. In 1985, he was the first of the Beatles to become a grandfather upon the birth of Zak's daughter, Tatia Jayne Starkey. Zak Starkey is also a drummer, and during his father's regular absences, he spent time with The Who's Keith Moon. Zak has performed with his father during some All-Starr Band tours. In total, Ringo Starr has eight grandchildren - one from Zak, four from Jason and three from Lee. In 2016, he was the first Beatle to become a great-grandfather. Starr and Bach split their time between homes in Cranleigh, Surrey; Los Angeles; and Monte Carlo. In the Sunday Times Rich List 2011, Starr was listed at number 56 in the UK with an estimated personal wealth of PS150 million. In 2012, Starr was estimated to be the wealthiest drummer in the world. In 2014 Starr announced that his 200-acre Surrey estate at Rydinghurst, with its Grade II-listed Jacobean house, was for sale. However, he retains a property in the London district of Chelsea off King's Road, and he and Bach continue to divide their time between London and Los Angeles. In December 2015, Starr and Bach auctioned some of their personal and professional items to the public via Julien's Auctions in Los Angeles. Highlights of the collection included Starr's first Ludwig Black Oyster Pearl drum kit; instruments given to him by Harrison, Lennon and Marc Bolan; and a first-pressing copy of the Beatles' White Album numbered \\"0000001\\". The auction raised over 9 million, a portion of which was set aside for the Lotus Foundation, a charity founded by Starr and Bach. In 2016, Starr expressed his support for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, explaining: \\"I thought the European Union was a great idea, but I didn't see it going anywhere lately.\\" In 2017 he described his impatience for Britain to \\"get on with\\" Brexit, declaring that \\"to be in control of your country is a good move.\\" Question: Was he ever married?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, Ringo Starr was married two times. First, he married Maureen Cox in 1965, but they divorced in 1975.

Monica continued her demonstration, outlining several methods available to bypass popup ads. \\"Firstly,\\" Monica said, \\"one of the most common ways to prevent popup ads is by subscribing to YouTube Premium. It's a paid service, but it removes all ads from the platform and even comes with other perks, like background play and offline mode.\\" Katrina's eyes widened at the prospect of an ad-free experience but seemed reluctant about a subscription. Sensing this, Monica quickly added, \\"But don't worry, there are other methods as well.\\" Intrigued, Katrina leaned in as Monica explained the second approach, which involved using an ad-blocking web browser. \\"There are several browsers out there, like Brave or Firefox Focus, that have built-in ad blockers,\\" Monica said, tapping her screen a few times to showcase the different browsers. \\"These web browsers prevent ads from loading when you watch a YouTube video, which means you won't see any popups.\\" Katrina seemed pleased with the alternative, but still, Monica wasn't finished yet. \\"Another option would be to use a third-party ad-blocking app or extension for your web browser. Although YouTube won't officially endorse these, they can be effective in removing popups as well.\\" Monica showed Katrina a few popular options, such as AdBlock and AdGuard. Emphasizing caution, Monica added, \\"However, you must be careful when choosing an ad blocker. Always pick a trusted, reputable one, as some might have hidden malware or other unwanted consequences.\\" \\"Now, let's explore a more specific approach,\\" Monica said with a grin. \\"You might have noticed how some videos on YouTube have a direct link to a popup-free version in the description. You can use that link to enjoy a smoother experience. If there aren't any, you can try searching for the video's title followed by 'no ads' using the YouTube search bar.\\" As Monica reached the final method, Katrina appeared eager to try them all. \\"Lastly,\\" Monica said, \\"you can download YouTube videos to your device using various apps or websites. This way, you can enjoy your favorite content offline, without any popups to bother you. Just remember to respect the creator's rights and only use this method for personal use.\\" As the tutorial concluded, Katrina thanked Monica for her thorough demonstration. \\"I didn't realize there were so many ways to avoid popup ads on YouTube!\\" Katrina exclaimed. Monica smiled and replied, \\"It's always great to have options, and now you know how to create a tailored, ad-free experience for your viewing pleasure. Just remember to watch responsibly and consider alternative ways to support creators, like engaging with their other content or purchasing merchandise.\\" With Monica's guidance, Katrina was no longer troubled by popup ads on YouTube.

Later that day, when Sylvie's father (Tom Skeritt) picks her up, Ivy asks for a ride. At first Darrel, Sylvie's father, is reluctant, but grudgingly compromises.

Question: What was the other subject in the letter to the National Assembly? Context: In November 1790, François-Louis-Thibault de Menonville, a member of the National Assembly of France, wrote to Burke, praising Reflections and requesting more \\"very refreshing mental food\\" that he could publish. This Burke did in April 1791 when he published A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly. Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed \\"a considerable insight into human nature\\" he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766–7 Burke was a friend of David Hume, with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau \\"entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but vanity\\"—which he \\"was possessed to a degree little short of madness\\". He also cited Rousseau's Confessions as evidence that Rousseau had a life of \\"obscure and vulgar vices\\" that was not \\"chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action\\". Burke contrasted Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital: \\"a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred\\".

Prior to his release, he is interviewed by a local college newspaper reporter, to whom he recounts committing the murders with a Kaiser blade, saying, \\"Some folks call it a sling blade. I call it a kaiser blade.\\" Karl says he thought the man was raping his mother. When he discovered that his mother was a willing participant in the affair, he killed her also. Thanks to the doctor in charge of his institutionalization (James Hampton), Karl lands a job at a repair shop in the small town where he was born and raised. He befriends 12-year-old Frank Wheatley (Lucas Black) and shares some of the details of his past, including the killings. Frank reveals that his father was killed - hit by a train - leaving him and his mother on their own. He later admits that he lied, and that his father committed suicide. Frank introduces Karl to his mother, Linda (Natalie Canerday), as well as her gay friend, Vaughan Cunningham (John Ritter), the manager of the dollar store where she is employed.

Here is a goal: How to measure your dog How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"Measuring your dog involves taking accurate measurements of your dog's length, height, chest girth, neck size, and weight. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you accomplish this: 1. Gathering the Necessary Equipment: The first step is to get all the tools you will need to measure your dog. This includes: - A tape measure: This should be a flexible one, which is often used in sewing or tailoring, so it can be easily wrapped around your dog's body. - A flat surface: For example, a wall or door can be used to measure your dog's height. - A notepad or your phone: To jot down the taken measurements. - A scale: to measure your dog's weight. This step is crucial because having the right tools at hand will make the measurement process easier and more accurate. 2. Measuring the Height: To measure your dog's height, have your dog stand against the flat surface. With your dog standing straight, measure from the ground to the top of your dog's shoulders (the withers), not to the top of the head because head movements can make the measurements inaccurate. This is a crucial measurement if you're getting things like doggy doors, crates, or if your dog competes in agility events. 3. Measuring the Length: To find the length, measure from the base of your dog's tail to the front of his chest. Alternatively, for puppies that are still growing, measure from the base of the tail to the tip of the nose. This could be important for buying pet clothing or beds. 4. Measuring the Chest Girth: Wrap the tape measure around the largest part of your dog's chest. This is usually right behind the front legs. This measurement helps in getting the right size of harnesses and clothing. 5. Measuring the Neck Size: To get the neck size, simply wrap the tape measure around your dog's neck where a collar would comfortably sit. It's important not to tighten it too much. It should be snug, allowing for movement. This measurement is useful for choosing the correct size collar or protective cones. 6. Weighing Your Dog: Lastly, it's important to know your dog's weight. For small dogs, it's often easiest to weigh yourself on a bathroom scale without the dog, then weigh yourself holding the dog, and subtract the first number from the second to get your dog's weight. For heavier dogs, you might need special dog scales or a trip to the veterinarian's office. Each step has to be taken carefully to avoid hurting the dog and to get the most accurate measurements possible. Now that you have all the measurements and weight, you can ensure you get the right equipment, clothing, and nutrition for your dog, among other things."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Gulf of Aqaba to the east, the Red Sea to the east and south, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan, and across from the Sinai Peninsula lies Saudi Arabia, although Jordan and Saudi Arabia do not share a land border with Egypt. It is the world's only contiguous Afrasian nation. - The Nile ( \\"en-Nl\\", \\"an-Nl\\" \\"P(h)iaro\\"; Ancient Egyptian: \\"'p\\" and \\"Iteru\\"; Biblical Hebrew: , \\"Ha-Ye'or\\") is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa. It is generally regarded as the longest river in the world, however other conflicting sources cite a 2007 study that gave the title to the Amazon River in South America. The Nile, which is 6,853 km (4,258 miles) long, is an \\"international\\" river as its water resources are shared by eleven countries, namely, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Congo-Kinshasa, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan and Egypt. In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt and Sudan. - A civilization, or civilisation (see spelling differences), is any complex society characterized by urban development, social stratification, symbolic communication forms (typically, writing systems), and a perceived separation from and domination over the natural environment by a cultural elite. Civilizations are intimately associated with and often further defined by other socio-politico-economic characteristics, including centralization, the domestication of both humans and other organisms, specialization of labour, culturally ingrained ideologies of progress and supremacism, monumental architecture, taxation, societal dependence upon farming as an agricultural practice, and expansionism. - Geb was the Egyptian god of the Earth and later a member of the Ennead of Heliopolis. He had a snake around his head and was thus also considered the father of snakes. It was believed in ancient Egypt that Geb's laughter created earthquakes and that he allowed crops to grow. - Osiris (alternatively Ausir, Asiri or Ausar, among other spellings), was an Egyptian god, usually identified as the god of the afterlife, the underworld, and the dead, but more appropriately as the god of transition, resurrection, and regeneration. He was classically depicted as a green-skinned man with a pharaoh's beard, partially mummy-wrapped at the legs, wearing a distinctive crown with two large ostrich feathers at either side, and holding a symbolic crook and flail. Osiris was at times considered the oldest son of the earth god Geb, though other sources state his father is the sun-god Ra, and the sky goddess Nut, as well as being brother and husband of Isis, with Horus being considered his posthumously begotten son. He was also associated with the epithet Khenti-Amentiu, meaning \\"Foremost of the Westerners\\", a reference to his kingship in the land of the dead. As ruler of the dead, Osiris was also sometimes called \\"king of the living\\": ancient Egyptians considered the blessed dead \\"the living ones\\". - Menes (probably pronounced *; ) was a pharaoh of the Early Dynastic Period of ancient Egypt credited by classical tradition with having united Upper and Lower Egypt and as the founder of the First Dynasty. - Tefnut is a goddess of moisture, moist air, dew and rain in Ancient Egyptian religion. She is the sister and consort of the air god Shu and the mother of Geb and Nut. - Egyptian mythology is the collection of myths from ancient Egypt, which describe the actions of the Egyptian gods as a means of understanding the world. The beliefs that these myths express are an important part of ancient Egyptian religion. Myths appear frequently in Egyptian writings and art, particularly in short stories and in religious material such as hymns, ritual texts, funerary texts, and temple decoration. These sources rarely contain a complete account of a myth and often describe only brief fragments. - Upper and Lower Egypt also referred to as The Two Lands is a name used for Ancient Egypt. The concept appears in titles of Egyptian Kings and Queens and appears in scenes in temples and tombs. The concept also refers to an innate sense of duality in the Ancient Egyptian culture. - Isis (original Egyptian pronunciation more likely \\"Aset\\" or \\"Iset\\") is a goddess from the polytheistic pantheon of Egypt. She was first worshiped in ancient Egyptian religion, and later her worship spread throughout the Roman Empire and the greater Greco-Roman world. Isis is still widely worshiped by many pagans today in diverse religious contexts; including a number of distinct pagan religions, the modern Goddess movement, and interfaith organizations such as the Fellowship of Isis. - Nephthys or Nebthet was a goddess in ancient Egyptian religion. A member of the Great Ennead of Heliopolis in Egyptian mythology, she was a daughter of Nut and Geb. Nephthys was typically paired with her sister Isis in funerary rites because of their role as protectors of the mummy and the god Osiris and as the sister-wife of Set. - Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeastern Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in what is now the modern country of Egypt. It is one of six civilizations to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh Narmer (commonly referred to as Menes). The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age. - The Ennead (meaning \\"group of nine\\") was a group of nine deities in Egyptian mythology. The Ennead were worshipped at Heliopolis and consisted of the god Atum, his children Shu and Tefnut, their children Geb and Nut and their children Osiris, Isis, Set, and Nephthys. - Lower Egypt (\\"\\") is the northernmost region of Egypt: the fertile Nile Delta, between Upper Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea from El Aiyat, south of modern-day Cairo, and Dahshur. - Narmer was an ancient Egyptian king of the Early Dynastic Period. Probably the successor to the Protodynastic kings Scorpion and/or Ka, some consider him the unifier of Egypt and founder of the First Dynasty, and in turn the first king of a unified Egypt. - Hu ( w ) , in ancient Egypt , was the deification of the first word , the word of creation , that Atum was said to have exclaimed upon ejaculating or , alternatively , his self - castration , in his masturbatory act of creating the Ennead . Hu is mentioned already in the Old Kingdom Pyramid texts ( PT 251 , PT 697 ) as companion of the deceased pharaoh . Together with Sia , he was depicted in the retinue of Thoth , with whom he was also occasionally identified . In the Middle Kingdom , all gods participated in Hu and Sia , and were associated with Ptah who created the universe by uttering the word of creation . Hu was depicted in human shape , as a falcon , or as a man with a ram 's head . In the New Kingdom , both Hu and Sia together with Heke , Irer and Sedjem were members of the fourteen creative powers of Amun - Ra . By the time of Ptolemaic Egypt , Hu had merged with Shu ( air ) . - The history of ancient Egypt spans the period from the early prehistoric settlements of the northern Nile valley to the Roman conquest, in 30 BC. The Pharaonic Period is dated from the 32nd century BC, when Upper and Lower Egypt were unified, until the country fell under Macedonian rule, in 332 BC. - Atum, sometimes rendered as Atem or Tem, is an important deity in Egyptian mythology. - The prehistory of Egypt spans the period from earliest human settlement to the beginning of the Early Dynastic Period of Egypt in c. 3100 BC, starting with the first Pharaoh Narmer (also known as Menes). This Predynastic era is traditionally equivalent to the Neolithic period, beginning c. 6000 BC and including the Protodynastic period (Naqada III).

Students are graduating with larger and larger debts. So is a college degree really worth it? In 2006, the UK government started to allow universities in England and Wales to charge British students tuition fees. As a result, more than 80 percent of students in England and Wales now take out a student loan in order to go to university. They use the loan to pay for tuition fees and living expenses. Although the interest on student loans is quite low, it begins as soon as the student receives the loan. The average student in England and Wales now graduates from university with a debt of around PS12,000 (122,952 yuan). It means graduates have to struggle to pay rent on a flat, because they have to start paying back the student loan when they reach April after graduating. If you start to earn over PS15,000 (153,630 yuan) a year, the government takes repayments directly from your monthly salary. You might think that a person with a degree would find it easy to get a well-paid job. However, most people in \\"white collar jobs\\" seem to have a degree, so there is a lot of competition. Also, British companies tend to value work experience over . All of the above is beginning to make British people question whether a university degree is really worth the money.

Since it was a Saturday night, everything else was empty for miles. The parking lot was filled with sports cars, hybrids, and shiny suburban tanks. The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance. The first thing I noticed as I approached was the beefy refrigerator in a rented tux blocking the doorway. The second thing was the surveillance camera perched on the wall above his head. I had stopped home and changed first, so I was sure I was dressed mostly appropriately for some rich faux-hipster art party - charcoal gray pinstripe jacket over a TV on the Radio t-shirt, skinny cuffed jeans, Docs, and a black fedora. I certainly didn't look any worse than the other idiots I saw filing in and out of the door. I even had an invitation. So I was fairly confident I'd be able to gain admission to this thing without incident. \\"No, absolutely not,\\" the doorman said, pressing a meaty palm into my chest. \\"I was invited!\\" I said, exasperated. \\"I have documentation.\\" I waved the rave card in front of his face. \\"No dice.\\" I stepped aside to let a couple of aging goths through the door and wondered for a moment if the doorman somehow knew who I was.

Determine the time you need to be awake for work or school (e.g., 6:00 am). 2. Calculate the number of hours of sleep you need. Most adults require 7 to 9 hours of sleep. 3. Count backwards from your wake-up time to find your ideal bedtime. For example, if you need to wake up at 6:00 am and require 8 hours of sleep, your bedtime should be at 10:00 pm. 4. Establish a consistent sleep schedule by always going to bed and waking up at these times, even on weekends. Additional steps to improve sleep quality: 1. Create a relaxing bedtime routine, such as taking a warm bath, reading a book, or practicing mindfulness exercises. 2. Make sure your sleeping environment is cool, dark, and quiet. 3. Avoid caffeine and heavy meals close to bedtime. 4. Limit exposure to screens and electronic devices before bed as the blue light emitted from these devices can disrupt sleep.

Well, if you're planning to check bags you'd better bring some extra cash. American Airlines announced Wednesday that it will start charging passengers 15 next month to check a bag. The airline -- like many others -- had already announced plans to charge 25 to check a second bag. But just because these airlines are charging you for what was once free, don't expect any improvements in service. Airline experts said there will still be plenty of lost bags. Ray Neidl, an airline analyst with Calyon Securities, said because of high gas prices the airlines need cash and passengers shouldn't expect any change in how their bags are handled. Sign Up for Our RSS Feed and Get the Latest Business Headlines From ABC News \\"The systems are still going to be the same,\\" Neidl said. Basically, he added, fuel prices are forcing the airlines to do something they might have done anyway. \\"People want bare-bones ticket prices. They don't want to be subsidizing other passengers checking in bags,\\" Neidl said. Rick Seaney, CEO of FareCompare.com and an ABCNEWS.com columnist, also cast doubt about any improved baggage service. \\"Sure they'll charge 15 to check a bag, but if you think this will get your bag to your final destination … in your dreams,\\" Seaney said. \\"I doubt this new 15 first check bag fee is going to come with a money-back guarantee if/when your bag doesn't make it to your destination.\\" Robert Crandall, former CEO of American Airlines, said today on \\"Good Morning America\\" that the new fee is \\"a reflection of the desperation of the industry.\\" He noted that baggage \\"weighs a good deal\\" and therefore burns a lot of costly fuel. But he said his former company's move might not have been the best approach. \\"I think frankly the industry might be better off if it raised fares and had everybody contribute,\\" Crandall said. But in the past when airlines have raised fares there have been times when one refused to go along with the hike, he said, undermining others. Crandall also said that more government regulation of the airlines might solve some of the industry's perils. Struggling With the Economy? What can ABC News do or tell you that would help you live your life? It is not clear whether other airlines will follow American's lead. Delta released a statement Wednesday saying: \\"Though record-breaking fuel prices are causing us to look at costs in every area of our business, we have no plans at this time to charge for a first checked bag.\\" Other airlines took a similar wait-and-see approach. Air Canada, American, Continental, Delta, Northwest, United, US Airways and Virgin America are all charging 25 for that second bag, according to SmarterTravel.com, which tracks such fees. JetBlue charges 20 and AirTran 10 for that second bag. Southwest charges 25 for a third checked bag. Spirit charges for all bags checked -- 10 for the first and 20 for the second if paid in advance online. Otherwise, Spirit charges 20 at the airport for both bags. All airlines charge more for additional bags. Struggling with the Economy? What can ABC News do or tell you that would help you live your life?

Please answer the following question: Two islands of identical size with similar ecosystems experienced different destinies. Caribu island, inhabited by more natives, hunted a few of the animal species there, contributing to the extinction of a few. People from Hiji island, were pescotarian, and hardly ever fished. Which island experienced more environmental degradation? Hint: Biodiversity loss is the extinction of species (plant or animal) worldwide, and also the local reduction or loss of species in a certain habitat. The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the environmental degradation that leads to the loss is reversible through ecological restoration / ecological resilience or effectively permanent (e.g. through land loss). Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible. Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate danger for food security, also for humankind.[1] A:","completion":"Based on the given information, Caribu island experienced more environmental degradation compared to Hiji island. Caribu island has a larger native population that hunted some of the animal species present on the island, leading to the extinction of a few species. The extinction of these species can have significant impacts on the food web and the food chain of the island's ecosystem. As one species disappears, it can lead to coextinction or adverse effects on the other species that are dependent on it, either directly or indirectly. This, in turn, results in a reduction of biodiversity on Caribu island, negatively affecting its ecosystem services and stability. On the other hand, Hiji island inhabitants were pescotarian, primarily consuming fish, and hardly ever fished. Thus, they did not significantly contribute to the local reduction or loss of species in their habitat. By maintaining a more stable and less impacted ecosystem, Hiji island likely experienced less environmental degradation compared to Caribu island. While global extinction is irreversible and has more dramatic consequences, even small changes in species composition at local levels can lead to diverse ecological effects. In the case of these two islands, the difference in human activities (hunting and fishing habits) has led to a higher level of environmental degradation on Caribu island due to the loss of biodiversity resulting from hunting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Wild animals are our friends, but many of them are getting fewer and fewer. We should try to protect them. The four animals below are now in danger. Tibetan Antelopes Tibetan antelopes are medium-sized animals. They mainly feed on grass. They are usually found in groups of about 20. They are killed for their wool, which is warm, soft and fine and can be made into expensive clothes. Although people can get the wool without killing the animals, people simply kill them before taking the wool. The number of them is dropping year by year. There are less than 75,000 Tibetan antelopes left in the world, down from a million 50 years ago. Golden Monkeys Golden monkeys are mainly found in Sichuan, Gansu, Shanxi provinces and Shengnongjia mountainous area of Hubei Province. Golden monkeys have golden-orange fur. They move around in the daytime, usually in groups of as many as 100 to 200 heads, or 20 to 30 heads. They feed on fruits and young leaves of bamboos. But people are destroying the environment where they live. Trees and bamboos are disappearing, so golden monkeys have less and less to eat. Elephans ks5u Elephants are very big and strong. They are bigger than any other animals on land. They are grey and have long trunks and tusks. They have poor eyesight, but very good hearing and smell. They can lift heavy things and break down branches with their trunks. Elephants are very friendly towards each other and towards their neighbours. Normally, they live in a group for many years. Young male elephants do not leave the group until they are about 12 years old. Now, there are very few elephants in the world. The number of them is becoming smaller and smaller because their living areas are used for farming. Also, people hunt them for their tusks. Wolves Wolves are not very big. They have grey fur.

Step 2: Understand the meaning of Sentence 2 - Sentence 2 means that Julius moved his head back and forth, which can describe the physical action of shaking his head. Step 3: Compare the meanings of both sentences - Both sentences describe a similar physical action, i.e., moving the head back and forth. Step 4: Determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence - The second sentence describes the physical action present in the first sentence without mentioning the context in which it is done (such as expressing disagreement). Therefore, the second sentence can be considered entailed by the first sentence, as the physical action of moving the head back and forth is present in both sentences.

He says that \\"slime molds are fungus-like protists commonly found on rotting logs and compost\\" and \\"sludge composts are also fairly high in nutrients\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? Answer:","completion":"Slime molds can be found in various environments, notably those rich in organic material and moisture. Although they are often linked to rotting logs, they are not exclusive to this habitat. As your teacher hinted, slime molds are also commonly found in compost. This is likely due to the high nutrient content present in compost, which provides an ideal environment for the growth and proliferation of these organisms. In addition to these locations, slime molds can also be found in leaf litter, soil, and dung of herbivores. They survive and proliferate in these areas as they consume bacteria, yeast, and fungi which are abundant there. It is essential to note that they thrive particularly well in moist and cool environments, which are typically abundant in organic matter.

Plants play a crucial role in producing oxygen through the process of photosynthesis, where they convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into oxygen and glucose. A reduction in plants would mean a decrease in oxygen levels in the atmosphere, which would then affect the amount of oxygen available to be inhaled by humans and animals. However, the process of inhaling air, passing it through the lungs and bronchial tissue, and transporting oxygen to the body cells remains unchanged. The issue arises due to a decreased concentration of oxygen in the air we breathe, rather than a failure or alteration in the steps of the respiratory process itself.

Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \\"Five Bells\\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo.

He was also called Abu Muhammad and Ibn al-Ridha. Because Samarra, the city where he lived, was a garrison town, he is generally known as al-Askari (Askar is the word for military in Arabic). Al-Askari married Narjis Khatun and was kept under house arrest or in prison for most of his life, until, according to some Shia sources, he was poisoned at the age of 28 on the orders of the Abbasid caliph Al-Mu'tamid and was buried in Samarra. Hasan al-Askari was born during a period when his father Ali al-Hadi, the tenth Imam, was suspected of being involved in a conspiracy against the Caliph Al-Mutawakkil. There is doubt as to whether al-Askari was born in Medina or Samarra. According to authentic shia hadith he was born in Medina on the 8th of Rabiul Akhar 232 Hijri (4 December 846 AD) and died in Samarrah Iraq on the 8th of Rabiul Awwal 260 Hijri (4 January 874) aged 28. The period of his imamate was 6 years. He was taken along with his family to Samarra in the year 230, 231 or 232 A.H., and was kept there under house arrest. In Samarra, al-Askari spent most of his time reading the Quran and the Sharia. According to Donaldson, al-Askari must also have studied languages, for in later years it was known that he could speak Hindi with the pilgrims from India, Turkish with the Turks, and Persian with the Persians. According to Shia accounts, however, it is part of the divine knowledge given to all Imams to be able to speak all human languages. It is said that even as a child, al-Askari was endowed with divine knowledge. One day a man passed by him, and saw that he was crying. The man told him he would buy a toy that he might play with. \\"No!\\" said al-Askari, \\"We have not been created for play.\\" The man was amazed at this answer and said, \\"Then, what for have we been created?\\" \\"For knowledge and worship.\\" answered the child. The man said \\"Where have you got this from?\\" Al-Askari said, \\"From the saying of God, Did you then think that We had created you in vain.\\" The man was confused, so he said, \\"What has happened to you while you are guiltless, little child?\\" al-Askari said, \\"Be away from me! I have seen my mother set fire to big pieces of firewood, but fire is not lit except with small pieces, and I fear that I shall be from the small pieces of the firewood of the Hell.\\" Al-Askari's mother, as in the case of the majority of The Twelve Imams, was a slave girl who was honoured after bearing children with the title Umm walad (mother of offspring). Her given name was Hadith, though some say she was called Susan, Ghazala, Salil, or Haribta. Al-Askari had other brothers, and among them was Ja'far who was also known as Ja'far al-Zaki or Jaffar-us-Sani. His other brother was Husayn, and together he and al-Askari were known as \\"as-Sibtayn\\", after their two grandfathers Hasan and Husayn, who were also called as-Sibtayn.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write highlights for this article: Earlier this year, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, expressed support for raising taxes only on households earning 1 million or more, a higher threshold than the 250,000 dividing line backed by President Obama. Eventually, Schumer and Pelosi declared their support for the president's position. But the 1 million proposal might serve as the basis for a bipartisan agreement. A number of Republicans, led by Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, have called for raising tax revenue by capping deductions at 50,000, a proposal that would leave virtually all middle-income households untouched while substantially raising average tax rates on households in the top 2% of the income distribution. A deduction cap is expected to raise roughly 800 billion in revenue above current policy, which is only half of the 1.6 trillion the Obama administration hopes to raise from high-earners. It is, however, an amount that many congressional Republicans appear to have deemed acceptable. Politics: The road to fiscal cliff paved with good intentions. One of the central problems with a deduction cap, however, is that it is likely to be opposed by politically influential charitable organizations, which recognize that it will greatly undermine the incentive for high earners to make large charitable donations. Moreover, President Obama has insisted that tax rates on high earners will have to increase, though he has not made an explicit commitment to the Clinton-era statutory top rate of 39.6% (which compares to today's top rate of 35%). So, is there a way out of this impasse? Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, along with Reps. Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma, Bob Dold, R-Illinois, and Mary Bono Mack, R-California, have called on congressional Republicans to back legislation that would extend all the Bush-era tax cuts except for the high-income rate reductions, which would be allowed to expire. This remains a minority view among congressional Republicans, but it may well gain support in light of the popularity of allowing the high-income rate reductions to expire. Another possibility is that congressional Republicans will embrace the Schumer-Pelosi proposal. That is, rather than embrace expiration for the high-income rate reductions for households earning 250,000 or more, they would accept it for households earning 1 million or more. This would shield a large, politically influential constituency of affluent households, a disproportionately large share of whom live in high-cost metropolitan areas in blue states, while allowing Democrats and Republicans to take a politically popular stand. Opinion: A tax we could learn to love. To raise somewhat more revenue, this threshold could be set at 500,000 or 410,000, the latter of which would more precisely target the top 1% of households by annual income. Rather than set the tax rate for this new top bracket at 39.6%, Congress could set a rate of 36% or 37%, a face-saving gesture that would contribute to an appearance of moderation. Back in 2007, Alan Viard, a tax economist at the right-of-center American Enterprise Institute, offered a detailed explanation of why increasing taxes on high-income households alone is unlikely to raise enough revenue to reach ambitious deficit reduction goals. At the time, he estimated that raising 1 trillion in additional revenue relative to the Bush-era tax code from households earning 1 million or more (500,000 for singles) would require raising the tax rate from 35% to 57%. If the goal of a millionaire's tax bracket is not to raise revenue in the most efficient manner but rather to make a political point, as seems at least somewhat plausible, it is easy to imagine it as the basis of a political compromise. The Obama administration is eager to secure more fiscal stimulus for the coming year in light of sluggish global economic growth. So a tax compromise that raises relatively little revenue is arguably desirable, at least in the short term, as it would help forestall an economic contraction. Homes, cars, jobs: Americans already making big decisions over fiscal cliff. If some small number of Republican senators from swing states are willing to cross the aisle to back a millionaire's tax bracket, President Obama will be able to claim he has a bipartisan consensus in favor of his broad approach to resolving the fiscal cliff. This in turn will make it very difficult for House Republicans to resist. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Reihan Salam. Highlights:","completion":"1. Some politicians want to raise taxes only for families that earn 1 million or more. 2. Other politicians think taxes should be higher for families making 250,000 or more. 3.

Q: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: After reading a lot of reviews about Zojirushi, I decided to buy this product from Amazon for one main reason.The description said Made in Japan. Unfortunately, it turned out to be false advertising by Amazon. The product is actually Made in China and it shows in the finish. It feels very plastic and almost about to break.The carafe is nothing special either. Just like any regular vacuum lined container and it does a basic job of keeping liquids hot for about 3 hours. Not more than that..Well it serves the purpose. But is costly for the Made in China label and the 3 hr lifetime of hot liquids. Answer: The answer is:","completion":"Based on the review, it's unlikely that the user would recommend the product. Several points of dissatisfaction are expressed, which suggest that the user's experience with the product did not meet their expectations. Firstly, the user had a particular preference for products manufactured in Japan, but was disappointed to find that the product was actually made in China. This wouldn't necessarily be an issue for every potential customer, but within the context of this review, it suggests that the user values the perceived quality associated with Japanese-manufactured goods and was let down by what they saw as false advertising from Amazon. Secondly, the user criticizes the physical quality of the product. They suggest that the product feels \\"very plastic\\" and almost breakable, which doesn't correlate with their perceived cost and expectation of the product. Thirdly, they seem to be underwhelmed by the product's functionality - particularly the carafe or vacuum lined container. The user explains that it does a basic job of keeping liquids hot for about three hours, but nothing more. They mention that it \\"serves the purpose\\" but does not excel or stand out in any way. Additionally, the user addresses the price of the product, stating that they find it expensive for what it delivers, especially being labeled as Made in China and only capable of keeping liquids hot for a short time. Considering all these points, although the user does not directly state that they would not recommend the product, their overall dissatisfaction with their purchase suggests that it's unlikely they would endorse others to buy the product.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Jack London had endured more hardships by the age of twenty-one than most people experience in a lifetime. His struggles developed in him sympathy for the working class and a lasting dislike of hard work and provided inspiration for his career as a writer. London grew up in San Francisco in extreme poverty. At an early age, he left school and supported himself through a succession of un skilled jobs ----working as a paper boy, in bowling alleys, on ice wagons, and in canneries and mills. Despite working long hours at these jobs, London was able to read constantly, borrowing travel and adventure books from the library. The books London read inspired him to travel, and his job experiences led him to become active in fighting for the fights of workers. He sailed to Japan on a journey aiming at catching seals and joined a cross-country protest march with a group of unemployed workers. After being arrested for vagrancy near Buffalo, New York, London decided to educate himself and reshape his life. He quickly completed high school and entered the University of California. After only one term, however, the appeal of fortune and adventure proved uncontrollable. London gave up his studies and traveled to the Alaskan Yukon in 1897 in search of gold. Jack London was among the first of these miners. He may have searched for more than gold, however. London once commented, \\" True, the new region was mostly poor; but its several hundred thousand square miles of coldness at least gave breathing space to those who else would have choked at home.\\" Although he was unsuccessful as a miner, London's experiences in Alaska taught him about the human desire for wealth and power and about humankind's inability to control the forces of nature. While in Alaska, London also absorbed memories and stories that would make him known one hundred years later. Once back in California, London became determined to earn a living as a writer. He rented a typewriter and worked up to fifteen hours a day, spinning his Alaskan adventures into short...

Question: Question: \\"What was from a universally fixed set?\\" Context: \\"In 1968 Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle published The Sound Pattern of English (SPE), the basis for generative phonology. In this view, phonological representations are sequences of segments made up of distinctive features. These features were an expansion of earlier work by Roman Jakobson, Gunnar Fant, and Morris Halle. The features describe aspects of articulation and perception, are from a universally fixed set, and have the binary values + or −. There are at least two levels of representation: underlying representation and surface phonetic representation. Ordered phonological rules govern how underlying representation is transformed into the actual pronunciation (the so-called surface form). An important consequence of the influence SPE had on phonological theory was the downplaying of the syllable and the emphasis on segments. Furthermore, the generativists folded morphophonology into phonology, which both solved and created problems.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The universally fixed set refers to the distinctive features of phonological representations in generative phonology.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who did Noah's brother train with? Mathayus aims to avenge the death of his father at the hand of Sargon, now king of Akkad, by taking service in his Black Scorpions squad. After completing his training he is tasked by Sargon to kill Noah, Mathayus's own brother. He saves him and escapes the city, but a magic arrow follows them and kills Noah. Mathayus boards a ship to Egypt, accompanied by his childhood friend Layla. He intends to get the Spear of Osiris in Egypt, which he believes will be able to pass through Sargon's black magic protection. A fellow traveller, Greek poet Aristophanes, tells Mathayus and Layla that the Spear only kills Egyptian creatures, but the Sword of Damocles will work. The trio travels to Greece, where they can enter the Underworld to retrieve the Sword of Damocles. On the way, they fall into a cell and are surrounded by men left as sacrifices for the Minotaur. Some of the sacrifices are mercenaries who owe allegiance to Mathayus' father, so they help him and Layla to defeat the Minotaur, with help from a Chinese captive named Fung. The enlarged group travel to the Underworld, where they are attacked by the goddess Astarte. Layla and Astarte fight, while Fung and Ari search for and find the sword. Astarte tries to send Layla to hell, but Mathayus frees her, and they all escape to the human realm. Astarte orders Sargon to get her sword back, and he asks for more dark powers.

Based on the premise \\"The Need for Multi-pollutant Legislation\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"There is need for legislation that addresses multi-pollutants.\\" is true (see options)? pick from the following. (1). yes; (2). it is not possible to tell; (3). no;","completion":"(1). Yes The hypothesis \\"There is need for legislation that addresses multi-pollutants\\" can be deemed true, based on the premise of \\"The Need for Multi-pollutant Legislation.\\" This detailed and long answer will further expand on the reasons that support this assertion. Air pollution caused by various contaminants has long proven to have adverse impacts on environmental and human health. Pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and others significantly contribute to the deterioration of air quality. They also play a substantial role in the occurrence of respiratory infections, cardiovascular diseases, and other health issues. In the past, legislative efforts have primarily focused on regulating individual pollutants, usually involving the establishment of emission control measures and guidelines for industries and other significant contributors. While this approach has led to some improvements in air quality, it has become increasingly evident that tackling the problem of air pollution requires a more comprehensive, multi-pollutant perspective. The need for multi-pollutant legislation arises from the following factors: 1. Interactions between pollutants: Many pollutants tend to interact with one another in the atmosphere, often causing a cascading effect on air quality. For instance, NOx and VOCs can react together to form ground-level ozone, which is a harmful air pollutant. It is impossible to predict the outcomes of these interactions by merely focusing on individual pollutant control. 2. Integrated pollution control: Single-pollutant legislation may lead to a narrow approach when it comes to managing emissions. Multi-pollutant regulation, on the other hand, encourages industries and other pollution sources to adopt integrated pollution control strategies that not only reduce the emission of one pollutant but also contribute to the overall improvement of air quality. 3. Co-benefits: Addressing multiple pollutants simultaneously can lead to potential co-benefits, such as reduced health costs, improved ecosystem health, and enhanced agricultural productivity. This is due to the inherently linked nature of pollutants and their effects on the environment and human health. 4. Cost-effectiveness: Implementing multi-pollutant legislation can lead to more cost-effective solutions for industries. For example, they can invest in technologies that reduce multiple pollutant emissions at once, resulting in improved operational efficiencies and cost savings for both the industries and the regulatory authorities. 5. Global impact: Pollutants know no boundaries; they can travel across continents and impact regions far away from their sources. Addressing multiple pollutants through legislation can help in curbing the global impacts of air pollution, fostering international collaboration and coordination in pollution control efforts. In conclusion, the hypothesis that there is a need for legislation that addresses multi-pollutants is true, as backed by the premise of \\"The Need for Multi-pollutant Legislation.\\" Incorporating a multi-pollutant approach to legislative efforts will enable more effective and efficient measures to combat air pollution, ultimately leading to improved air quality and better protection of human and environmental health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The War of the Limburg Succession, was a series of conflicts between 1283 and 1289 for the succession in the Duchy of Limburg. The cause of the War of the Limburg Succession was the death of Waleran IV, Duke of Limburg in 1280, and his only daughter Ermengarde of Limburg in 1283. Waleran IV had no sons and Ermengarde had no children. Ermergarde had married Reginald I of Guelders, who now claimed the Duchy of Limburg. However, Waleran's nephew Adolf VIII of Berg, son of his elder brother Adolf VII of Berg, also claimed the Duchy. Unable to assert his claims, he sold them in 1283 to the mighty John I, Duke of Brabant. Between 1283 and 1288, several smaller confrontations occurred between both sides, none of them decisive. Meanwhile, most of the other local powers chose sides. Siegfried II of Westerburg, the Archishop of Cologne and ruler of the Electorate of Cologne, traditional enemy of the Duke of Brabant, forged an alliance with Reginald I, joined by Henry VI, Count of Luxembourg, and his brother Waleran I of Luxembourg, Lord of Ligny, as well as by Adolf, King of Germany. On the other side the Counts of Mark took the chance to affirm their independence from the Archbishop of Cologne and together with the Counts of Loon, Tecklenburg, and Waldeck allied with Brabant and Berg. The citizens of the City of Cologne, eager to emancipate themselves from the Archbishop's rule, also joined this alliance. After the decisive Battle of Worringen in 1288, won by Duke John I of Brabant and his allies, the Duchy of Limburg came in the possession of the Duke of Brabant. The City of Cologne gained its independence from the Archbishopric and finally the status of an Imperial city in 1475.

Zupko 's A dictionary of weights and measures for the British Isles ( p 256 ) states that the nail was originally the distance from the thumbnail to the joint at the base of the thumb , or alternately , from the end of the middle finger to the second joint . An archaic usage of the term nail is as a sixteenth of a ( long ) hundredweight for mass , or 1 clove of 7 pound avoirdupois ( 3.175 kg ) . - In geometric measurements, length is the most extended dimension of an object. In the International System of Quantities, length is any quantity with dimension distance. In other contexts \\"length\\" is the measured dimension of an object. For example, it is possible to cut a length of a wire which is shorter than wire thickness. - An inch (abbreviation: in or ) is a unit of length in the imperial and United States customary systems of measurement now formally equal to yard but usually understood as of a foot. Derived from the Roman uncia (\\"twelfth\\"), \\"inch\\" is also sometimes used to translate related units in other measurement systems, usually understood as deriving from the width of the human thumb. Traditional standards for the exact length of an inch have varied in the past, but since the adoption of the international yard during the 1950s and 1960s it has been based on the metric system and reckoned as exactly 2.54cm.

The sex expert doesn't believe that we can't help who we fall in love with.","completion":"Title: Stolen Partners Do Not Make Good Relationships, Says Recent Study Hey kids! Did you know that sometimes grown-ups have special friends, called \\"partners\\"? These partners are like the best teammates who help and support each other. But sometimes, choosing the wrong partner can lead to trouble. Today, we will talk about a study that says if people have a partner that once belonged to someone else, their relationship might not be a good one. The study found that these \\"stolen partners\\" can cause problems in relationships. People who were once someone else's partner may cheat and want more attention than others. Cheating means not being loyal, like breaking the promises of a team. Wanting too much attention can be like someone hogging the ball in a game and not playing nicely with others. A clever person named Tracey, who knows a lot about relationships, says that grown-ups can avoid falling in love with the wrong person. Falling in love means really, really liking someone, like how we might love our favorite toy, show, or snack. Tracey doesn't believe people can't help who they fall in love with. That means grown-ups don't have to choose partners who may cause trouble. Instead, they can look for better teammates who will make them happy and help them grow. In conclusion, this study teaches us that taking someone else's partner can lead to problems in a relationship.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: The House of Commons is debating the legislation that would trigger Article 50. The SNP - which has tabled a motion that would delay the bill - and Liberal Democrats are opposed, but Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has ordered his MPs to vote with the government. However some Labour MPs are expected to defy Mr Corbyn. The government remains determined to trigger negotiations on the UK's withdrawal from the European Union by the end of March. But the SNP's amendment to the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill criticises the government for failing to consult effectively with the devolved administrations on the plans for Brexit. It also says the government has yet to publish a White Paper detailing its policy proposals, has refused to give a guarantee on the position of EU nationals in the UK, and has provided no assurance that a future parliamentary vote will be anything other than irrelevant. Speaking as he outlined the amendment, SNP MP Stephen Gethins said triggering Article 50 would have a major economic impact on Scotland. He argued that the only detailed plans for Brexit had been published by the Scottish and Welsh governments. And he said Scotland had voted to Remain and was now being taken out of the EU by a Conservative Party that just posted its worst general election result since 1865 in Scotland. Mr Gethins said: \\"Passing this bill and turning your back on our amendment would turn its back on the progress made and disrespect the devolution settlement. \\"I'd urge members to vote for our amendment, otherwise this is a backward and damaging step and it is an act of constitutional and economic sabotage.\\" Mr Gethins found an unlikely ally in former Tory Chancellor Ken Clarke, who said he would be \\"voting with his conscience\\" and backing the SNP amendment. Mr Clarke described visions of a post-Brexit future as a \\"wonderland\\" fantasy. He also mocked the government's hopes for free trade after leaving the single market, and claimed that \\"no sensible country has referendums\\". The government had resisted having a vote in the Commons, but was forced to seek parliament's approval for its plans by a Supreme Court ruling last week. Its Brexit secretary, David Davis, told the debate that MPs would not be able to vote to block Brexit, telling them the \\"point of no return\\" had already passed. He added: \\"This is not a bill about whether the UK should leave the EU or indeed how it should do it. \\"It is simply about parliament empowering the government to implement a decision already made, a point of no return already passed. \\"We asked the people of the UK if they wanted to leave the EU. They decided they did. So at the core of this Bill lies a very simple question. Do we trust the people or not? \\"We will respect the will of the people and implement their will by 31 March.\\" The debate is due to last two days, with the government expected to win the final vote - although the size of the rebellion by Labour MPs against their instructions to vote with the government is not yet clear. Labour's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, said two thirds of Labour MPs represented constituencies that voted to leave the EU, and one third where people voted to stay in. \\"This is obviously a difficult decision,\\" he said. \\"I wish the result had gone the other way. I campaigned passionately for that. But as democrats our party has to accept that result and it follows that the prime minister should not be blocked from starting the Article 50 negotiations.\\" Summary:","completion":"The House of Commons, a group of people who help make laws in the United Kingdom, is talking about a new law. This law would help start a process called \\"Article 50\\", which means the UK would leave a big group of countries called the European Union (EU). Some people, like the SNP and the Liberal Democrats, don't want this to happen yet. But the leader of another group, called Labour, wants his team to vote for the new law. Some people in the Labour group might not listen to their leader. The UK government wants to start leaving the EU before the end of March. The SNP doesn't agree with how the government is planning all this. They want more information and help for people who are from the EU but live in the UK. They also want the different parts of the UK, like Scotland and Wales, to have a say in the plan. The House of Commons will talk about this for two days before making a decision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Electromobility will make diesel and gasoline vehicles even more efficient Make this lower case.","completion":"Electromobility, or the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), has the potential to significantly impact the global transportation system, revolutionizing the way we move while simultaneously reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. As EV technology progresses, it is expected that the market share of diesel and gasoline (petrol) vehicles will gradually decrease. Nonetheless, these internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles can still become more efficient and environmentally friendly in parallel with the growth of the EV industry. Here, we will discuss the ways by which electromobility can contribute to the efficiency of diesel and gasoline vehicles. 1. Technology innovations: The developments in the field of electrification technology, including batteries, charging infrastructure, and power electronics, will promote further improvements in overall vehicle efficiency. These innovations can be applied to both EVs and ICE vehicles, potentially resulting in advanced battery-assisted hybrid vehicles that can better manage energy consumption and optimize performance. 2. System integration: As the overall transportation network becomes more electrified, vehicles powered by diesel and gasoline can be integrated into a smarter, cleaner, and more efficient ecosystem through state-of-the-art technology such as vehicle-to-grid (V2G) systems and smart charging. This interconnected system can potentially optimize ICE vehicle performance, reduce peak electricity demand, and curb emissions. 3. Energy diversification: An EV-dominated automotive sector can encourage the diversification of energy sources, which can also ultimately impact ICE vehicles. For instance, as renewable energy production increases and the grid becomes more sustainable, diesel and gasoline vehicles can reap the benefits of cleaner electricity production, lower carbon footprint, and environmentally friendlier fuels synthesized from renewable electricity. 4. Aftermarket modifications: As electromobility becomes more accepted, automakers and third-party manufacturers may invest in aftermarket modifications and retrofits for ICE vehicles. These adaptations might include electric components for better fuel economy, regeneration systems for energy recovery and clean energy supplements for the combustion engine. 5. Stricter emissions standards: Driven by the advancements in EV technology and the increasing public concern for the environment, governments may implement stricter emissions standards for ICE vehicles. In turn, this may prompt automakers to improve the efficiency and eco-friendliness of diesel and gasoline vehicles, ensuring their competitiveness within an increasingly green market. 6. Competition driving innovation: The growth of the EV market, and the competition that it brings, will push automakers to think more creatively about maximizing the efficiency of traditional ICE vehicles. This competitive landscape will likely result in technological leaps that translate into smaller, more efficient engines, better aerodynamics, and advanced materials that reduce vehicle weight, ultimately benefiting ICE vehicle efficiency. 7. Production optimization: As the auto-manufacturing sector shifts towards EV production, there will likely be increased investments in advanced manufacturing technologies and improved production methods. This will ultimately lead to a more efficient and sustainable automotive production process, benefiting the construction of both EVs and ICE vehicles. In summary, while electromobility is set to revolutionize the transportation sector by accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles, it can also contribute to making diesel and gasoline vehicles even more efficient. Through technology advancements and innovations, stricter emissions standards, competition, and optimized production methods, the overall efficiency of ICE vehicles may increase in parallel with the growth of the electric vehicle market, leading to a more sustainable and eco-friendly transportation system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mild symptoms might include itchy eyes, sneezing, and a runny nose. Severe symptoms can cause difficulty breathing, which may be life threatening. Keep in mind that it is the immune system and not the allergen that causes the allergy symptoms. Allergy symptoms can be treated with medications such as antihistamines. Severe allergic reactions may require an injection of the hormone epinephrine. These treatments lessen or counter the immune system’s response. Please answer this question : Which group had more people that could be treated with antihistamines? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Both Group D and Group C could have individuals treated with antihistamines. This is because antihistamines are a type of medication used to treat allergy symptoms, regardless of their severity. However, it's important to note that the use of antihistamines would likely have been more effective for the mild allergy symptoms experienced by individuals in Group D. That's because antihistamines are typically used to alleviate milder symptoms of an allergic reaction, such as sneezing, runny nose, or itchy eyes. On the other hand, the members in Group C with severe allergy symptoms would likely need more immediate and intensive medical intervention, like an injection of epinephrine, as suggested in the background information. This is because severe allergic reactions can cause difficulty in breathing, which can be life-threatening. Therefore, while members from both groups may receive antihistamines, they could potentially be more effective for those in Group D with milder symptoms. As for the severe cases in Group C, while antihistamines could potentially be part of their treatment plan, they would most likely need additional measures like an epinephrine shot to immediately manage the hazardous symptoms.

Write the answer: Which Russian was the first man to walk in space?","completion":"Alexei Arkhipovich Leonov, a Soviet cosmonaut, became the first person to walk in space when he successfully performed extravehicular activity (EVA) on March 18, 1965. Born on May 30, 1934, in Listvyanka, Siberia, Leonov was selected as part of the Soviet Union's Air Force Group One in 1960, which consisted of the first group of cosmonauts. The historic event took place during the Voskhod 2 mission, an ambitious step in the rivalry between the Soviet Union and the United States during the Space Race. The primary purpose of the Voskhod 2 mission was to perform the first-ever spacewalk and further demonstrate the technological prowess of the Soviet space program. During the mission, Alexei Leonov, along with his fellow cosmonaut Pavel Belyayev, piloted the Voskhod 2 spacecraft into orbit. As the designated spacewalker, Leonov wore a specially designed EVA suit and prepared to enter the vacuum of space. After completing the necessary safety checks, Leonov exited the Voskhod 2 and entered the void of space, secured by a tether. As he stepped into the abyss, Leonov became the first human to walk in space, a title that would go down in the annals of history. Leonov's spacewalk lasted approximately 12 minutes and 9 seconds, during which he used a handheld camera to take photos of Earth, the spacecraft, and himself. Additionally, Leonov conducted a few basic tasks in space, including maneuvering around the airlock and testing the limitations of his EVA suit. While the spacewalk itself was a momentous achievement, the Voskhod 2 mission was not without challenges. When attempting to reenter the airlock, Leonov found that his suit had ballooned due to the lack of atmospheric pressure, making it difficult to move and fit back through the hatch. After partially depressurizing his suit, he was finally able to enter the spacecraft, albeit with immense difficulty. Despite the unforeseen problems, Leonov and Belyayev managed to return to Earth safely, with their harrowing experience illustrating the dangers and challenges of space exploration. The mission successfully showcased the Soviet Union's progress in space travel and, most importantly, cemented Alexei Leonov's place in history as the first human being to walk in space. Alexei Leonov's pioneering spacewalk laid the groundwork for future missions that would push the boundaries of human exploration. His extraordinary feat expanded the understanding of what was possible and set the stage for manned lunar landings, space station construction, and eventually, the pursuit of interplanetary travel."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

First, let's simplify the equation by combining the constant terms on both sides. Combine -1032 and -829, which equals -1861. This simplifies our equation to: -1861 = -33*f - 1432. 3. Now, let's isolate the term with the variable f by moving the constant term from the right-hand side to the left-hand side. We do this by adding 1432 to both sides of the equation. The new equation is: -1861 + 1432 = -33*f. 4. Calculate the sum on the left-hand side: -1861 + 1432 = -429. So the equation is now: -429 = -33*f. 5. Finally, let's solve for f by dividing both sides of the equation by -33: -429 / -33 = f. 6. Calculate the division: -429 / -33 = 13.

Running for 7 years and involving over 135,000 people, this was a very big study so its conclusions are right to take notice of. The key finding from the work that attracted the most media attention was that a high carbohydrate diet was linked with a higher risk of earlier mortality, whereas total fat and individual types of fat were related to a lower risk of earlier mortality. Digging deeper into the study, the research team found that global diets consisted of 61 percent energy coming from carbohydrates and 24 percent energy from fats. And while those in the highest carbohydrate consumption group (a whopping 77 percent of energy) had a higher risk of earlier death, it wasn’t cardiovascular disease they were dying from. What those other causes of death were exactly is unclear. Perhaps getting hit by a car running for a Mars Bar was one of them as a recent commenter on my Facebook page theorised. A paradigm shift? Not quite Does this study turn on its head ‘everything we knew about nutrition?’ Not quite. And here’s why. Before the PURE study, there were many studies showing the opposite link between carbohydrates and longevity. So, when a conflicting study comes along, this grabs the media spotlight for the day. Here is just one example – a major systematic review and meta-analysis from 2013 involving 17 individual studies and over 242,000 people showing a higher risk of earlier mortality as carbohydrate intake decreased. And this is the problem at times with observational research in that two studies can give polar opposite results so the findings of the PURE study should be seen through this filter.

The factory is highly automated and designed to shift flexibly to produce many different kinds of chips to suit demand. \\"The diversity is the big difference with this plant,\\" said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a research firm. \\"It gives IBM the capability to make so many different kinds of custom chips, and the world is going to custom chips.\\" The 140,000-square-foot plant is a testament to advanced manufacturing technology. The 300-millimeter silicon wafers -- about the size of a standard pizza -- are shuttled around the facility in enclosed plastic pods, which ride on overhead tracks. They drop down from wires automatically into machines, sheathed in stainless steel and glass, for each stage of processing and fabrication. Throughout the 500 processing steps, which typically last 20 days, the wafers are not touched by human hands. The circuits etched into the chips are less than one thousandth the width of a human hair. Human operators are there to monitor the systems, catch errors and fine-tune the production process for maximum efficiency. Because each of the hundreds of processing machines is self-enclosed, and essentially airtight, the uniforms operators wear are less constricting than in the previous generation of chip plants, which looked like space suits.

This strategic meeting is aimed at strengthening relationships between the countries while addressing key concerns related to regional stability, global security, and technological advancements in the defense industry, among other crucial matters. The talks, hosted by the Malaysian government, have attracted representatives from the participating nations, including defense ministers, military officials, and key stakeholders in the defense and security sectors. The event showcases the vitality of the Commonwealth as an influential global force capable of convening defense partners to address complex and emerging challenges. The gathering comes at a time when the world is facing a more unpredictable and complex security landscape, marked by a rise in cyber-attacks, terror threats, climate-induced crises, and increasing tensions between major geopolitical powers. The discussions held in Malaysia are intended to serve as a platform where the countries can examine security challenges faced by the member states of the Commonwealth and chart a way forward for collective defense initiatives. Britain, being a key member of the Commonwealth and a dominant player in the global defense sector, has played a leading role in organizing this event. It has taken this opportunity to reaffirm its commitment to strengthening ties with other Commonwealth countries, especially in terms of defense and security cooperation. Daniel Collins, a defense and security analyst, opined that \\"the meeting signals the increasing importance of regional stability among the member countries. It is a testament to the fact that the Commonwealth alliance is not just about cultural and historical connections but also about joining forces to counter threats that could potentially destabilize the region and the values that they uphold\\". One of the topics that took center stage during the talks was the rapid emergence of disruptive technologies in the defense industry. The participants engaged in discussions on the application of Artificial Intelligence, drone technology, and cyber defense measures, considering how these innovations could play a role in strengthening the defense capabilities of each nation. Furthermore, the defense partners engaged in dialogues revolving around climate change and its implications for regional and global security. Representatives from the nations examined strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change and explored ways to collaborate on emergency response mechanisms to tackle climate-induced disasters. It was also an opportune moment for the participating countries to discuss collaboration in the defense manufacturing industry. By sharing resources and expertise, the countries aim to enhance their respective capabilities while building a solid support structure for joint defense projects. As the talks drew to a close, the participants expressed the need for a continuous commitment to promoting cooperation and dialogue on defense matters. They also emphasized the importance of maintaining a strong and adaptive defense posture necessary to safeguard their shared interests. The discussions in Malaysia have set the stage for future engagements and ongoing collaboration between defense partners, reaffirming their commitment to working together to ensure security and prosperity for the Commonwealth nations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

'He has sired at least another 100 calves just through artificial insemination in he last twelve months alone.

Article: Spielberg first met actress Amy Irving in 1976 at the suggestion of director Brian De Palma, who knew he was looking for an actress to play in Close Encounters. After meeting her, Spielberg told his co-producer Julia Phillips, \\"I met a real heartbreaker last night.\\":293 Although she was too young for the role, she and Spielberg began dating and she eventually moved in to what she described as his \\"bachelor funky\\" house.:294 They lived together for four years, but the stresses of their professional careers took a toll on their relationship. Irving wanted to be certain that whatever success she attained as an actress would be her own: \\"I don't want to be known as Steven's girlfriend,\\" she said, and chose not to be in any of his films during those years.:295 Now answer this question: Why did Irving not want to be in Spielberg's films while dating?","completion":"Amy Irving did not want to be in Steven Spielberg's films while they were dating primarily because she wanted to ensure that any success she achieved as an actress was a result of her own talent and hard work, rather than being influenced by her association with the established and well-known director. She was conscious of the potential perception that her acting career might be seen as successful merely due to her relationship with Spielberg, which could have cast a shadow over her credibility and accomplishments as an individual artist. During their time together, both Irving and Spielberg were pursuing their respective professional careers in the film industry, which brought about various stresses and strains on their relationship. By consciously deciding not to act in Spielberg's films, Irving sought to maintain a clear separation between her personal and professional life, thereby preserving the integrity of her career choices and demonstrating her independence as an actress. This move also aimed to prevent any potential accusations of nepotism or favoritism, which could have arisen if she had been cast in his projects while they were romantically involved. Furthermore, Irving's decision to focus on forging her path independently also highlights her ambition and self-confidence as an actress. She wanted her work to speak for itself without being overshadowed by her connection to Spielberg. By choosing not to appear in his films during their relationship, Irving was able to build a strong and successful career on her terms, which would eventually secure her a place in the industry based on her merit, skill, and dedication."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - starting fire - illumination - heat - make fire - frustration Explain why a human would choose \\"illumination\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"A human would choose \\"illumination\\" as the answer to the question above for the following reasons: Step 1: Identify the question and purpose The question asks about the most likely reason for lighting a match in a dark tunnel. The purpose is to understand the motivation behind such an action in the given context. Step 2: Analyze the options A. Starting fire - This suggests intentionally causing a large-scale fire, which isn't a reasonable action in a dark tunnel. B. Illumination - This means to produce light to see in the dark. C. Heat - While lighting a match provides some heat, it isn't a practical source to warm up in a tunnel due to its short duration. D. Make fire - This is similar to \\"starting a fire,\\" implying large-scale fire rather than simply producing light. E. Frustration - This reason, although possible, is less relatable to the context of a dark tunnel than illumination. Step 3: Assess the context The context plays a significant role in this scenario. In a dark tunnel, visibility is the primary concern. An individual would act to improve their ability to see and navigate in the environment. Step 4: Determine the most likely reason Given the context and the analysis of options, \\"illumination\\" is the most practical and likely reason for lighting a match in a dark tunnel.

I always wish the animals could be free. I can’t think of anything “funny” I have seen at the zoo exactly although there has to be something…. we used to go to Catskill Game Farm and Bronx Zoo in NY so I am sure there has to have been something notable, if not funny…. At Catskill Game Farm there were Peacocks that walked around free and made startling noises. There were also punk flamingoes there that were amazing to see. Maybe the funniest (not so funny though) thing was in the area where you could feed deer and baby pigs so sometimes they’d all come around at once and mob you? My daughter wanted to feed who she wanted to feed but the deer and the pigs had their own ideas. The deer liked these crackers kind of like rye crisps and the baby pigs went for the bottles of milk or formula. When my daughter tried to pick and choose and just feed one suddenly she would be surrounded by many. I think my husband must have videos of what transpired. One of these days it might be entertaining to view them again. At the Bronx Zoo I remember going one or more years during the winter to see the animal light sculptures and huge block ice carving and the penguins and polar bears maybe? I can’t remember anything funny happening. When we went out to San Diego around years ago during a business trip my husband got to go on then my daughter and I went with him. I took my daughter to the Zoo and Sea World but she was so young then and it was so long ago I can’t recall much except standing on line to see the pandas and just collapsing on a open type tour after trying to carry her and a collapsible stroller and diaper bag all around. She was so young but seemed to enjoy jumping on some bouncy trampoline type thing at the Sea World. My husband might remember the funny things better than I do.

Question: The answer to the question: What was the amount of men that represented 30 percent of the village of Little Thetford's population in 1911? is inside the article: The apothecary and botanist, William Sole (June 1741 February 1802), was born in Little Thetford and educated at King's School, Ely. Sole was apprenticed to Robert Cory of Cambridge for five years; he followed this by setting up a solo apothecary practice in Bath and later a practice in partnership with Thomas West. Sole published Menthae Britannicae; he was one of the first elected associates of the Linnean Society of London and Sprengel named a plant species Solea (now Viola) after him. An Enclosure Act is a parliamentary authority to fence-off common land, thus making that land private property, while awarding commoners land in compensation. Inclosure is the name given to the parliamentary statute thus created. The enclosure process began in the 13th century and was supported by Acts of Parliament from 1640. In November 1833, the Isle of Ely intended to apply for Acts of Parliament to enclose the lands of Little Thetford. Officials arrived in the village armed with nothing more than a notice to be pinned on the Church of England's St. George's church door, but were prevented from doing so by a dozen villagers. They returned later with ten constables, authorised by Ely magistrates, and were confronted this time by 150 stick-wielding protesters, who continued to prevent due process. When the clergyman, Henry Hervey Baber, arrived the following afternoon, he was prevented from carrying out his normal Sunday service. Villagers may have rebelled against the church at this time, perhaps believing it was acting on behalf of the establishment in the enclosure acts. This event may have been the trigger that, five years later, encouraged a strong Baptist following amongst the poorer villagers. About half the total area of Little Thetford was eventually enclosed in 1844, seven years after that of Stretham.The village sent 61 men to fight in the First World War, which represents over 30 percent of the village population of 1911.

Do you know how plants respond to these changes? Some plants open their leaves during the day. It is during these hours the plant can collect sunlight. At night, the plant closes its leaves to prevent water loss. Many plants respond to the change in the length of the day. As days grow shorter, some plants respond by going dormant. Dormant is when a plant suspends its growth. It does this in order to survive. Shorter days signal the coming of winter. Winter in most areas means extreme cold. It is also very dry in the winter months. As winter approaches, some plants respond by their leaves changing color. After the change in color, they fall off. This dormancy period helps trees.

Mr Gianforte has apologised for the incident in which he is accused of \\"body slamming\\" Ben Jacobs who works for the UK's Guardian newspaper. In a victory speech he said he had \\"learned a lesson\\" and was \\"sorry\\". A Fox News journalist who saw Wednesday's incident said Mr Gianforte had \\"grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him into the ground\\" after the reporter persisted in trying to question him. Mr Gianforte had previously said Mr Jacobs had grabbed his wrist, pulling them both to the ground. \\"When you make a mistake you have to own up to it, that's the Montana way,\\" he said, after initial laughter among his supporters as he began to speak about the incident. \\"Last night I made a mistake, I took an action that I can't take back. \\"I am not proud of what happened, I should not have responded in the way that I did, and I'm sorry,\\" he said. \\"I should not have treated that reporter that way, and for that I'm sorry Mr Ben Jacobs,\\" he added. He has been charged with misdemeanour assault, for which the maximum penalty is a 500 (Â£385) fine and a six-month jail term. Mr Gianforte, a multimillionaire technology executive and Christian conservative, beat Mr Quist, a banjo-playing folk singer, to fill an empty seat in the House of Representatives. Mr Quist said he was \\"sure that Montanans will hold Mr Gianforte accountable.\\" The vacancy in Montana arose after President Donald Trump appointed the previous holder of the seat, Ryan Zinke, as interior secretary. Three of the state's largest newspapers withdrew their endorsements of Mr Gianforte after the violent incident on the eve of the vote. The state's Democratic governor, Steve Bullock, described it as \\"a wake-up call to all Montanans and Americans\\". \\"It is unsettling on many levels that Greg Gianforte physically assaulted a journalist and then lied, refusing to take responsibility for his actions,\\" he said in a statement. More than a third of the votes were cast by mail before it took place, an electoral official told Reuters. Republicans have held the state's single seat in the House for two decades. The party has, in general, been downplaying the case and casting it as an errant mistake, BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher says.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the band that has received six APRA Awards ? In writing Young Modern, Johns tried to make the music sound very simple, despite a complex musical structure. The lyrics were written after the music was created, sometimes as late as the day of recording. As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future. Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound. For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award-winning \\"Straight Lines\\". Joannou believed that Young Modern was simpler than Diorama but \\"still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements\\". He said that much of the band's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.Gillies notes that Silverchair will often \\"run the risk of losing fans\\" with their work, and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in Diorama and Young Modern. However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact \\"that we haven't been pigeonholed, and people really don't know what to expect\\" as one of the attractive elements of the band. Despite the ups and downs of success at a young age, Gillies says the band \\"appreciate what we've achieved and what we've got\\" in their careers.

When investing in a movie proposal, there are several factors you should consider before making a decision.

In the case of \\"Guilty Conscience,\\" the movie has an intriguing plot with twists and turns that are likely to keep the audience engaged. The involvement of well-known actors such as Anthony Hopkins and Blythe Danner adds credibility to the project and might attract more viewers or investors.

For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music. Saint-Saëns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere. In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged. His four-act \\"drame lyricque\\", Le timbre d'argent (\\"The Silver Bell\\"), to Jules Barbier's and Michel Carré's libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production. The work was eventually presented by the Théâtre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances.The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy \\"To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition\\". Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died. He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities. After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all. He composed a Messe de Requiem in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Saëns conducted. In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success, with Samson et Dalila, his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation. Although the work eventually became an...

It's obvious none of the actors or writers of this film actually ever did smoke the stuff. The way the villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny.

He hopes to use his superior intellect to become an inventor and raise his tribe above simple sticks and stones, but due to a combination of the flimsy materials available to him and the lack of support from his tribe they always fail.

He at first is too attached to her to consider clubbing another woman, and is further discouraged after a particularly ill-fated attempt at clubbing. Ishbo becomes quite depressed, a feeling which is escalated by his failure to prove useful on a mammoth hunt. He falls into a large pile of mammoth dung, then is eaten by the mammoth, and eventually excreted (or extracted – the scene itself appears as a series of animated cave drawings) from the mammoth when it is finally killed by the rest of the tribesmen. answer the following question: What is the name of the person whose inventions always fail?","completion":"The name of the person whose inventions always fail is Ishbo.

What is this text about?","completion":"This text is about the dollar's strong rebound on a particular Thursday following the release of economic data that displayed a narrower U.S. current account deficit in the third quarter than what was initially anticipated. The news led to a relief rally for the U.S. currency, which had been under significant pressure before this positive development. To provide more context, the U.S. current account is a measurement of a country's trade balance, taking into account its exports and imports of goods and services, investment income, and net transfers. A current account deficit indicates that a country imports more goods and services than it exports, leading to a negative net balance. This can sometimes put downward pressure on the currency. In this case, the market had expected a much larger deficit, which would have been more negative for the dollar. However, the narrower deficit in the data released brought some relief to the beleaguered U.S. currency, sparking a rally that resulted in a strong rebound for the dollar. This indicates an improvement in market sentiment and a potential boost in the dollar's value against other major currencies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Plot title: Quadrophenia Movie plot: The film, set in 1964, follows the life of Jimmy Cooper (Phil Daniels), a young London Mod. Disillusioned by his parents and a dull job as a post room boy in an advertising firm, Jimmy finds an outlet for his teenage angst by taking amphetamines, partying, riding scooters and brawling with Rockers, accompanied by his Mod friends Dave (Mark Wingett), Chalky (Philip Davis) and Spider (Gary Shail). One of the Mods' rivals, the Rockers, is in fact Jimmy's childhood friend, Kevin (Ray Winstone). An attack by hostile Rockers on Spider leads to a retaliation attack on Kevin. Jimmy participates in the beating, but when he realises the victim is Kevin, he doesn't help him, instead riding away on his scooter. A bank holiday weekend provides the excuse for the rivalry between Mods and Rockers to come to a head, as they both descend upon the seaside town of Brighton. A series of running battles ensues. As the police close in on the rioters, Jimmy escapes down an alleyway with Steph (Leslie Ash)Â â a girl on whom he has a crushÂ â and they have sex. When the pair emerge, they find themselves in the middle of the melee just as police are detaining rioters. Jimmy is arrested, detained with a volatile, popular Mod he calls 'Ace Face' (Sting), and later fined the then-large sum of Â£50. When fined Â£75, Ace Face mocks the magistrate by offering to pay on the spot with a cheque, to the amusement of the fellow Mods. Back in London, Jimmy becomes severely depressed. He is thrown out of his house by his mother, who finds his stash of amphetamine pills. He then quits his job, spends his severance package on more pills, and finds out that Steph has become the girlfriend of his friend Dave. After a brief fight with Dave, the following morning his rejection is confirmed by Steph and with his beloved Lambretta scooter accidentally destroyed in a crash, Jimmy takes a train back to Brighton. In an attempt to relive the recent excitement, he revisits the scenes of the riots and of his encounter with Steph. To his horror, Jimmy... My question: In what year is Quadrophenia set?

Try to increase the number of your new words. If there are four or five new words on a page, write them in your notebook. But you don't have to write them while you read.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is an article: IT WAS THE FACE that launched a thousand home accessories. When, as the story goes, Milan-based artist and designer Piero Fornasetti (1913-1988) spotted the beestung lips and Mona Lisa-esque gaze of Belle Epoque opera singer Lina Cavalieri in an old magazine, he saw opportunity. Before long, he was recasting and tweaking her image, reimagining her as a vixen, a bandit and a deep-sea diver in an array of Surrealist motifs on dinner plates, paperweights, teacups and bathroom tiles. From the 1940s to the 1980s, Mr. Fornasetti spun out a prodigious collection of other illustrated pieces, applying crosshatched Piranesi engravings to lacquered secretaries, drawing fossils on tabletops and concocting trippy cityscapes from images of playing cards on paneled screens. Furniture design in itself wasn’t a fixation, said his son, Barnaba Fornasetti, who took over the business after his father’s death, after working alongside him for years. Some of the forms were the work of others—most notably the Italian architect and designer Giò Ponti. “My father saw himself as a decorator of surfaces,” said the younger Mr. Fornasetti, who once gave a Fender Stratocaster the family’s patented print treatment for an Italian collector. “His vision is not classifiable to a style or period, so it’s not fashion but an influencer of fashion. Decoration is something like music. You need it for your soul.” This week, “Piero Fornasetti: The Practical Madness” opens at the Louvre’s Les Arts Decoratifs, in Paris. The more than 1,000 pieces that the exhibition showcases, adorned with witty and sometimes transgressive prints, foreshadow today’s fad for wildly patterned surfaces. (See Isabel and Ruben Toledo’s new makeup compacts for MAC or Louis Vuitton’s spring dresses emblazoned with Fornasetti-style prints.) More evidence of the artist’s currency: In January, the Italian brand Valentino collaborated on a six-piece collection with Fornasetti that included a scarf, a tray and a stool. Valentino designers Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli see an accord between the two brands, or “Italian patrimonies,” as they put it: “We’ve found the same culture of luxury linked to the idea of beauty and manufacturing perfection.” We asked a few other Fornasetti connoisseurs to talk about their favorite discoveries. Here’s what they picked. Screen Gem “Piero was Pop before Pop,” said New York-based interior designer Frank de Biasi, describing Mr. Fornasetti’s appropriation of ready-made imagery. “I once found a four-panel screen depicting the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. The severe graphic design, contrasted with the slick resin surface, transformed this copy of a Piranesi print into something fresh and modern for the entry hall of the Colonial Revival house where I placed it.” Fornasetti Pompeiana Screen (a piece in the same spirit), 15,725, Barneys New York, 212-826-8900 Side Show “His love of decoration and his surreal motifs are all things I relate to,” said London-based jewelry designer Solange Azagury-Partridge. “I have a round side table at home that’s a bit knocked around. But I don’t think he would mind, considering his irreverent take on things.” Fornasetti ‘Re Sole’ Table, 1,540, Barneys New York, 212-826-8900 Snakes on a Rug Fornasetti designs are “intelligent in the same way a New Yorker cartoon is,” said New York-based interior designer Richard Mishaan. “Elegant and provocative. You either love serpents or you don’t, but my Garden of Eden carpet is terribly engaging. When we bought it, our children liked to run down the hall, screaming. And in a long hall, it helps the eye travel.” Amiamo il Serpente Rug, approx. 16,232, Fornasetti, +39-02-8965-8040 Wall of Fame “I absolutely adore Fornasetti wallpaper,” said Ken Fulk, a San Francisco-based event designer who’s using it in a restaurant that opens in the fall. “I also happen to own the most glorious Fornasetti dining table ever.” Fornasetti Malachite Wallpaper by Cole & Son, 198 per roll, Lee Jofa, 888-533-5632 Faces in the Crowd “Repetition is a device I often revisit in my own collections,” said Los Angeles-based product designer and interiors maven Kelly Wearstler. “Mr. Fornasetti’s use of repetition—and his inventive, at times wild, color—have such a distinctive voice. His signature Theme & Variations plates are works of art.

Co-founded CalArchNet; iii. Working at Cal Poly; iv. not enough information; Q: For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture. If you’re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture...

Please answer the following question: Our voice gives away a lot of information about ourselves. It can tell us our gender and age. And now, scientists say that it can also tell us our height. Scientists at Washington University, Indiana University and University of California found that listeners could accurately tell the height of speakers, just by their voices. And the key to this mystery is a sound known as the subglottal resonance . It _ with height and helps us build a mental picture of a person. \\"The best way to think about subglottal resonances is to imagine blowing into a glass bottle with water. The less water in the bottle, the lower sound,\\" said John Morton, a scientist at Washington University. And it's the same for humans. The frequency of the subglottal resonance depends on the height. The taller we are, the deeper the resonance frequency is. In order to find out whether people could identify the resonance, scientists did experiments. A number of same-sex pairs of different heights were told to read the same sentence aloud. It was played back to listeners who had to choose which one of the pairs was taller. Then, other listeners had to rank the speakers from the shortest to the tallest. The listeners were able to identify the tall people 62.17% of time, much higher than a lucky guess. Why not try the experiment yourself? Find out if your tall friends have deeper voices.

Ambassador Susan Rice on Capitol Hill on Wednesday for her meeting with Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine). (Win McNamee/Getty Images) U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice returned to Capitol Hill on Wednesday for a fresh round of face-to-face meetings with her Republican critics, and once again failed to find the public support she would need to secure her confirmation to serve as the next secretary of state. As with meetings she held Tuesday, Rice discussed her role in the Obama administration’s response to the Sept. 11 U.S. consulate attack in Benghazi, Libya, specifically comments she made five days afterward regarding the origins of the assault. Rice’s involvement in the administration’s response is complicated by the fact that President Obama is reportedly considering her to succeed Hillary Rodham Clinton at the State Department. Rice met Wednesday morning with Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who is the ranking member on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which is investigating the Libya attack. She also met with Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. After a 75-minute meeting with Rice, Collins told reporters: “I still have many questions that remain unanswered.” Collins said she was “troubled” that Rice, in her role as U.N. envoy, “decided to play what was essentially a political role at the height of a contentious presidential election campaign” by appearing on five political talk shows to present the administration’s position. Collins also noted that Rice was working at the State Department in 1998 — and was the assistant secretary for African Affairs — when U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed. Requests for additional security at both outposts had been denied and Collins said she asked Rice on Wednesday whether she had been involved in those decisions. “She [Rice] said she would have to refresh her memory, but that she was not directly involved in turning down the request,” Collins said. But the senator said Rice must have been aware of the requests. Collins demurred when asked if she would be able to support Rice if she is nominated by Obama to serve as the next secretary of state: “I would need to have additional information before I could support her nomination. She’s not been posted yet, our homeland security committee investigation is ongoing, there are many different players in this and there’s much yet to be learned. So I think it would be premature for me to reach that judgment now.” For his part, Obama on Wednesday once again voiced support for Rice. Asked by reporters during a White House Cabinet meeting whether he still supported his U.N. ambassador, Obama said: “Susan Rice is extraordinary.” With that, the rest of his Cabinet applauded. “I couldn’t be prouder of the job that she’s done,” he added. Back on Capitol Hill, Corker said Obama should nominate whoever “he thinks is best suited” to serve as his next top diplomat. “I am asking the president to step back away from all that’s happened and take a deep breath and to nominate the person that he really believes is the very best person to be secy of state for our country, regardless of relationship,” Corker said. But Corker said he remains troubled by the administration’s response to the Libya affair: “Whenever I’m in contact with anyone who has anything to do with either the intelligence, the communication, anything involving the way Washington itself has handled Benghazi, whenever I’m around anybody who’s had any close relationship, I will say that emotion within me rises tremendously.” Corker said so much of the GOP’s attention has focused on Rice “because she ended up being the spokesperson five days later.” This item has been updated since it was first published.

Follow Ed O’Keefe on Twitter: @edatpost RELATED (from 1998): At the State Department, Susan Rice has trained her sights on U.S. African policy ||||| In just two quick meetings on Capitol Hill, Susan Rice may have blown up any goodwill she had with the very senators she’ll need for confirmation if she’s ever tapped as the next secretary of state. Over the past two days, four key Republican senators have emerged from private meetings to blast the United Nations ambassador’s explanation about what happened during and after the deadly attacks on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Text Size - + reset Collins: 'Troubled' by Rice Obama calls Rice extraordinary (PHOTOS: Susan Rice's career) It’s not clear what Rice said behind closed doors to anger all these senators, but it’s obvious the meetings went badly and this was hardly a nominee-in-waiting charm offensive. Even Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, just the type of moderate Republican who might help break a filibuster on a nomination, said there were still too many questions about why Rice incorrectly characterized the Sept. 11 assault in five Sunday talk show interviews as the result of spontaneous protests at the same time the Libyan president was calling it a terrorist attack. “I don’t understand why she would not at least qualify her response to that question,” Collins told reporters after emerging from a 75-minute, closed-door meeting with Rice. (PHOTOS: What they're saying about Susan Rice) The Wednesday meeting in a secure briefing room in the Capitol basement came a day after a similar sit-down Rice had with three key voices on foreign policy and defense issues went terribly wrong. GOP Sens. John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Kelly Ayotte, all members of the Armed Services Committee, said they were more “troubled” about the Benghazi affair than they had been before their meeting with Rice. And Graham and Ayotte went so far as to say they would place a hold on her possible nomination. “If she were nominated tomorrow, I would hold her because we still have questions that have not been answered,” Ayotte told POLITICO on Wednesday. McCain, the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee and Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential rival, hasn’t been as explicit. But one GOP senator told POLITICO Wednesday that McCain, Graham and Ayotte were so incensed after their powwow with Rice because they felt she was not being straight or candid with them about Benghazi. Rice acknowledged this week that she had mistakenly described the attack as something spontaneous rather than premeditated. But she said neither she nor anyone else in the administration intended to mislead the public. President Barack Obama defended Rice on Wednesday, just as he did at a news conference two weeks ago. “Susan Rice is extraordinary,” Obama said at the start of his Cabinet meeting with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at his side and Rice seated at the end of the table. “Couldn’t be prouder of the job she’s done.” Both Clinton and Rice gave updates on tensions in the Middle East during the meeting. ||||| Sen. Bob Corker (Tenn.), the presumptive incoming ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, declined to explicitly criticize Susan Rice after meeting Wednesday morning with the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. ADVERTISEMENT Corker, whose panel would have primary jurisdiction if President Obama tapped Rice to become the next secretary of State, pledged he would not prejudge her possible nomination. A day after Corker said Rice would make a better chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee than secretary of State, he explained that he did not intend to steer Obama away from picking Rice. Corker said he would fairly consider Rice's nomination, if Obama chooses her to lead the State Department. “I know that at some point I may play a semi-important role in who the next secretary of State may be,” he told reporters. “Whoever the president nominates, I certainly plan to sit down and give a full hearing to, as I’ve said from Day One, regardless of who that nominee is,” he said. Corker promised to “weigh in heavily” when the nomination is made. However, he suggested the president try to step back from the intensifying debate over Rice and contemplate who would be the best person to succeed Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. “I’m asking the president to step back away from all that’s happened and take a deep breath and to nominate the person that he really believes is the very best person to be secretary of State for our country, regardless of relationship,” he said. He said the Senate holds the secretary of State to a higher standard than other Cabinet members. Corker said he is unhappy with the FBI’s and CIA’s handling of the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and its aftermath. “I’m very disappointed in the entire apparatus here,” he said. Earlier, Sen. Susan Collins (Maine) became the latest GOP senator to raise questions about Rice. After an almost two-hour meeting with the ambassador, Collins said she's unconvinced by Rice's explanation of her role after the attack. “I continue to be troubled by the fact that the UN ambassador decided to play what was essentially a political role at the height of a contentious presidential election ... by agreeing to go on the Sunday shows to present the administration's position,” said Collins, the top Republican on the Homeland Security Committee. Collins, a centrist Republican who would be a key vote for Rice if she is nominated, also said she is concerned about Rice's role in denying security requests prior to the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa. Collins's statement comes after three key Senate Republicans — Sens. John McCain (Ariz.), Lindsey Graham (N.C.) and Kelly Ayotte (N.H.) — said Tuesday they were “more troubled” than ever after meeting with Rice. — Julian Pecquet contributed ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"U.N.

Summarize this article: The possible grounds for an appeal is understood to be a claim that Carrick Rangers manager Gary Haveron should not have been in his club's dugout for the win over Dungannon Swifts on 23 April. Haveron was handed a three-match ban but it is claimed one of the games should have included the Swifts match. There is a suggestion Haveron sat out a game when he wasn't actually banned. Irish FA rules state that the sanction for a player or manager failing to serve a ban is a minimum £350 fine for the club concerned and the forfeiting of the match on a 3-0 scoreline. If Carrick's win over Dungannon was overturned, they would drop to the automatic relegation spot while it would leave Warrenpoint Town in the promotion-relegation play-off spot. The situation is complicated by that fact that the first leg of the promotion-relegation play-off between Ballinamallard United and Institute took place on Friday night with the Fermanagh club earning a 2-1 win over Institute at Drumahoe. Warrenpoint were left furious by their relegation on the final day of the season after a highly contentious injury-time penalty led to Dungannon snatching a 1-1 draw which meant that the county Down club dropped to bottom spot. A Warrenpoint victory in that game would maintained their Premiership status.

Here is an article: A passenger aboard a United Airlines flight Monday night raced toward the cockpit screaming, forcing the plane to return to Dulles Airport. Here are excerpts from the conversation between the cockpit and air traffic control. (Audio courtesy: LiveATC.net) A woman aboard a United Airlines plane texted her husband that she was experiencing the “scariest moment” of her life after a passenger raced screaming toward the cockpit before being subdued by others on the plane, the woman’s husband said Tuesday. Donna Tellam of Boulder, Colo., was returning from a business trip to London via Dulles International Airport on Monday night, according to her husband, Curt. In a text, Donna Tellam told her husband that “some crazy guy just tried to get into the cockpit.” She also wrote that three passengers took the person down, right at her feet near her first-class seat. None of the passengers aboard the flight were reported to be injured. The plane returned to Dulles and the person was taken off. Officials at Dulles Airport said the passenger who was taken off the plane was “transported to a local hospital for observation.” Kimberly Gibbs, a spokesman for the agency that oversees the airport’s operations, said in an e-mail Tuesday that the passenger “has not been charged at this time.” [Professor arrested following mid-flight foreign policy rant] The incident started around 10:40 p.m. Monday. Once the person was subdued, the aircraft was searched and the passengers were allowed off the plane around midnight. Later Monday night, Tellam texted her husband that the incident was the “scariest moment of my life.” She told her husband she grabbed the guy sitting next to her and held on to him. Tellam told her husband she was sitting on the plane playing a game on her phone and waiting to get her computer when the person ran straight past her, screaming. He made it to the area where flight attendants typically sit outside the cockpit area before three men tackled him, she recalled to her husband. Tellam also told her husband that the passenger was saying “jihadists” were on the plane, but authorities have given no details on the incident. Those who allegedly took him down, according to Tellam’s husband, were saying “take off his shoes, check for bombs.” On Tuesday morning, Tellam’s husband was getting ready to go pick her up at the airport in Denver. “I was scared,” he said of receiving her text and hearing of the incident. Few other details emerged from officials on the incident, which unfolded shortly after Flight 1074 took off from Dulles around 10:15 p.m. with 33 passengers and six crew members on board. The Boeing 737 was headed to Denver. Local law enforcement officials met the plane at the gate at Dulles and the person was detained, according to United Airlines officials. Luke Punzenberger, a United Airlines spokesman, said in a statement that the passenger “failed to comply with crew instructions.” Punzenberger did not provide additional information on the disruption. ABC News reported that the person had to be held by other passengers after rushing the cockpit. It cited LiveATC.net, which provides air traffic control communications online. According to ABC News, the passenger “ran forward towards the cockpit and he is being restrained by passengers,” one of the pilots said during the flight. “Cockpit is secure and we would like to return to the airport and have the authorities meet him,” one of the pilots then said, according to the report. The pilot was said to speak in a calm voice on the recording and told air traffic controllers that he was “declaring an emergency due to a passenger disturbance.” He went on to say that the person was “restrained. We need to return to the airport,” according to LiveATC’s recording. After the pilot was asked by controllers, he said the incident was a “Level 2” disturbance. That is said to be the second lowest level of severity on a four-level scale. A Level 2 disturbance in the industry means there has been physically abusive behavior but no life-threatening behavior. Donna Tellam said to ABC News, “One held his feet and the other one kind of laid on top of him and then the flight attendants went and got some plastic restraints for his arms.” A video online purported to show scenes from the flight. In the video, a person appears to be held down by people on a flight. Gibbs, the spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority — which oversees Dulles Airport — said in an e-mail that there was “no impact to airport operations.” The passengers aboard the plane were rebooked by the airline to Denver.

Harrison's enduring fantasy sequence concerning the fictitious city of Viriconium consists of three novels and various short stories and novels written between 1971 and 1984. Viriconium is known as the Pastel City. Both universal and particular, the city has a shifting topography and history, and is sometimes known by names such as 'Uroconium'. The first book, The Pastel City (1971), presents a civilization in decline where medieval social patterns clash with the advanced technology and superscience energy weapons that the citizens of the city know how to use but have forgotten how to engineer. The more complex second novel is A Storm of Wings (1982). It is set eighty years later than The Pastel City. and stylistically it is far denser and more elaborate. A race of intelligent insects is invading Earth as human interest in survival wanes. Harrison brilliantly depicts the workings of civilization on the verge of collapse and the heroic efforts of individuals to help it sustain itself a little longer. The third novel, In Viriconium (1982) (US title: The Floating Gods), was nominated for the Guardian Fiction Prize during 1982. It is a moody portrait of artistic subcultures in a city beset by a mysterious plague. Where the previous books in the series held some sword and sorcery elements, In Viriconium goes beyond black humour into a coma of despair. The short story \\"A Young Man's Journey to Viriconium\\" (1985; later retitled \\"A Young Man's Journey to London\\") is set in our world.

Question: Where does Captain Murdock land the plane safely? Movie title: Airport 1975 Movie plot: Columbia Air Lines' Flight 409 is a Boeing 747-100 on a red-eye route from Washington Dulles International Airport to Los Angeles International Airport. Scott Freeman, meanwhile, is a New Mexican businessman flying his private Beechcraft Baron to an urgent sales meeting in Boise, Idaho. However, an occluded front has the entire West Coast socked in, with Los Angeles reporting zero visibility. Columbia 409 and Freeman's Beechcraft are both diverted to Salt Lake City International Airport. Salt Lake air traffic control assigns Columbia 409 to land ahead of Freeman's Beechcraft. As Columbia 409 is about to start its descent, First Officer Urias unlocks himself from his seat to check out a vibration. Just then, Freeman suffers a massive heart attack and descends into the approach of Columbia 409. The Beechcraft impacts Columbia 409 just above the co-pilot seat, blowing Urias out of the plane to his death and killing Flight Engineer Julio. Captain Stacy is struck in the face by debris and is blinded. Nancy Pryor, the First Stewardess, rushes to the flight deck, where Captain Stacy is able to engage the autopilot and the altitude hold switch before losing consciousness. Pryor informs the Salt Lake control tower that the crew is dead or badly injured and that there is no one to fly the plane. She gives an assessment of the damage as a large hole on the right side of the flight deck that wiped out most of the instrument gauges over the engineer station. Joe Patroni, Columbia's Vice President of Operations, is apprised of Columbia 409's situation. He seeks the advice of Captain Al Murdock, Columbia's chief flight instructor, who also happens to be Nancy Pryor's boyfriend, even though their relationship was \\"on the rocks\\" at that time. Patroni and Murdock take the airline's executive jet to Salt Lake.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi? , can you please find it? The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\" Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's...

Divinyls (often incorrectly referred to as The Divinyls) was an Australian rock band that was formed in Sydney in 1980. The band primarily consisted of vocalist Chrissy Amphlett and guitarist Mark McEntee. Amphlett garnered widespread attention for performing on stage in a school uniform and fishnet stockings, and often used an illuminated neon tube as a prop for displaying aggression towards both band members and the audience. Originally a five-piece, the band underwent numerous line-up changes, with Amphlett and McEntee remaining as core members, before its dissolution in 1996. In 1991 Divinyls released diVINYLS on Virgin Records and the single \\"I Touch Myself\\" which became their only Australian No.1 single. The song reached No. 4 in the US and No. 10 in the UK. The majority of Divinyls' hits were co-written by Amphlett and McEntee, but in this case they wrote with Tom Kelly and Billy Steinberg. diVINYLS reached No. 5 on the Australian album charts and No. 15 on Billboard Top 200. The drummer for the diVINYLS sessions was Charley Drayton, who became romantically involved with Amphlett: they married in July 1999, and from 2000, lived together in New York. A disagreement with Virgin Records stifled future development outside Australia where they released popular albums and achieved two more top twenty singles with \\"I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore\\" No. 19 in 1992 and \\"I'm Jealous\\" No. 14 in 1995. During the 1980s and 1990s Amphlett collaborated as a songwriter with other artists including Chrissie Hynde and Cyndi Lauper, and both Amphlett and McEntee worked on solo projects. A live album, Divinyls Live, was released in 1991 but Divinyls did not provide another studio album for five years. In the early 1990s they recorded a series of cover songs for various movie soundtracks, including the Young Rascals' \\"I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore\\" for Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992), the Wild Ones' \\"Wild Thing\\" for Reckless Kelly (1993), and Roxy Music's \\"Love Is the Drug\\" for Super Mario Brothers (1993). The song \\"I Touch Myself\\" caused such a controversy it had trouble getting airplay in many US-area markets; so much to the point that while performing their song live in Texas at Austin Aqua Fest 1991 the plug was pulled on the band mid-set by organisers. This song is also mentioned in The Guide to Getting it On by Paul Joannides. It wasn't until 1996 that Underworld, their fifth studio album, was released in Australia by BMG. Despite the success of diVINYLS Virgin had not kept them under contract and BMG did not release Underworld in the US. As with What A Life! they worked with three producers, beginning with Peter Collins recording \\"I'm Jealous\\" in Nashville, followed by Keith Forsey for \\"Sex Will Keep Us Together\\" and \\"Heart of Steel\\". Although \\"Heart of Steel\\" was chosen as a single, Divinyls discontinued working with Forsey because according to Amphlett \\"he was a bit too 'pop' for us\\" and remaining tracks were produced by their drummer Drayton. By the end of 1996, Amphlett and McEntee had a falling out and separated without formally disbanding Divinyls.

Article: The World Health Organization warns that millions of people are dying every year from indoor air pollution. The WHO finds that poor cooking, heating and lighting technologies are killing millions of people each year. Indoor air pollution results from the use of dangerous fuels and cook-stoves in the home. To help fight the problem, the WHO announced, new guidelines aimed at reducing household pollutants. WHO officials say nearly three billion people are unable to use clean fuels and technologies for cooking? heating and lighting. And they say more than seven million people die from exposure to indoor or outdoor air pollution each year. Of that number, the WHO says about 4. 3 million people die from household air pollution given off by simple coal cook-stoves. Most of the deaths are in developing countries. Carlos Dora is Coordinator in the WHO's Department of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. He says people should not use unprocessed coal and kerosene fuel indoors. He says opening a window or door to let out the harmful air will not improve the situation. It will only pollute the outdoors. WHO officials say indoor pollution leads to early deaths from stroke, heart and lung disease, childhood pneumonia and lung cancer. Women and girls are the main victims. The United Nations found that more than 95 percent of households in sub-Saharan Africa depend on solid fuels for cooking. It says huge populations in India, China and Latin American countries, such as Guatemala and Peru, are also at risk. Nigel Bruce is a professor of Public Health at the University of Liverpool. He says researchers are developing good cook-stoves and other equipment to burn fuels in a more efficient way. WHO experts note some new, safe and low-cost technologies that could help are already available. In India, you can buy an induction stove for about 8.00. And in Africa a you can buy a solar lamp for less than 1. 00. Question: What has been done to reduce indoor air pollution? Options: A: The WHO provided selfless assistance for the poor.

But they are upset because the results are then being posted on the Internet and accessible to millions of Internet users. On the websitewww.spickmich.deduring the past four months students have posted evaluation of 100,000 teachers.

Here are the simple steps to understand and complete the task: 1. You are given three inputs: i, j, and A. - i and j are integers and represent positions within a list. - A is a list containing various elements (numbers and other characters). 2. Your goal is to find the sum of all numerical elements in the list A that are between positions i and j (including positions i and j). 3. If there are no numerical elements between the given positions, return 0. 4. You can be sure that: - i and j are non-negative. - i and j will always be less than the length of list A. - i will always be less than j. Using the example provided: Input: 4, 12, ['4655', 'c', '6617', '9009', 'h', 'S', 'S', '6321', '1611', '9813', '7961', 'T', '9159'] Steps to find the answer: 1.

Based on the premise \\"Scientific gentleman, he was.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"He was very scientific.\\" is true?","completion":"To examine the hypothesis \\"He was very scientific\\" based on the premise \\"Scientific gentleman, he was.,\\" we must first break this analysis into several parts. We will delve into the language utilized in the premise, analyze the intended meaning, and relate it to the hypothesis. 1. Premise Language: The provided premise uses a phrase \\"Scientific gentleman, he was.\\" At first glance, it seems that the sentence structure is slightly unusual, as it places the subject \\"he\\" and the verb \\"was\\" at the end of the statement. This construction is known as anastrophe, which is a literary technique where the typical syntax of a sentence is reversed. It is often used for emphasis or to create a rhetorical effect. 2. Intended Meaning: The term \\"scientific gentleman\\" likely refers to an individual who is both educated in the sciences and is of high social or intellectual standing. A gentleman, in this context, would be someone who is courteous, well-mannered, and respectable. To be considered a \\"scientific gentleman\\" means that the individual is knowledgeable and practiced in the science field while possessing the qualities of a gentleman. 3. Relating to the Hypothesis: Given the intended meaning of \\"scientific gentleman,\\" it is reasonable to assume that the individual in the premise has engaged in scientific endeavors or possesses a deep understanding of the scientific principles. The hypothesis, \\"He was very scientific,\\" aims to clarify the degree of the individual's involvement in the scientific field. It suggests that he was not only knowledgeable but also deeply engaged and passionate about his scientific pursuits. 4. Conclusion: It is important to note that the premise does not explicitly state how deeply invested the individual is in his scientific endeavors. The term \\"scientific gentleman\\" is indicative of someone knowledgeable in the scientific field, but it does not shed light on the intensity of their passion or their degree of expertise. However, considering the context, the use of the term \\"scientific gentleman\\" instead of simply using \\"gentleman\\" implies a significant emphasis on the individual's engagement with science. This, in turn, would suggest that the hypothesis \\"He was very scientific\\" is likely true. In conclusion, while the premise does not definitively confirm the hypothesis \\"He was very scientific,\\" it does provide substantial support for the claim. The choice of words in the premise communicates the significance of the individual's scientific pursuits, thus making it reasonable to conclude that he was indeed \\"very scientific.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"Which of the following never lacks a brain: invetebrates or vetebrates?\\" Context: \\"The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. Only a few invertebrates such as sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain; diffuse or localised nerve nets are present instead. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a typical human, the cerebral cortex (the largest part) is estimated to contain 15–33 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"vertebrates. In the given context, it is indicated that the brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate animals and most invertebrate animals. It is important to note the distinction here between the two groups of animals: vertebrates and invertebrates. Vertebrates are animals that possess a backbone or spinal column, and this group includes mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. In all of these animals, the brain plays a crucial role in the nervous system, acting as the primary control center for the body and regulating a wide array of activities, from sensory perception to motor function. As stated in the context, the brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body - with the human brain being an exemplary model, containing billions of neurons that communicate with one another and facilitate our ability to think, feel, and interact with the world around us. In contrast, invertebrates are animals that do not have a backbone, and this diverse group includes creatures such as insects, mollusks, crustaceans, worms, and many more. While the majority of invertebrates do possess a brain, there are some that do not, as mentioned in the context - examples being sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts, and starfish. Instead of having a centralized brain, these creatures rely on diffuse or localized nerve nets, which serve as a simplified form of a nervous system. These nerve nets vary greatly among different invertebrate species, but they generally play a role in coordinating basic bodily functions and processing sensory information. Considering the information provided in the context, it is clear that vertebrates never lack a brain, making them the correct answer to the question. While most invertebrates also possess a brain, there are a few notable exceptions that show a greater diversity in nervous system arrangements among this group of animals. Therefore, it is essential to recognize the varying levels of complexity and structure within the animal kingdom and appreciate the vast array of adaptations that different species have developed throughout their evolution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Energy often changes from one form to another. For example, the drummer transfers motion to sound energy. When the moving drumstick strikes the drum head, the drum starts to vibrate. The motion of the vibrating drum head creates the sound you hear. Any form of energy can change into any other form. Frequently, one form of energy changes into two or more different forms. Have you ever sat in front of a campfire? What are two things you notice? The fire creates light. It is also warm by the fire, meaning it creates heat. The energy of the fire comes from the stored energy in the wood. The wood contains chemical energy. As it burns, the chemical energy is changed into light and heat. Not all chemical energy changes produce light and heat. Our cars use gasoline as a fuel. Gasoline contains chemical energy. When our cars burn gasoline in their engines, it is converted into motion and heat. When energy changes forms, energy is conserved. Question: \\"How does a drummer transfer motion energy to sound energy?\\" Answer: \\"He changes the chemical energy to sound\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"No, the answer to the question is not correct. The drummer transfers motion energy to sound energy not chemical energy to sound energy. When the drummer strikes the drumhead with the drumstick, the motion energy from the moving drumstick is transferred to the drumhead causing it to vibrate. This vibration of the drumhead creates sound energy. So, the correct answer would be \\"The drummer transfers motion energy to sound energy by hitting the drumhead with a drumstick, causing it to vibrate and create sound.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sarah chose to knit a scarf instead of crocheting one because the","completion":"knitting technique appealed more to her due to several reasons. Firstly, Sarah finds knitting to be more engaging and easier to pick up than crocheting. This is mainly due to the orthogonal movement of the needles in knitting compared to the rotational movement required in crocheting. The knitting process involves the use of two needles which are used in a cross and release manner. This results in a series of loops that create the fabric of the scarf. It's much like the action of tying shoelaces, just with a lot of loops being tied together at once. This made the learning process for Sarah much less strenuous. Secondly, Sarah appreciates the flexibility that knitting offers in terms of design and texture. While crochet can produce beautifully intricate designs, knitting offers a different type of versatility. The ability to switch easily between knit and purl stitches within a single row allows for a wide variety of textures and patterns. This makes it possible for Sarah to create a unique pattern for her scarf and add any kind of design she wants with relative ease. Thirdly, the feel of the finished product plays a huge part in Sarah's preference for knitting. Knitted items tend to be lighter and more flexible than crocheted ones, due to the differences in how the yarn is looped and pulled through. A knitted scarf will drape and fold more naturally, and Sarah prefers this softer, more fluid end result. Knitted fabric has that stretchiness, which reacts more like woven cloth. She likes that her scarves can be folded away neatly and compactly for storage. Also, Sarah enjoys the rhythmic, meditative nature of knitting. Once she gets going, the repetitive motion can be very soothing, almost hypnotic. This, combined with the satisfying click-clack sound that the knitting needles make, offers a therapeutic value that she doesn't find in crocheting. Lastly, Sarah prefers the results of knitting when considering aesthetics. Knitting has a right and wrong side to its fabric, which allows each side to present a different appearance offering diversity in design, as opposed to the uniform, somewhat one-dimensional appearance of crocheting. The combination of these reasons explains why Sarah chose to knit a scarf instead of crocheting one. Despite the charms of crocheting, knitting suits Sarah's personal preferences and needs better. It's a more gentle and therapeutic activity that she finds incredibly fulfilling and rewarding."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In 2006, U2 started work on the follow-up to How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (2004), collaborating with producer Rick Rubin. After U2 guitarist the Edge worked individually with Rubin in Los Angeles, the group spent two weeks in September 2006 completing songs with the producer at Abbey Road Studios in London. Later that year, the band released two songs from these sessions on the compilation album U218 Singles: a cover of the Skids' \\"The Saints Are Coming\\" with Green Day, and \\"Window in the Skies\\". In January 2007, lead singer Bono said U2 intended to take their next album in a different musical direction from their previous few releases. He said, \\"We're gonna continue to be a band, but maybe the rock will have to go; maybe the rock has to get a lot harder. But whatever it is, it's not gonna stay where it is.\\"Rubin encouraged a \\"back to basics\\" approach and wanted the group to bring finished songs to the studio. This approach conflicted with U2's freeform recording style, by which they improvised material in the studio. The Edge said, \\"we sort of hadn't really finished the songs. It's typical for us, because it's in the process of recording that we really do our writing.\\" Bassist Adam Clayton said, \\"once we have a song, we're interested in the atmospherics and the tones and the overdubs and the different stuff you can do with it... things that Rick was not in the slightest bit interested in.

I worked for a major commercial airline. A friend of mine and I decided to go to Puerto Rico for a long weekend. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. The hotel at which we stayed had a lovely (classy/expensive) restaurant serving continental fare. So, we decided to have our first dinner there. We dressed to the nines. Our hair and makeup were perfect. I had fake fingernails (not acrylic - those were fairly new back then. I had the type one glues on). Those fingernails were long, and painted a very bright - and obvious - red. When the waiter came to take our drink order, we both ordered glasses of wine. The waiter brought the wine, set it down on the table, and waited to take our meal orders. I smoked back then, and at the time, smoking was still allowed in restaurants. In a 21-year-old attempt to look classy and sophisticated, at that moment I took out a cigarette, put it between my lips, picked up my lighter, and lit my cigarette - or so I thought. Unfortunately, my long, red, fake thumbnail got in the way of the flame, and it caught on fire. The waiter’s mouth dropped open, his eyes wide. He froze in place. I was horrified. The flame was literally shooting up from my nail! And smoke; the nail was plastic! Quickly scanning the table for the closest thing with which I could extinguish the flame, I spied my glass of wine. As nonchalantly as possible, I stuck my thumb in the glass. There was a sizzle as the flaming nail hit the wine. When I withdrew my thumb from the glass, the nail was melted, black, and curled under.

Now they are comfortable and common. And parent--child activities, from shopping to sports, involve a feeling of trust and friendship that can continue into adulthood. No wonder greeting cards today carry the message, \\"To my mother, my best friend.\\" But family experts warn that the new equality can also result in less respect for parents. \\"There's still a lot of strictness and authority on the part of parents out there, but there is a change happening,\\" says Kerrie, a psychology professor at Lebanon Valley College. \\"In the middle of that change, there is a lot of confusion among parents.\\" Family researchers offer a variety of reasons for these evolving roles and attitudes.

The customer states that the album does not have the \\"authentic raw groove\\" of another album, suggesting that they found it to be lacking in some essential quality that they appreciated in the other work. 4. The phrase \\"risible moments\\" indicates that the album had moments that were laughable or even ridiculous, which is generally not something one would like to see in an album they were hoping to enjoy. 5. The customer's mention of the song 'Star Star' being the standout, however, shows that there might be some positive aspects to the album.

In the solid state, particles are fixed in place, while particles are more free to move in the liquid and gas states. The particles in the solid and liquid states “stick together,” but in the gas state, they move freely about the container. In general, it requires energy to separate individual particles. If we want to make a solid adopt a liquid form, we can add energy in the form of heat, increasing the temperature of the substance. Conversely, if we want to convert a substance from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, we remove energy from the system and decrease the temperature. Pressure also plays an important role in changes of state, which will be discussed later on. We will study these difference in greater detail in the chapter States of Matter. John is studying the different states of matter. Today, he has a matter in three states in front of him, state A, state B, and state C. State A is in solid state. State B is in liquid state.

A disgusting Chinese takeaway has been shut down after health experts found cockroaches, mice droppings, filthy hobs smeared in grease and food left to cool inches from bags of rubbish. The Golden Dragon in Plaistow, east London, was closed on the spot after inspectors discovered the horrific catalogue of flagrant health and safety breaches. The fast food outlet is thought to have been trading for at least a month before it was officially closed by Stratford Magistrates Court last Friday. Cockroaches were found crawling behind refrigeration units at the Golden Dragon in Plaistow 'It's one of the worst cases I've seen in 12 years,' said Matthew Collins, principal environmental health officer for Newham Council.

It is deeply concerning that businesses are allowed to operate under these conditions, posing a serious risk to public health and safety.' To combat the recurring problem of unhygienic food establishments in the area, authorities and local communities must take a multi-faceted approach. Here are some steps that can be implemented to improve overall food safety: 1. Stricter inspections and licensing: The government, councils, and local health departments should create and enforce more stringent health inspection regulations to ensure that all food establishments meet the same high standards. Only when the businesses pass comprehensive evaluations should they be granted licenses to operate. Restaurants found to have violated quality regulations should be mandated to rectify the issue within a specific time frame or risk closure. 2. Real-time information sharing: Develop an integrated database that shares real-time information on all food establishments in the area, such as inspection results, complaints, and legal actions taken. This would enable both councils and the public to have greater access to information about the businesses they patronize, fostering increased transparency and accountability. 3. Public education and engagement: Local communities should be educated on how to report suspected health and safety violations at food establishments. This would not only help the relevant authorities identify offenders quickly but also encourage continuous improvement in the food industry. 4. Regular training for food establishment staff: All staff working in food establishments should receive periodic training in food safety and hygienic practices. Proper training would ensure that all employees are knowledgeable about best practices, and it reduces the likelihood of poor hygiene standards being overlooked in the workplace. 5. Stronger penalties and fines: Increase penalties, fines, and sanctions for food establishments found to be operating under unsafe and unhygienic conditions. The fear of severe consequences could act as a deterrent to business owners who may otherwise ignore health and safety regulations. 6. Collaboration with other stakeholders: Partnerships between local government, health departments, industry associations, and community organizations could lead to a more holistic approach for addressing the problem. Collaboration can facilitate the exchange of knowledge, resources, and information, resulting in a more efficient and effective food safety system. The closure of the Golden Dragon serves as an example of the urgent need for vigilance, oversight, and action to protect the health and well-being of the community. Taking the necessary steps to address these issues would ultimately promote safer, cleaner, and more responsible food establishments that customers can trust and enjoy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: Who is assumed to have attacked the professor's fiance? , can you please find it? The film opens with a trio of explorers in Africa who are hiding in a cave. One of the explorers, a pregnant woman, is bitten by a vampire bat. The film then cuts forward in time to a small European village where a series of mysterious murders are taking place. The villagers readily assemble in mob form, with torches, at the house of Professor Kristan after every murder. The villagers suspect that a giant bat is to blame for the murders. Kristan gives the villagers advice on staying safe, and assures them a scientific explanation exists. However, in subsequent scenes, Kristan himself is revealed to be the murderer. He is seized by attacks (triggered by darkness) which transform him into a trance-like state of murderousness. After he commits a murder, he awakens from the trance with no memory of the deed, believing himself merely to have fainted. Kristan's obliviousness is further enabled by the intervention of his loyal hunchback Zan, the only person aware of Kristan's condition. Zan follows Kristan when he is in his trances, ensuring the professor is not discovered. An old friend of Kristan's, Dr. Bizet, arrives to visit, and soon suspects what is happening. Bizet discloses to Kristan that his mother was bitten by a vampire bat, and that traits of vampirism have likely been passed down to him per Lamarckism. (The audience now understands the pregnant explorer in the opening flashback to have been Kristan's mother.) After Kristan's fiance is attacked by an entranced Kristan, the mob of villagers assumes Zan is culpable and chases him to the edge of a cliff inside a cave. Kristan arrives and confesses to the murders, despite Zan's protestations (aimed at saving the professor) that he, the hunchback, is in fact the murderer. As the mob watches, Kristan throws himself over the edge of the cliff and Zan follows. The answer to this question is:","completion":"An entranced Professor Kristan is assumed to have attacked the professor's fiance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Paragraph : The farther you stretch the band, the greater the resistance is. Question: Jim is playing with a rubber band by stretching and releasing it. Would he feel more resistance stretching the band to 40 cm or or 30 cm? Answer:","completion":"Jim would feel more resistance when he stretches the rubber band to 40 cm as opposed to 30 cm. The paragraph states that \\"the farther you stretch the band, the greater the resistance is.\\" This means that as the rubber band is stretched farther, the force or resistance it exerts against the stretching action increases. In this situation, 40 cm is a greater distance than 30 cm. When Jim stretches the rubber band to 40 cm, the band has to cover a larger distance, which requires more force to achieve. As a result, the resistance generated by the rubber band will be higher at 40 cm compared to when it is stretched only to 30 cm. This is due to the inherent properties of the rubber band. The material used in making rubber bands is elastic, which allows it to stretch and return to its original shape and size when the stretching force is removed. As the band is stretched, the molecules in the rubber become more aligned and experience a greater internal resistance against the stretching force. Consequently, the farther the rubber band is stretched, the more it resists being stretched further. In conclusion, Jim would feel more resistance stretching the rubber band to 40 cm as compared to 30 cm, as the resistance increases with the distance it is stretched."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Next question: what were the years of prohibition in the united states?","completion":"Prohibition in the United States was a nationwide constitutional ban on the production, importation, transportation, and sale of alcoholic beverages. It was a significant period in American history that lasted for a little over 13 years. Prohibition formally began on January 17, 1920, when the 18th Amendment to the United States Constitution came into effect and ended on December 5, 1933, with the ratification of the 21st Amendment, which repealed the 18th Amendment. The push for Prohibition in the United States developed over a long period of time. Temperance movements had gained traction in the 19th century, primarily motivated by religious and moral beliefs. Advocates of temperance argued that alcohol consumption led to social problems such as crime, poverty, and broken families. The emergence of the Anti-Saloon League in the late 1800s added significant momentum to the cause. In 1919, the United States Congress passed the Volstead Act, which was officially named the National Prohibition Act. The Act enforced the 18th Amendment and defined the terms under which the production, sale, and transportation of intoxicating liquors were prohibited. The Volstead Act faced a challenge from President Woodrow Wilson, who vetoed the bill. However, his veto was overridden by Congress, and the Act went into effect alongside the 18th Amendment on January 17, 1920. Despite its noble intentions, Prohibition turned out to be a contentious policy that led to a variety of unintended consequences. The ban on alcohol created a massive black market, giving rise to criminal organizations and leading to an increase in organized crime. Gangsters, such as the infamous Al Capone, profited immensely by smuggling and distributing alcohol through speakeasies, underground bars and clubs that flouted Prohibition laws. Violent clashes between rival gangs and law enforcement officials became a more frequent occurrence during this period. The federal government struggled to enforce Prohibition effectively, as limited resources and widespread corruption among authorities hindered their efforts. Furthermore, many American citizens did not support the ban on alcohol, leading to widespread disrespect for and disregard of the law. Prohibition also had economic implications on the United States. Job losses were suffered as breweries, distilleries, and other alcohol-related industries struggled. Additionally, the government experienced a significant reduction in tax revenues due to the absence of alcohol sales. As the detrimental effects of Prohibition became increasingly apparent, calls for its repeal grew louder. The onset of the Great Depression in 1929 further intensified these demands, as the struggling economy prompted policymakers to search for new sources of revenue, such as alcohol taxes. Eventually, the 21st Amendment was proposed and ratified on December 5, 1933, officially repealing the 18th Amendment and bringing an end to the era of Prohibition in the United States. In summary, Prohibition in the United States lasted from January 17, 1920 to December 5, 1933. Although intended to address social issues related to alcohol consumption, it led to numerous unintended consequences, such as the rise of organized crime, that ultimately contributed to its repeal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Its sister international division is Viacom International Media Networks. - MTV (originally an initialism of Music Television) is an American cable and satellite television channel owned by Viacom Media Networks (a division of Viacom) and headquartered in New York City. Launched on August 1, 1981, the channel originally aired music videos as guided by television personalities known as \\"video jockeys\\" (VJs). In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, high school students and college students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods. It has received criticism towards this change of focus, both by certain segments of its audience and musicians. MTV's influence on its audience, including issues involving censorship and social activism, has also been a subject of debate for several years. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America.

A permanent European presence in New Netherland began in 1624 – making New York the 12th oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement in the continental United States – with the founding of a Dutch fur trading settlement on Governors Island.

Title: Plastic Measuring cups Review: Oxo is a safe choice for good products at reasonable prices and that's true of these cups. There are six in the set so pretty much all of the sizes you might need are covered. The shape is elongated instead of round, so they may be an easier fit into some canisters than round measures. The sizes are marked in different colors on raised lettering, so even if the paint wears off, you should still be able to read the sizes.Because these measures are plastic and not metal, some powdered ingredients seem to slightly stick to them, and oil is a bit harder to clean off. They are also a little bit bulky compared to metal measuring cups. That's why I am only giving them four stars. Answer: The answer is:","completion":"Yes, this product review is overall positive.

He hugged his lawyers and their assistants and then said , \\" Thank you so much . \\" Moments later , he hugged his defense lawyers , softly saying , \\" Thank you , so much . \\" Options are: - no; - yes;...I think the answer is","completion":"Yes, the two sentences essentially convey the same meaning, but there are some subtle differences in the context and tone. Both sentences describe an individual expressing gratitude towards their lawyers and assistants through physical affection (a hug) and verbal thanks (\\"Thank you,\\" \\"Thank you so much,\\" and \\"Thank you, so much\\"). However, there are slight variations in the phrasing and structure of the two sentences that set them apart. In the first sentence, \\"He hugged his lawyers and their assistants and then said, 'Thank you so much.'\\" The action is presented as an uninterrupted sequence of events, implying that the individual's gratitude was intended for both the lawyers and their assistants simultaneously. Their appreciation seems assertive and direct. The second sentence, \\"Moments later, he hugged his defense lawyers, softly saying, 'Thank you, so much.'\\" suggests that there might have been some time-lapse between the individual's expression of gratitude and the preceding event. Using \\"moments later\\" establishes the possibility that right before this event, something else occurred or the individual had previously spoken to different people prior to focusing on their defense lawyers. Additionally, when expressing thanks in this sentence, the individual does so \\"softly.\\" This could imply that their gratitude, although sincere, might have been more emotional or tender in nature compared to the first sentence. In summary, while both sentences communicate the same overall message – an individual hugging and thanking their legal representatives – there are subtle differences in context and tone. Despite these variations, the core meaning remains the same, and the answer is, therefore, yes – the two sentences essentially mean the same thing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The band's heavy, guitar-driven sound, rooted in blues and psychedelia on their early albums, has earned them recognition as one of the progenitors of heavy metal, though their unique style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music. What is the relationship between 'rich woman' and 'rounder records'? The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"Rich Woman\\" is closely related to Rounder Records due to its inclusion on the album \\"Raising Sand\\", a collaboration between musicians Robert Plant and Alison Krauss. \\"Raising Sand\\" was released on October 23, 2007 by Rounder Records, which is a label that specializes in a variety of American music forms, from folk and bluegrass, to blues and more. \\"Rich Woman\\" is a standout song from this album, showcasing the unique blend of rock and bluegrass-country sounds that define the Plant-Krauss collaboration. The track, along with the rest of the \\"Raising Sand\\" album, was recognized for its excellence in music production, with the album winning \\"Album of the Year\\" at the 2008 Americana Music Honors & Awards and at the 2009 Grammy Awards. Notably, \\"Rich Woman\\" itself also won the 2009 Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.

Q:On Saturday, President Donald Trump will mark the first anniversary of his inauguration as the 45th president, the day on the steps of the U.S. Capitol he promised to put \\"America first.\\" Trump's tumultuous first year was unlike that of any other president in recent U.S. history, and 2018 could offer more of the same. The president had his share of victories and setbacks amid a backdrop of Twitter storms and, at times, raging rhetoric. Trump's political base seems pleased with his first year in office, touting his efforts to cut Obama-era regulations, install Justice Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, and roll back Islamic State forces in the Middle East. \\"We were kind of thinking we were going to relax and put Trump behind us and just watch all the great promises that he gave us, and watch him make America great again,\\" said Michigan Trump supporter Meshawn Maddock. \\"But what happened immediately is that we felt he was under attack from day one.\\" The president's biggest legislative victory came just last month, a sweeping tax cut bill that had been a Republican priority for years. \\"We are very proud of it,\\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office as he signed it. \\"It is going to be a tremendous thing for the American people. It is going to be fantastic for the economy.\\" In fact, there are plenty of signs of a surging economy, and public opinion polls show growing support for Trump's handling of it and even a bump up in support for the tax bill, which many voters saw initially as too favorable to the wealthy. The tax victory also seems to be helping Trump galvanize the Republican Party behind him, even those who in the past have been cool to his leadership. \\"This president hasn't even been in office for a year, and look at all the things he has been able to get done, by sheer will in many ways,\\" said Utah Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, who also announced recently he would not run for re-election this year.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Children throw tantrums when they want something and do not get it. By acting out, the child may hope to get what they want in the end. If you give the child what they want (e.g. ice cream, or a delayed bathtime/bedtime), then the child will learn that tantrums are a good way to get things. It is much easier to start addressing tantrums when the autistic person is a child. For example, a 6-year-old boy who throws himself on the floor is much easier to manage compared to a 16-year-old. Also, the child will be less likely to cause injury to themself or others. Planned ignoring can work best for yelling, swearing, and sulking. This will teach the child that the behavior is not an effective way to get attention. It helps to clearly communicate this idea, such as \\"I can't understand what's wrong if you're pouting back there. But if you would like to calm down a little and explain what is wrong, I would be happy to listen to you.\\" Always step in if the child begins throwing things, taking things that belong to others, or hitting. Ask the child to stop and then explain why the behavior is not okay. Tell your child that they can choose to act in a way that will get the desired response. Explaining this to your child will help your child understand the best way to get what they want (or at least a listening ear or a compromise). For example, you can tell your child, \\"If you'd like me to help you, you can take a few deep breaths and tell me what's wrong. I'm here for you if you need me.\\" Summary:","completion":"This article explains that when children have tantrums to get what they want, it's important to teach them better ways to communicate their needs instead of giving in to their tantrums."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: American football strategy concerns the deployment of offensive, defensive, and special teams players and the execution of plays in American football. In American football, there are a vast array of positions, formations, strategies, plays and types of play calling systems that are utilized. If a strategy is for a particular game, it is known as a \\"game plan\\". Hypothesis: Offensive, defensive, and special teams players are deployed for varying amounts of time.","completion":"In order to determine the validity of the hypothesis that offensive, defensive, and special teams players are deployed for varying amounts of time, it is necessary to analyze the structure and rules of American football. In this context, football teams can be disaggregated into three primary units: offensive, defensive, and special teams. Offensive Unit: This unit is responsible for scoring points by driving down the field and either reaching the end zone for a touchdown or getting within field goal range. The offensive unit consists of positions such as the quarterback, running backs, wide receivers, tight ends, and offensive linemen. This unit will spend time on the field each time they possess the ball during a game and typically has the most prolonged periods of continuous play. Defensive Unit: This unit's objective is to stop the opposing team's offensive unit from advancing the ball and ultimately scoring points. The defensive unit includes the defensive linemen, linebackers, and defensive backs. Similar to the offensive unit, the defensive unit will spend time on the field based on the opposing team's possession of the football. However, their time on the field also depends on the effectiveness of their plays and tactics which can lead to turnovers and quick offensive possessions for their team. Special Teams: The special teams unit consists of players who are utilized during kicking plays, such as punts, field goal attempts, and kickoffs. Due to the specialized nature of these plays, the special teams unit is generally on the field for lesser continuous time compared to the offensive and defensive units. Players in key positions on special teams include the punter, kicker, long snapper, and return specialists. Given the specific roles and functions of each unit in American football, it is evident that the time spent on the field can vary depending on the circumstances related to a game's progression. Factors such as the overall game plan, score differential, and the effectiveness of each unit in executing plays will influence the amount of time each unit is deployed throughout the game. Considering the differentiation in the roles, responsibilities, and circumstances faced by offensive, defensive, and special teams players during an American football game, the hypothesis that they are deployed for varying amounts of time is indeed true. The dynamics of American football and the diverse strategies employed by coaches and players ensure that each unit's deployment time is likely to differ, as they contribute uniquely to the outcome of the game."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: There was a boy named Chan who loved his parents, though they did not love him back; he was not even given a first name. He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

New York (CNN) -- The mayor of Newark has called for an investigation into a far-reaching New York Police Department surveillance program that was allegedly conducted in the New Jersey city's Muslim's neighborhoods. \\"The Newark Police Department was not involved in joint operations with the New York Police Department as was described in the disclosed NYPD report,\\" Mayor Cory Booker said Wednesday, referring to a leaked internal New York police document that allegedly detailed police surveillance of Muslim-owned business and mosques across the city. \\"I strongly believe that we must be vigilant in protecting our citizens from crime and terrorism but to put large segments of a religious community under surveillance with no legitimate cause or provocation clearly crosses a line,\\" he said. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also called the development \\"disturbing\\" and has asked the state's attorney general to investigate. The 60-page report, first obtained by The Associated Press, showed maps of Newark and photographs of Muslim residences and mosques. There was no statement in the document regarding terrorism or criminal activity. The New Jersey mayor's statement comes a day after New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg defended the extent of police surveillance against critics who have suggested authorities went too far. \\"We have to keep this country safe,\\" the mayor told reporters, addressing questions about a separate report, also leaked to AP, that indicated the New York police were closely monitoring Muslim student associations in schools across the Northeast. \\"If people put things on websites and make them available to everybody, of course the NYPD is going to look at anything that's publicly available in the public domain,\\" Bloomberg said. \\"And given we've had a dozen people arrested or convicted of terrorist acts who've come from similar organizations, we have an obligation to do so.\\" That report said police have tracked websites, and on one occasion sent an undercover officer with students from the City College of New York on a whitewater rafting trip. \\"The police department goes where there are allegations,\\" Bloomberg said. But Yale University President Richard Levin described New York's surveillance program as \\"antithetical to the values\\" of the New Haven, Connecticut, university and those of the nation. When a reporter asked if police had gone too far by sending the agent on the rafting trip, Bloomberg responded, \\"No.\\" Police spokesman Paul Browne told CNN that his agency does not monitor students directly but confirmed it monitors websites they use. \\"In any case where you see an NYPD officer present, it's an indication that we were looking at an individual,\\" he said. The Columbia University Muslim Students Association condemned the police practice in a statement this week. \\"We are concerned that news reports about NYPD's presence on our campus have a chilling effect on the intellectual freedom necessary for a vibrant academic community,\\" it read. In December, a prominent group of Muslim leaders boycotted Bloomberg's annual interfaith breakfast in protest of the controversial program. The move stemmed from a series of earlier news reports that raised questions about the nature of a CIA partnership with the New York police that allegedly helped to build city intelligence programs to spy on Muslims. The boycott stood in a stark contrast to the goodwill the mayor earned among Muslim leaders when he defended plans for a controversial Islamic community center near the former site of the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan. The CIA later announced its internal watchdog found no issue or evidence of wrongdoing in the spy agency's partnership with New York police.","completion":"Part #1: The maximum length of the highlight.

Select the topic that this about: The last probable common ancestor to humans and great apes had a body like an ape, fingers like a chimp and the upright posture of humans, according to researchers who unearthed a fossil of the animal in Spain. Options: -World -Sports -Business -Science/Tech","completion":"This topic belongs to Science/Tech. The discovery of the last probable common ancestor's fossil between humans and great apes is a significant breakthrough in the field of human evolutionary studies. By analyzing these fossils, researchers can unlock crucial information about the biological and morphological traits that have shaped our lineage and led to the emergence of modern humans. The fossil, unearthed in Spain, demonstrates a unique blend of characteristics from both humans and apes, which may have allowed the species to adapt better during critical periods of evolutionary change. A body like an ape suggests that this species was adapted to moving through trees or across uneven surfaces. This physical feature would have benefited them in the arboreal environment, enabling them to effectively search for food, avoid predators, and establish a territory. In addition, fingers like a chimp indicate a greater degree of manual dexterity and gripping capabilities that could have been used in multiple ways - from handling objects and manipulating tools to signal communication and social functioning. This trait may have been vital in developing the cognitive and cultural processes that have enabled human intellectual development. One of the most striking features of human evolution is our upright posture, also known as bipedalism. This trait is shared with the last probable common ancestor, potentially providing evidence on how early hominids began to rely more on walking upright, ultimately leading to improved energy efficiency and the ability to traverse longer distances. Bipedalism also freed the hands for various tasks such as carrying objects, tool manufacturing, and social grooming - all essential factors to the social and cultural evolution of our species. This significant discovery highlights the importance of interdisciplinary research in the field of paleoanthropology. By combining various investigative methods from disciplines such as geology, biology, and archeology, researchers can reveal fascinating stories about our past and understand the complex factors that lead to the evolutionary success of our species. In conclusion, the topic of the last probable common ancestor to humans and great apes found in Spain is most accurately classified under the Science/Tech category. This discovery contributes to our understanding of human evolution, illustrating the morphological features and biological traits that have set the stage for the emergence of modern humans. It sheds light on the evolutionary adaptations that propelled our ancestors towards the sophisticated cognitive and social abilities that define humanity today."},{"prompt":"Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was one of Henry V's victories? When Richard II was crowned in 1377, he led a procession from the Tower to Westminster Abbey. This tradition began in at least the early 14th century and lasted until 1660. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 the Tower of London was besieged with the King inside. When Richard rode out to meet with Wat Tyler, the rebel leader, a crowd broke into the castle without meeting resistance and looted the Jewel House. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, took refuge in St John's Chapel, hoping the mob would respect the sanctuary. However, he was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill. Six years later there was again civil unrest, and Richard spent Christmas in the security of the Tower rather than Windsor as was more usual. When Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399, Richard was imprisoned in the White Tower. He abdicated and was replaced on the throne by Bolingbroke, who became King Henry IV. In the 15th century, there was little building work at the Tower of London, yet the castle still remained important as a place of refuge. When supporters of the late Richard II attempted a coup, Henry IV found safety in the Tower of London. During this period, the castle also held many distinguished prisoners. The heir to the Scottish throne, later King James I of Scotland, was kidnapped while journeying to France in 1406 and held in the Tower. The reign of Henry V (1413–1422) renewed England's fortune in the Hundred Years' War against France. As a result of Henry's victories, such as the Battle of Agincourt, many high-status prisoners were held in the Tower of London until they were ransomed.Much of the latter half of the 15th century was occupied by the Wars of the Roses between the claimants to the throne, the houses of Lancaster and York. The castle was once again besieged in 1460, this time by a Yorkist force. The Tower was damaged by artillery fire but only surrendered when Henry VI was captured at the Battle of Northampton.

The film is based on actual events, beginning in August 1941. Nazi Einsatzgruppen (task forces) are sweeping through Eastern Europe, systematically killing Jews. Among the survivors not killed or restricted to ghettoes are the Belarusian Jewish Bielski brothers: Tuvia, Zus, Asael and Aron. Their parents are dead, killed by local police under orders from the occupying Germans. The brothers flee to the Naliboki Forest, vowing to avenge the deaths of their parents. They encounter other Jewish escapees hiding in the forest, and the brothers take them under their protection and leadership. Tuvia kills the local Auxiliary Police chief responsible for his parents' deaths. Over the next year, they shelter a growing number of refugees, raiding local farms for food and supplies and moving their camp whenever they are discovered by the collaborationist police. Bielski brothers stage raids on the Germans and their collaborators. Casualties cause Tuvia to reconsider this approach because of the risk to the hiding Jews. Rivalry between the two eldest brothers, Tuvia and Zus, fuels a disagreement between them about their future; as winter approaches, Zus decides to leave the camp and join a local company of Soviet partisans, while his older brother Tuvia remains with the camp as their leader.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: Whose relationship with their wife becomes strained?, using the article: John, an ambitious young police officer, is sent undercover to join a violent football firm associated with the fictitious club Shadwell Town to track down the 'generals' - the shadowy figures who orchestrate the violence. His team of four gradually ingratiate themselves into the lives of The Dogs, the nickname that Shadwell's fans give themselves. The main site for this is The Rock, a public house around which The Dogs' lives revolve. Gradually, the hard drinking and hard fighting macho culture - where Saturday's match and Saturday's fight are all that matters - prove strangely irresistible to John and he slowly finds himself becoming one of the thugs he has been sent to entrap. His relationships with his wife, his superiors and even his team become strained. Eventually his wife returns to her parents' house and rebuffs his attempted reconciliation. The police operation is abruptly wound up for budgeting reasons, just as it seems John is making progress in identifying those who pull the strings. The closing sequence shows a shaven-headed John taking part in a racist march, having become nothing more than a neo-nazi fascist. One of his team approaches him to try to help him, but is rebuffed. John says that he is, again, working undercover. There is a degree of ambiguity, and it might be that he is working undercover, though it may also be that he has become deluded and has merely mired himself in an even less pleasant world.

Q:Given the below context: Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less...

Select the topic that this about: TEHRAN, Iran Sept. 12, 2004 - Iran said Sunday it would not abandon uranium enrichment, rejecting a key demand by three European powers that have threatened to intensify pressure if Tehran does not curb its nuclear program.","completion":"The topic this passage is about is \\"Iran's Nuclear Program and International Diplomacy.\\" Specifically, it focuses on the longstanding international dispute around Iran's nuclear program and its refusal to halt uranium enrichment. Uranium enrichment is a process that's critical for both civil nuclear power generation and military nuclear weapons. This dual-use technology is thus rigorously monitored and regulated on an international level. In this context, the enrichment of uranium by Iran, a country that has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), becomes a significant point of concern for many nations worldwide because it potentially signals Tehran’s capability and intention to develop nuclear weapons. The passage also highlights the diplomatic efforts of three European powers to curb Iran's nuclear program. Although these countries are not explicitly named in the excerpt, historical knowledge reveals the group typically referenced in such cases is the E3, or EU3, consisting of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. These key European nations have repeatedly aimed to negotiate with Iran in order to persuade the country to halt its nuclear developments and particularly its uranium enrichment activities as part of a broader strategy to maintain stability in the Middle East and global nuclear security. Lastly, the threat to \\"intensify pressure\\" on Iran if it does not comply with requests to curb its nuclear program suggests a range of diplomatic and economic measures, including potential sanctions or reporting the issue to international institutions such as the United Nations. It reflects the seriousness and complexity of the situation, as world powers seek to balance diplomatic, security, and strategic considerations in dealing with Iran and its nuclear program."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Sondra Crench kicked a roach out of her way as she walked into her tiny apartment and sat down at her old laptop. It was after midnight. So, she figured her new friend, Jason, was already dead. And so were her hopes of landing a secretarial job in time to keep her apartment. Rent was due on Tuesday, and she had just enough money to pay it. But then she'd have no money for food or gas or anything else. Maybe it was time to go home for a while. Surely she could put up with her mother for a few weeks while looking for work. She opened her Favorites list and clicked on the link for The Orange Leader. Sondra had not been back to her home town in a long time, but she liked to keep up with what was going on there. Occasionally, she'd see one of her old classmates in a wedding announcement. Those people led real lives, and held real jobs. As a working musician, she lived in a completely different world. She had more in common with actresses than a secretaries. She checked the Classifieds. Nurses wanted. Nope. Part-time receptionist. Not enough pay. Then she saw a full-page ad announcing the upcoming Grand Opening of Billy-Eye's Arcade and Dance Barn. Open Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights, 6:00 PM to Midnight. For ages 12-20. Free soft drinks and popcorn. Live band. Five bucks to get in. Only twenty-five cents for arcade games.

It would play two hours a night, and earn 2,000 per week. Divided by four band members... Sondra could actually live on that! Not very well--but she could get by.

Translate this to English?","completion":"As the current strategy is based on a long-term strategic vision, the results must also be quantified in the long term. This statement emphasizes the importance of having a long-term strategic vision when implementing a current strategy. In any organization or project, having a clear and well-defined strategy allows for better planning and decision-making processes. It ensures that all the steps taken are aligned with the ultimate goals and objectives of the organization. When a strategy is based on a long-term vision, it means that the organization is considering not only its immediate needs and goals but also the future prospects. This long-term perspective allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the complex factors that can affect the success of the strategy. These factors can include economic trends, technological advancements, and changes in the industry landscape. Furthermore, this statement highlights the importance of quantifying the results of a long-term strategy. Quantifying the results means measuring and evaluating the outcomes of the strategic actions taken by the organization. This may involve collecting data, establishing key performance indicators (KPIs), or even conducting cost-benefit analyses to determine the return on investments made in pursuing the strategy. Quantifying the results of the long-term strategic vision enables the organization to assess the success of the current strategy, learn from its past experiences, and make necessary adjustments to improve future outcomes. It also helps the organization communicate its progress and achievements to stakeholders, such as investors or shareholders, who may have a specific interest in the long-term prospects of the organization.

Known as a supreme colorist, and after an early period with Mannerism, Paolo Veronese developed a naturalist style of painting, influenced by Titian. - The Roman Republic was the era of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire. It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world. - Lucretia is a painting by Paolo Veronese from c. 1585 . - Tiziano Vecelli or Tiziano Vecellio (1488/1490 27 August 1576), known in English as Titian , was an Italian painter, the most important member of the 16th-century Venetian school. He was born in Pieve di Cadore, near Belluno (in Veneto, Republic of Venice).

Risk factors include mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, alcoholism, or substance misuse. Others are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to method of suicide, such as firearms and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, there is little evidence for their effectiveness. The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries, and is partly related to the availability of effective means. Common methods include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. Suicide resulted in 842,000 deaths globally in 2013 (up from 712,000 deaths in 1990). This makes it the 10th leading cause of death worldwide. Approximately 0.5% to 1.4% of people die by suicide, about 12 per 100,000 persons per year. Three quarters of suicides globally occur in the developing world. Rates of completed suicides are generally higher in men than in women, ranging from 1.5 times as much in the developing world to 3.5 times in the developed world. Suicide is generally most common among those over the age of 70; however, in certain countries those aged between 15 and 30 are at highest risk. There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year. Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long-term disabilities. In the Western world, attempts are more common in young people and females. Views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. The Abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide an offense towards God due to the belief in the sanctity of life.

The work is a large-format (6.77 m × 9.94 m) oil painting executed in the Mannerist style of the High Renaissance (14901527); as such, \\"The Wedding Feast at Cana\\" is the most expansive canvas (67.29 m) in the paintings collection of the Musée du Louvre. - Mannerism is a style in European art that emerged in the later years of the Italian High Renaissance around 1520, lasting until about 1580 in Italy, when the Baroque style began to replace it. Northern Mannerism continued into the early 17th century. - Titus Livius (64 or 59 BCAD 17)known as Livy in Englishwas a Roman historian who wrote a monumental history of Rome and the Roman people \\"Ab Urbe Condita Libri\\" (\\"Books from the Foundation of the City\\") covering the period from the earliest legends of Rome before the traditional foundation in 753 BC through the reign of Augustus in Livy's own time. He was on familiar terms with the Julio-Claudian dynasty, advising Augustus's grandnephew, the future emperor Claudius, as a young man not long before 14 AD in a letter to take up the writing of history. Livy and Augustus's wife, Livia, were from the same clan in different locations, although not related by blood. - The Feast in the House of Levi or Christ in the House of Levi is a 1573 painting by Italian painter Paolo Veronese and one of the largest canvases of the 16th century, measuring . It is now in the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice.

History paintings usually depict a moment in a narrative story, rather than a specific and static subject, as in a portrait. The term is derived from the wider senses of the word \\"historia\\" in Latin and Italian, meaning \\"story\\" or \\"narrative\\", and essentially means \\"story painting\\". Most history paintings are not of scenes from history, especially paintings from before about 1850. In modern English, historical painting is sometimes used to describe the painting of scenes from history in its narrower sense, especially for 19th-century art, excluding religious, mythological and allegorical subjects, which are included in the broader term history painting, and before the 19th century were the most common subjects for history paintings. - Lucretia or Lucrece (died ) was an ancient Roman woman whose fate played a vital role in the transition of Roman government from the Roman Kingdom to the Roman Republic. While there were no contemporary sources, accounts from Roman historian Livy (Livius) and Greek-Roman historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus from the time of Emperor Caesar Augustus (23 September 63 BC 19 August 14 AD) agreed that there was such a woman and that her suicide after being raped by an Etruscan king's son was the immediate cause of the anti-monarchist rebellion that overthrew the monarchy.
