Later, he began to present various radio programs, including Switch with Annie Mac and various weekend shows. His talent and charisma quickly became popular among listeners, which led to him hosting the Weekend Breakfast Show in 2009. He moved to weeknights with the new show, Radio 1's Evening Show in 2010, which eventually evolved into Radio 1's NME Chart Show. In July 2012, the BBC announced that Nick Grimshaw would take over from Chris Moyles as the presenter of The Radio One Breakfast Show after the latter's departure. The switch garnered significant attention, with many eager to witness Grimshaw's impact on the show. The first Grimshaw-fronted airing of The Radio One Breakfast Show took place on September 24, 2012.

'' The divide has long been a place steeped in mystery and rich with cultural significance. For generations, the native tribes living in the surrounding areas have passed down stories and legends that speak of powerful forces that reside within the divide. These stories have connected the tribes to the divide in a way that has defined their existence, and helped to shape their understanding of the world around them. Billie's assertion that people connected to activity on the divide have always been like \\"us\\" speaks to the bond shared by the individuals belonging to these native tribes. By identifying themselves as \\"native American,\\" or \\"first peoples,\\" they are reinforcing the notion that they are connected to a deep history and ancient lineage that predates the arrival of European settlers in the Americas. Confusion can arise for outsiders, as the cultural intricacies and ancient knowledge of the divide have traditionally been passed down orally through generations and are thus not widely known or documented. The native tribes possess a unique understanding of the divide, thanks to the stories, rituals, and practices that they have inherited from their ancestors. This understanding is grounded in the belief that they are the descendants of the very first people to inhabit the land surrounding the divide. The mention of the protagonist's ability, one that apparently has not been encountered among non-Native individuals, suggests that there could be something unique or special about their connection to the divide as well. This raises intriguing questions about the possible influence that ancestral lineage, cultural context, and mythology play in determining both the nature of one's abilities and their relationship to the divide. It is also fascinating to consider the ways in which mythology associated with the divide has possibly shaped and influenced the lives of those who live near it. For the native tribes, these mythological stories provide a framework for understanding the world and their place within it, as well as a shared cultural identity that unites them across different tribes. In this passage, we see that an individual's connection to the divide may depend, at least in part, on whether they belong to a native tribe. Those who do not share this lineage may find it difficult to comprehend or interpret the significance of the divide and the activities that take place there. Ultimately, the divide serves as a powerful symbol that enriches the culture of the native tribes while also connecting them to a complex and profound history. Through the exploration of the connections between ancestry, mythology, and understanding of the divide, the text invites us to consider the ways in which these elements intertwine to shape, define, and preserve the collective identity of the first peoples."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

All electric charge is based on the protons and electrons in atoms. A proton has a positive electric charge. An electron has a negative electric charge. Forces on Charged Objects Most atoms are balanced electrically. They have the same number of positive and negative charges. Therefore, the number of protons equals the number of electrons. Neutrons do not matter as they have no charge. When an object loses some electrons, it becomes positively charged. There are now more protons than electrons inside the atom. The lost electrons may remain free. Or, they may attach to another object. The new object now has more electrons than protons. It then becomes negatively charged.

Question: Information: - Whitewater, usually spelled white water in both American and British English, is formed in a rapid, when a river's gradient increases enough to create so much turbulence that air is entrained into the water body, that is, it forms a bubbly or aerated and unstable current; the frothy water appears white. The term is also loosely used to refer to less turbulent, but still agitated, flows. - New Caledonia is a special collectivity of France located in the southwest Pacific Ocean, east of Australia and east of Metropolitan France. The archipelago, part of the Melanesia subregion, includes the main island of Grande Terre, the Loyalty Islands, the Chesterfield Islands, the Belep archipelago, the Isle of Pines, and a few remote islets. The Chesterfield Islands are in the Coral Sea. Locals refer to Grande Terre as \\"\\" (\\"the pebble\\"). - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - The North Island or Te Ika-a-Mui (\\"Mori\\") is one of the two main islands of New Zealand, separated from the slightly larger but much less populous South Island by Cook Strait. The island's area is , making it the world's 14th-largest island. It has a population of - The Tasman Sea (Mori: \\"Te Tai-o-Rehua\\") is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand. It measures about across and about from north to south. The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who was the first recorded European to encounter New Zealand and Tasmania. The British explorer Captain James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s as part of his first voyage of exploration. - A stream is a body of water with a current, confined within a bed and banks. Depending on its location or certain characteristics, a stream may be referred to as a \\"bayou\\", \\"beck\\", \\"branch\\", \\"brook\\", \\"burn\\", \\"creek\\", \\"crick\\", \\"ghyll\\", \\"gill\\", \\"kill\\", \\"lick\\", \\"mill race\\", \\"race\\", \\"rill\\", \\"river\\", \\"rivulet\\", \\"run\\", \\"runnel\\", \\"streamage\\", \\"syke\\", or \\"wash\\". - The Whataroa River, sometimes the Wataroa River, is a river in the southern West Coast region of New Zealand's South Island. Its source is in the Southern Alps and it flows north and northwest, passing the township of Whataroa on the eastern side before reaching the Tasman Sea just south of Abut Head. The river is fed by many tributaries, such as the Perth River, and is crossed by State Highway 6 on its route between Whataroa and Te Taho. - Tonga (or ; Tongan: \\"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about scattered over of the southern Pacific Ocean. It has a population of 103,000 people of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu. - Tectonic uplift is the portion of the total geologic uplift of the mean Earth surface that is not attributable to an isostatic response to unloading. While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere. - Wellington is the capital city and second most populous urban area of New Zealand, with residents. It is at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region, which also includes the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa. As the nation's capital city, the New Zealand Government and Parliament, Supreme Court and most of the civil service are based in the city. - The South Island or Te Waipounamu (\\"Mori\\") is the larger of the two major islands of New Zealand, the other being the smaller but more populous North Island. It is bordered to the north by Cook Strait, to the west by the Tasman Sea, and to the south and east by the Pacific Ocean. The South Island covers and is influenced by a temperate climate. - A pond is a body of standing water, either natural or artificial, that is usually smaller than a lake. They may arise naturally in floodplains as part of a river system, or they may be somewhat isolated depressions (examples include vernal pools and prairie potholes). Usually they contain shallow water with marsh and aquatic plants and animals. A few animals also make their home in ponds, including both alligators and beavers. The type of life in a pond is generally determined by a combination of factors including water level regime (particularly depth and duration of flooding) and nutrient levels, but other factors may also be important, including presence or absence of shading by trees, presence or absence of streams, effects of grazing animals, and salinity. - The Southern Alps (Mori: K Tiritiri o te Moana ) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side. The term \\"Southern Alps\\" generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it. - Auckland is a city in the North Island of New Zealand. It is the most populous urban area in the country. Auckland has a population of , which constitutes percent of New Zealand's population. It is part of the wider Auckland Regionthe area governed by the Auckland Councilwhich also includes outlying rural areas and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf, resulting in a total population of . Auckland also has the largest Polynesian population of any city in the world. The Mori language name for Auckland is or , meaning \\"Tmaki with a hundred lovers\\", in reference to the desirability of its fertile land at the hub of waterways in all directions. It has also been called karana, the Mori enunciation of \\"Auckland\\". - The Perth River is a river located in the Southern Alps in the West Coast region of New Zealand's South Island. Its source is in terrace icefields north of the Rangitata Divide and is joined by multiple tributaries, including a creek from Abel Lake. It features a number of rapids and passes through two gorges before meeting the Whataroa River. The river is largely inaccessible, but recently, an adventure tourism company has begun offering \\"heli-rafting\\" on the river: whitewater rafters are flown in by helicopter to raft the river. Kayakers have been flying (\\"heli-boating\\") up the Perth for a number of years. The normal rafting put in at Five-Finger stream gives a nice class III-IV run with one amazing gorge. By flying up to Scone Hut, the trip becomes one of the best IV-V runs on the coast. More recently paddlers have been flying or walking upstream of scone hut for some V-V+ excitement. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - In geography, temperate or tepid latitudes of Earth lie between the tropics and the polar regions. The temperatures in these regions are generally relatively moderate, rather than extremely hot or cold, and the changes between summer and winter are also usually moderate. - Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea. \\"True rats\\" are members of the genus \\"Rattus\\", the most important of which to humans are the black rat, \\"Rattus rattus\\", and the brown rat, \\"Rattus norvegicus\\". Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats. - Fiji ((), officially the Republic of Fiji, is an island country in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about northeast of New Zealand's North Island. Its closest neighbours are Vanuatu to the west, New Caledonia to the southwest, New Zealand's Kermadec Islands to the southeast, Tonga to the east, the Samoas and France's Wallis and Futuna to the northeast, and Tuvalu to the north. - A lagoon is a shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water by barrier islands or reefs. Lagoons are commonly divided into coastal lagoons and atoll lagoons. They have also been identified as occurring on mixed-sand and gravel coastlines. There is an overlap between bodies of water classified as coastal lagoons and bodies of water classified as estuaries. Lagoons are common coastal features around many parts of the world. - Climate is the statistics of weather, usually over a 30-year interval. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - A lake is an area of variable size filled with water, localized in a basin, that is surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake. Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, and therefore are distinct from lagoons, and are also larger and deeper than ponds, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams. - Abel Lake is a small lake in the Westland region of the South Island of New Zealand . It is located in the Southern Alps , 35 kilometres ( 22 mi ) east of Franz Josef and is fed by the Abel Glacier . A short stream links the lake with the Perth River . - Cook Strait lies between the North and South Islands of New Zealand. It connects the Tasman Sea on the northwest with the South Pacific Ocean on the southeast, and runs next to the capital city, Wellington. It is wide at its narrowest point, and is considered one of the most dangerous and unpredictable waters in the world.

Summarize this article: Prior to starting any weight loss or diet program, it's ideal to speak to your doctor or even with a registered dietitian. Your doctor will be able to tell you whether your diet program is safe and healthy for you. They may also be able to provide you with additional guidance or recommend alternatives that might be more appropriate for your health. A registered dietitian is a nutrition expert that may give you a more effective diet for weight loss. They can create a meal plan for you that will help induce weight loss in addition to guiding you towards healthy foods to help you lose weight. Visit the EatRight website and click on the orange \\"Find an Expert\\" button on the top right to search for a dietitian in your area. In order to lose weight, you'll most likely need to cut out extra calories from your diet. Safe weight loss, or losing 1-2 pounds per week, requires you to cut out or burn off about 500-1000 calories daily. It is not recommended to cut out more than 500-1000 calories from your diet daily. You run the risk of being unable to meet your nutrient goals. Although weight loss and healthy eating go beyond calories, it's important to be calorie aware - knowing whether or not you're eating enough calories for your body and lifestyle. You can combine cutting calories with exercise to maximize how large your calorie deficit is daily. Studies show that consuming adequate protein helps support weight loss in addition to keeping you feeling satisfied. Include lean proteins such as: poultry, beef, pork, eggs, dairy products, legumes and tofu. In general, it’s recommended for women to consume 46 g of protein daily and men to consume 56 g daily. This recommendation is easily met if you consume about 3-4 oz of protein at each meal. That's about the size of a deck of cards or the palm of your hand or about 1/2 cup of items like beans or lentils. Fruits and vegetables are high in nutrients like fiber, vitamins and minerals and are also low in calories. Making half of your plate a fruit or vegetable helps cut down on your overall caloric intake. Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables each day. Choosing a different colored fruit or vegetable is an easy way to eat different vitamins and antioxidants. In general, aim for about 1-2 servings of fruit a day (about 1 small fruit or 1/2 cup of sliced fruit per serving) and at least 3-4 servings of vegetables (1 cup or 2 cups leafy vegetables per serving). Keep in mind that you can eat extra vegetables without throwing off your diet. In fact, eating more vegetables may help you to feel full and make it easier stick with your diet. Whole grains are an excellent source of fiber and a few vitamins and minerals. If choosing to eat grains, aim to choose whole grains when possible. Whole grains are an unprocessed grain. They contain the hull, germ and endosperm parts of the grain. Whole grains include: brown rice, 100% whole wheat pasta, oats, quinoa and 100% whole grain breads. Popcorn is also considered a whole grain. Having the occasional healthy snack is appropriate when you're trying to lose weight. In addition, a snack may even help support your weight loss efforts. If you really want to snack, think about whether it's necessary. A low-calorie snack can be a good option when there's more than 4-5 hours between meals, before or after a workout or you're feeling very hungry and there's more than 2 hours until your next meal. Try to keep your snacks between 100-200 calories. This will help get you to your next meal without blowing your daily calorie budget. Including fruits, vegetables and lean protein help keep snacks calorie-controlled while still being nutritious. Healthy snacks can include: cottage cheese and fruit, 2 hard boiled eggs, 1/3 cup of trail mix, or air-popped popcorn without butter. Staying hydrated can also aid in weight loss. Aim to drink about 64 oz or 8 glasses of clear, sugar-free liquids daily. Although this is a general rule of thumb, it's a good place to start. Even mild, chronic dehydration can slow weight loss. When you're dehydrated or feeling thirsty, many times this feels like hunger. This could be triggering you to eat, when you just need a few sips of water. Keep track of how much water or other fluids you consume daily by keeping a labeled water bottle near by. You can decrease or manage portion sizes by drinking a large glass of water right before your meal. This may help make you feel satiated a bit sooner. Avoid sweetened beverages. Avoiding soda, fruit juice, punch, sports drinks, energy drinks, kool-aide, sweet tea, lemonade, sweetened coffees, etc. can make a huge impact on your daily calorie intake. You may even lose weight just by eliminating these drinks. Going out for a bite to eat is something that's fun, social and can be included even on a weight loss plan. Be careful about the items you choose and try to pick a meal that will fit into your overall eating pattern. Restaurant foods can be higher in calories, fat and sodium compared to homemade foods. Many times, this is due to sauces, dressings, marinades or added oils or butter. Ask to have these things served on the side. Pass on the starch. Eating only protein and a vegetable may help keep your overall calorie levels low. Choose an appetizer portion or a kids portion to help minimize larger portion sizes that are served at restaurants. Limit or skip the alcohol and desserts. These can be significant sources of extra calories when you go out to eat. For example, a frozen margarita can have 675 calories and a slice of molten lava cake may be over 1,100 calories! Summary:","completion":"Before starting a weight loss program, consult your doctor or a registered dietitian to ensure the diet is safe and appropriate for your needs. To lose weight, aim to cut out or burn 500-1000 calories daily, but do not exceed this amount. Incorporate lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains into your meals, aiming for 1-2 servings of fruit, 3-4 servings of vegetables, and about 46 g of protein daily for women and 56 g for men. Ensure you stay hydrated, aiming for 64 oz of clear, sugar-free liquids daily, and avoid sweetened beverages. Choose healthy portion sizes and consider snacking on low-calorie options between meals. When eating out, select meals that fit into your eating plan, request sauces and dressings on the side, and opt for smaller portion sizes.

Possible answers: [i] no; [ii] yes;","completion":"The two questions you've presented have similar situations, but they are not exactly the same in meaning. For the first question, it appears that the girl is genuinely interested in being in a relationship with you, but she wants to wait for a better time to start a relationship. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as personal issues, work, or other factors that might be occupying her thoughts at the moment. She may need more time to settle her emotions and mental state before committing to a relationship, but her feelings for you seem to be true. On the other hand, the second question presents a girl who states she likes you, yet she is not emotionally available for a relationship. This can imply that although she may have feelings for you, she may not be in a mental or emotional state to invest in a relationship. The reasons for her emotional unavailability could be similar to the first, such as unresolved personal issues or other factors that might be affecting her overall well-being. While both questions tackle the same general theme of emotional readiness for a relationship, they do differ in the girls' attitudes towards the possibility of a serious commitment in the near future. In the first question, the girl acknowledges her feelings for you and wants to pursue a relationship, albeit at a more suitable time. In the second, the girl may not be certain of wanting a relationship, as her emotional unavailability may prevent her from being fully invested in a partnership. Considering the differences between these questions, the appropriate answer is [i] no. As for advice in handling each situation, here are my suggestions: 1. For the first question, it is essential to respect the girl's decision to wait until she believes it's the right time to jump into a relationship. Show understanding and patience, and assure her that you will be there to support her as she works through her personal challenges. Maintain open communication and keep a positive attitude, as this can help strengthen your bond when she finally feels ready to commit to a relationship. 2. For the second question, you can try communicating with her about her emotional unavailability and understand the possible reasons behind it. Although she may like you, it's essential to ascertain whether she is open to resolving her issues and becoming emotionally ready for a relationship. It is crucial to respect her boundaries, but if she expresses interest in growing as an individual and overcoming her emotional barriers, you can offer support and help her throughout this process. However, if she remains emotionally unavailable and is not sure about her feelings for you, it might be best to distance yourself from her emotionally for your own well-being until she feels ready to move forward."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Duffy has recently been drafted into the U.S. Army and fears of being sent to Iraq to fight where he might not return.Shortly after Steve joins up with Duff and T, he witnesses them kill a man in broad daylight in the middle of the street over 80. As the story unfolds, it is clear that Heather is being used and abused by her new boyfriend Todd, whom she is reluctant to leave for Steve. Later, Steve convinces Seb, who broke his ties with Duff's crew, to come out and party with Duff and the old gang for a night.Meanwhile, T insults two Korean men by calling them Gooks, who then fire an Uzi into Duff's car, killing Seb. Duff and T are later sold out to a crooked undercover cop and the older brother of the man who was previously shot over 80. They killed T and then a narcotics officer, and his team busted the door down and were all killed.In the final scene, Steve and Duff are driving along the street when a couple of young kids throw rocks at Duff's car causing the two get to out of the car and chase after them.

The graceful Art Nouveau dragon-fly entrances are just the most noticeable on a Metro system which celebrated its 100thanniversary by spending 30 million francs (PS2.9million) on making its stations works of art. On my way home I pass Bonne Nouvelle station in the heart of Paris's cinema district. There, during the cinema festival this summer, special lighting effects dot the platforms and films are projected onto the large advertising boards. More than anything the metro is efficient. \\"When I worked on line 4\\", says a retired driver, \\"we had exactly 30 minutes and 15 seconds to complete the journey. If it took any longer, they cut our pay.\\" But there are problems. Many Metro stations have too many stairs, and changing lines at big interchanges can be tiresome. Moscow Passengers carried per day: 9m Cost of ticket: 12p Length: 164 miles Lines: 11 Stations: 162 The first underground passage for the Moscow Metropolitan started in 1932. Three years later the trains started running. They haven't stopped since-- every 90 seconds or two minutes during rush hour, every five minutes the rest of the time, from 6 a.m. till 1 a. m. There may be a crowd of people but there is seldom a wait. The trains take you through spacious and spotless stations. For tourists it's a major sightseeing attraction: from Russian Art Deco to neo-classical, the Metro stations are not to be missed.

Second question: When was the first Dam built? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Select from: (i). no; (ii). yes;","completion":"First, I will answer the two questions provided: 1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of dams? Advantages of dams: - Flood control: Dams help regulate river flow, preventing flooding in downstream areas. - Water storage: Dams store water, which can be used for irrigation, human consumption, and industrial purposes. - Hydroelectric power generation: Dams convert the potential energy of water stored in a reservoir to electricity, providing a sustainable and renewable energy source. - Recreation: Many dams create large reservoirs or lakes, which are popular destinations for boating, fishing, and other forms of recreation. Disadvantages of dams: - Environmental impacts: Building and maintaining dams can disrupt local ecosystems, including fish migration, sediment flow, and water quality. - Displacement of people and communities: The creation of large reservoirs can result in the flooding of fertile agricultural lands, forests, and human settlements. - High costs and risks: Dams are expensive to build, maintain, and decommission, and their failure can have catastrophic consequences for downstream areas. - Sedimentation and reduced lifespan: Over time, sediment accumulates in reservoirs, reducing their storage capacity and water flow, eventually leading to a decline in the functionality of the dam. 2. When was the first dam built? The first known dam was built around 2900 BCE in Egypt. It was called the Sadd el-Kafara Dam and was constructed by ancient Egyptians in the Wadi Al-Garawi in southern Egypt. Now, to determine if the two questions are asking the same thing: Are these two questions asking the same thing? (i). no Explanation: The first question focuses on the advantages and disadvantages of dams, while the second question asks about the timeframe of the first dam construction.

On their way home, at a stop sign, Paige unbuckles her seatbelt to lean over and kiss Leo. At that very moment, a truck rams their car from behind and Paige crashes through the windshield. Both of them are rushed to the emergency room, and as Leo, in a voice-over talks about how \\"moments of impact help in finding who we are\\" the movie cuts to how Paige and Leo first met. The scenes of how they courted, became engaged and married at the Art Institute of Chicago and share a kiss under the Cloud Gate are interwoven with the present. When Paige regains consciousness, she thinks Leo is her doctor, having lost all memories of the past few years. When her wealthy parents, Bill and Rita Thornton, learn about this, they visit her. This is the first time that Leo meets them, and they do not appreciate Leo taking their daughter, and not being informed. Paige does not understand why he would not have met her parents, after having been married to her. She finds it even stranger that he did not know why either. Nor did she understand why she left law school, broke her engagement with her previous fiancé, Jeremy, and why she has not been in touch with her family and friends. Her parents insist on taking her home with them and Paige agrees, thinking she might have married Leo for some mutual benefit. She seeks evidence of the marriage. Just as she is about to leave, Leo comes running to play her a voice message in which she sounds very happy and romantic. Paige decides to go back with Leo, hoping it will help her regain her lost memory.

Article: Never use cold water, ice baths, or rubbing alcohol. A fever must be brought down gradually, and these methods will reduce body temperature too rapidly and may cause additional health problems. Moreover, rubbing alcohol comes with the additional risk of alcohol poisoning, which may occur if the alcohol is absorbed through the skin. Make sure your baby is dressed in lightweight fabrics, and keep layers to a minimum. Extra layers will likely trap the excess body heat produced by your baby's fever, causing your baby to stay too warm and encouraging the fever to continue rising. If your baby starts to shiver, however, you may need to add an extra layer to prevent him or her from catching a chill. A little dampness may not cause much damage, but a thoroughly drenched garment may cause your baby to catch a chill, which will only complicate your child's illness. Shivering is a tell-tale sign that your child needs additional coverage to stay warm. Blankets make a good choice because they are easier to remove and adjust than clothing. Never use heavy-weight blankets, however, since these will only cause your infant's body temperature to increase. It is a good sign if your child is still interested in playing, but too much physical activity will only cause the body’s internal temperature to continue climbing. Keep your baby indoors and relatively sedate. Preventing dehydration is an important part of fighting a fever. Infants under six months of age should only receive breast milk or formula, but you may consider supplementing this with small amounts of water, natural fruit juice, or gelatin and popsicles made with natural fruit juice to babies over six months.

Plants: Rocks are not typically formed from plant material. Instead, plants grow in soil, which is a mixture of organic matter and small rock particles. Thus, it's less likely for a rock sample to contain plants. 2. Minerals: Rocks are naturally occurring solid substances that are made of minerals. Minerals are the basic building blocks of rocks, and the proportion and arrangement of these minerals determine the rock's characteristics. Thus, a rock sample will most likely contain minerals. 3. Water: Although some rocks, like porous rocks, can contain water within their pores, it's not a guaranteed component of all rocks. So, a rock sample might contain water, but it's not the most likely option 4. Wood: Wood is a natural substance derived from plants, particularly from the trunk or branches of trees.

He couldn't take it any longer – he needed to change into something more comfortable, especially if he were to tackle the remainder of the day's tasks. As Bill slipped into his shorts, he immediately felt a sense of relief wash over him. The soft, lightweight fabric allowed his skin to breathe easily, and the freedom of movement made him feel as if he'd shed an invisible layer of stress along with his formal attire. The contrast between the coldness of his pant and the warmth from his shorts couldn't go unnoticed by Bill.

The feeling of the elements against his formerly covered skin sent a thrill through him, and he knew that he was ready to seize the day like never before.

Measure 1 cup (140 g) of sunflower seeds and 1 cup (140 g) of raw almonds into a large bowl. Pour enough water to cover the seeds and nuts by 2 inches (5 cm).","completion":"After soaking the sunflower seeds and almonds overnight, the next steps in making the vegan mock tuna salad is as follows: 1. Drain and Rinse: The following day, you want to ensure that all the water has been drained out from the soaked nuts and seeds. Additionally, it is essential to rinse them thoroughly under cold, running water to remove dirt and excess phytic acids that may have been released during soaking. 2. Prepping the ingredients: While the seeds and nuts are being rinsed, prepare the rest of the ingredients for the mock tuna salad. This may include finely dicing some celery, red onion, and pickles, and chopping some fresh parsley and/or dill. If you prefer a few other ingredients such as finely chopped bell peppers or grated carrot, feel free to add them. 3. Processing the seeds and nuts: Transfer the soaked and rinsed sunflower seeds and almonds into a food processor. Pulse the mixture until the seeds and nuts are broken down into a coarse, crumbly texture. Be careful not to overprocess the mixture, as you still want it to have some substance and a similar texture to traditional tuna salad. 4. Mixing the base: In a large mixing bowl, combine the processed sunflower seeds and almonds with the prepared vegetables (celery, onion, pickles, and any additional ingredients). Mix well to blend all the ingredients and create the foundation for the mock tuna salad. 5. Adding the dressing: In a separate small mixing bowl, whisk together some vegan mayonnaise, lemon juice, mustard, and apple cider vinegar. Season with salt, black pepper, and garlic powder (optional) to taste. Add any additional herbs or spices you like, such as onion powder, cayenne pepper, or paprika, based on your preferences. 6. Combining the salad: Pour the dressing over the sunflower seed and almond mixture in the large mixing bowl. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly coated in the dressing, adjusting seasoning if necessary. 7. Chilling the mock tuna salad: For the best flavor and consistency, cover the completed mock tuna salad and place it in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to an hour. This will allow the flavors to meld and create a more desirable taste experience. 8. Serving the vegan mock tuna salad: After chilling, give the salad a quick stir and taste to see if any additional seasoning is needed. Serve the vegan mock tuna salad on its own, in sandwiches, on top of a salad, stuffed into tomatoes, or wrapped in lettuce leaves. Enjoy your delicious and wholesome vegan mock tuna salad! And that's how you make a vegan mock tuna salad. With its base of sunflower seeds and almonds, this recipe provides a healthy and tasty alternative to traditional tuna salad while still delivering a familiar texture and flavor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the premise \\"In consequence of that quarrel, your mother very suddenly and hurriedly makes a new will. \\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Your mother cut you out of the will.\\" is true?","completion":"Based on the initial premise, \\"In consequence of that quarrel, your mother very suddenly and hurriedly makes a new will,\\" we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis \\"Your mother cut you out of the will\\" is true without additional information. While it is possible that your mother may have removed you from the will as a result of the quarrel, there are other potential reasons and considerations. Let's break down the statement and analyze it further to provide a more comprehensive explanation. 1. \\"In consequence of that quarrel\\": This indicates that there was an argument or disagreement which has led to certain consequences, one of which is your mother making a new will. However, it isn't explicitly stated who was involved in the quarrel, whether it was between you and your mother, your mother and someone else, or even a disagreement between several family members. 2. \\"Your mother very suddenly and hurriedly makes a new will\\": This part suggests that your mother made a quick decision to create a new will. However, the motivations behind her decision are not entirely clear, and there could be many other possible reasons for her actions beyond potentially cutting you out of the will. Possible scenarios include: A) Your mother decided to revise her will to include new beneficiaries, such as grandchildren, close friends, or charitable organizations that she had not previously considered. This could be due to her connection or contribution to her community that has been deepened or developed since the quarrel, for example. B) Your mother decided to change the distribution of assets among the existing beneficiaries, which could involve increasing or decreasing the shares. This could be a result of reconsidering her relationship with each beneficiary or her awareness of their individual needs. C) The quarrel led to your mother recognizing that her existing will is outdated or lacking in some way, and she feels an urgent need to rectify that. Perhaps there are unforeseen problems with her current will that, if left unresolved, could lead to conflict or unfair distribution among the beneficiaries. D) Your mother was involved in a quarrel with someone other than you, such as another family member, which led to her decision to revise the will. In this case, it is possible that the changes to the will do not affect you directly and that the hypothesis is not true. While it is possible that the quarrel led your mother to cut you out of the will, there is not enough evidence in the given premise to support this hypothesis exclusively. Further information about the quarrel and your mother's intentions and relationship dynamics would be necessary to determine whether or not the hypothesis is accurate."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As a result, the judge increased her sentence from 40 to 60 days. This action was upheld because, according to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, her statement suggested a lack of remorse, an attempt to avoid responsibility for her actions, and even a likelihood of repeating her illegal actions.

It is in the Levern Valley, 2 miles (3.2 km) southwest of Barrhead, 3.8 miles (6.1 km) south of Paisley, and 5.7 miles (9.2 km) south-southwest of Renfrew, at the southwestern fringe of the Greater Glasgow conurbation. Neilston is a dormitory village with a resident population of just over 5,000 people. Neilston is mentioned in documents from the 12th century, when the feudal lord Robert de Croc, endowed a chapel to Paisley Abbey to the North. Neilston Parish Church—a Category B listed building—is said to be on the site of this original chapel and has been at the centre of the community since 1163. Little remains of the original structure. Before industrialisation, Neilston was a scattered farming settlement composed of a series of single-storey houses, many of them thatched. Some domestic weaving was carried out using local flax. Water power from nearby streams ground corn and provided a suitable environment for bleaching the flax. The urbanisation and development of Neilston came largely with the Industrial Revolution. Industrial scale textile processing was introduced to Neilston around the middle of the 18th century with the building of several cotton mills. Neilston became a centre for cotton and calico bleaching and printing in the 18th century, which developed into a spinning and dying industry, and continued into the early 20th century. Although Neilston is known as a former milling village, agriculture has played, and continues to play, an economic role. The annual Neilston Agricultural Show is an important trading and cultural event for farmers from southwest Scotland each spring.Although heavy industry died out in the latter half of the 20th century, as part of Scotland's densely populated Central Belt, Neilston has continued to grow as a commuter village, supported by its position between Paisley and Glasgow, from roughly 1,000... contains an answer for the question: What major even brought urbanisation to the town that was a scattered farming settlement composed of a series of single-story houses?, what is it ?

In an opening scene before the credits, an assassin, Banat, is seen preparing a gun while a gramophone skips as it plays. The story that follows is the narrative of a letter from Howard Graham, an American armaments engineer, to his wife Stephanie. While journeying to the Soviet port of Batumi to return to the United States to complete his business with the Turkish Navy, Graham and his wife stop in Istanbul and are met by Kopeikin, a Turkish employee of Graham's company, who under the pretense of discussing business, takes Graham to a nightclub to introduce him to dancer Josette Maretl and her partner Gogo. Banat tries unsuccessfully to kill Graham during a magic act, shooting the magician instead. Graham is brought to the headquarters of the Turkish secret police for questioning, where Colonel Haki blames the assassination attempt on German agents seeking to delay the re-arming of Turkish ships. The colonel shows Graham a photograph of Banat, who he says was hired by a Nazi agent named Muller. Haki then orders Graham to travel secretly to Batumi aboard a tramp steamer, while Haki personally oversees the safe overland transit of Stephanie. Graham's fellow passengers include Josette and Gogo; Kuvetli, an ingratiating Turkish tobacco salesman; Professor Haller, an apolitical German archeologist; and the henpecked Matthews and his French wife. Josette sees that Graham is frightened, and not knowing that he is married, tries to become close to him. At an interim port call, Graham is made aware of the arrival of a new passenger by the annoying clamor of a gramophone, while Haller warns him that Kuvetli is not who he claims to be.

As the [Your Position] at [Your Company], my objective is to ensure that our company operates efficiently and complies with all relevant regulations and industry standards. In line with this goal, I am writing to address the topic of executing broker agreements and outlining the steps we can take in implementing, reviewing, and ensuring compliance with such agreements for the benefit and protection of our organization. An executing broker is a financial institution that engages in the buying and selling of securities on behalf of its clients. These agreements serve as contractual arrangements between our company and the executing brokers, stipulating the terms and conditions of the services provided, compensation structures, and resolving any potential disputes. To achieve the desired level of compliance and risk mitigation, I recommend adopting the following measures: 1. Drafting and reviewing executing broker agreements: To ensure adequate protection of our interests and adherence to applicable regulations, it is crucial to work closely with our legal team to draft comprehensive executing broker agreements. This process involves addressing critical elements such as: - Scope of services: Clearly define the brokerage services to be provided, including the types of securities to be traded, trading platforms to be used, and the responsibilities of each party. - Fees and commissions: Outline the fee structure for the services provided, specifying any commissions, discounts, or other charges that apply. - Confidentiality: Enforce protections to prevent the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive information and ensure compliance with privacy laws. - Termination clauses: Include provisions addressing the grounds and procedures for termination of the agreement, as well as potential penalties and consequences. - Dispute resolution: Establish a framework for addressing and resolving any conflicts that may arise between our company and the executing broker. 2. Due diligence and broker selection: Thoroughly assess the background, experience, and reputation of potential executing brokers to ensure they are competent and qualified. This process may involve obtaining references, reviewing regulatory filings, and evaluating their demonstrated expertise in the type of securities and markets we operate in. 3. Periodic monitoring and reporting: Establish an ongoing monitoring framework to assess the performance of executing brokers against predefined benchmarks and service level agreements (SLAs). This process can include auditing transaction records, tracking failed or delayed orders, and evaluating timeliness and accuracy of reporting. 4. Regular reviews and updates: Conduct regular reviews of executing broker agreements to ensure their continued relevance and compliance with evolving regulations and market conditions. This process should involve collaboration with our legal team and may require amendments or renegotiations of certain terms. 5. Training and awareness: Develop a robust training program to educate relevant staff members on the intricacies of executing broker agreements, applicable regulations, and best practices for managing relationships with such brokers. This process should encourage open communication and sharing of information to mitigate potential risks and optimize efficiency. Implementing these measures will help our organization maintain a high level of compliance and risk mitigation, while maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of our relationship with executing brokers. My team and I are ready to support these initiatives and ensure a comprehensive approach to executing broker agreements. Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me for clarification or additional information. Thank you for your attention to this essential matter. I look forward to working collaboratively with you to enhance our approach to executing broker agreements and continue driving our company's success.

Four variables are available to the photographer to obtain the desired effect: lighting, film speed, f-number (aperture size), and shutter speed (exposure time). The equation may be expressed as ratios, or, by taking the logarithm (base 2) of both sides, by addition, using the APEX system, in which every increment of 1 is a doubling of exposure; this increment is commonly known as a \\"stop\\". The effective f-number is proportional to the ratio between the lens focal length and aperture diameter, the diameter itself being proportional to the square root of the aperture area. Thus, a lens set to f/1.4 allows twice as much light to strike the focal plane as a lens set to f/2. Therefore, each f-number factor of the square root of two (approximately 1.4) is also a stop, so lenses are typically marked in that progression: f/1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22, 32, etc. Please answer a question about this article.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given an input list. A list contains several comma-separated items written within brackets. You need to return the position of all the alphabetical elements in the given list in order. Assume the position of the 1st element to be 1. Return -1 if no alphabetical element is in the list. Problem:['Z', 'm', 'f', '499', 'd', 'J', 'p', 'm', '2071', 'p', 'z', '2869', '1655', '3607', '8365', '8729', '2127', '8613', 'O', '4703', '5897', 'C', 'q', '4447'] Solution:","completion":"To solve this problem, we will iterate through the input list and check if an element is an alphabetical character or not. If it is, we will store its position in a new list. Finally, we will return the list of positions or return -1 if the list is empty. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this: 1. Initialize an empty list to store the positions of alphabetical elements. Let's call it \`alpha_positions\`. 2. Loop through the \`input_list\` using a for loop and enumerate function. The enumerate function will provide both the index and the element of \`input_list\` as we iterate through it. 3. Inside the for loop, check if the element is an alphabetical character using the isalpha() method. If it is, append the index+1 (as we're considering 1-based index) to the \`alpha_positions\` list. 4. After the for loop, check if the \`alpha_positions\` list is empty or not. If it's empty, return -1; otherwise, return the \`alpha_positions\` list. Here's the sample Python code to implement the above approach: \`\`\`python def find_alpha_positions(input_list): alpha_positions = [] for index, element in enumerate(input_list): if element.isalpha(): alpha_positions.append(index + 1) return -1 if not alpha_positions else alpha_positions input_list = ['Z', 'm', 'f', '499', 'd', 'J', 'p', 'm', '2071', 'p', 'z', '2869', '1655', '3607', '8365', '8729', '2127', '8613', 'O', '4703', '5897', 'C', 'q', '4447'] print(find_alpha_positions(input_list)) \`\`\` Solution: The output will be a list of positions of alphabetical elements: \`[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 19, 22, 23, 24]\`. If there were no alphabetical elements in the \`input_list\`, the output would be \`-1\`."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Although words related in form or meaning, e.g. Hellenist (Ancient Greek: Ἑλληνιστής, Hellēnistēs), have been attested since ancient times, it was J. G. Droysen in the mid-19th century, who in his classic work Geschichte des Hellenismus, i.e. History of Hellenism, coined the term Hellenistic to refer to and define the period when Greek culture spread in the non-Greek world after Alexander’s conquest. Following Droysen, Hellenistic and related terms, e.g. Hellenism, have been widely used in various contexts; a notable such use is in Culture and Anarchy by Matthew Arnold, where Hellenism is used in contrast with Hebraism. Q: Who wrote Culture and Anarchy?","completion":"Culture and Anarchy was written by Matthew Arnold, an influential British poet and cultural critic of the 19th century. The Hellenistic period covers the era from 323 BC to 31 BC, beginning with the death of Alexander the Great and ending with the final defeat of Cleopatra and Mark Antony by Octavian (later Emperor Augustus) in the Battle of Actium. This was a transformative period in the ancient world, characterized by significant changes in culture, politics, and society. In the realm of culture, the Hellenistic period was marked by a blend of Greek and Eastern influences, often referred to as Hellenization. Many non-Greeks in the eastern Mediterranean and Asia started to adopt Greek language, culture, and customs, resulting in a hybrid civilization. Some of the greatest advancements of this period included the works of historians, philosophers, and scientists. The famous library of Alexandria was also a testament to the intellectual fervor of the Hellenistic era. Key philosophers included Epicurus and Zeno of Citium, who founded the Epicurean and Stoic schools of philosophy respectively. In terms of politics, the Hellenistic world was characterized by Greek-style city-states (poleis) and monarchies, which were a departure from the previously dominant system of city-states in Classical Greece. These Hellenistic states included the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, the Seleucid Empire in Asia, and the Kingdom of Pergamon in Asia Minor. These monarchies often relied on a blend of Greek and local elites for their administration. Social changes were also significant. With the spread of Hellenistic culture, there was a shift towards a more cosmopolitan society. Social mobility increased, with non-Greeks being able to advance in society by adopting Greek customs. Despite this, there remained significant social and cultural divisions within these societies. The Hellenistic period was an era of significant ferment and change, both in the Greek heartland and in the wider Mediterranean and Near East. Despite its eventual supersession by the Roman Empire, the Hellenistic period left lasting legacies in many areas, including art, architecture, philosophy, science, and the organization of the state. In many ways, it can be seen as a critical bridge between the classical civilizations of Greece and Rome and the later civilizations of the Byzantine Empire and Islam."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If uh-huh yeah that was pretty good though really, can we conclude that \\"I thought it was pretty good!\\"? pick from the following. [I] yes [II] it is not possible to tell [III] no","completion":"Based on the provided statement \\"uh-huh yeah that was pretty good though really,\\" it seems that the person speaking had a positive impression of whatever they experienced. When translating this informal statement to \\"I thought it was pretty good!\\", there are several aspects to consider in order to reach a conclusion. 1. Context: Understanding the context of the conversation is crucial in determining whether it accurately reflects the individual's opinion. Knowing what the person is referring to and how the experience or event aligns with their expectations and preferences can provide valuable insights into the level of satisfaction they felt. 2. Level of enthusiasm: The use of informal phrases like \\"uh-huh\\" and \\"yeah\\" could signal that the person is excited or engaged with the subject matter. If they are enthusiastic and genuinely enjoyed the experience, their opinion would align with the statement \\"I thought it was pretty good!\\". 3. The tone of the statement: Since text does not always convey tone effectively, it is important to consider how the individual might have expressed themselves vocally. If their tone was upbeat, positive, or cheerful, then it would be safe to assume that their opinion aligns with the statement provided. However, if the statement was delivered in a sarcastic or indifferent tone, it could indicate a different perception. 4. Clarity in communication: The informal nature of the quote might also be an indicator that the individual was not entirely clear in expressing their opinion. In such cases, it might be prudent to seek further clarification before concluding that their perception aligns with \\"I thought it was pretty good!\\". With all these factors taken into account, it still proves difficult to confidently choose from the given options (yes, it is not possible to tell, or no) without additional context and information. While the initial impression seems positive, its informal nature may obscure the true meaning. Consequently, it may be wise to say [II] it is not possible to tell whether the statement aligns perfectly with the translation \\"I thought it was pretty good!\\" without further information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Six weeks after arriving in the United States, Hassan Abduraheem takes a seat in the back pew of Tar Wallet Baptist Church. Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman.

Premise: \\"That number is an output.\\" Hypothesis: \\"That number is the final output from months of study.\\" Step 1: Understand the premise and the hypothesis. The premise states that the number we are referring to is an output, but it does not provide any additional details about the nature of the output or the process that generated it. The hypothesis assumes that the number might be the final output specifically resulting from months of study, which introduces a new detail that is not present in the original premise. Step 2: Compare the premise to the hypothesis. While the premise and hypothesis do share a common element – the number being an output – the hypothesis adds extra information about the source and time duration of the study that the premise does not mention. Step 3: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis. Based on the comparison in step 2, the premise does not entail the hypothesis since it does not provide enough information to determine if the number is the final output specifically resulting from months of study.

If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: Does the meeting go pleasantly the whole time? Movie title: I'll Never Heil Again Movie plot: I'll Never Heil Again follows much the same pattern as You Nazty Spy!. It opens at the estate of King Herman the 6 7/8s, the deposed, abeit exiled king of Moronica. Meanwhile, Ixnay, Ohnay and Amscray, the war profiteers from the first film have realized they've made a monster out of Hailstone and his cronies in letting them be too power hungry. They decided that they have had enough of the dictator they put in power, and want to help Herman retake the throne. Herman refuses to accept thier help until he finds out that they were sorry about the whole scenario about wanting to start a war and are willing to pay the price for their actions. To this end, he sends his daughter, the princess Glinda (disguised as Matty Herring in the first film) to try and assassinate Hailstone using an explosive pool ball strategically positioned in Hailstone's billiard table. Dictator Moe Hailstone of Moronica enjoys a shave, and fights Curly and Larry for a turkey (that is a parody of Hitler possibly wanting control in Turkey. Larry parodies the attempts to control Greece by saying, \\"I'll wipe out grease.\\") The winner of that battle is a picture of Napoleon who grabs the bird from the bewildered Stooges. Glinda enters, and starts to place in Moe's mind the idea that his allies, the \\"Axle\\" partners, are plotting against him. After doing this she replaces the 13 ball on Hailstone's pool table with an exploding 13 ball and flees as Hailstone begins a pool game with his partners. Throughout the game the cue ball inexplicably defies the laws of physics avoiding the exploding ball by swerving around it and jumping over it colliding with Herring's head.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the movie plot provided, I'll Never Heil Again seems to be a comedic, satirical film that follows the adventures of King Herman and war profiteers Ixnay, Ohnay, and Amscray as they try to retake the throne in Moronica from Dictator Moe Hailstone. The film is a sequel to You Nazty Spy! and continues with a similar storyline that involves various twists, turns, and comedic moments. To answer the question about the meeting going pleasantly the whole time, it seems that there isn't a moment where the meeting is entirely pleasant. The film's climax appears to take place during a meeting between Hailstone and his \\"Axle\\" partners Chizzilini and the Bey of Rum, where Hailstone suspects that they are plotting against him. This is likely the result of Glinda's intervention, as she infiltrates Hailstone's estate and manipulates his thinking. The overall tone of the film seems to be farcical and satirical, with plenty of slapstick humor throughout. As for whether this film is worth investing in, it ultimately depends on your specific interests and preferences, as well as the potential audience for the film. If you are a fan of classic comedies, particularly those featuring the Three Stooges, or you enjoy politically themed satires, then this film may be of interest to you. However, you should also consider the film's potential for commercial success and profitability. Given the historical and political references present within the film, it is essential to retain this context in a contemporary setting. Viewers with a keen understanding and appreciation of history and political satire may find the film more appealing, but a broader audience might not resonate with the content or humor as easily. Before investing in the film proposal, you should consider several important factors, such as the film's production budget, marketing strategy, target demographic, and potential revenue streams (e.g., theatrical release, streaming platforms, DVD/Blu-ray sales, etc.). You may also want to consult with experts in the film industry, like producers, directors, or screenwriters, who can provide further insight and guidance on the project's potential success and return on investment. In conclusion, I'll Never Heil Again seems to be a comedy that mixes political satire, slapstick humor, and a farcical storyline. The film may appeal to certain audiences, particularly those with an appreciation of history and political themes, but its potential commercial success and profitability will depend on a variety of factors, including marketing strategy, budget, target demographic, and more. It is recommended that you carefully weigh these considerations before deciding to invest in the film proposal."},{"prompt":"Q: I heard that Carson licked my face when he was over last week.

Choose your answer from: (a). erosion. (b). deposition. (c). an earthquake. (d). volcanic activity.","completion":"The Grand Canyon is an example of (a) erosion. The Grand Canyon, located in Arizona, United States, is a landmark renowned worldwide for its overwhelming size and incised landscapes. Measuring over 277 miles (446 kilometers) long, up to 18 miles (29 kilometers) wide, and reaches depths over a mile (6,093 feet or 1,857 meters), Grand Canyon provides an excellent exhibition of geological layers and the effects of erosion. Erosion is a geological process where natural elements like wind, water, and ice wear away rocks and soil. Over millions of years, these elements remove and transport surface material slowly, shaping the landscape. The Grand Canyon, particularly, is a prime example of this process, primarily created by the erosive force of the Colorado River. This massive canyon's formation started around 70 million years ago. The Colorado River, along with its tributaries, started to carve its deep channel through layers of rock while the Colorado Plateau was gradually uplifted. Over the years, the relatively fast-flowing river scoured a steep and deep channel, which characterizes the Grand Canyon's shape today. Furthermore, the Colorado River's flow was not only responsible for the canyon's depth, but it also significantly contributed to its breadth. The heavy rains and melting snow would cause the river to overflow its banks, leading to erosion on the sides of the canyon, widening it over time. Apart from the Colorado River, other natural elements like wind and ice also proved to be significant erosive forces that carved the canyon. The process of erosion also revealed the Grand Canyon's iconic sequential rock layers. The exposed geological strata range in age over 2 billion years, from the Precambrian to the Cenozoic era, making the Grand Canyon a classic site for studying Earth's geological history. Each layer of rock represents a distinct timeframe in Earth's past and offers insights into the changing environmental conditions and life forms of that period. Deposit (b), another geological process, involves the accumulation or laying down of matter by natural processes. While deposition is relevant as it has likely occurred in the Colorado riverbed over time, it does not fundamentally define the Grand Canyon's formation. Earthquake (c) and volcanic activity (d) predominantly relate to tectonic processes, which also have shaped the Earth's landscapes drastically. However, these factors are not primarily responsible for the Grand Canyon's formation and distinctive characteristics. So, to sum it up, erosion, primarily owing to the Colorado River, is the defining geological process that shaped the Grand Canyon. It showcases an incredibly lengthy period of Earth's history, eroded and exposed for us to see today. This makes the Grand Canyon not just a stunning natural phenomenon, but also a valuable resource for geological and environmental studies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The author is providing a balanced review of the experience, highlighting the positive and negative aspects. Here is a breakdown of the sentiment for each part of the sentence: 1. \\"should jolt you out of your seat a couple of times\\" This part has a positive sentiment as it indicates that the experience will have exciting and thrilling moments capable of unexpectedly impacting the audience. 2. \\"give you a few laughs\\" This part also carries a positive sentiment as it suggests the experience will provide moments of humor, making it enjoyable for the audience. 3. \\"leave you feeling like it was worth your seven bucks\\" Again, a positive sentiment can be perceived from this part. It indicates that despite any shortcomings, the overall experience would be worth the money spent, offering a sense of satisfaction. 4. \\"even though it does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end\\" This part introduces a negative aspect to the sentiment.

But because the decision involves two different states and pending appeals, thing get convoluted in the way that only gay-marriage cases can. In today's court hearing, Broward Judge Dale Cohen dissolved the marriage of Heather Brassner and Megan Lade, who were joined in a 2002 civil union in Vermont. Brassner says she hasn't seen Lade for several years and filed for divorce in absentia. But \\"the court needed to recognize the relationship as an out-of-state civil union first, in order to grant it,\\" explains the local New Times. \\"This meant Cohen had to weigh in on Florida's same-sex marriage ban.\\" He did so, declaring the ban unconstitutional in August and then again, because of a legal technicality, on Dec. 8, reports the Miami Herald. The divorce hearing followed today. \\"This is a historic day,\\" says Brassner attorney Nancy Brodzki. \\"This is the first divorce for a same-sex couple. It will not be the last divorce.\\" Brodzki, though, expects Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi to appeal. And this is separate from a case on the federal level in which a judge declared the same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional but put a stay in place until Jan. 5. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who handles appeals in this region, will decide before then whether the stay will be extended. Expand this summary.","completion":"Sure, sweetie! So let's pretend there are two friends named Heather and Megan. They made a special promise to each other which is really important, just like when Mommy and Daddy promise that they will live together forever. They made this promise in a place called Vermont. Then, Heather couldn't find Megan for a long time, so she decided to break the special promise, just like how some people's mommies and daddies don't live together anymore. There's a slight problem though. They were in Florida, and Florida had a really old rule saying that two mommies or two daddies can't make the special promise to live together. However, Judge Dale, who is like a referee in a game, said that rule is not good and needs to be changed, so that Heather and Megan can break their promise properly. This was very important and made many people very happy, like their friend Nancy, who helps them talk to the judge.

It was the first Formula One car to use a carbon fibre composite monocoque, a concept which is now ubiquitous. Can we draw the following conclusion? The McLaren MP4/1 performed equally well during the 3 seasons it was used.","completion":"While it is true that the McLaren MP4/1 was used during the 1981, 1982, and 1983 Formula One seasons, it would be inaccurate to conclude that the car performed equally well across those three seasons. It is crucial to consider several factors such as the car's development, the competitiveness of rival teams, the performance of the drivers, and specific technical changes in the regulations. First of all, the McLaren MP4/1 underwent continuous development over the three seasons it competed in, with multiple updates and modifications made to the car. These improvements could have influenced the car's performance from year to year. For instance, the MP4/1B variant was introduced in 1982, and the MP4/1C and MP4/1E variants for the 1983 season, each with different upgrades in aerodynamics, suspension, and engine technology. Secondly, the competitiveness of rival teams should be taken into account. The Formula One landscape is always evolving, with teams making advancements and new competitors arriving. Over the three seasons that the McLaren MP4/1 competed, numerous other teams also made significant improvements to their cars, which could have affected the MP4/1's relative success on track. Some seasons might have been more competitive than others due to these continuous developments by competing teams. In terms of driver performance, multiple drivers piloted the McLaren MP4/1 over those three seasons, including John Watson, Andrea de Cesaris, Niki Lauda, and others. Each driver may have brought his own strengths and weaknesses, altering the car's performance accordingly. It is also worth noting that drivers might experience fluctuations in their performance due to factors such as their physical and mental health, experience, and adaptability to varying racing conditions. Lastly, changes in technical regulations can have a significant impact on a Formula One car's performance. The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), which governs the sport, periodically modifies the rules to encourage innovation, enhance safety or level the playing field among teams, among other reasons. Each season may, therefore, have unique challenges and requirements due to these changes, which can directly affect how well the McLaren MP4/1 (or any other car) performed. To summarize, it would be overly simplistic and inaccurate to draw the conclusion that the McLaren MP4/1 performed equally well during the 1981, 1982, and 1983 seasons. Differences in the car's development, competitiveness of rival teams, driver performance, and changes in technical regulations can all have considerable effects on a Formula One car's performance across multiple seasons."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles. Takeaways: Middle managers are one step above one-celled organisms. They can, and will try to get you to do non-role work, with no intention of ever paying you more. They key is to cut it off at the pass. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: When people got more work? Options: - Before people got fired - They got more work every week - After the transition inside a large company - not enough information A:","completion":"After the transition inside a large company"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a summary based on this article: RIYADH (Reuters) - Secretary of State John Kerry said on Monday there was \\"finite\\" time for talks between Iran and world powers on its disputed nuclear program to bear fruit, but gave no hint how long Washington may be willing to negotiate. Israel, Iran's arch-enemy and convinced Tehran is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons, has grown impatient with the protracted talks and has threatened pre-emptive war against Tehran if it deems diplomacy ultimately futile. Kerry's sentiment was largely echoed by Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, who said that the negotiations cannot be endless like the debates of philosophers over how many angels can fit on the head of a pin. \\"There is a finite amount of time,\\" Kerry, in the Saudi capital Riyadh on his first overseas trip as the top U.S. diplomat, said of the talks between a group of six world powers and Tehran, Saudi Arabia's main regional adversary. Kerry was speaking at a news conference with Prince Saud al-Faisal, who suggested Iran was not showing enough seriousness about the discussions, which he said \\"cannot go on forever\\". Iran was positive last week after talks with the powers in Kazakhstan about its nuclear work ended with an agreement to meet again. But Western officials said it had yet to do anything concrete to allay their concerns about its nuclear aspirations. The United States, China, France, Russia, Britain and Germany offered modest relief from economic sanctions in return for Iran reining in its most sensitive nuclear activity but made clear that no breakthrough was in the offing quickly. \\"We can't be like the philosophers who keep talking about how many angels a pinhead can hold,\\" Prince Saud al-Faisal said. \\"They (the Iranians) have not proved to anybody the urgency in their negotiation,\\" he said. \\"They reach common understanding only on issues that require further negotiation. And so this is what (has) worried us.\\" The United States and many of its allies suspect Iran may be using its civil nuclear program as a cover to develop atomic weapons, a possibility that Israel, which is regarded as the Middle East's only nuclear power, sees as a mortal threat. The possibility also deeply disturbs many Arab countries in the Gulf who, some analysts say, could choose to pursue their own nuclear programs if Iran were to acquire an atomic bomb, leading to a destabilizing arms race. In Vienna on Monday, the U.N. nuclear watchdog raised pressure on Iran to finally address suspicions that it has sought to design an atomic bomb, calling for swift inspector access to a military base where relevant explosives tests are believed to have been carried out. DIPLOMACY \\"FIRST CHOICE\\" Iran says its program is solely for peaceful purposes, such as generating electricity and making medical isotopes. Kerry, in the final stages of a nine-nation, 11-day trip that will also take him to Abu Dhabi and Doha, also had lunch with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss the possibility of reviving peace talks with Israel. Making his first trip abroad as secretary of state, Kerry also met Saudi Crown Prince Salman but a U.S. official said he would not see Saudi King Abdullah, who turns 90 this year. Kerry said a diplomatic solution on Iran is still preferred by the United States and Saudi Arabia. In 2008, Riyadh's ambassador to Washington said King Abdullah had repeatedly urged Washington to \\"cut off the head of the snake\\" by striking Iran's nuclear facilities, according to a U.S. diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks. \\"We both prefer - and this is important for Iranians to hear and understand - we both prefer diplomacy as the first choice, the preferred choice,\\" Kerry said. \\"But the window for a diplomatic solution simply cannot by definition remain open indefinitely.\\" Echoing Western concerns about a possible nuclear arms race in the Middle East in the event that Iran obtained a nuclear bomb, Kerry made a series of arguments for Gulf Arab countries not to pursue a military nuclear capability. These included standing U.S. policy to prevent Iran from acquiring such arms, the dangers of nuclear proliferation, the diversion of resources that could otherwise go to economic development, and the general trend by the United States and Russia toward reducing their doomsday arsenals. \\"The threat is not just the threat of a nuclear bomb, the threat is also the threat of a dirty bomb or of nuclear material being used by terrorists,\\" said Kerry. In December 2011, former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal said that if Tehran did gain nuclear weapons capability, Saudi Arabia should consider matching it. Riyadh has also announced plans to develop 17 gigawatts of atomic energy by 2032 as it moves to reduce domestic oil consumption, freeing up more crude for export.

Speaking to the IAEA's board of governors, Amano said Iran should grant access \\"without further delay\\" to the Parchin military complex, where the Islamic Republic is believed to have tested rockets. Since Iran has not provided such access to date, \\"The Agency therefore cannot conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is in peaceful activities,\\" Amano said. For about a decade, international observers have accused Iran of secretly pursuing a nuclear weapons program, which Iran consistently denies. Amano noted that Iran has recently begun installing IR-2m centrifuges at its fuel enrichment plant at Natanz, and that those high-speed devices that rotate to enrich uranium are more advanced than the previously-installed centrifuges.

On Wednesday, diplomats from the so-called P5+1 -- the six-nation diplomatic bloc consisting of the United States, France, Britain, Germany, China and Russia -- held secretive talks with Iranian representatives in Kazakhstan, and then announced future meetings on March 18 and April 5. The Islamic Republic already faces sanctions from the United Nations Security Council for violating a U.N. resolution forbidding it from enriching uranium. But Iran says since it signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it should be able to enrich uranium for peaceful energy needs. The IAEA was created in 1957 to promote \\"safe, secure and peaceful nuclear technologies,\\" its website says. Among its endeavors, the agency tries to verify that countries correctly and completely account for their nuclear material and activities. The agency says as of December 31, it had \\"safeguards agreements in force\\" with 179 official countries, and Taiwan. |||||","completion":"John Kerry, the Secretary of State, said that there was a limited amount of time for talks between Iran and world powers about Iran's nuclear program.

Two out-of-town photographers in Birmingham that day were Charles Moore, who had previously worked with the Montgomery Advertiser and was now working for Life magazine, and Bill Hudson, with the Associated Press. Moore was a Marine combat photographer who was \\"jarred\\" and \\"sickened\\" by the use of children and what the Birmingham police and fire departments did to them. Moore was hit in the ankle by a brick meant for the police. He took several photos that were printed in Life. The first photo Moore shot that day showed three teenagers being hit by a water jet from a high-pressure firehose. It was titled \\"They Fight a Fire That Won't Go Out\\". A shorter version of the caption was later used as the title for Fred Shuttlesworth's biography. The Life photo became an \\"era-defining picture\\" and was compared to the photo of Marines raising the U.S. flag on Iwo Jima. Moore suspected that the film he shot \\"was likely to obliterate in the national psyche any notion of a 'good southerner'.\\" Hudson remarked later that his only priorities that day were \\"making pictures and staying alive\\" and \\"not getting bit by a dog.\\"Right in front of Hudson stepped Parker High School senior Walter Gadsden when a police officer grabbed the young man's sweater and a police dog charged him. Gadsden had been attending the demonstration as an observer. He was related to the editor of Birmingham's black newspaper, The Birmingham World, who strongly disapproved of King's leadership in the campaign. Gadsden was arrested for \\"parading without a permit\\", and after witnessing his arrest, Commissioner Connor remarked to the officer, \\"Why didn't you bring a meaner dog; this one is not the vicious one.\\" Hudson's photo of Gadsden and the dog ran across three columns in the prominent position above the fold on the front page of The New York Times on May 4, 1963., what would be the answer ?

In the heart of this world lies Hyperion City, governed by a ruthless technocrat named Armand Cray. He is obsessed with power and weaves a web of deceit and corruption to maintain his iron grip over the city. Enter Race, the enigmatic and sharp-witted leader of a gang called \\"The Wolves\\", known for their excellent vehicle theft and driving abilities. The Wolves have been a thorn in Armand's side for years, continually undermining his hold over the city by stealing rare and powerful vehicles from his highest-ranking officials. However, when one of their own, Jax, is captured and held by Armand for leverage against The Wolves, the gang must devise a plan to save their friend. To do so, they must pull off their biggest heist yet, infiltrating Armand's heavily guarded mansion and taking his most prized possession - a prototype AI-controlled truck called \\"The Behemoth\\". The Behemoth is rumored to be nearly indestructible and capable of thwarting any pursuit or attack. Race is convinced that stealing this powerful machine will provide them the upper hand in their battle against Armand and help ensure Jax's safe return.

Their victory, however, is short-lived when they realize that not only was the truck a trap, but the power within The Behemoth was never real - it's just a myth engineered by Armand to frighten his enemies.

Using their cunning and unmatched driving abilities, they unite to overthrow Armand, rescue Jax, and bring hope back to Hyperion City.

She later finds Benigna in the orphanage's coal shed, but Benigna flees the scene. Later, SimÃ³n teaches Laura a game which grants its winner a wish. Clues lead the two to SimÃ³n's adoption file. SimÃ³n becomes angry, and says that his new friend told him that Laura is not his biological mother and that he is going to die soon. During a party at the orphanage, Laura and SimÃ³n argue, and SimÃ³n hides from her. While looking for him, she encounters a child wearing a sack mask who shoves her into a bathroom and locks her inside. Escaping, she finds that SimÃ³n is missing and she is unable to find him. That night Laura hears several loud crashes. Police psychologist Pilar (Mabel Rivera) suggests to Laura and Carlos that Benigna may have abducted SimÃ³n. Six months later, SimÃ³n is still missing. Searching in a Spanish city, Laura spots Benigna who is then struck and killed by a car. The police find evidence that Benigna once worked at the orphanage, and that she had a son named TomÃ¡s who was interned there. The children stole a mask that TomÃ¡s wore to conceal his deformed face. Embarrassed, TomÃ¡s hid in a local sea cave and was subsequently drowned. His death occurred weeks after Laura was adopted. Laura asks for the assistance of a medium named Aurora (Geraldine Chaplin) in the search for SimÃ³n. Aurora conducts a seance during which she claims to see the ghosts of the orphans crying for...

The context provided emphasizes the importance of citing the author's last name in the MLA (Modern Language Association) style, which is a widely-used citation format in academia. This citation method integrates source information within the text through parenthetical citations and directs readers to more detailed entries in the Works Cited page placed at the end of the paper. There are various aspects that support the hypothesis that MLA style identifies the sources used for a paper: 1. In-text citations: This fundamental feature of MLA style allows authors to incorporate brief citations within their text, usually by citing the author's last name and the page number (if available) where the information was found. This practice ensures that readers can quickly locate and cross-reference the cited sources while reading through the paper. 2. Works Cited page: The comprehensive list of sources used in a paper, formatted according to MLA guidelines, offers readers a detailed view of the materials an author has consulted and integrated into their research. The clear organization of this page, which includes features like alphabetical ordering and defined formatting rules for various types of sources (books, articles, websites, etc.), facilitates easy identification and accessibility to the original sources. 3. Academic integrity: By consistently using a standardized citation format like MLA, authors maintain a high level of academic integrity, preventing any instances of unintentional plagiarism or misattribution of ideas. The adherence to these guidelines demonstrates an author's careful consideration and respect for the work of others, which is a fundamental principle of academia. 4. Consistency: MLA style offers a structured and systematic approach to citing sources, leading to consistency within and between different papers. This uniformity makes it easier for readers to understand and navigate through the cited materials, improving the overall legibility and accessibility of academic texts. In conclusion, the hypothesis that MLA citation style identifies the sources used for a paper is evident and supported by the context provided. The use of the MLA format in academic papers allows for a consistent, ethical, and organized means of integrating source materials to maintain academic integrity and promote comprehensibility for readers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jess Rowles, 24, was left needing stitches to her lip and chin after allegedly being punched in the face by a taxi driver following a night out in Bristol on July 27. These photos show the horrific injuries a woman suffered after being punched in the face by a rogue taxi driver following a night out. Jess Rowles, 24, said she was assaulted by the taxi driver in an 'isolated' street after she told him she didn't have enough money to pay the fare as he took her home on July 27. She had enjoyed several drinks with a friend in Bristol city centre prior to the incident and was on her way home at about 2.30am when the taxi driver allegedly locked the doors before driving to the random street. The insurance company worker said she realised during the drive home she didn't have enough money and asked the taxi driver to stop off at a cash point. However, he ended up dropping the two young women off in the secluded street – miles from home – before allegedly assaulting Miss Rowles. She said: 'We had £14 but he wanted £20 so we asked him to take us to a cash point. 'He refused, locked us in the cab and said he was going to take us back to where he collected us. 'But in fact he dumped us in (another road) which was dark, but to be honest we were just glad to be able to get out the cab. 'Then as we walked away he got something out the boot of his car and sprayed us with water. 'I went back to ask him why he had done that and it felt like he punched me in the face. 'There was certainly a lot of force because it knocked me to the ground and I hit my face on the kerb.' The young women, from Shirehampton, Bristol, called the emergency services and police officers took Miss Rowles to hospital where she had several stitches to her lip and chin. However, the cabbie - which the girls believe was run by Bristol City Council and had an Asian driver who was in his 20s– drove off and police have been unable to track it down. Miss Rowles said she told the taxi driver she didn't have enough money to pay the fare as he took her home in Shirehampton, Bristol, and asked to be driven to a cash point. It was then he apparently punched her in the face. Avon and Somerset Police were informed of the incident but have now closed the investigation due to lack of evidence, infuriating Miss Rowles, who thinks they have done the 'bare minimum'. A force spokesman said: 'A thorough and detailed investigation was carried out based on the limited information and evidence available. 'CCTV was checked but there was no film showing the incident or a good shot of the actual taxi. 'House-to-house investigations were also carried out and private CCTV checked but no relevant footage was found. 'Because Miss Rowles has a right to complain if she feels we have not carried out a thorough investigation, this has been reported to the force's professional standards department to review.' Ms Rowles has now gained the support of her local MP, Wayne Harvey, who said: 'Seeing the photos of this horrific, violent and cowardly attack on Jess has left me feeling sickened. Avon and Somerset Police has closed an investigation into the case which Miss Rowles blasted them for, saying they had done the 'bare minimum'. She now has the support of MPs who said the attack was 'cowardly' 'This is the second attack that has been brought to my attention regarding taxi drivers becoming violent and assaulting their passengers. 'With all the CCTV we have in Bristol this should be being picked up.' MP Charlotte Leslie added: 'Taxis should be seen as a place of safety for people, not a place where you risk being assaulted.

Given the question: An apprenticeship is a form of on-the-job training that combines workplace experience and classroom learning. It can last anywhere from one to six years, but four years is typical for most. An apprentice spends most of the time in a workplace environment learning the practical skills of a career from a journeyman--someone who has done the job for many years. The rest of the apprentice's time is spent in a classroom environment learning the theoretical skills the career requires. Being an apprentice is a full-time undertaking. One of the advantages of apprenticeship is that it does not cost apprentices anything. The companies that hire them pay for school. What's more, it offers apprentices an \\"earn while you learn\\" opportunity. They usually start out at half the pay of a journeyman, and the pay increases gradually as they move further along in the job and studies. Near the end of the apprenticeship, their wages are usually 90 percent of what a journeyman would receive. Apprenticeship also pays off for employers. It can offer employers a pool of well-trained workers to draw from. Despite the advantages, apprentices are usually required to work during the day and attend classes at night, which leaves little time for anything else. Sometimes, they might be laid off if business for the employers is slow. Once they have completed the apprenticeship and become journeymen, they receive a nationally recognized and portable certification and their pay also increases again. Some journeymen continue employment with the companies they apprenticed with; others go onto different companies or become self-employed contractors. What is the tone of the writer in this passage?

At a meeting conducted in the temple, the villagers resolved to close down liquor dens and ban alcohol in the village. Since these resolutions were made in the temple, they became, in a sense, religious commitments. Over thirty liquor brewing units voluntarily closed their establishments. Those who did not succumb to social pressure were forced to close their businesses when the youth group smashed their premises. The owners could not complain as their businesses were illegal. Once 3 drunken villagers were tied to pillars and then flogged, personally by Hazare with his army belt. He justified this punishment by stating that \\"rural India was a harsh society\\", and that Doesn't a mother administer bitter medicines to a sick child when she knows that the medicine can cure her child? The child may not like the medicine, but the mother does it only because she cares for the child. The alcoholics were punished so that their families would not be destroyed.

It was decided to ban the sale of tobacco, cigarettes, and beedies (an unfiltered cigarette where the tobacco is rolled in tendu also known as Diospyros melanoxylon leaves instead of paper) in the village. To implement this resolution, the youth group performed a unique \\"Holi\\" ceremony twenty two years ago. The festival of Holi is celebrated as a symbolic burning of evil. The youth group brought all the tobacco, cigarettes, and beedies from the shops in the village and burnt them in a Holi fire. Tobacco, cigarettes, or beedies are no longer sold. Answer this question \\"What does alcohol prohibition have to do with him?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"Alcohol prohibition has to do with Hazare because he and the youth group took up the issue of alcoholism to create positive change in the village. They helped close down liquor businesses and made banning alcohol a religious commitment. Hazare even punished some drunk villagers to protect their families. He also appealed to the government to create a law about alcohol prohibition. This shows that Hazare played a significant role in addressing the issue of alcoholism in the village."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q: Grammatical error correction (GEC) is a challenging task due to the variability of the type of errors and the syntactic and semantic dependencies of the errors on the surrounding context. Most of the grammatical error correction systems use classification and rule-based approaches for correcting specific error types. However, these systems use several linguistic cues as features. The standard linguistic analysis tools like part-of-speech (POS) taggers and parsers are often trained on well-formed text and perform poorly on ungrammatical text. This introduces further errors and limits the performance of rule-based and classification approaches to GEC. As a consequence, the phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) approach to GEC has gained popularity because of its ability to learn text transformations from erroneous text to correct text from error-corrected parallel corpora without any additional linguistic information. We model our GEC system based on the phrase-based SMT approach. However, traditional phrase-based SMT systems treat words and phrases as discrete entities. We take advantage of continuous space representation by adding two neural network components that have been shown to improve SMT systems BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 . To train NNJM, we use the publicly available implementation, Neural Probabilistic Language Model (NPLM) BIBREF14 . The latest version of Moses can incorporate NNJM trained using NPLM as a feature while decoding. Similar to NNGLM, we use the parallel text used for training the translation model in order to train NNJM. We use a source context window size of 5 and a target context window size of 4. We select a source context vocabulary of 16,000 most frequent words from the source side. The target context vocabulary and output vocabulary is set to the 32,000 most frequent words. We use a single hidden layer to speed up training and decoding with an input embedding dimension of 192 and 512 hidden layer nodes.

Its policy of neutrality was internationally recognised at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Only in 2002 did Switzerland become a full member of the United Nations and it was the first state to join it by referendum.

What was Switzerland the first state to join the U.N. by?","completion":"Switzerland was the first state to join the United Nations (U.N.) by a referendum. This means that the Swiss citizens were given the opportunity to vote directly on whether their country should become a full member of the U.N. This decision-making process was not made by political representatives or government elites alone, but involved the entire Swiss population eligible to vote, reflecting the principles of direct democracy in the country. The referendum took place in March 2002, and the Swiss people voted in favor of joining the U.N., with 55% supporting the membership. This marked a significant change in Switzerland's long-standing policy of neutrality and non-membership in major international organizations. Upon the vote, Switzerland officially became the 190th member of the United Nations on September 10, 2002. The decision to hold a referendum reflects Switzerland's strong tradition of direct democracy, where citizens play an active role in decision-making processes. This form of governance allows the population to have a direct say in shaping the nation's policies and actions, fostering a greater sense of ownership and involvement in political decisions. Switzerland's history of neutrality and its decision to join the U.N. by a referendum highlight the country's unique approach to international relations.

Write an article with the title: \\"Can massage reduce anxiety?\\"","completion":"Title: Can Massage Reduce Anxiety? Introduction: (Step 1: Introduce the topic, mention the prevalence of anxiety, and the importance of finding effective solutions.) Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health issues worldwide, affecting millions of people each year. As we continue to seek out effective remedies to alleviate the symptoms and enhance well-being, one natural approach that has gained popularity in recent years is massage therapy. This article delves into the question: can massage truly reduce anxiety? The Science behind Massage Therapy: (Step 2: Explain the science behind massage therapy, focusing on the physiological effects.) Massage therapy works primarily by applying pressure, kneading, and manipulating soft tissue and muscle structures within the body. These techniques help to increase blood circulation, relax muscles, and improve lymphatic flow, which in turn may aid in enhancing an individual's overall health. Research on Massage and Anxiety: (Step 3: Summarize a few relevant studies exploring the connection between massage and anxiety reduction.) Several research studies have explored the relationship between massage therapy and anxiety reduction. A meta-analysis published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry indicated that massage therapy shows significant potential for reducing anxiety in various populations, including those with chronic medical conditions or undergoing medical procedures. Furthermore, a study published in the Journal of Psychosomatic Obstetrics and Gynecology revealed that pregnant women who received massages experienced decreased anxiety, stress, and cortisol levels. These studies, among others, suggest that massage therapy may indeed help alleviate anxiety. How Massage May Combat Anxiety: (Step 4: Describe potential mechanisms through which massage may reduce anxiety.) There are several proposed mechanisms through which massage therapy may reduce anxiety: 1. Increased relaxation: Massage may physically relax tight muscles, leading to an increased sense of overall relaxation, which can mentally decrease anxiety levels. 2. Improved sleep: Massage therapy has been shown to improve sleep quality, and adequate restorative sleep can help minimize anxiety symptoms. 3. Release of endorphins: Massage has been found to stimulate the production of endorphins, which can boost mood and reduce feelings of anxiety. 4. Mindfulness and body awareness: Massage promotes a sense of connection between mind and body, which may help individuals better respond to and manage anxiety triggers. Limitations and Considerations: (Step 5: Acknowledge limitations in the evidence and discuss considerations for those interested in trying massage therapy for anxiety.) It is important to note that the effect of massage on anxiety may vary depending on the individual, the techniques used, and the frequency and duration of sessions. Additionally, more research is needed to establish the long-term benefits of massage therapy in treating anxiety disorders. Nonetheless, given the potential benefits, as well as the non-invasive and relaxing nature of massage therapy, individuals struggling with anxiety may find it a helpful adjunct or alternative to traditional interventions. Conclusion: (Step 6: Summarize the main points and provide a final answer to the question posed in the title.) In conclusion, massage therapy shows promise as an intervention for reducing anxiety. While it should not be considered a standalone treatment, especially in cases of severe anxiety disorders, incorporating massage therapy into a holistic approach to stress management and mental health care may prove to be beneficial for many individuals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country.

One of the most significant aspects of making your writing clear and coherent is by using appropriate transition words that help establish relationships between ideas and logically guide the reader from one point to another. Among the many options available, the word \\"therefore\\" stands out as a powerful tool for showing cause and effect in a way that strengthens sentence flow. This article discusses the importance of using \\"therefore\\" in your writing to optimize sentence flow and clarity. Understanding Cause and Effect: The Role of \\"Therefore\\" Cause and effect relationships are a natural part of any discourse, as they help establish the reasoning behind a particular claim or argument. Essentially, the word \\"therefore\\" is crucial in demonstrating how one statement leads logically to another, creating a coherent and persuasive piece of writing. Step 1: Identify Instances for Cause and Effect Before integrating \\"therefore\\" into your writing, it's important to pinpoint the moments where cause and effect relationships occur. These can be easily identified by examining your text, searching for instances where an idea, fact, or statistic leads to a specific conclusion or outcome.

By using \\"therefore\\" consistently, you can reduce redundancy and maintain clarity in your writing. Step 3: Improve Sentence Flow through Integration Once you have identified the instances that require cause and effect transitions and decided to use \\"therefore,\\" it's time to integrate the word into your sentences in a way that enhances flow.

Vastuullisuus tarkoittaa sitä, että liiketoiminnan vaikutuksia ympäristöön ja yhteiskuntaan arvioidaan aktiivisesti sekä niitä pyritään vähentämään tai kompensoimaan. Yritykset voivat asettaa itselleen esimerkiksi ympäristötavoitteita, sosiaalisia tavoitteita ja taloudellisia tavoitteita, jotka ohjaavat toimintaa kohti kestävää kehitystä. Yrityksen vastuullisuus voi kattaa monia eri osa-alueita, kuten energiatehokkuuden, työhyvinvoinnin, yhdenvertaisuuden, eettisen toimintakulttuurin ja paikallisen yhteiskunnan hyvinvointiin panostamisen. Yritysten vastuullisuuden mittaaminen voi olla haasteellista, sillä vastuullisuus voi olla moniulotteista ja eri asiat painottuvat eri yritysten kohdalla eri tavoin. Yksi tapa arvioida yrityksen vastuullisuutta on ISO 26000 -standardi, joka tarjoaa viitekehyksen erilaisten vastuullisuuden osa-alueiden huomioimiseen. Myös yritysten raportointia ja ulkopuolisia arvioitsijoita voidaan käyttää vastuullisuuden mittaamiseen ja vertailuun. Yritysten vastuullisuutta voi edistää monin eri keinoin, esimerkiksi kansallisten ja kansainvälisten lakien ja säädösten avulla, jotka edellyttävät vastuullista toimintaa ja raportointia. Myös kuluttajilla on suuri vaikutusvalta yrityksiin, sillä kuluttajien ostopäätöksillä voidaan ohjata yrityksiä kestävämpiin suuntiin. Kestävää ja vastuullista liiketoimintaa tukevat myös erilaiset verkostot ja järjestöt, kuten YK:n Global Compact -aloite, joka vaalii kymmentä periaatetta vastuullisen yritystoiminnan edistämiseksi. Myös yritysten välisillä kumppanuuksilla voidaan lisätä vastuullisuutta ja kestävää kehitystä. Yhteenvetona voidaan todeta, että yritysten vastuullisuuden tukeminen ja edistäminen edellyttää monenlaisten toimijoiden yhteistyötä sekä yritysten oman sitoutumisen lisäksi myös lainsäädännön, kuluttajien, verkostojen ja järjestöjen toimet. Vastuullinen yritystoiminta on paitsi eettinen valinta, myös avain kestävään tulevaisuuteen ja kilpailukykyyn."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I read this background article the other day: The temperature of a body of water directly affects the amount of dissolved oxygen it can hold. Following Henry's law, as water becomes warmer, oxygen becomes less soluble in it. This property leads to daily anoxic cycles on small geographic scales and seasonal cycles of anoxia on the larger scale. Thus, bodies of water are more vulnerable to anoxic conditions during warmest period of the day and during the summer months. This problem can be further exacerbated in the vicinity of industrial discharge where warm water used to cool machinery is less able to hold oxygen than the basin to which it is released. I am facing a new situation today: Dan visited Twin lakes every year. The interesting fact about them wast that, while Twin I had a very cold water all year, Twin II lake had very warm waters year round.

First, let's look at the problem: 269*t + 119*t + 1164 = 97*t We want to find the value of t, which is like a mystery number that we'll find by solving this puzzle. Step 1: Combine the t's on the left side of the equation 269*t + 119*t = (269 + 119) * t = 388*t So now the problem looks like this: 388*t + 1164 = 97*t Step 2: Move all the t's to one side of the equation To do this, let's get rid of 97*t from the right side. We'll subtract 97*t from both sides, like this: 388*t - 97*t + 1164 = 97*t - 97*t This leaves us with: 291*t + 1164 = 0 Step 3: Remove the 1164 from the left side Now, we need to get rid of the 1164 on the left side. We'll do this by subtracting 1164 from both sides: 291*t + 1164 - 1164 = 0 - 1164 This leaves us with: 291*t = -1164 Step 4: Solve for t Finally, we just need to find the value of our mystery number, t. To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 291: 291*t / 291 = -1164 / 291 t = -4 So, the value of t that solves this problem is -4!

Queen are a British rock band that formed in London in 1970. Their classic line-up was Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (lead guitar, vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals), and John Deacon (bass guitar). Queen's earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock, into their music. On 25 and 26 April, May and Taylor appeared on the eleventh series of American Idol at the Nokia Theatre, Los Angeles, performing a Queen medley with the six finalists on the first show, and the following day performed \\"Somebody to Love\\" with the 'Queen Extravaganza' band. Queen were scheduled to headline Sonisphere at Knebworth on 7 July 2012 with Adam Lambert before the festival was cancelled. Queen's final concert with Freddie Mercury was in Knebworth in 1986. Brian May commented, \\"It's a worthy challenge for us, and I'm sure Adam would meet with Freddie's approval.\\" Queen expressed disappointment at the cancellation and released a statement to the effect that they were looking to find another venue. Queen + Adam Lambert played two shows at the Hammersmith Apollo, London on 11 and 12 July 2012. Both shows sold out within 24 hours of tickets going on open sale. A third London date was scheduled for 14 July. On 30 June, Queen + Lambert performed in Kiev, Ukraine at a joint concert with Elton John for the Elena Pinchuk ANTIAIDS Foundation. Queen also performed with Lambert on 3 July 2012 at Moscow's Olympic Stadium, and on 7 July 2012 at the Municipal Stadium in Wroclaw, Poland. On 12 August 2012, Queen performed at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. The performance at London's Olympic Stadium opened with a special remastered video clip of Mercury on stage performing his call and response routine during their 1986 concert at Wembley Stadium. Following this, May performed part of the \\"Brighton Rock\\" solo before being joined by Taylor and solo artist Jessie J for a performance of \\"We Will Rock You\\". On 20 September 2013, Queen + Adam Lambert performed at the iHeartRadio Music Festival at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. Queen + Adam Lambert toured North America in Summer 2014 and Australia and New Zealand in August/September 2014. In an interview with Rolling Stone, May and Taylor said that although the tour with Lambert is a limited thing, they are open to him becoming an official member, and cutting new material with him. In November 2014 Queen released a new album Queen Forever. The album is largely a compilation of previously-released material but features three new Queen tracks featuring vocals from Mercury with backing added by the surviving members of Queen. One new track, \\"There Must Be More To Life Than This\\", is a duet between Mercury and Michael Jackson. In 2016, the group embarked across Europe and Asia on the Queen + Adam Lambert 2016 Summer Festival Tour. This included closing the Isle of Wight Festival in England on 12 June where they performed \\"Who Wants to Live Forever\\" as a tribute to the victims of the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida earlier that day. On 12 September they performed at the Park Hayarkon in Tel-Aviv, Israel for the first time in front of 58,000 people. As part of the Queen + Adam Lambert Tour 2017-2018, the band toured North America in the summer of 2017, toured Europe in late 2017, before playing dates in Australia and New Zealand in February and March 2018.","completion":"This text is about the British rock band Queen.

Assur-Uballit I Which language is this?","completion":"Assur-Uballit I is not a language but rather refers to a historical figure who was an Assyrian king. He reigned from 1365 BC to 1330 BC during the Middle Assyrian Empire period. The name Assur-Uballit derives from Assur, which denotes the Assyrian god Assur, and \\"uballit\\" which means \\"has given life\\" in the ancient Akkadian language. This means that the king's name can be translated as \\"Assur has given life.\\" The Akkadian language was a Semitic language widely spoken in ancient Mesopotamia, which includes present-day Iraq, Syria, and parts of Turkey and Iran. The language's history can be divided into three main periods: Old Akkadian (2500 BC - 1950 BC), Middle Akkadian (1950 BC - 1530 BC), and Neo-Akadian (1530 BC - 612 BC). The last form of Akkadian is also known as Assyrian due to its predominance in the Assyrian Empire. Assur-Uballit I is known for his significant achievements, including expanding Assyria's territories. His reign saw the Assyrians regain autonomy and assert their independence from the Mitanni Kingdom, their previous overlords. Assur-Uballitaire's diplomatic and military successes laid a solid foundation for the growth and eventual dominance of the Assyrian Empire. In addition, Assur-Uballit I initiated a number of building projects which enhanced the infrastructure, particularly in the Assyrian capital of Assur. He was responsible for the construction of numerous temples, palaces, and other monumental buildings, contributing to the city's grandeur and prosperity.

News article: FILE - In this undated file photo released by Xinhua News Agency, a Chinese H-6K bomber patrols the islands and reefs in the South China Sea. The China Daily newspaper reported Saturday, May 19, 2018... (Associated Press) FILE - In this undated file photo released by Xinhua News Agency, a Chinese H-6K bomber patrols the islands and reefs in the South China Sea. The China Daily newspaper reported Saturday, May 19, 2018... (Associated Press) BEIJING (AP) — The Chinese air force has landed long-range bombers for the first time at an airport in the South China Sea, a state newspaper said Saturday, in a move likely to further fuel concerns about Beijing's expansive claims over the disputed region. The China Daily newspaper reported that the People's Liberation Army Air Force conducted takeoff and landing training with the H-6K bomber in the South China Sea. China is pitted against smaller neighbors in multiple disputes in the South China Sea over islands, coral reefs and lagoons in waters crucial for global commerce and rich in fish and potential oil and gas reserves. A statement from the Defense Ministry late Friday said the exercise was conducted on an island reef, but it did not specify when or where, saying only that it took place recently at a \\"southern sea area.\\" It involved several H-6Ks taking off from an air base and making a simulated strike against sea targets before landing, the ministry said. Wang Mingliang, a military expert, was quoted in the statement as saying that the takeoff and landing exercises will help the air force improve its \\"real combat ability against all kinds of marine security threats.\\" The U.S. criticized the move. \\"The United States remains committed to a free and open Indo-Pacific,\\" a Pentagon spokesman, Marine Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, said in an email. \\"We have seen these same reports and China's continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea only serves to raise tensions and destabilize the region.\\" The Washington-based Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, using Chinese social media posts, identified the location of the exercise as Woody Island, China's largest base in the Paracel Islands. With a combat radius of nearly 1,900 nautical miles (3,520 kilometers), the H-6K bomber would put all of Southeast Asia in its range from Woody Island, AMTI said. Farther south in the Spratly group of islands, China has constructed seven man-made islands and equipped them with runways, hangers, radar and missile stations, further cementing its vast territorial claims in the busy waterway. The U.S. and others accuse Beijing of militarizing the region to bolster its claims. Adm. Phil Davidson, the new head of the Pacific Command, said recently that China had reached the tipping point in its control over the South China Sea. China's South China Sea bases can be used to challenge the U.S. presence in the region, \\"and any forces deployed to the islands would easily overwhelm the military forces of any other South China Sea-claimants,\\" Davidson wrote in recent testimony to Congress. ||||| Exercise described by air force as preparation for ‘the battle’ for the disputed waters China’s air force has landed bombers on islands and reefs in the South China Sea as part of a training exercise in the disputed region, it said in a statement. Several bombers of various types – including the long-range, nuclear strike-capable H-6K – carried out landing and take off drills at an unidentified island airfield after carrying out simulated strike training on targets at sea, the Chinese airforce said. “A division of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) recently organised multiple bombers such as the H-6K to conduct take-off and landing training on islands and reefs in the South China Sea in order to improve our ability to ‘reach all territory, conduct strikes at any time and strike in all directions’,” it said. The statement said the pilot of the H-6K bomber conducted assault training on a designated sea target and then carried out take-offs and landings at an airport in the area, describing the exercise as preparation for “the west Pacific and the battle for the South China Sea”. China deploys cruise missiles on South China Sea outposts – reports Read more The notice, published on the PLAAF’s Weibo microblogging account, did not provide the precise location of the exercise. The US has dispatched warships to disputed areas of the South China Sea in a bid to challenge China’s extensive sovereignty claims in the territory, which is also subject to claims by Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Brunei and Malaysia. The waters are vital global shipping routes and contain what are believed to be significant oil and natural gas deposits. “The United States remains committed to a free and open Indo-Pacific,” Pentagon spokesman Lt Col Christopher Logan said. “We have seen these same reports and China’s continued militarisation of disputed features in the South China Sea only serves to raise tensions and destabilise the region.” Wang Mingliang, a defence expert cited in the Chinese statement, said the takeoff and landing exercises will help the air force “strengthen its combat capability to deal with maritime security threats”. The move comes weeks after US network CNBC reported that China had installed anti-ship and air-to-air defences on outposts in the Spratly Islands that are also claimed by Vietnam and the Philippines, citing sources close to US intelligence. Washington warned Beijing would face unspecified “consequences” over its militarisation of the South China Sea, and said it had raised the issue with China. In an analysis published on its website, a US thinktank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the location of the runway was believed to be Woody Island, China’s largest base in the Paracel Islands, which is also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan. China has engaged in years of land-reclamation efforts on reefs it controls in the region and built both civilian and military facilities in the contested area. Chinese military facilities include air bases, radar and communications systems, naval facilities and defensive weaponry including landing strips able to accommodate military planes.

Only the descendants of Seth would be left to restore mankind.The story begins with Noah shown as a young boy, standing on a hill with his father Lamech . Lamech is about to give him a precious heirloom - the skin of the original serpent from Eden, which has been passed down for many generations. Suddenly, a large crowd approaches, led by a young king named Tubal-Cain (Ray Winstone), who wants to make that hill into a mine. Seeing Lamech, Tubal-Cain kills him and takes the serpent's skin, while Noah runs.Many years pass.

The initial equation you have is: -33*a + 3 = -32*a The goal here is to get all the terms including a on one side of the equation and the constant on the other side. Let's start by adding 33a on both sides to get rid of -33a on the left side of the equation: -33*a + 33*a + 3 = -32*a + 33*a This simplifies to: 3 = a Therefore, in the equation -33*a + 3 = -32*a, a equals to 3. To confirm this finding, let's substitute a=3 back into the original equation and try to balance both sides: Left side=(-33*a + 3) = -33*3 + 3 = -99 + 3 = -96 Right side= -32*a = -32*3 = -96 Both sides are in balance (-96=-96), so our solution a=3 is correct."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

She candied ginger, plums pears, and she didn't candy apples, oranges apricots and bananas. Which fruit contains more crystallized sugar, plums or apricots? Hint: Sugaring is a food preservation method similar to pickling. Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses. The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites. A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant. A:","completion":"Since Ann candied ginger, plums, and pears, and she didn't candy apples, oranges, apricots, and bananas, we can determine that she candied plums but not apricots.

Isaac tries to rescue the dying Matthews, but he is also wounded in the right knee and has his radio damaged and his water bottle destroyed in the process. Alone, Isaac takes cover behind an unsteady wall and tends to his wounds. The sniper has a radio tuned into the American channel, and uses it to communicate with Isaac under the pretense of being a high ranking allied soldier at another site. The deception allows the sniper to get other useful information from Isaac. Throughout their various one-sided attempts at conversation, we learn that the sniper does not claim to be the mythical Juba mentioned earlier in the film, a nom de guerre for various Al Qaeda snipers notorious for filming their attacks on American soldiers. Isaac's attempts to call headquarters for help are stymied by the loss of his radio antennae.

Q:The answer to the question: What was the full name of the band member who left the Smashing Pumpkins in 2009? is inside the article: The Smashing Pumpkins (or Smashing Pumpkins) are an American alternative rock band from Chicago, Illinois. Formed in 1988 by frontman Billy Corgan (lead vocals, guitar), D'arcy Wretzky (bass), James Iha (guitar), and Jimmy Chamberlin (drums), the band has undergone many line-up changes. The current lineup features Corgan, Chamberlin, Iha and guitarist Jeff Schroeder. Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries, they have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegazing, and electronica in later recordings. Corgan is the group's primary songwriter; his musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as \\"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land\\".The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. With 30 million albums sold worldwide, the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up. In 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist. After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, which encompassed the release of stand-alone singles, compilation EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project's scope—Oceania in 2012 and Monuments to an Elegy in 2014.

To further elaborate, let's break down the components of the statement: 1. \\"In a crowded park\\" - This part of the statement sets the scene for the event described, which is happening in an outdoor space, a park, which is also filled with people. Hence, this clearly establishes that the park is an outdoor location where people gather. 2. \\"Three racially diverse girls hold hands\\" - This part of the statement indicates the characters involved in the scene: three girls from different racial backgrounds. By saying that they are holding hands, it depicts an interaction between them that is happening in the park mentioned earlier. This reinforces the idea that there are people involved and that the event is occurring in an outside area. Based on these two components, it can be concluded that the statement \\"In a crowded park, three racially diverse girls hold hands\\" supports the idea that there are people outside.

The Screening Room spoke to creator Matt Groening and writer Al Jean in London about everyone's favorite two-dimensional yellow family. Simpsons supremo Matt Groening with his creations at the film's premiere in Springfield, Vermont Matt Groening told the Screening Room that fans had driven the demand for the movie. \\"We've had fans clamoring for a movie for the past 18 years,\\" he said. The film has taken four years to come to fruition, as writer Al Jean explained. \\"What really held us up for a long time was to have enough people to do the show and the movie,\\" he said. \\"We talked for a while about doing the movie after the show is done, but the show is never done! So it really started in earnest in 2003, when we started working on this story that became the movie.\\" Technology has also played its part. Jean continued, \\"The technology to do this film really wasn't even around five years ago. For example, there was this joke I once pitched and David Silverman, the director, started drawing and as I was pitching it, it went into the film and it was cut a day later. To go from pitch to cut in two days is pretty impressive.\\" Its creators hope that \\"The Simpsons Movie\\" will both satisfy long-term fans and bring Homer and Marge's family to a new audience. Groening told the Screening Room, \\"This movie is designed to both honor the people who have loved the show all this time, so there's lots of little details for them in the movie, little characters and stuff who they know and love, but we also want people who don't know the family to not be completely confused.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: A tender woman, or an independent one, which one would you prefer? Arecent research shows that most people would choose the latter. This type of woman is called a nuhanzi (\\"tough woman\\"). Experts believe these characteristics have social and psychological roots among young femalesin China. Su Hao's friends all call her a tough woman, because she can finish tough tasks usually carried out by men. For example, she carries 10-litre water to her dormitory on the 5th floor. \\"I depend on no one but myself,\\" she says. According to a recent survey by China Youth Daily, tough women have become rather common in society. Of the 21,265 respondents, 78.5 percent said they are familiar with a tough woman. About 50 percent said they like women with tough characteristics, while less than 29 percent expressed the opposite view. Why are tough women gaining popularity? Shen Meng, a psychological consultant, believes the fierce competition in society is contributing to this trend. \\"Women are often in a disadvantaged position compared to men,\\" Shen says. \\"In order to survive, they have to be independent, strong and tough.\\" Liu Xiao lin, professor of psychology at Wuhan Mental Health Center, believes tough women are brought up this way. They are often on close relationship with their fathers, who teach their daughters to be brave and decisive,\\" he says. As a result, these women are more likely to be psychologically healthy and more tolerant to stress, according to Liu. Though Liu believes that this is a good trend, Hu Shenzhi, a psychologist at the Guangdong Sunflower Counseling Center, says the popularity of tough woman indicates an unclear line between gender identities, which can lead to relationship problems. \\"Some women with characteristics that differ from the traditional female image may have a difficult time finding Mr Right,\\" he says.\\"Even if they get married, their manly characteristics might cause family conflicts.

News article: Abu Dhabi Lays Off Staff as Gulf Austerity Tightens Thousands of layoffs at state-linked companies in Abu Dhabi are a fresh sign the Gulf’s wealthy oil states are hunkering down for a long period of austerity as low crude prices pressure their economies. Since mid-2015, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other countries in the region have curbed spending on some construction projects and reduced energy subsidies to limit budget deficits caused by cheap oil. Now some governments are also starting to reduce staff at the companies they control, many of them in the energy industry, in order to ensure the firms are not a drain on state finances if oil prices stay low for several years. Abu Dhabi’s National Oil Co (ADNOC), with around 55,000 staff, has cut hundreds of jobs in the last few months and will have reduced its workforce by at least 5,000 by the end of 2016, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Warner Bros. Theme Park To Open in Abu Dhabi in 2018 The reduction will occur across most of its 17 subsidiaries as part of a restructuring following a reshuffle of the firm’s leadership this month, they said. An ADNOC spokesman did not confirm or deny the cuts but said: “In keeping with the entire oil and gas industry, ADNOC is constantly looking at ways to be more efficient and more profitable, particularly in the current market environment.” The UAE’s oil and gas recruitment market is set for its most difficult year in over a decade in 2016, a report from recruiters Morgan McKinley said. “The oil and gas industry is still feeling the pain, as was to be expected. Overall redundancies have been on the increase,” said Trefor Murphy, managing director for the region. Most layoffs at Abu Dhabi state firms are not in response to production cut-backs; the UAE has not reduced its oil output, and says it is proceeding with long-planned oil and gas development projects. Nor do the layoffs mean Abu Dhabi is running out of money. With hundreds of billions of dollars in its sovereign wealth fund, the emirate could draw down its reserves to sustain current levels of spending for decades. But the government wants to minimize the speed of the draw-down as it looks ahead to the possibility of many years of low oil prices. Last year, Abu Dhabi acted ahead of other Gulf states in cutting domestic fuel and electricity subsidies. Now it is applying the same approach to state-linked firms. In Qatar, state-controlled firms such as Qatar Petroleum and Qatar Rail have been laying off staff. State companies in other states such as Saudi Arabia and Oman have been looking at ways to reduce costs but have so far not resorted to major job cuts. For more on the Gulf region, watch: Most cuts at state firms in Abu Dhabi and elsewhere involve foreign staff rather than locals, because governments want to limit unemployment among their citizens. Nevertheless, the job losses are contributing to an economic slowdown in the region. The International Monetary Fund has predicted Abu Dhabi’s gross domestic product growth will fall to 1.7% this year from 4.4% in 2015. In neighboring Dubai, where the economy is not directly reliant on oil and state-linked firms are vigorously pushing tourism and real estate projects, growth is forecast to accelerate marginally, to 3.7% from 3.6%. Companies cutting staff in Abu Dhabi include Abu Dhabi National Energy Co, which has reduced its workforce by a quarter since 2014. It has cut around a third of oil and gas jobs and 55% of staff at its headquarters, it said this month after reporting a first-quarter loss. Earlier this year, Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Rail, the federal government-owned entity building a UAE rail network, said it cut 30% of its staff in a restructuring. Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority laid off scores of people, mostly expatriates, sources said. Spokespeople for the authority did not return calls seeking comment. Strikes Bring Shortages in Hundreds of French Petrol Stations National Petroleum Construction Co, owned by Abu Dhabi’s state-owned industrial conglomerate Senaat and one of the largest oilfield contractors in Abu Dhabi, is reviewing its manpower levels, chief executive Aqeel Madhi told Reuters. Construction firm Arabtec, in which Abu Dhabi state fund Aabar Investments is the biggest shareholder, may include job cuts in its cost reduction program, chairman Mohamed al-Rumaithi said last month, adding: “There’s some fat to be taken out.” Some firms are axing expatriates to create jobs for UAE nationals. Medical center operator Cleveland Clinic, owned by Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala, is creating over 100 positions for locals, having told some expatriate staff they have to leave by year-end, sources said. Asked to comment, Cleveland said that as part of its efforts to develop local talent, a number of administrative roles would move to UAE citizens in coming months.

William Martin Joel was born in the Bronx on May 9, 1949, and was raised in Levittown, New York in the town of Oyster Bay. In 1963 when zip codes were assigned, the section of Levittown in Oyster Bay was given a Hicksville, New York zip code and has since been part of Hicksville. Joel's father, Howard (born Helmuth) Joel, a classical pianist, was born in Germany, to a Jewish family, the son of a merchant and manufacturer, Karl Amson Joel. Howard emigrated to Switzerland and later to the United States (via Cuba, as immigration quotas for German Jews prevented direct immigration at the time) to escape the Nazi regime. Influenced by early-rock-and-roll and rhythm-and-blues artists, including groups such as The Beatles, The Drifters and The Four Seasons, he favored tightly-structured pop melodies and down-to-earth, unpretentious songwriting. After seeing The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show, Joel decided to pursue a career in music. In an interview he said of the group's impact, \\"That one performance changed my life ... Up to that moment I'd never considered playing rock as a career. And when I saw four guys who didn't look like they'd come out of the Hollywood star mill, who played their own songs and instruments, and especially because you could see this look in John Lennon's face - and he looked like he was always saying: 'F--- you!' - I said: 'I know these guys, I can relate to these guys, I am these guys.' This is what I'm going to do - play in a rock band'.\\" Joel joined the Echoes, a group that specialized in British Invasion covers. The Echoes began recording in 1965. Joel (then 16) also played piano on several records released through Kama Sutra Productions and on recordings produced by Shadow Morton. Joel played on a demo version of \\"Leader of the Pack\\", which would become a major hit for the Shangri-Las. Joel states that in 1964 he played on a recording of the Shangri-Las' \\"Remember (Walking in the Sand)\\" but he is unaware of whether he played on the demo or master version; The released single included a co-producer credit for Artie Ripp, who later was the first to sign and produce Joel as a solo artist after Michael Lang, who had given Joel a monetary advance, passed Joel along to Ripp to focus his attentions elsewhere instead. In late 1965, the Echoes changed their name to the Emeralds and then to the Lost Souls. Joel left the band in 1967 to join the Hassles, a Long Island group that had signed with United Artists Records. Over the next year and a half they released four singles and two albums (The Hassles and Hour of the Wolf). All were commercial failures. Joel and drummer Jon Small left the Hassles in 1969 to form the duo Attila, releasing an eponymous debut album in July 1970. The duo disbanded the following October when Joel began an affair with Small's wife, Elizabeth, whom Joel eventually married.

When planted, the seed grows into a flower, and inside the blossom is a tiny girl the size of the old woman's thumb. The old woman names the girl Thumbelina and raises her as her own. Although Thumbelina loves her mother, she craves companionship from someone her own size. One night, Cornelius, the fairy prince, stumbles upon Thumbelina after hearing her beautiful singing. The two take a ride on Cornelius' bumblebee, and fall in love; during this ride Mrs. Toad and her son Grundel are enchanted by Thumbelina's singing. Cornelius promises to return the next day, but after he's gone, Mrs. Toad kidnaps Thumbelina from her bed and takes her away. Thumbelina awakens on Mrs. Toad's show boat. Mrs. Toad wants Thumbelina to join their troupe and marry Grundel, who is in love with her.

The whole world felt sorry about the death of Mandela, a great man of history. Mandela is mostly remembered for his efforts to end apartheid in South Africa. Mandela was born in 1918. In South Africa, there are both black and white people. But at that time, Black people couldn't live or travel where they wanted. They didn't have the right to vote, either. Mandela didn't think that was right. He organized many activities against it, but he was sent to prison for 27 years. Under international pressure, the government set Mandela free in 1990. Great changes in the law began to end apartheid. At that time, Mandela chose to forgive his enemies. He shook hands with the people who wanted him dead. He also encouraged black people to forgive the whites. Because of his forgiveness, Mandela is remembered as a moral model by the whole world. In1993,Mandela won the Nobel Peace Prize. A year later, he became the first black president of South Africa. Both black people and white people voted. Apartheid ended. In 1999, Mandela left office at the highest point of his power.

LIFE AND FLOODING ALONG THE BANKS OF THE LONDON - For centuries, the Thames River, which twists through London as it flows from the mountains in the West toward the sea, was left to the fishing boats and cargo ships that called at the docks along its banks. Now, new life is coming to the river. Last week marked the beginning of debate before the Greater London Council over the Coin Street project - a plan to commercially develop the river's south bank - which is just one of many such fights under way or in prospect. The Thames has become the focus of disparate concerns; among them, the promise of London's commercial development and the daily threat that the river will overflow its banks and leave much of the city under water. ''London has always been uncomfortable in that a great resource, the river, has been ignored,'' said Lance Knoble, assistant editor of the British publication, The Architectural Review, reviewing the relationship of the city to what was once its lifeblood. In central London, he concluded, the Thames is now ''the last frontier.'' Unlike other riverbank cities, such as New York or Washington, London developed in such a way that the Thames separates the wellknown commercial and residential neighborhoods on the north bank from the poorer, more industrial areas on the south. As highways and industrial sites came to occupy the river's edges, Londoners on both banks came to ignore its noncommercial qualities. In the early 1970's, city fathers realized they could no longer overlook one characteristic -the Thames's propensity to o verflow. Spill over it did in 1099, in 1236, in 1663, in 1928 and in 1953. In 1978, the river came wi thin 10 inches of the top of the embankment, calling to mind the floo d three centuries before, depicted by the diarist SamuelPepys as ''th e greatest tide that ever was remembered in England to have been in the river, all Whitehall having been drowned.'' Should it happen today, studies suggest, 1.25 million people and 8 billion in property would be affected. And it can happen, as regularly as low-pressure areas form off North America and move eastward pushing ahead a surge of water - which is often indeed. The chances of flood have actually increased in recent years because the melting of the polar ice cap has raised the level of the sea; because the southeastern part of England has been slipping into the North Sea; and because London itself has been sinking into its clay foundation. When the Thames Runneth Over Thus in 1972, after 35 years of agonizing, the Greater London Council approved construction of a 1 billion system of permanent dams and moveable barriers that, in essence, would shut out the Thames if a surge tide threatened. The estimate is that it will be completed in November 1982. Meanwhile, London has been mesmerized by thoughts of a deluge. Large signs have been erected as ''Warning to those in flood risk area. Sirens will begin wailing about an hour before London is flooded. Don't travel. Go upstairs and stay put.'' A publicity campaign to reinforce this advice is planned by local authorities. And on Oct.27, the day of one of the highest tides of the year, the British Broadcasting Corporation plans to present a television dramatization of a mythical London flood. On the apparent assumption that catastrophe will be forestalled, however, the struggle over developing the river banks grows more intense. In part, it reflects the new availability of abandoned industrial sites in the south; in part, the increased scarcity and skyrocketing prices of land to the north. The Architectural Journal reports that more than 50 development schemes for the Thames are on the table, including plans for apartments, offices, shops, hotels, parks and even two more bridges, although there are already 19. Most proposals involve the south bank. Virtually all await approval from local and national officials. For in Britain, planning controls are so tough as to make New Y ork seem like Housto n. To some, the bureaucratic bog is welcome. A number of schemes are of dubious quality and Londoners need only look at the new National Theater complex, an expanse of concrete far colder than the old industrial buildings surrounding it, to see development gone esthetically sour. A few proposals enjoy favor, such as recycling the soon-to-be-abandoned Billingsgate fish market into a shopping and tourist center, with restaurants, bars, studios, workshops and sports facilities. Developers are already revitalizing the ''docklands,'' a stretch of decrepit wharves, warehouses, public housing and open space to the east of the inner city that may become the site for thousands of units of moderately priced housing. That the Thames is being incorporated into the majority of development plans is an outgrowth of successful efforts to depollute a waterway so dirty that in Victorian times, women sold nosegays to pedestrians by Westminster Bridge. Though cleanup attempts began as early as 1855, by 1960 pollution had worsened and fish life had vanished, except for an occasional eel. A major antipollution project was started in the mid-1960's, but not until five years ago was all waste dumped into the Thames fully treated. The change has been dramatic. Acknowledging a perpetual murkiness - the result of tidal action stirring riverbed sand - the Thames Water Authority contends the river is ''the cleanest metropolitan estuary in the world.'' Smelt, bass, shrimp and salmon are being found in substantial numbers. Swans and shelducks are back. For the first time, as far as anyone knows, a sea horse was discovered. Fishermen can be seen on the shore below Waterloo Bridge, and the river, though salty, is safe for swimming. Buoyed by such success, the authorities believe they can rest on their laurels. ''The intent is not to spend any more money on improving quality,'' a spokesman said recently. The opposite is still true for flood control and redevelopment.

Given the following context: In 1955 in Portland, Oregon, a businessman finds his wife in bed with another man, and commits a double murder-suicide. His young son, Paul, witnesses the three deaths, and is traumatized. Twenty-five years later, in 1980, Paul is incarcerated at a psychiatric institution near Stanford Bay, a small town on the Oregon Coast. One day, Paul manages to murder an orderly, and subsequently retrieves a beloved wooden flute given to him by his father before escaping the institution. Local teenager Marion is struggling to adjust to her disability—she survived a car accident several years prior, caused by her drunken father Frank, which left her unable to walk without the help of a leg brace. She is plagued by bizarre dreams, which she comes to discover are in fact premonitions; while in the hospital after her accident, she received a blood transfusion from Paul, which has given her extrasensory perception into Paul's actions. Marion's home life is troubled, with her father being verbally abusive to her and her mother, Bea, and she dreams of leaving Stanford Bay once her fisherman boyfriend, Joey, obtains a job in Portland. Meanwhile, Paul hitchhikes with a truck driver whom he bludgeons to death with a hatchet, and then steals his vehicle. He subsequently picks up a female hitchhiker, who he brings to a local motel in Stanford Bay, and murders her after failing to charm her with his flute-playing. Marion's psychic visions of Paul's murders increase in frequency and intensity, and sh soon witnesses him in person disposing of a body on a rural beach, making her his next target. Marion manages to elude to Paul, but he later discovers where she lives, and infiltrates her home, killing Frank. Struggling to walk, Marion manages to flee her home to an adjacent sawmill, and is pursued by Paul.

Northern region where the animals are exposed to a lot of abiotic stress, and the southern region, where the animals experience almost no abiotic stress. Which region had fewer species inhabiting it? The answer is:","completion":"In order to answer the question, we need to analyze the effects of abiotic stress on the number of species inhabiting a given region. Step 1: Understand the concept of abiotic stress. Abiotic stress refers to the negative impact of non-living factors on living organisms in a specific environment. These factors can include temperature, water availability, nutrients, and other physical or chemical factors that may limit the growth and survival of organisms. Step 2: Consider how abiotic stress affects species diversity. Higher levels of abiotic stress can lead to a reduction in species diversity, as the challenging environment may favor only a few well-adapted species to survive and successfully reproduce. Such conditions make it difficult for less adapted species to thrive, resulting in a lower diversity of species in that environment. Step 3: Apply the understanding of abiotic stress to the given question. In the question, we are given that the northern region of Italy has a lot of abiotic stress, while the southern region has almost no abiotic stress. Based on our understanding of the effect of abiotic stress on species diversity, we can infer that regions with more abiotic stress tend to have a lower number of species inhabiting them. Step 4: Conclude the answer. Given this information, we can conclude that the northern region of Italy, where animals are exposed to a lot of abiotic stress, would have fewer species inhabiting it compared to the southern region, where animals experience almost no abiotic stress."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Slovak is an Indo-European language that belongs to the West Slavic languages (together with Czech, Polish, and other lingos). It is the official language of Slovakia, a landlocked country located in Central Europe. In a more expanded context, Slovak is a member of the Slavic language family. The Slavic family of languages is divided into three branches: West, East, and South. The three Western Slavic languages are Polish, Czech, and Slovak. These regionally proximate languages have similar structure and vocabulary due to historical and cultural exchanges over the centuries. Although Slovak is most closely related to Czech, there is a substantial mutual intelligibility with both Czech and Polish. Slovak uses the Latin alphabet with certain modifications to accommodate its phonetic requirements. It is characterized by the use of diacritical marks such as the acute symbol ( ´ ) to denote long vowels and the caron/haček symbol ( ˇ ) to denote a change in the consonant’s pronunciation. As for demographic distribution, Slovak is spoken by approximately 5 million people in Slovakia. Outside of Slovakia, there are Slovak-speaking communities in the United States, Canada, Hungary, Serbia, Ireland, Romania, Poland, Australia, and the Czech Republic, among other countries. Thanks to the shared origins and similarities with other Slavic languages, speakers of Slovak can often communicate quite freely with people who speak other languages from the same family. Your specific sentence, \\"V očiach mu bličal tvrdý hnev,\\" roughly translates to \\"In his eyes flashed hard anger\\" in English.

QUEBEC CITY — Emotions were on display when U.S. President Donald Trump met other G-7 leaders at their annual summit in Canada on Friday, but the discussions were civilized and diplomatic, according to sources. Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

Here are possible answers to this question: - soccer game - musle - vein - animals - person I believe the correct choice is \\"person\\", here's why:","completion":"The correct choice is indeed \\"person\\", and here's a detailed explanation: An operating room typically refers to a medical facility specifically designed and equipped for performing surgical procedures on patients. From the possible answers provided, let's analyze each option to understand why \\"person\\" is the most suitable answer: 1. Soccer game: This choice is unrelated to the context of the question, as a soccer game is a sports event and has nothing to do with an operating room or surgical procedures. 2. Muscle: While it's true that surgeons might operate on a muscle during certain surgical procedures, it doesn't indicate the subject being operated on which is required for this particular question (\\"what were the surgeons operating on?\\"). Therefore, the answer \\"muscle\\" is not specific enough. 3. Vein: Similar to the muscle, a vein is a part of the human circulatory system that surgeons might operate on during specific procedures, but it doesn't provide information about the subject being operated on. So, the answer \\"vein\\" is also not specific enough. 4. Animals: Operating rooms are primarily associated with surgeries in humans, and although there are veterinary surgeries for animals, the question indicates that there is blood everywhere in the operating room, implying that the subject being operated on is bleeding. Human operating rooms are designed for human patients, so \\"animals\\" would not be the most appropriate answer here. 5. Person: This is the most logical and appropriate answer since an operating room's primary purpose is for performing surgical operations on human patients. Blood, a natural component of the human body, is often involved during surgeries and is likely to be present in the operating room. In conclusion, \\"person\\" is the most accurate answer among the given choices, as it accurately reflects the subject being operated on in an operating room during a surgical procedure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is now realized that being able to work successfully with other people is one of the main keys to success, partly because we need to do it so often. In almost every situation where you're in a group, you will need a skilled leader. All groups need leaders and all successful groups have good leaders. Groups without leaders or with weak leaders almost always break down. Members of a leaderless group often begin to feel disappointed and helpless. Time is wasted and the tasks are not achieved. There are often arguments and nervousness between people as there is nobody to keep the goals clear. Some people are natural leaders. The well-known cook, Antonio Carlucci says, \\"True leaders are born and you see them in kitchens.\\" They're people who are strong, fair, and humorous. Although a lot of people agree that there are some natural-born leaders, most people now know that leadership can also be taught. Experienced teachers can train almost anyone how to be a successful leader. Good leaders don't make people do things in a controlling way. You can learn how to join others, encouraging the whole group to work towards a common goal. Successful leaders also need to be calm and wise.

Article:Two teams of former Derry City players graced the turf for charity in the final match at the ground in its current guise. Redevelopment and modernisation work gets under way this week at the Lone Moor Road ground. It has been home to Derry City since the club's inception in 1928. The multi-million pound project will include a new stand, changing rooms and a new synthetic playing surface. Among those playing in the ground's swansong was former Northern Ireland international Liam Coyle. The striker, a Derry City fans' favourite, grew up in the shadow of the stadium, following in the footsteps of his father Fay - part of the 1958 Northern Ireland World Cup squad - by playing for his hometown club. \\"There's a lot of great memories here, making my debut and scoring a hat trick, winning the treble under Jim McLaughlin and winning the League under Felix Healy,\\" he told BBC Radio Foyle. \\"But progress has to be made and the ground has to be redeveloped\\". A soccer stadium since the late 19th century, Brandywell was voted among the UK's top ten favourite sports venues in the UK in 2002 by BBC Radio Five Live listeners. The ground has seen title triumphs, cup wins, European glory nights and some of the footballing world's great names cross its white lines. Glamour friendlies brought Barcelona, Real Madrid and Manchester United to the famous old ground - players of the calibre of Ronaldinho, Xavi, Iniesta and Gascoigne, among those to face the challenge of the ground's notorious slope. Benfica, Steaua Bucharest, Gothenborg, Vitesse Arnheim, Paris St. Germain are among the European elite to take on Derry City in European competition. There are darker days in the ground's long history too - in 1972 a supporters' bus from Ballymena United was burned on a visit to Brandywell. Ultimately that would see the club expelled from the Irish League and forced in the footballing wilderness until their acceptance into the League of Ireland in 1985. It was during that exile that the ground's other tenants - Brandywell is owned by the local council - helped keep the stadium from ruin. The ground is also home to football's Derry and District and Saturday Morning Leagues while it has housed greyhound racing since the 1930s. A final race meeting due to take place last week fell foul of the weather. A new track at the adjacent Showgrounds will form part of the upgrade. Michael McLaughlin of the Brandywell Greyhound Racing Company is looking ahead to the opening of the modernised facility in 2017. \\"I would like to thank all the people who have supported us over the years and look forward to seeing them again next autumn\\". A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council, owners of the ground, said the first phase of the ground's redevelopment would be completed in 2017. It will include \\"a new 1,100 seater stand, a new pitch, new dog track and substantial improvement works across the stadium and perimeter walls\\". A second phase, dependant on the securing of necessary funding, could further increase capacity to 5,000. Derry City FC are now looking for a new home for the 2017 season while Brandywell is overhauled. In a statement, the club said the redevelopment is a \\"very positive and affirming development for the future of the club\\". \\"The project has been long in its gestation and the club itself and our supporters have, at times, been disappointed. \\"To see the actual works begin in the stadium will help us all to relish the possibilities for the future. \\"We can begin to look forward to having a stadium that properly represents the status and the history of this great club\\". A summary of the above article is?","completion":"The final match at the historic Brandywell stadium in Derry took place recently, featuring two teams of former Derry City players.

This is an essential step in beginning the recovery process. Step 2: Seek professional help It's important for a person struggling with addiction to consult trained professionals such as therapists, counselors, or support groups. They can provide guidance and support during the recovery journey. Step 3: Develop a solid support system Having a strong support system, including friends and family, can greatly improve the chances of recovery. Encouraging open communication and providing emotional support can help keep the person motivated and focused on healing.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Curtis Mayfield was born on June 3, 1942 in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Marion Washington and Kenneth Mayfield, one of five children. Mayfield's father left the family when Curtis was five; his mother (and maternal grandmother) moved the family into several Chicago public housing projects before settling in Cabrini-Green during his teen years. Mayfield attended Wells Community Academy High School before dropping out his sophomore year. His mother taught him piano and, along with his grandmother, encouraged him to enjoy gospel music. Curtis Mayfield was known for introducing social consciousness into African-American music. Having been raised in the Cabrini-Green projects of Chicago, he witnessed many of the tragedies of the urban ghetto first hand, and was quoted saying \\"With everything I saw on the streets as a young black kid, it wasn't hard during the later fifties and sixties for me to write my heartfelt way of how I visualized things, how I thought things ought to be.\\" Following the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, his group the Impressions produced music that became the soundtrack to a summer of revolution. It is even said that \\"Keep On Pushing\\" became the number one sing along during the Freedom Rides. Black students sang their songs as they marched to jail or protested outside their universities, while King often used \\"Keep On Pushing\\", \\"People Get Ready\\" and \\"We're A Winner\\" because of their ability to motivate and inspire marchers. Mayfield had quickly become a civil rights hero with his ability to inspire hope and courage. Mayfield was unique in his ability to fuse relevant social commentary with melodies and lyrics that instilled a hopefulness for a better future in his listeners. He wrote and recorded the soundtrack to the 1972 blaxploitation film Super Fly with the help of producer Johnny Pate. The soundtrack for Super Fly is regarded as an all-time great body of work that captured the essence of life in the ghetto while criticizing the tendency of young people to glorify the \\"glamorous\\" lifestyles of drug dealers and pimps, and illuminating the dark realities of drugs, addiction, and exploitation. His work influenced many, and it is said that Mayfield truly introduced a new style of black music. Mayfield, along with several other soul and funk musicians, spread messages of hope in the face of oppression, pride in being a member of the black race and gave courage to a generation of people who were demanding their human rights, without abandoning the struggle for equality. He has been compared to Martin Luther King, Jr. for making a lasting impact in the civil rights struggle with his inspirational music. By the end of the decade Mayfield was a pioneering voice in the black pride movement, along with James Brown and Sly Stone. Paving the way for a future generation of rebel thinkers, Mayfield paid the price, artistically and commercially, for his politically charged music. Mayfield's \\"Keep On Pushing\\" was actually banned from several radio stations when riots began flaring up in some cities. Regardless of the persistent radio bans and loss of revenue, he continued his quest for equality right until his death. His lyrics on racial injustice, poverty and drugs became the poetry of a generation. Mayfield was also a descriptive social commentator. As the influx of drugs ravaged through black America in the late 1960s and 1970s his bittersweet descriptions of the ghetto would serve as warnings to the impressionable. \\"Freddie's Dead\\" is a graphic tale of street life, while \\"Pusherman\\" revealed the role of drug dealers in the urban ghettos.

Kenneth Waltz, the founder of the neorealist theory of international relations, uses a set of five criteria to determine great power: population and territory; resource endowment; economic capability; political stability and competence; and military strength.

The resulting background will reframe your seating area while adding a splash of color and texture. And, since it provides such a striking contrast, it can help break up the visual monotony of bigger rooms. Keep the design consistent with the palette you’ve picked out for the room, as well as its general energy. A coral and seafoam green chevron pattern will look out of place in a room with elegant Victorian decor, but will be right at home in one done up in colorful 1960s retro. Even if there’s nothing behind it, it will add an air of chic mystery. A simple wood slat screen should be versatile enough for most homes, or you could go with an elaborately painted Chinese style to suit other exotic accessories. Be sure to unfold the screen so it will fit neatly behind the couch, unless you prefer to keep your seating pulled in closer to the center of the room. Update an uninspired screen with a fresh coat of paint or a DIY distressing job. A changing screen may be just the thing you need to conceal tangles of electronics cords near the wall outlet. For a no-fuss fix to your wall problem, all you need is a few coils of plastic stringer lights and a little imagination. Drive nails or push pins into the wall, then loop the lights around them in whatever configuration you find appealing. Colored lights are the more festive way to go, while white bulbs will be subtle enough to suit just about any space. Have fun with your stringer lights by twisting them into words or symbols. Naturally, string lights double as a source of illumination. Their soft glow can be perfect for when you want it dim but not too dark. Board-and-batten is an accenting technique that involves layering thin boards over an existing wall to give it added visual texture. The boards are arranged vertically or horizontally, or at intersecting angles for a latticed look. This unique design style can be a practical answer for those looking for a less conventional way to freshen up a sitting room wall. Board-and-batten is relatively inexpensive and simple to install if you know what you’re doing. If you’re not confident in your ability to tackle the project yourself, call a professional contractor to come in and do it right. Summary:","completion":"To create a visually appealing and textured background for your sofa wall, consider the following options: 1. Apply wallpaper to the sofa wall alone, ensuring it matches the room's palette and overall energy. This can help break up visual monotony in large rooms. 2.

Despite the public acclaim that had greeted Shackleton's achievements after the Nimrod Expedition in 1907–1909, the explorer was unsettled, becoming—in the words of British skiing pioneer Sir Harry Brittain—\\"a bit of a floating gent\\". By 1912, his future Antarctic plans depended on the results of Scott's Terra Nova Expedition, which had left Cardiff in July 1910, and on the concurrent Norwegian expedition led by Roald Amundsen. The news of Amundsen's conquest of the South Pole reached Shackleton on 11 March 1912, to which he responded: \\"The discovery of the South Pole will not be the end of Antarctic exploration\\". The next work, he said, would be \\"a transcontinental journey from sea to sea, crossing the pole\\". He was aware that others were in the field pursuing this objective. On 11 December 1911, a German expedition under Wilhelm Filchner had sailed from South Georgia, intending to penetrate deep into the Weddell Sea and establishing a base from which he would cross the continent to the Ross Sea. In late 1912 Filchner returned to South Georgia, having failed to land and set up his base. However, his reports of possible landing sites in Vahsel Bay, at around 78° latitude, were noted by Shackleton, and incorporated into his developing expedition plans.News of the deaths of Captain Scott and his companions on their return from the South Pole reached London in February 1913. Against this gloomy background Shackleton initiated preparations for his proposed journey. He solicited financial and practical support from, among others, Tryggve Gran of Scott's expedition, and the former Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, but received no help from either. Gran was evasive, and Rosebery blunt: \\"I have never been able to care one farthing about the Poles\\".Shackleton got support, however, from William Speirs Bruce, leader of the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of 1902–1904, who had harboured plans for an Antarctic crossing since 1908, but had abandoned the project for lack of funds.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question given this paragraph: CHAPTER SUMMARY 36.1 Sensory Processes A sensory activation occurs when a physical or chemical stimulus is processed into a neural signal (sensory transduction) by a sensory receptor. Perception is an individual interpretation of a sensation and is a brain function. Humans have special senses: olfaction, gustation, equilibrium, and hearing, plus the general senses of somatosensation. Sensory receptors are either specialized cells associated with sensory neurons or the specialized ends of sensory neurons that are a part of the peripheral nervous system, and they are used to receive information about the environment (internal or external). Each sensory receptor is modified for the type of stimulus it detects. For example, neither gustatory receptors nor auditory receptors are sensitive to light. Each sensory receptor is responsive to stimuli within a specific region in space, which is known as that receptor’s receptive field. The most fundamental function of a sensory system is the translation of a sensory signal to an electrical signal in the nervous system. All sensory signals, except those from the olfactory system, enter the central nervous system and are routed to the thalamus. When the sensory signal exits the thalamus, it is conducted to the specific area of the cortex dedicated to processing that particular sense. Q: What is a specific region in space within which a sensory receptor is responsive to stimuli? Choices: - deceptive field - amplify field - symmetrical field - receptive field A:","completion":"A specific region in space within which a sensory receptor is responsive to stimuli is known as the receptive field. The receptive field is an area where a sensory neuron is able to detect and react to a specific stimulus, whether it be internal or external. Each sensory receptor is designed to detect a specific type of stimulus, such as light, sound, taste, etc., within its receptive field. This allows our sensory systems to efficiently process and respond to various stimuli in our environment and send the appropriate neural signals to the central nervous system for further processing and interpretation by the brain."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Guidelines: 1. Only one criminal charge needs to be identified. 2. The criminal charge should be provided in Chinese. First, read through the paragraph carefully. Draw on your knowledge of legal vocabulary and understanding of the text to identify the specific charge. As the paragraph is about a criminal case, look for words or phrases that refer to illegal actions or offences. The first line has a potential clue as it involves someone (the defendant, Zhang) refusing to perform an obligation or duty. Then later in the text, the paragraph talks about Zhang also refusing to report his assets. According to Chinese law, these actions could be seen as obstructing the enforcement of a court order. Given the script \\"被告人张1某拒不执行裁定\\" and \\"被告人张1某拒绝报告财产\\", which means \\"the defendant Zhang refuses to execute the verdict\\" and \\"the defendant Zhang refuses to report his properties\\". Given these sentences, the charges could possibly be \\"拒不执行法院判决\\", which translates to \\"refusal to enforce court ruling or verdict.\\" Or it could be \\"拒绝报告财产\\", which translates to \\"refusal to report property.\\" With the constraints of the task, the sufficient answer could either be \\"拒不执行法院判决\\" or \\"拒绝报告财产\\".

I really wanted to give it a higher rating, but for now, I can only give it 2 stars. The content available on this app is decent, offering a diverse range of news stories from multiple categories such as politics, science, technology, and more. However, the app's overall performance is quite underwhelming. It constantly lags and freezes, making it difficult for me to read or even browse through the articles. The user interface is not quite smooth, either, sometimes registering touches inaccurately. This takes away from the content's value and degrades my overall experience. Additionally, though the app is visually appealing, I found the organization of articles to be quite confusing, making it hard for me to find specific stories or topics I'm interested in. The search function is also a bit of a hit or miss; sometimes it delivers the desired results, but more often than not, it shows unrelated news articles or nothing at all. Finally, the push notifications can be somewhat overwhelming. While I appreciate keeping up-to-date with important news, I found the frequency of notifications to be excessive, and there seems to be no way to customize or reduce the number of notifications received. Overall, the NPR News app has potential with its vast content library but falls short due to its poor performance, unintuitive user interface, and problematic search and notification functions. I hope they can invest time and resources into fixing these issues for a more enjoyable user experience. Rating: 2/5 stars"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Explanation: When we say that one sentence is 'entailed' by another, we mean that if the first sentence is true, then the second one must also be true. Here, the first sentence does talk about something being 'near sighted', but it doesn't tell us who or what is near sighted. It's like saying Bob has a ball, without telling us which ball Bob has. So, we can't say for sure if the second sentence is talking about the same thing as the first one - it could be, but it could also be something completely different. That's why we say 'it's not possible to tell'. The answer is not *yes because the first sentence doesn't directly state or confirm that 'I' am the one being near sighted. And it is not *no because although the first sentence doesn't directly confirm the second, it also doesn't rule it out - it just doesn't give us enough information to know for sure.

The Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a heritable connective-tissue disorder caused by defects in fibrillar-collagen metabolism. Mutations in the type V collagen genes account for up to 50 percent of cases of classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but many other cases are unexplained. We investigated whether the deficiency of the tenascins, extracellular-matrix proteins that are highly expressed in connective tissues, was associated with the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. We screened serum samples from 151 patients with the classic, hypermobility, or vascular types of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome; 75 patients with psoriasis; 93 patients with rheumatoid arthritis; and 21 healthy persons for the presence of tenascin-X and tenascin-C by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We examined the expression of tenascins and type V collagen in skin by immunohistochemical methods and sequenced the tenascin-X gene. Tenascin-X was present in serum from all normal subjects, all patients with psoriasis, all patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and 146 of 151 patients with the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Tenascin-X was absent from the serum of the 5 remaining patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, who were unrelated. Tenascin-X deficiency was confirmed in these patients by analysis of skin fibroblasts and by immunostaining of skin. The expression of tenascin-C and type V collagen was normal in these patients. All five of these patients had hypermobile joints, hyperelastic skin, and easy bruising, without atrophic scarring. Tenascin-X mutations were identified in all tenascin-X-deficient patients; one patient had a homozygous tenascin-X gene deletion, one was heterozygous for the deletion, and three others had homozygous truncating point mutations, confirming a causative role for tenascin-X and a recessive pattern of inheritance. Tenascin-X deficiency causes a clinically distinct, recessive form of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. This finding indicates that factors other than the collagens or collagen-processing enzymes can cause the syndrome and suggests a central role for tenascin-X in maintaining the integrity of collagenous matrix.

Article: People born in winter are more likely to suffer mental health disorders, according to a recent study carried out by researchers at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. Researchers raised baby mice from birth to weaning in either \\"summer\\" light cycles of 16 hours of light and 8 hours of dark or \\"winter\\" cycles of 8 hours of light and 16 hours of dark. A third group experienced 12 hours of light and 12 hours of dark a day. Then half the winter mice stayed in a winter cycle, while half switched to a summer schedule. The summer mice were similarly _ . The mice raised in equal periods of light and dark were split into three groups, one of which stayed on the 12hour schedule, one of which joined the winter group, and one of which joined the summer group. After 28 days, it turns out the summerborn mice behaved the same whether they stayed on the summer cycle or switched to winter. But among the winterborn mice, those stayed in winter kept their previous schedule, while those that switched to summer stayed active for an extra hour and a half, which indicates that mice born and weaned in a winter light cycle showed dramatic disruptions in their biological clocks. The finding is the first of its kind in mammals, and it could explain why people born in winter are at higher risk for mental health disorders including bipolar depression, schizophrenia and seasonal affective disorder. \\"We know that the biological clock regulates mood in humans,\\"said study researcher McMahon. \\"If the mechanism similar to the one that we found in mice operates in humans, then it could not only have an effect on a number of behavioral disorders, but also have a more general effect on personality.\\" Question: Who is the appropriate reader of the passage?

Thousands of people have been evacuated from across the central Philippines today with what is expected to be the year's strongest typhoon set to strike the region in the early hours of tomorrow morning. Typhoon Haiyan has intensified and accelerated as it moves closer to the country with sustained winds of 225kph (140 mph) and ferocious gusts of 260 kph (162 mph). One of the areas expected to be hit is the province of Bohol which was devastated by an earthquake last month. Incoming: Typhoon Haiyan gather momentum as it moves towards the Philippines. The U.S. Navy believes it is the strongest typhoon so far this year. Preparation: Filipino fishermen haul a wooden boat ashore in in Ormoc city in the island of Leyte as Typhoon Haiyan approaches. Impact: The Typhoon is expected to hit the coast of the Philippines at 9am on Friday morning. Haiyan could further strengthen and pick up speed as it moves over the Pacific Ocean before slamming into the eastern province of Samar early Friday, government forecaster Buddy Javier said. As of 9pm the eye of the typhoon was 338 kilometers (211 miles) southeast of Eastern Samar province's Guiuan township. The storm was moving at 39kph (24mph), up from its earlier speed of 33 kph (20mph). The storm was not expected to directly hit Manila further north. The lowest alert in a four-level typhoon warning system was issued in the flood-prone capital area, meaning it could experience winds of up to 60 kph (37 mph) and rain. The U.S. Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Hawaii said it was the strongest tropical cyclone in the world this year. Cyclone Phailin, which hit eastern India on Oct. 12, packed sustained winds of up to 222 kph (138 mph) and stronger gusts. President Benigno Aquino III warned people to leave high-risk areas, including 100 coastal communities where forecasters said the storm surge could reach up to seven meters (23 feet). He urged seafarers to stay in port. Authorities warned more than 12 million people were at risk from Haiyan which is more powerful than the typhoon which hit India last month. President Benigno Aquino III warned people to leave high-risk areas, including 100 coastal communities where forecasters said the storm surge could reach up to 7 meters. Thousands have been evacuated from across the central Philippines wiith Typhoon Haiyan expected to bring ferocious gusts of 260kph. Aquino also assured the public of war-like preparations: three C-130 air force cargo planes and 32 military helicopters and planes on standby, along with 20 navy ships. 'No typhoon can bring Filipinos to their knees if we'll be united,' he said in a televised address. Governors and mayors supervised the evacuation of landslide- and flood-prone communities in several provinces where the typhoon is expected to pass, said Eduardo del Rosario, head of the government's main disaster-response agency. School classes and plane flights were canceled in many areas. Aquino ordered officials to aim for zero casualties, a goal often not met in an archipelago lashed by about 20 tropical storms each year, most of them deadly and destructive. Haiyan is the 24th such storm to hit the Philippines this year. Edgardo Chatto, governor of Bohol island province in the central Philippines, where an earthquake in October killed more than 200 people, said soldiers, police and rescue units were helping displaced residents, including thousands staying in small tents, move to shelters. Bohol is not forecast to receive a direct hit but is expected to be battered by strong winds and rain, government forecaster Jori Loiz said. 'My worst fear is that the eye of this typhoon will hit us. I hope we will be spared,' Chatto told The Associated Press by telephone. One of the areas expected to be hit is the province of Bohol which was devastated by an earthquake last month. Gov. Roger Mercado of landslide-prone Southern Leyte province said more than 6,000 residents had been evacuated to shelters, government and emergency personnel had been put on alert, and relief goods have been packed for distribution. 'All we are doing now is we are praying, praying hard,' he told ABS-CBN News Channel. Mayor Emiliana Villacarillo of Eastern Samar's Dolores township said residents of her town did not want to be evacuated because the weather was fine on. Thursday but 'we forced them and hauled them to evacuation centers.'

Q:Given the following context: Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig. In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias. Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\". answer the following question: What is the full name of the person that studied at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig? A:","completion":"The full name of the person that studied at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig is Reinhard Keiser. He was born in 1674 and had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Who Cares? Illustration by Harry Campbell for TIME Though global equities have rallied modestly after a sharp plunge in May and June and companies have announced strong earnings, sentiment about the future remains gloomy. In response to intense concerns about a looming double-dip recession, business leaders have complained to White House officials that government policy is inhibiting job creation and that uncertainty about new regulations is discouraging them from investing their 1.8 trillion in accumulated corporate cash. On the flip side, Democrats in Congress effectively cornered the Republicans to extend unemployment benefits yet again, a direct response to the undeniable fact that the unemployed are facing a severe challenge to find work. What should be most striking about these concerns, however, is how little they matter. A double dip is a period of economic contraction that follows a brief recovery after a recession. It's a useful prop for framing economic and political debates but doesn't describe what's actually happening across the country. The reality is that if you are doing well in this economy, either as a company or an individual, you will continue to do well regardless of a statistical double dip. If you are doing badly, you will continue to struggle whether or not the economic data are improving. (See 10 big recession surprises.) GDP has been expanding since the third quarter of last year, graced by government spending and a steady though diminished level of domestic consumption. But as we all know, that growth  5.6% in the fourth quarter of last year and 2.7% in the first quarter of this year  has been accompanied by high unemployment and little job creation. In short, this has been an economic recovery that has felt like a continued recession. That's because for a significant portion of the population, it is a continued recession. Not only is the real unemployment rate (combining workers who have dropped out of the workforce and the headline numbers, together with workers classified as marginally attached to the workforce) in the midteens, but the amount of hours worked has declined, as have many incomes. If you combine that with the scarcity of consumer credit and the uncertainty about the social safety net, tens of millions of Americans are facing a grave economic future. Particularly for men who lack a college education and were or are in an industry that depends on manual labor (construction and manufacturing above all), this is a perilous time. But for tens of millions of others, there is no recession. For the college-educated, the unemployment rate is 4.4% (for college-educated women, less than that). For them, wages have been rising, since more-skilled workers command higher salaries and industries ranging from technology to health care have been hiring and expanding. Those workers are enjoying  in relative moderation  the fruits of modern society, including owning homes, buying millions of cool gadgets like iPhones and BlackBerrys, taking summer vacations, sending their children to costly but worthy colleges and worrying over their retirement accounts, which means that they have retirement accounts to worry about. (See the best business deals of 2009.) And then there are millions of others who fall on the spectrum in between. Very few of these groupings will be altered by a double-dip recession. If the economy expands by 3% over the next quarters, there is little indication that the millions currently struggling or the many more in limbo will suddenly be less in limbo. Nor is there any reason to suppose that companies will suddenly start hiring again. They have integrated productivity-enhancing technologies, understand the dynamics of inventories and had been trimming workforces for years before the 2008-09 crisis. Better policy from Washington won't change that; nor is worse policy truly the cause of it, though it is a convenient excuse. On the flip side, if the economy contracts a bit, there is no reason to expect fewer iPads will be bought. After all, save for a brief few months at the very end of 2008 and the very beginning of 2009, the economic activity of the haves showed remarkable resilience. While contraction will lead to more negative sentiment, sentiment is already negative and is not a reliable indicator of activity. People can feel bad and spend money  and often do. So the double-dip question is yet another rabbit hole that distracts from the structural realities and challenges that the U.S.  and the rest of the world  faces. The debate speaks to a false belief that our macro statistics tell us something truly meaningful when in fact they are no better than shadows of shadows that offer at best a blurry facsimile. Until we begin to have a discussion about the multiple economies that constitute the U.S., our attitudes and our answers will fail to generate the desired  and shared  outcome of a more secure and prosperous future for all. See TIME's Pictures of the Week. See the Cartoons of the Week. Summary:","completion":"Despite global equities rallying after a plunge in May and June, concerns about a double-dip recession remain. Many business leaders express that government policy inhibits job creation and that uncertainty about new regulations discourages investment. However, this article argues that a double-dip recession may not have a significant impact on certain population groups. For the college-educated, unemployment remains low and wages are rising. On the other hand, for a significant portion of the population, especially those without a college education, the situation remains challenging. The article suggests that the focus should shift towards addressing the structural realities faced by the US instead of getting distracted by the double-dip question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which happened first, the defeat of the Teutonic Knights or the Livonian Order inheritance?","completion":"Title: The Defeat of the Teutonic Knights vs. The Livonian Order Inheritance: A Historical Analysis Introduction The histories of the Teutonic Knights and the Livonian Order are entwined, marked by their shared journeys through the medieval era and their participation in the Northern Crusades. Both orders emerged as dominant forces in the Baltic region, shaping the religious, political, and social landscapes of the time with lasting consequences. In this article, we will explore the chronological relations between two of the most significant events within these orders' histories – the defeat of the Teutonic Knights and the inheritance of the Livonian Order. To better understand the context of these events, we must first delve into the evolution and background of the two orders. The Teutonic Knights and Livonian Order: A Brief Background The Teutonic Knights, officially known as the Order of Brothers of the German House of Saint Mary in Jerusalem, were formed in 1190 during the Third Crusade in the Holy Land. As a Catholic religious-military order, they played a significant role in the ensuing Northern Crusades, fighting alongside secular crusaders and other religious orders like the Livonian Order. Their primary goal was the conversion of pagan populations to Christianity in the Baltic region. Similarly, the Livonian Order, established in 1237, emerged after the merger of two previous religious military orders – the Livonian Brothers of the Sword and the Order of Dobrzyń. They maintained a primary focus on the Baltic region, seeking to convert the local populations and exert political influence. The Livonian Order operated under the Teutonic Knights' authority, but functioned independently within its own geographical territories, which included present-day Latvia and Estonia. The Defeat of the Teutonic Knights The downfall of the Teutonic Knights can be traced back to the Battle of Grunwald, also known as the First Battle of Tannenberg, which took place on July 15, 1410. This pivotal battle was fought between the combined forces of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, led by King Władysław II Jagiełło and Grand Duke Vytautas the Great, respectively. They faced off against the Teutonic Knights, led by Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen. The battle was a result of ongoing tensions and territorial disputes between the Teutonic Knights and the Polish-Lithuanian alliance. At the Battle of Grunwald, the Teutonic Knights suffered a crushing defeat, with heavy casualties and the death of Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen. Following the battle, the weakened position of the Teutonic Knights and subsequent pressure from the Polish-Lithuanian forces led to the Treaty of Toruń, signed on February 1, 1411. The treaty forced the order to cede significant territories and make considerable indemnity payments, ultimately causing a decline in their political and military influence in the region. The Livonian Order Inheritance The Livonian Order's inheritance refers to the series of events that led to the eventual dissolution of the order and the incorporation of its territories into other regional powers. This process began in the early 16th century with the onset of the Reformation, which led to the erosion of the Livonian Order's religious authority and support from the Catholic Church. Furthermore, the rise of neighboring powers, such as the Kingdom of Poland, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Kingdom of Sweden, and the Tsardom of Russia, posed a significant threat to the Livonian Order's territorial integrity. The situation escalated in 1558 when the Livonian War began, lasting from 1558 to 1583, and involving the aforementioned regional powers in a struggle for control over the territories of the Livonian Order. The order was ultimately unable to withstand the pressures of the war, leading to its dissolution in 1561. With its dissolution, the last Master of the Livonian Order, Gotthard Kettler, secularized the order's remaining territories, which became the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, a vassal state to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Conclusion It is evident that the defeat of the Teutonic Knights predates the inheritance of the Livonian Order. The former occurred in the early 15th century with the Battle of Grunwald in 1410 and the subsequent Treaty of Toruń in 1411, which significantly weakened the Teutonic Knights' power in the Baltic region. Meanwhile, the latter event took place in the middle of the 16th century, with the Livonian War between 1558 and 1583 resulting in the order's dissolution and the incorporation of its territories into other regional powers. Although both events are integral to understanding the history and evolution of the Teutonic Knights and the Livonian Order, it is crucial to acknowledge their distinct chronological positioning and the unique factors that precipitated each event."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mary, a baby girl, suffered from colic, whereas Patricia, also a baby girl, did not, so it was quite difficult to console","completion":"Mary during her sleepless nights. Patricia, on the other hand, was a happy, easy-going baby who slept through most nights, leaving her parents fairly well-rested. Mary's parents, Sarah and Tom, had tried every trick in the book to soothe her - swaddling, white noise machines, and even driving around the neighborhood to lull her to sleep. No amount of gentle rocking or warm baths seemed to alleviate her discomfort. They even consulted pediatricians and baby experts, only to be told that the colic would eventually pass with time. Overwhelmed and exhausted, Sarah and Tom sought help from their family and friends, who suggested various home remedies and techniques to alleviate Mary's colic pains. Although some of these suggestions showed momentary relief for Mary, none provided a long-lasting solution. At wit's end, Sarah stumbled upon a local support group for parents with colicky babies. With a glimmer of hope, she decided to join the group in search of a solution to help Mary. At the support group meetings, Sarah met several other parents who shared their own experiences and offered advice on how to cope with the stress of caring for a colicky baby. As weeks went by, Sarah soon became close friends with several parents in the group, particularly Laura, who also had a colicky baby named Emily. Laura was a single mother who had recently moved to the city for a new job. Despite the challenges they faced, the mothers bonded over their shared experiences, the laughter, and the tears, and they began to lean on each other for strength and support. As time went on, Laura and Sarah decided to schedule weekly playdates for their babies, hoping that they could learn from each other, find ways to calm their little ones, and give one another much-needed emotional support. During one of these playdates, at a local community center, Mary and Emily were both fussy with colic. Sarah had noticed a small room designed for babies and toddlers attached to the play area, filled with soft toys, cushions, and dim lighting. Figuring it would be worth a try, she asked the play area attendant if it would be possible for them to spend some time in the room with their babies. Thankfully, the attendant agreed. Once they settled in the dimly-lit room with their babies lying on the soft cushions, Sarah and Laura noticed a child therapist quietly observing them from a corner. The therapist introduced herself as Dr. Karen Rivers and revealed that she specialized in helping families with colicky babies. She offered a few relaxation techniques that the two mothers could try to alleviate the colic pains with minimal intervention. One helpful suggestion from Dr. Rivers was to swaddle both Mary and Emily, placing them upright on their laps while gently stroking their babies' backs in a circular motion. Surprisingly, after a few minutes, the babies started to calm down. This simple, yet effective technique released tension in their tiny muscles, which in turn eased the colic discomfort. Another method recommended by Dr. Rivers was to softly hum a lullaby to help regulate the babies' breathing patterns. Sarah and Laura noticed a significant change in their daughters' crying soon after they implemented this technique. The chest-to-chest contact in the upright position, while humming the lullaby, created a soothing environment that helped them establish a stronger emotional connection with their babies. Over time, these connections fostered a sense of safety and security in both Mary and Emily, leading to fewer episodes of colic and fussiness. Over the next several months, Sarah and Laura continued to see Dr. Rivers while attending support group meetings and playdates with their babies. Their friendship deepened over time as they experienced the joys and challenges of motherhood together. As their babies began to outgrow the colic, Mary and Emily slowly developed into content, curious toddlers who brought untold joy to their dedicated and resilient mothers. The journey had been arduous, but through their shared experiences, Sarah and Laura had found strength in each other and managed to navigate the stormy waters of colic with Mary and Patricia. Their friendship, born from the support group, blossomed into a lifelong bond that would ultimately change the lives of both families in ways they never could have imagined."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: TWIN FALLS • It often takes a lot of work to catch a burglar, but sometimes criminals make it easy for investigators. A Twin Falls burglary suspect returned to the scene of the crime Saturday looking for keys and a cellphone he dropped during the heist, police say. Caleb Shay Funke, 22, was arraigned Monday in Twin Falls County Magistrate Court on two charges of burglaries and one charge of grand-theft. A woman called police about 2:30 p.m. saying she’d arrived home on the 200 block of Sixth Avenue North to find her back door open and her house ransacked, police said. Cupboards were open, books and paper were scattered, a file-cabinet was pried open and an unfamiliar cellphone was left on the bed. A silver 2007 Chevrolet Cobalt was parked behind the house, where police said they could see cash and jewelry on the passenger seat. While officers were still at the house investigating, a woman drove up behind the car and dropped Funke off, police said. Funke told officers he let a friend borrow the car and the keys ended up locked inside, court documents said. He said he had arranged for a locksmith to come unlock the car. As Funke spoke with police, a resident of the burglarized house came out with some keys, saying they didn’t belong to anyone in the house, court documents said. An officer unlocked and started the car with the keys. Funke said he wasn’t the burglar but knew who was. His story didn’t add up, so police arrested him. When officers patted him down they found a piece of jewelry in his pocket belonging to the homeowner. Her cellphone was in his car, police said. Police say Funke is also a suspect in two other Saturday burglaries. A house on the 500 block of Washington Street North had a window broken out and was left in disarray, court documents said. Footprints found near both the garage and the backdoor matched the slippers Funke was wearing when he was arrested, police said. Another house was burglarized in the 1000 block of Wirsching Avenue West, police said. The homeowner’s daughter said she noticed bags of change missing and police found checks and a credit card from the home inside the Cobalt, court documents said. In an interview with police, Funke admitted to being involved with all three burglaries, court documents said. He said he burglarized the house on Wirsching Avenue and was a lookout for a friend for the Sixth Avenue burglary. Funke said he accidentally broke the window on Washington Street and was only there because he thought his friends lived there, police said. After climbing into the house he figured his friends must have moved and left without taking anything, court documents said. Funke’s bond was set at 5,000 and a preliminary hearing is scheduled for Sept. 25. ||||| Hello, Im Craig Nabat, President of Ambitious Ideas, Inc., and inventor of FINDIT® -- the most innovative and easy-to-use locating device that attaches via adhesive strip or key ring to any of your commonly lost household items such as car keys, cellular phones, remote controls, electronic organizers, eyeglass cases, purses, and anything you tend to misplace.

Premier Li Keqiang has said the US election \\"has been lively and has caught the eye\\", but many in China see it as more than that. They see the flamboyant New York billionaire as an inspiration rather than an antagonist. We talk about free trade. It's not tree free trade, it's stupid trade. China dumps everything that they have over here....\\" Even before Mr Trump declared his intention to run for the presidency, the name Trump was well known in China. In Henan province, there is a property management consulting firm called Trump Consulting. It has no connection with Mr Trump, but says on its website it is inspired by his property empire. There is also a company in southern China, Shenzhen Trump Industries, that produces smart toilet seats and bathroom fixtures for high-end hotels, and Trump Electronics, a company based in eastern Anhui Province, has been making air purifiers since 1996, according to People's Daily. Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump has more than 14,000 fans on microblogging site Sina Weibo. There is also a Trump Weibo fan page that is dedicated to \\"everything Trump\\". There is no reliable opinion poll on how Mr Trump's comments are received in China, but state media are watching him with a degree of schadenfreude. A recent Xinhua report said his rise showed \\"the limitations of the 'democracy' that Americans have long boasted about\\". After he won a huge margin in Super Tuesday primaries, state-owned newspaper Global Times ran an English-language piece saying it was \\"solid proof that US voters are tired of Washington politics\\". \\"It is probably on this point that Chinese public finds Trump somewhat more agreeable,\\" wrote Ai Jun. But he added that \\"in the normal run of events, Chinese people should reject an arrogant, hawkish candidate like him out of hand\\". Last week, the newspaper went further, issuing a stern warning that \\"the rise of a racist in the US political arena worries the whole world\\". \\"The US had better watch itself for not being a source of destructive forces against world peace, rather than pointing fingers at other countries for their so-called nationalism and tyranny.\\" They tell me, 'You can't really build a wall, can you?'

Shanghai-based corporate lawyer Wei Li, who spent 10 years living in the US, tells the BBC that Mr Trump \\"is really speaking for heartland Americans, and he is a rare politician who speaks in plain English\\". Mr Li says American election politics is \\"like a theatre\\" and rational politics will ultimately triumph over rhetoric. \\"Trump's pragmatism, his access to information, his smartness as well as good counsel may translate into good decisions, should he win,\\" he says. Sijia Liu, a veteran radio host and commentator who has millions of daily listeners in Beijing, agrees. \\"Perhaps Trump will be the president who makes politics understandable to ordinary people,\\" Ms Liu says. \\"In America, even though you are the president, you cannot behave recklessly.\\" \\"So I wouldn't worry that Trump might become a bad president.\\" A recent widely circulated article on Chinese messaging network WeChat also provides some insights into the Trump phenomenon. In it, author Wan Weigang claimed he read Mr Trump's book - Crippled America: How to Make America Great Again - and concluded that, among all Republican candidates, his political ideas were actually \\"the mildest\\". In other words, Mr Wan thinks Mr Trump is not as hawkish as he appears to be. \\"Before Obama became president, he wrote a book called The Audacity of Hope, and he used 'change' in his first term and 'hope' in the second to galvanise Americans,\\" he continues. \\"But what kind of change and hope that Obama has brought to Americans? Where is his audacity now? Americans have already been bored of such politicians.\\" I would get China to make [Kim Jong Un] disappear in one form or another very quickly.\\" Even among the Chinese diaspora, who might have been put off by Mr Trump's views on race and immigration, there is some admiration. \\"Many people are having a hard time understanding why Trump is so popular, or have the misconception that people who support him are poorly educated, white and angry males,\\" says Wendy Wang. Ms Wang moved to the US from China at the age of 25 and became a naturalised American citizen three years ago. She holds a PhD degree and is a professor at a private California university. Ms Wang tells the BBC she will \\"definitely\\" vote for Donald Trump as she sees him as \\"the medicine America needs\\". I asked what exactly it is about Mr Trump that appeals to her.

An inquest held into the circumstances of the fatal crash revealed that the pilot lost his life when his aircraft broke into multiple pieces and plummeted to the ground during a public airshow. The accident has left the aviation community and the pilot's family and friends in shock, while authorities continue to investigate the cause behind the disaster. Inquest Details During the official inquest conducted in Cheshire, it became clear that the unthinkable happened: the small aircraft, which was one of the main attractions at the renowned event, started falling from the sky after disintegrating into multiple pieces mid-air. Evidently, there was no chance for the pilot to regain control or eject from the ill-fated plane. The tragic incident took place in front of a stunned audience who had gathered in great numbers that day to enjoy the exhilarating maneuvers performed by seasoned pilots and their incredible flying machines. Authorities are still uncertain about what caused the aircraft to break apart, and the ongoing investigation will aim to provide answers to this deeply distressing occurrence. In the meantime, the aviation community has been offering its condolences and support to the family and friends of the deceased pilot, while reflecting on the inherent risks of their passion for flying. Eyewitness Accounts Several spectators at the Cheshire event witnessed the horrible scene with their own eyes. Many reported that initially, they could not comprehend what was happening when they saw the small aircraft suddenly disintegrate and begin to fall. As the horrifying reality of the situation settled in, the crowd was left in shock and despair. Emergency services were immediately dispatched to the crash site; however, there was little they could do. The pilot was pronounced dead at the scene - the tragic result of a day meant for celebration and enjoyment. The Pilot Out of respect for the family's request during this sensitive period, the identity of the pilot has not been made public. What is known, however, is that the man was an experienced aviator who was passionate about his profession and had the respect and admiration of his peers. Fellow pilots and the wider aviation community have found it difficult to process the sudden loss of their comrade. Raising Questions and Ensuring Safety While airshows are typically events that showcase the incredible capabilities of aircraft and the skill of the pilots who fly them, accidents like the one in Cheshire serve as a humbling reminder of the risks involved in performing such death-defying maneuvers closer to the ground. This tragic crash has raised concerns about the safety measures in place for these types of events, and it is expected that further scrutiny will be placed on the industry by both authorities and the public in the aftermath of the incident. In Conclusion As the Cheshire airshow community and the pilot's loved ones come to terms with the gravity of the loss, the onus is on the industry to examine and reassess the safety protocols and checks to prevent any such future tragedies. As we pay tribute to the bravery and skill of the pilots who entertained and amazed us, we must also remember that the sky is a domain that demands the utmost respect and caution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bin Laden and his aides did not need a very large sum to finance their planned attack on America. The 9/11 plotters eventually spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. Consistent with the importance of the project, al Qaeda funded the plotters. KSM provided his operatives with nearly all the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live. The plotters' tradecraft was not especially sophisticated, but it was good enough. They moved, stored, and spent their money in ordinary ways, easily defeating the detection mechanisms in place at the time. The origin of the funds remains unknown, although we have a general idea of how al Qaeda financed itself during the period leading up to 9/11. General Financing As we explained in chapter 2, Bin Laden did not fund al Qaeda through a personal fortune and a network of businesses in Sudan. Instead, al Qaeda relied primarily on a fund-raising network developed over time. The CIA now estimates that it cost al Qaeda about 30 million per year to sustain its activities before 9/11 and that this money was raised almost entirely through donations. For many years, the United States thought Bin Laden financed al Qaeda's expenses through a vast personal inheritance. Bin Laden purportedly inherited approximately 300 million when his father died, and was rumored to have had access to these funds to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position in al Qaeda. In early 2000, the U.S. government discovered a different reality: roughly from 1970 through 1994, Bin Laden received about 1 million per year-a significant sum, to be sure, but not a 300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad. Then, as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the 1990s, the Bin Laden family was forced to find a buyer for Usama's share of the family company in 1994. The Saudi government subsequently froze the proceeds of the sale. This action had the effect of divesting Bin Laden of what otherwise might indeed have been a large fortune. Nor were Bin Laden's assets in Sudan a source of money for al Qaeda. When Bin Laden lived in Sudan from 1991 to 1996, he owned a number of businesses and other assets. Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"How did the tradecraft of each of the 9/11 plotters go to fund the terrorist activities of 9/11?\\" is \\"By funneling business fortunes into terrorist activity\\"?

If \\"A man wearing cutoff shorts, a tank top, and green sneakers sitting in a garden with a beer.\\", does it logically follow that \\"a casually dressed man sits in the garden\\"?","completion":"Yes, it does logically follow that \\"a casually dressed man sits in the garden\\" when given the description \\"A man wearing cutoff shorts, a tank top, and green sneakers sitting in a garden with a beer.\\" Let's break down the initial description to understand why: 1. \\"A man wearing cutoff shorts, a tank top, and green sneakers\\": This part of the description talks about the attire of the man, which includes cutoff shorts, a tank top, and green sneakers. All of these clothing items are considered casual wear, indicating that the man is not dressed formally. In general, cutoff shorts and tank tops are relaxing attire typically worn during warm weather for comfort and ease of movement. Sneakers, especially those in bright or unusual colors like green, are also informal footwear. Hence, we can infer that the man is casually dressed. 2. \\"...sitting in a garden...\\": This element of the description informs us that the man is situated within a garden, which is an outdoor area mainly comprising of plants, flowers, and other natural elements. Gardens are often spaces where people go to relax, reflect, enjoy nature, or engage in leisurely activities. Thus, it makes sense that a person would be casually dressed while sitting in a garden. 3. \\"...with a beer.\\": The presence of a beer implies that the man is likely engaged in a leisurely activity, as beer is often consumed during social gatherings, recreational events, or simply to relax and unwind. This additional detail further supports the notion that the man is casually dressed, as it matches the informal setting and activity. Taking all of these factors into account, it becomes clear that the given description indeed supports the conclusion that \\"a casually dressed man sits in the garden.\\" The attire, location, and activity all align with the image of a man dressed informally and engaging in casual, relaxing pursuits within a garden setting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer B: wanted to have play-time might be a potential scenario, but it does not directly answer the question about what Addison might do after adding to their collection. Additionally, the context provided specifies that Addison collects toy frogs, which could mean they simply enjoy collecting and admiring the items rather than playing with them.

Article: Just as some people think that certain numbers are lucky or unlucky, others believe that we can use numbers to understand our personalities, or predict what will happen to us in the future. Numerology is a way of using numbers to describe a person's character, and to make predictions about future life events. Numerologists use the numbers 1-9, 11 and 22 -- also known as the \\"master\\" numbers -- to help a person understand his or her personality, life goals, and destiny. Numerologists consider yourLife Path number to be the most significant because this number describes your character. To find this number, add together all the numbers in your date of birth. For example, a person born on April 25, 1985 would add the month (4), to the numbers of the date (2+5), plus the numbers of the birth year (1+9+8+5). In this case the total is 34, so this person's life path number is 7(3+4). Numerologists believe that people with this number are peaceful and affectionate but can also be very reserved. Your Expression numberdescribes your talents and predicts how you should use these to fulfill your destiny in life. Numerologists assign a number between 1 and 9 to each of the letters in your name. These numbers are then added together in the same way as before to find your Expression number. Numerologists can also do calculations to predict when the most challenging periods of your life will be. Numerologists also believe that the day a person is born is important. Each day of the month has a character description. People born on the fourth are said to be responsible, honest, and stubborn. People born on the fifteenth have very strong attachments to family and home. Those who celebrate their birthday on the thirtieth are artistic, creative, and imaginative, and often make good writers.

This is because holding a gauze pad over a gaping wound can be quite an overwhelming and distressing experience, especially for someone who is trying hard not to faint.

Problem:Problem: a merchant marks goods up by 80 % and then offers a discount on the marked price . the profit that the merchant makes after offering the discount is 35 % . what % discount did the merchant offer ? Options: a ) 20 % , b ) 25 % , c ) 30 % , d ) 35 % , e ) 40 % Solution:","completion":"Let's break down the problem and find the solution step-by-step. 1. The merchant marks up the goods by 80%. So, if the cost price (CP) of the goods is 100, the marked price (MP) will be 100 + (80% of 100) = 180. 2. The merchant makes a profit of 35% even after giving a discount. So, the selling price (SP) should be 135 (100 + 35% of 100). 3. Now, we'll find the discount percentage offered by the merchant. To do this, we'll set up an equation: MP - discount = SP 4. Plugging in the values, we get: 180 - discount = 135 5. Solving for the discount, we find that the discount is 45 (180 - 135). 6. Now, we'll calculate the discount percentage using the following formula: (discount / MP) * 100 7. Plugging in the values, we get: (45 / 180) * 100 = 25 % So, the merchant offered a 25% discount on the marked price. Solution: b) 25%"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I got sap in my hair and had a bad time getting it out, so we had to shave the","completion":"rest of my hair off. I never thought I'd sport a bald look, but there I was, standing in front of the bathroom mirror, nervously holding the electric razor. Step 1: Charge the electric razor Before I could continue, I needed to make sure the razor was fully charged. I didn't want it dying halfway through shaving my head. I plugged it in and waited for the charging indicator to show that it was ready. Step 2: Set up the work area Next, I needed to set up the bathroom to minimize the mess that the shaving process would surely create. I placed a large towel on the floor to catch the falling hair, and I also prepared a damp washcloth to clean off any excess hair from my face and neck during the process. Step 3: Choose the right guard setting Since I was going for a complete shave, I selected the lowest guard setting on my electric razor. This would ensure that all the hairs were cut to the same, very short length. Step 4: Start shaving Taking a deep breath to calm my nerves, I turned on the razor and began shaving my head. I started near the sap-entangled hair and slowly worked my way around the entirety of my scalp. I used smooth, steady strokes, being careful to not press too hard and potentially cut my skin. Step 5: Double-check for missed spots After having gone over my entire head, I thoroughly inspected it in the mirror to make sure I didn't miss any spots. I also asked a friend to take a look at the back of my head, as it was difficult for me to see it on my own. They pointed out a few areas I had missed, and I carefully went over them with the razor. Step 6: Clean up and wash my scalp Once I was satisfied that my head was completely shaved, I turned off the electric razor and carefully brushed away any stray hairs from my face and neck. I then shook out the towel on the bathroom floor, disposing of the hair clippings in the trash. Finally, I cleaned the bathroom sink and floor to remove any remaining hair. Step 7: Take care of my newly shaved scalp I knew that my scalp might be sensitive after the shave, so I gently washed it with a mild shampoo and moisturized it with a hypoallergenic lotion. To protect my head from the sun, I made a mental note to wear a hat or sunscreen whenever I went outside. In the end, the bald look wasn't as bad as I had initially thought. It was certainly a change, but one that I grew to appreciate. I even started to embrace my new look and the freedom it provided – no more worrying about styling my hair or getting sap stuck in it again!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Only a third of UK homes currently have a carbon monoxide alarm, while just one in five people realise the gas can kill, according to a new study. Campaigners are trying to cut the annual toll of deaths and injuries caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, which saw 4,000 Britons treated in hospital last year alone. Experts warned that carbon monoxide poisoning, which killed at least 50 in the UK last year, is often unrecognised because its early symptoms can be easily mistaken for tiredness, flu or food poisoning. Faulty boilers are one of the most common causes of carbon monoxide poisoning. Christine McGourty of Carbon Monoxide - Be Alarmed! said: 'We are urging people to go out and buy an alarm now - but there are also two simple steps we'd like the Government to take. 'Firstly, building regulations should be amended so that new homes come with alarms already installed. Secondly, providing an alarm should be part of a landlord's annual gas safety inspection.' Inhaling carbon monoxide reduces the blood's ability to carry oxygen, leaving the body's organs and cells starved of oxygen. It can lead to severe confusion, coma and death. Early symptoms such as nausea, stomach cramps and dizziness are often mistaken for flu or food poisoning. However, carbon monoxide does not cause a high temperature. The gas has no colour, taste or smell the only effective way to detect it is with an audible alarm. Carbon monoxide is produced when fuels such as gas, oil, charcoal, coal and wood do not burn fully. The most common cause of this is when appliances such as a boiler or cooker is installed incorrectly or is poorly maintained. Carbon monoxide can also build up when flues, chimneys or vents are blocked. Alarms are available from many DIY. stores, supermarkets, high street shops or directly from energy. suppliers. They can cost as little as £15 and many retailers will be. offering special discounts in support of the campaign. Research. carried out last month found that 63% of UK homes do not have a carbon. monoxide alarm and 78% of people do not know that the gas can kill. The poll of 2,001 adults was conducted by ICM, on September 26 and 27. Zonera Rehman, an HR advisor from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, said a carbon monoxide leak in her home put her whole family in grave danger, earlier this year... We could have died: Zonera with her husband and two sons. They already had their boiler checked each year but didn't have a carbon monoxide alarm. Mrs Rehman, 30, said: 'It was the school Easter holidays and we had just returned from a week away in Stoke on Trent when my husband and our two boys - Zachariah (4) and Zain (2) first started to feel unwell. 'It had been a really hectic week and we had done a lot of travelling so when we all started to feel tired, at first we simply put it down to normal fatigue. But then the tiredness became much more severe - at one stage I could hardly keep my head up I was so drowsy, and my four year old son who is usually full of beans was sleeping all the time. 'My husband, who is really fit and active, was napping in the day, something I had never known him to do. I would never describe us as a ‘couch potato family’, so when things hadn’t changed after four days, we realised that something was up. 'It was my husband who first thought about the possibility of carbon monoxide poisoning, and on a hunch he bought an alarm. When we turned it on, the alarm went off immediately and kept going off. 'Despite this, we still didn’t quite believe it as we had no problems with our heating or water. My husband decided to buy another alarm – one that showed carbon monoxide levels so we could be absolutely sure. 'When this showed really high levels, we immediately called the gas board and a plumber. The gas man turned off the gas and when the plumber arrived he tested the levels of carbon monoxide in our home. Normal levels are around 10 - our levels were above 200. Life savers: Campaigners have urged more homeowners to install carbon monoxide alarms after it was revealed one in five don't realise it can kill. 'It was a fault with our boiler than had caused the carbon monoxide leak. We did all the right things and got our boiler checked every year, so it just goes to show you can never be sure you are safe unless you have an alarm. 'After we realised what the problem was we evacuated our home and stayed at my mother in laws. After a week, we returned home. We now have two carbon monoxide alarms, which we test almost every day. 'I feel so lucky that we are all alive. It was unusual for all four of us to be home together for that amount of time – if it wasn’t the school holidays it is likely we wouldn’t have realised what the problem was in time. 'The doctor told us there was high change we could have all died in our sleep. There is not a day that goes by that I don’t think about what could have happened. 'The fact that the highest levels of carbon monoxide were found in my oldest son’s bedroom still sends shivers down my spine. The thought that I was so close to losing a child will haunt me forever.'

Which sister did not have a disease in which a blood protein called hemoglobin is produced incorrectly? Two sisters named Mary and Ann went in for a blood test and found out that Mary had sickle cell anemia. Ann was normal. Hint: Another example of incomplete dominance is with sickle cell anemia, a disease in which a blood protein called hemoglobin is produced incorrectly. This causes the red blood cells to have a sickle shape, making it difficult for these misshapen cells to pass through the smallest blood vessels. A person that is homozygous recessive ( ss ) for the sickle cell trait will have red blood cells that all have the incorrect hemoglobin. A person who is homozygous dominant ( SS ) will have normal red blood cells. Answer:","completion":"Ann is the sister who did not have a disease in which a blood protein called hemoglobin is produced incorrectly. In the provided paragraph, it is mentioned that Mary had sickle cell anemia, which is the disease caused by the incorrect production of hemoglobin. This information implies that Ann, in contrast, had normal blood test results and did not have sickle cell anemia.

Article: What a Scientist Is Like If you were asked to imagine a scientist, what image would come to your mind? The common idea that most kids from kindergarten through college have of a scientist is a man wearing a white lab coat with messy hair, big glasses, and several glass cups of mysterious color1ful liquids giving off clouds of smoke. As for adults, the majority view scientists as strange people who spend 100 hours a week slaving away in a lonely laboratory. However, the reality is quite different. Recently I've had a chance to take part in a scientific experience far from my laboratory and into Costa Rica. It supports a huge amount of wildlife due to its geographical placement between North and South America. It is home to more than 500,000 species ,which represents nearly 4% of the total species worldwide! First we worked alongside conservationists to preserve wildlife at a leatherback turtle ( )rescue center. We helped the volunteers preserve turtle populations by removing rubbish from the shoreline to create a safe environment for turtle eggs to come out. After that we stayed at Mount Arenal where we studied seismic activity relating to earthquakes. During our stay at Arenal, we rode over the mountainous areas and took a long walk through the rainforest. After reaching the top, we went down and through waterfalls to the beautiful valley below! On the last day we got a hands-on introduction to rocket science where we learned about new rocket technology that will be used on the international space station. During my Costa Rica experience, I know that being a scientist doesn't mean working in a lab all day and night. A scientist is one who loves learning and getting a better understanding of the world from helping preserve wild-life, learning about earthquakes or inventing rockets. I think that schools should really stress that science is so much more than wearing a lab coat and mixing chemicals. Kids need to be aware of the excitement and adventures science can bring!

This option is better for achieving the goal of making the bed look like a bus, as buses typically have black wheels, white or clear windows, and a colored body. Painting the wheel black would give a more realistic appearance of a bus's tire and its contrast with the body color. Windows being white will provide a more accurate representation of actual bus windows which are generally clear but may appear white due to light reflections. The other option, painting the wheels white and windows black, is not as suitable because it reverses the typical colors of the wheels and windows, making it less representative of a real bus. White wheels would be quite unusual for a bus, and black windows would give an impression of tinted or opaque windows, which is not standard for most buses."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Process: - Solution caves are formed in limestone and similar rocks by the action of water - After a rain, water seeps into cracks and pores of soil and rock - The water percolates beneath the land surface - Some of the water reaches a zone where all the cracks and pores in the rock are already filled with water - Rainwater absorbs some carbon dioxide as it passes through the atmosphere and even more as it drains through soil and decaying vegetation - The water combines chemically with the carbon dioxide - A weak carbonic acid solution is formed - This acid slowly dissolves calcite, forms solution cavities, and excavates passageways - Question: suppose more water reaches a zone already filled with water happens, how will it affect MORE salt being removed from the water. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","completion":"more effect. When more water reaches a zone already filled with water, the overall volume of water in the system increases. This causes an increase in the amount of water that's in contact with the limestone and other similar rocks, which in turn increases the rate at which the weak carbonic acid solution can form. As a result, the dissolution of calcite and the removal of salt from the water will be more efficient, as there is a greater availability of the acidic solution to perform this process. The increased volume of water also means that there is a larger amount of water for the salt to be carried away, so the overall amount of salt being removed from the water will be accelerated. Thus, the supposed perturbation leads to a more significant effect of salt removal from the water system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"The premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis. To demonstrate this, let's first analyze the given premise and hypothesis individually. Premise: \\"The woman's feet skidded in the dirt under her boots.\\" This statement presents a situation in which a woman is experiencing a lack of traction or grip with the ground, causing her feet to slide or \\"skid\\" on the surface. This could be due to various reasons, such as the ground being slippery, the boots being unsuitable for the terrain, or an intentional action by the woman. However, the exact reason for the skidding is not given in the premise. Hypothesis: \\"The woman was trying to do the moonwalk through the dirt.\\" Moonwalking is a dance move popularized by Michael Jackson, which gives the illusion of someone walking backward while their feet are gliding on the ground. The hypothesis suggests that the woman may have been trying to achieve this particular dance move in the given situation. Now, to consider if the premise entails the hypothesis: entailment occurs when one proposition necessarily follows from another. In this case, the premise would entail the hypothesis if the woman's feet skidding were solely and directly due to her attempt at doing the moonwalk. However, there are multiple potential explanations for why the woman's feet skidded in the dirt under her boots. Some alternative scenarios include: 1. She could have been walking or running on uneven terrain or slippery ground, which caused her feet to skid unintentionally. 2. She might have been startled or trying to stop suddenly, leading to an unintentional loss of traction. 3. The woman could have been deliberately sliding her feet for reasons unrelated to moonwalking, such as practicing a different dance move, testing her boots' grip, or playing a game. Given these alternative possibilities, it is not necessary that the woman's skidding feet were a direct result of attempting to do the moonwalk. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. In conclusion, although the hypothesis is a possible explanation for the premise, it is not the only potential reason for the woman's feet skidding. Thus, the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis, and the two statements could be related but not causally linked."},{"prompt":"Give me the correct facts to answer this: when did the orioles win the pennant?

This sentence, \\"Don swatted the mosquito with the newspaper,\\" can be considered acceptable linguistically. An linguist would likely examine the grammaticality, syntax, and semantics to evaluate a sentence. 1. Grammaticality: The sentence follows the rules of English grammar. It has a subject (Don), a verb (swatted), and an object (the mosquito). It also utilizes a prepositional phrase (with the newspaper) to provide additional information about the action. All of these elements are properly ordered and conjugated. 2. Syntax: The sentence demonstrates correct syntactic structure. It follows the typical Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order, which is common in English sentences. Additionally, the prepositional phrase \\"with the newspaper\\" coveys the instrument used to carry out the action, further adding to the syntactic clarity. 3. Semantics: Semantically, the sentence makes sense. The meaning is clear - It describes a situation where Don performs an action (swatting) on a mosquito, using a newspaper as the tool. The words and phrases used in the sentence are easily understood and follow the conventions of English vocabulary. Based on these factors, a linguist would rate this sentence as acceptable linguistically. It adheres to the grammatical, syntactic, and semantic rules and guidelines within the English language, resulting in a coherent and clear statement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Formed in 1994, the band is known for its eclectic genre-crossing style, predominately in the fusion of gangsta rap and punk it has termed \\"G-punk\\", but also for its reggae-fused music. The band's cross-genre mix of styles has been cited by journalists as having a considerable impact on rap rock and nu metal, though no firsthand accounts of the band influencing bands in either genre exists and the band itself has denied being a part of these styles, identifying more as a punk rock band utilizing rap vocals in conjunction with other vocal styles (melodic reggae singing, screaming and death growls) rather than being a rap rock band in of itself. One reviewer described the \\"nu metal\\" categorization as being a mistaken association. Hed PE performs a style of music which they have referred to as \\"G-punk\\", a phrase inspired by the term \\"G-funk\\". Hed PE has also described its music as \\"schizophrenic\\". Hed PE's music is a fusion of styles ranging from hip hop, reggae, and ska to hard rock, punk, and heavy metal. Other elements that have been incorporated into this style include blues, funk, jazz and industrial. Jared Gomes' vocal style ranges from melodic singing to rapping, screaming, and death growls. The band's lyrics draw from a number of subjects, including social justice, the existence of extraterrestrial life, criticism of organized religion, the 9/11 Truth movement, cannabis use and sexual intercourse. The band has disassociated itself from nu metal and rap rock, with former guitarist Jaxon stating that \\"I wouldn't call our band nu metal\\" and Gomes noting that his vocal style is wider ranging than simply rapping. Regarding the band's association with nu metal, Kik Axe described the band as being \\"mistakenly lumped\\" into the genre, while Beatdust described the band's sound as helping shape nu metal, listing Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit as bands it believes were influenced by Hed PE. Hed PE itself claims that Linkin Park was influenced by Hed PE's music and that Fred Durst listened to Hed PE frequently while recording Limp Bizkit's debut album; these claims, however, have not been backed up by either Durst or Linkin Park. Gomes, in addition to the 9/11 Truth movement, has expressed support for social liberal politicians such as Nancy Pelosi and president Barack Obama. Previously however, Gomes' 2004 lyrics for Only in Amerika expressed support for nationalism, and called for retaliation against Al Qaeda for the 9/11 terrorist attacks. How does G-Punk fit in with those subjects?","completion":"Alright, imagine you have a big bowl of ice cream with all your favorite flavors and toppings mixed together. That's what G-Punk is like for music! It's a special mix of many different types of music, like hip-hop, reggae, punk rock, and more.

Now, when Hed PE makes their music, they love to talk and sing about important things that are happening in the world, like being kind to others, questioning certain ideas, and even things like aliens or using special plants. They also talk about events and people who are leaders in our world. By talking about these subjects, they want to make people think and understand more about what's going on around them.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who Geoffery Bush characterizes as \\"essentially a composer for the piano, a composer of the range (not necessarily the stature) of Chopin\\"? from the following article ? Stanford wrote of Bennett: He maintained his British characteristics throughout his life ...The English take a kind of pride in concealing their feelings and emotions, and this is reflected in their folk-song. The Thames has no rapids and no falls; it winds along under its woods in a gentle stream, never dry and never halting; it is the type of the spirit of English folkmusic ... England is as remote from Keltic fire and agony, as the Thames is from the Spey. Bennett was a typical specimen of this English characteristic. He was a poet, but of the school of Wordsworth rather than of Byron and Shelley. W. B. Squire wrote in 1885: His sense of form was so strong, and his refined nature so abhorred any mere seeking after effect, that his music sometimes gives the impression of being produced under restraint. He seldom, if ever, gave rein to his unbridled fancy; everything is justly proportioned, clearly defined, and kept within the limits which the conscientiousness of his self-criticism would not let him overstep. It is this which makes him, as has been said, so peculiarly a musician's composer: the broad effects and bold contrasts which an uneducated public admires are absent; it takes an educated audience to appreciate to the full the exquisitely refined and delicate nature of his genius. Temperley suggests that, despite his reverence for Mendelssohn, Bennett took Mozart as his model. Geoffrey Bush agrees that \\"[h]is best work, like his piano playing, was full of passion none the less powerful for being Mozartian (that is to say, perfectly controlled)\\", and characterizes him as \\"essentially a composer for the piano, a composer of the range (not necessarily the stature) of Chopin\\".

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: There are new findings that not enough sleep may cause people to gain weight.Researchers say a lack of sleep can produce hormonal changes that increase feelings of hunger. In one study,researchers in the United States examined information on more than 1000 people.The people had taken part in a long-term study of sleep disorders. Some people slept less than five hours a night.They had 15 percent higher blood levels of a hormone called ghrelin than people who slept eight hours.And they had 15 percent less of the hormone leptin.Experts say ghrelin helps make people feel hungry;leptin makes you feel full. The scientists say these hormonal changes may be a cause of obesity in Western societies.They note the combination that limitation is common and is widely available. The results were not affected by how much people exercised.People who are awake longer have more time to burn energy.But the researchers say loss of sleep may increase hunger especially for high-calorie foods,so people gain weight.It seems that,for survival,the body may be designed to store more fat during times with less sleep. Researchers from Stanford University in California and the University of Wisconsin did the study.They found that the best amount of sleep for weight control is 7.7 hours a night. The Public Library of Science published the findings in its journal Medicine.Internet users can read the full study,free of charge,at plos.org.

The answer to the question: Which kingdom had their king baptized in 580? is inside the article: John of Ephesus' account describes the events around the Christianization of Alodia in detail. As the southernmost of the three Nubian kingdoms, Alodia was the last to be converted to Christianity. According to John, the Alodian King was aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543 and asked him to send a bishop who would also baptize his people. The request was granted in 580, leading to the baptism of the King, his family and the local nobility. Thus, Alodia became a part of the Christian world under the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria. After conversion, several pagan temples, such as the one in Musawwarat es-Sufra, were probably converted into churches. The extent and speed with which Christianity spread among the Alodian populace is uncertain. Despite the conversion of the nobility, it is likely that Christianization of the rural population would have proceeded slowly, if at all.Between 639 and 641, Muslim Arabs conquered Egypt from the Byzantine Empire. Makuria, which by this time had been unified with Nobadia, fended off two subsequent Muslim invasions, one in 641/642 and another in 652. In the aftermath, Makuria and the Arabs agreed to sign the Baqt, a peace treaty that included a yearly exchange of gifts and socioeconomic regulations between Arabs and Nubians. Alodia was explicitly mentioned in the treaty as not being affected by it. While the Arabs failed to conquer Nubia, they began to settle along the western coast of the Red Sea. They founded the port towns of Aydhab and Badi in the 7th century and Suakin, first mentioned in the 10th century. From the 9th century, they pushed further inland, settling among the Beja throughout the Eastern Desert. Arab influence would remain confined to the east of the Nile until the 14th century., can you guess it ? A:","completion":"The kingdom that had their king baptized in 580, according to the information given in the article, is Alodia.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: There are various aspects that go into making a successful school, and success can be measured in various ways. Often, the teachers are praised for a school's success and blamed for its failure. Yet, in order for a school to be effective, it must be a place where teaching and learning can easily take place, and that requires the hard work of more than just educators. Students must take learning into their own hands and feel as if what they are doing is as important as it actually is. This can only be done with the cooperation of every adult that is involved in the students' life. Some of these individuals often go unnoticed, yet the role they play in the students' lives is immeasurable. In the school, administrative assistants greet students at the start of the day and answer a large quantity of questions. When an assistant remembers a student's name or even something special about that student, it communicates to him that he is cared for. The assistant can also give that extra encouragement for a student to make better choices, especially when they are visiting the principal's office. Meanwhile, though cafeteria workers have a short space of time to interact with students, they can make a big difference as well. Beyond meeting nutritional needs, cafeteria workers may also on occasion meet the emotional needs of the students they serve. Students benefit from positive interaction with adults, and cafeteria workers may give that extra bit of encouragement that a child needs. Custodians are usually underappreciated for what they offer to schools. They have to be knowledgeable about everything from cleaning to fixing the most intricate tools. They get to school early in the morning before teachers arrive and lock up late at night after the last student has left from the after-school event. They also make sure teachers are equipped with the necessary items and prepare the rooms so that they are ready for learning. A great custodian also gives that kind word or extra smile to that student who needs it most. Options: A It's enough for them to cook for the students. B It's hard for them to interact with the students. C They have the most interaction with students at school. D They can also meet the emotional needs of the students.

B. yes.","completion":"A. no. The two questions are not the same. The first question is related to a technology concept, asking about a superheterodyne transmitter. To answer this question, a superheterodyne transmitter is an electronic device used in radio communication systems that uses the technique of frequency mixing to convert a high-frequency signal to a lower frequency. This makes the transmission and reception of signals more efficient. The superheterodyne technology is widely used in various forms of radio communications including FM and AM radio, satellite communication, and short-wave broadcasting. The second question is related to medical conditions, specifically cancer and spontaneous remission. Spontaneous remission refers to an unexpected decrease or disappearance of cancer without any specific treatment. After spontaneous remission of cancer, the outcome can vary greatly. It could lead to continued remission, metastasis (spreading of cancer to other parts of the body), or reappearance of the disease.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: Scissors, material, thread and hoop to do a needlepoint project.","completion":"In the given sentence, \\"Scissors, material, thread and hoop to do a needlepoint project,\\" several words can be considered important as they provide key information about the context of the sentence. However, the following four words carry the most significance as they define the tools and materials needed to complete a needlepoint project: 1. Scissors: Scissors are an essential tool for any needlepoint project. They are used for cutting fabric, trimming threads, and other tasks where precision cutting is necessary. A good pair of sharp, high-quality embroidery scissors is essential in ensuring clean cuts and avoiding frayed edges, thus maintaining the quality of the project. 2. Material: The choice of material, or fabric, is vital as it serves as the foundation for the needlepoint project. It determines the appearance, feel, and durability of the finished piece. Common materials used for needlepoint include canvas, linen, and Aida cloth. Each of these materials offers unique attributes such as fiber content, thread count, and weave structure that can impact the overall quality and appearance of the finished project. 3. Thread: Thread choice is a crucial aspect of any needlepoint project, as it determines the colors, textures, and overall visual appeal of the finished piece. Threads come in various materials, thicknesses, and finishes, each offering different results depending on the project's specific requirements. Some common threads used in needlepoint include cotton, silk, wool, and synthetic fibers. Choosing the appropriate thread weight and type is essential so that it complements and enhances the design and the chosen material. 4. Hoop: A hoop is an indispensable tool in needlepoint as it helps maintain the fabric's tension and keeps it secure during the stitching process. The hoop typically consists of two concentric rings, with the needlepoint fabric stretched between them. The hoop helps ensure even, precise, and consistent stitches while keeping the fabric taut and preventing it from wrinkling, which is especially important for needlepoint projects that require intricate details and intricate designs. In conclusion, the words \\"scissors,\\" \\"material,\\" \\"thread,\\" and \\"hoop\\" are the most important words in this sentence, as they represent the key components that are necessary for successfully completing a needlepoint project. Each of these elements contributes to the overall quality, aesthetics, and durability of the finished piece, making them essential considerations for any needlepoint project."},{"prompt":"Information: - A scavenger hunt is a party game in which the organizers prepare a list defining specific items, which the participants seek to gather or complete all items on the list, usually without purchasing them.

When the input information is supplied has an electrical signal, the display is called an \\"electronic display\\". - The user interface (UI), in the industrial design field of humancomputer interaction, is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur. The goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and control of the machine from the human end, whilst the machine simultaneously feeds back information that aids the operators' decision-making process. Examples of this broad concept of user interfaces include the interactive aspects of computer operating systems, hand tools, heavy machinery operator controls, and process controls. The design considerations applicable when creating user interfaces are related to or involve such disciplines as ergonomics and psychology. - Robot Rascals is a scavenger hunt video game by Ozark Softscape and published by Electronic Arts .

Video game is the most common form today, and for this reason the terms are often mistakenly used synonymously. Other common forms of electronic game include such products as handheld electronic games, standalone systems (e.g. pinball, slot machines, or electro-mechanical arcade games), and exclusively non-visual products (e.g. audio games). - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - Stephen (or Stephan) Gary \\"Steve\\" Wozniak (born August 11, 1950), nicknamed \\"Woz\\", is an American inventor, electronics engineer, programmer, and technology entrepreneur who co-founded Apple Inc.

Indeed, Sunderland are the Premier League’s second-lowest scorers with just 18, but Poyet said: ‘There is no doubt we all needed a lift, and the club is a different club today. I’ve got no doubts about that. Sunderland boss Gus Poyet has told his players 'there are no excuses' after the signing of Jermain Defoe. Defoe is in contention to face former side Tottenham at White Hart Lane on the weekend. Black Cats manager Poyet said he was thrilled to have signed the former Tottenham striker. 11 - Aston Villa. 18 - Sunderland. 19 - Burnley. 20 - West Brom, Hull, Leicester. 22 - Crystal Palace, Stoke. ‘It doesn’t happen that way very often, and it’s not very often we’re in a position where we can bring in a player of the quality of Jermain Defoe. ‘But we’ve got him here, and we have to use him in the right way now. There are no excuses now. I am responsible, and I’m telling you there are no excuses now, so whatever happens from this point onwards is down to me. ‘I cannot say one thing one day and then change when it suits me. We were missing something in front of goal, but now we’ve got Jermain. Now I need to keep him fit and playing, and find a way with Jermain on the pitch to make him score goals. That’s my challenge now.’ Poyet has revealed that he used his friendship with Defoe – who he worked with at Spurs - to get the deal started, before handing over to sporting director Lee Congerton to thrash out the terms of his £80,000-per-week contract. Poyet was pleased with how quickly Sunderland moved to sign Defoe ahead of their league rivals. The Uruguayan – who could now start Defoe at White Hart Lane – explained: ‘When the club was happy to start finding out about the possibility, I talked to Jermain. Simple. ‘I knew that Jermain would tell me the truth. He wouldn’t say, “Let me wait and see, and maybe I’ll give you an answer next week or in another week’s time”. It was straightforward. ‘When I knew what Jermain told me, I went back to Lee and said, “Now the ball is on your side of the court”. As soon as I spoke to Jermain, I knew we had a chance, and that was the main thing. We had a proper chance, and it proved right, so credit to Jermain. ‘Then all the rest of the deal was tough, there were so many things involved, but that is credit to the club.’ Highlights:","completion":"- Sunderland manager Gus Poyet states that there can be no more excuses for his team's shortcomings after signing Jermain Defoe from Toronto FC. - Poyet has repeatedly expressed his dissatisfaction with the attacking options at his disposal. - Sunderland is the second-lowest scoring team in the Premier League, with only 18 goals to their name. - Poyet believes signing Defoe brings a much-needed lift to the club, and the team must perform better. - Defoe is in contention to face his former side, Tottenham, at White Hart Lane. - Poyet reveals that he used his friendship with Defoe, forged during their time together at Spurs, to initiate the deal, which was then finalized by sporting director Lee Congerton. - Poyet is pleased with how quickly Sunderland acted to sign Defoe, securing an £80,000-per-week contract for the striker. - The Uruguayan manager is now focused on keeping Defoe fit and helping him score goals for the team."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"The name of the movement is derived from the Boston Tea Party of 1773, an iconic event in American history\\" is a reasonable answer, but it doesn't fully explain the contemporary political Tea Party. Let me elaborate on the movement for a better understanding: Step 1: Begin by explaining the origin of the term. The political Tea Party is a movement in the United States that takes its name from the historical event, the Boston Tea Party of 1773, which was a protest against the British government's taxation policies. Step 2: Elaborate on the modern political movement. The contemporary Tea Party movement emerged around 2009 as a grassroots, conservative political movement with a strong focus on limited government, fiscal responsibility, and lower taxes. Step 3: Describe relevant events and policy stances. The Tea Party gained prominence in the United States through a series of rallies, protests, and the election of candidates that supported their views in Congress. Key policy stances of the Tea Party include advocating for a balanced budget, reduced government spending, and opposition to the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare). Step 4: Mention its impact on American politics. The Tea Party has had a significant impact on American politics, particularly within the Republican Party, as it has pushed the party in a more conservative direction, challenging traditional Republican views on certain policy issues. In summary, the political Tea Party is a conservative movement in the United States that advocates for limited government, fiscal responsibility, and lower taxes. It is named after the Boston Tea Party, an iconic event in American history, and has had a profound impact on contemporary American politics."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Thor Heyerdahl (Norwegian pronunciation: [tu:r 'haei@da:l]; October 6, 1914 - April 18, 2002) was a Norwegian adventurer and ethnographer with a background in zoology, botany, and geography. He became notable for his Kon-Tiki expedition in 1947, in which he sailed 8,000 km (5,000 mi) across the Pacific Ocean in a hand-built raft from South America to the Tuamotu Islands. The expedition was designed to demonstrate that ancient people could have made long sea voyages, creating contacts between separate cultures. This was linked to a diffusionist model of cultural development. In 1947, Heyerdahl and five fellow adventurers sailed from Peru to the Tuamotu Islands, French Polynesia in a pae-pae raft that they had constructed from balsa wood and other native materials, christened the Kon-Tiki. The Kon-Tiki expedition was inspired by old reports and drawings made by the Spanish Conquistadors of Inca rafts, and by native legends and archaeological evidence suggesting contact between South America and Polynesia. The Kon-Tiki smashed into the reef at Raroia in the Tuamotus on August 7, 1947, after a 101-day, 4,300-nautical-mile (5,000-mile or 8,000 km) journey across the Pacific Ocean. Heyerdahl had nearly drowned at least twice in childhood and did not take easily to water; he said later that there were times in each of his raft voyages when he feared for his life. Kon-Tiki demonstrated that it was possible for a primitive raft to sail the Pacific with relative ease and safety, especially to the west (with the trade winds). The raft proved to be highly manoeuvrable, and fish congregated between the nine balsa logs in such numbers that ancient sailors could have possibly relied on fish for hydration in the absence of other sources of fresh water. Other rafts have repeated the voyage, inspired by Kon-Tiki. Heyerdahl's book about The Kon-Tiki Expedition: By Raft Across the South Seas has been translated into 70 languages. The documentary film of the expedition entitled Kon-Tiki won an Academy Award in 1951. A dramatised version was released in 2012, also called Kon-Tiki, and was nominated for both the Best Foreign Language Oscar at the 85th Academy Awards and a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 70th Golden Globe Awards. It was the first time that a Norwegian film was nominated for both an Oscar and a Golden Globe. Anthropologists continue to believe that Polynesia was settled from west to east, based on linguistic, physical, and genetic evidence, migration having begun from the Asian mainland. There are controversial indications, though, of some sort of South American/Polynesian contact, most notably in the fact that the South American sweet potato is served as a dietary staple throughout much of Polynesia. Blood samples taken in 1971 and 2008 from Easter Islanders without any European or other external descent were analysed in a 2011 study, which concluded that the evidence supported some aspects of Heyerdahl's hypothesis. This result has been questioned because of the possibility of contamination by South Americans after European contact with the islands. However, more recent DNA work (after Heyerdahl's death) contradicts the post-European-contact contamination hypothesis, finding the South American DNA sequences to be far older than that. Heyerdahl had attempted to counter the linguistic argument with the analogy that he would prefer to believe that African-Americans came from Africa, judging from their skin colour, and not from England, judging from their speech.

I was a student nurse at the time. I was assisting in the delivery of an infant. My specific task was to work with the rather over-excited father-to-be. He was an absolute delight to work with…very solicitous of his wife all throughout, very cooperative with the staff, and very appreciative of the help we were giving the mother-to-be. The background was that after 7 years of marriage, and 2 tragic miscarriages, THIS pregnancy had come to full term, and the child—deliberately they did NOT want to know the gender—was healthy, and both “mom” and “dad” were excited about the upcoming birth. The child finally emerged, the MD held up the child, and “dad” blurted out “It’s a girl!! You wanted a girl!!! Oh my God, she’s beautiful!!” Then he buried his face on his wife’s shoulder and was sobbing for pure joy. The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t. He made the cut, and came immediately over to the wife…”Honey…are you all right?? I didn’t hurt you??”” While the his daughter was being bathed and checked out by the APGAR nurse, he excited called out the various observations—she as healthy..she was pinking up…she was so beautiful “I can’t believe it.” When the nurse returned the little girl to “mom”, the three of them cuddled together, tears just pouring from his eyes…and we in the birthing suite were all getting teary-eyed ourselves. That was 30 years ago, and I still get tears just thinking about what I consider the most beautiful moment of my life, one that I was lucky to share with these two wonderful people.

Please answer the following question: Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own. I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.

Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"Based on the given short movie review, it appears that the critic is thinking positively about the movie. The phrase \\"never seems hopelessly juvenile\\" suggests that the movie, Metropolis, does not come across as immature or unsophisticated. In essence, the critic implies that Metropolis is more mature and intellectually developed than one might expect, and this is conveyed through positive wording. The use of the word \\"never\\" in the review is particularly important to note, as the critic emphasizes the point that, at no point during the movie does it seem childish or unsophisticated. This further strengthens the positive tone. Moreover, the semicolon in the sentence plays a crucial role in generating the overall positive meaning. It functions to connect two closely related ideas, both of which have negative connotations (negative and hopelessly juvenile). By doing so, it emphasizes that Metropolis never falls into the category of negative or juvenile. In this context, the negative connotation directly connects to the positive outcome and reveals the critic's appreciation for the film.

The New York Times This shame, as much as the crimes of the Germans, was the human stain that darkened and spread over Levi’s long career. His radical humanism kept him from taking refuge in “us and them” distinctions — he was much more focused on the shame of the species. (Unlike Eli Wiesel, Levi — a highly assimilated Jew — never quarrels with God, in whom he did not believe even as a young man.) But despite his rational stance, human guilt took on mystical overtones in his work, and can seem a sort of belated original sin. It’s bound up with the question, which troubles all his writing, of whether his time in Auschwitz was a season in hell or a glimpse of the true condition of the world. That question haunts these stories as well. The possibility of transcendent evil is felt with great force in “The Molecule’s Defiance” (1980), a seemingly straightforward account of a night at a factory that grows sinister when a vast batch of resin forms a single monster-molecule and bursts free of its container. “The hatch rose by itself, not suddenly but gently, solemnly, as when tombs open and the dead arise.” The palpable dread comes not from the fear of an explosion or the loss of a night’s work or the expectation of reprimand that dogs the chemist on duty, but from a kind of moral sickness, a sense that evil has sunk into the very molecular structure of the world. “A fire or an explosion can be a much more destructive accident, even tragic,” the narrator tells us, “but it’s not disgraceful, like a gelatinization.” In “The Periodic Table,” Levi offered the dead of Auschwitz not a spiritual afterlife but a sort of chemical one, imagining, in his final chapter, the way a single atom of carbon might cycle back into the living world, ingested by the author and transformed almost mystically into a dot on the page of the book he is writing. But this image of rational scientific rescue is undone in a story like “The Molecule’s Defiance,” where the laws of science do not seem rational at all. Instead of each molecule having “two hands” that form an elegant “rosary,” they develop a third hand and then “every rosary joins with two or three other rosaries, and in the end they’ve formed a single molecule, a monster.” Religious imagery overwhelms scientific language, and all the irrational elements that Levi recoiled from in human society seem to have penetrated the very fabric of the universe. One feels this as well in a story like “Knall” (1971), a pseudowhimsical dispatch on a short tool, “thick as a Tuscan cigar,” that has become vastly popular, a kind of deadly fashion accessory that can kill at close range, leaving no sign of trauma on the corpse. The name, of course, is German — the narrator tells us it means “crack, bang, crash.” But what makes the story so Levian is the mixture of humor, detachment and underlying disgust. In his careful, deadpan manner, the narrator notes that the knall is fired by “a precise and rhythmic sequence of twists in one direction and then the other,” and that “exploded knalls are darker and more flaccid than unused ones.” And though it may be true that sometimes a cigar-shaped implement of destruction is just a cigar-shaped implement of destruction, the story is indeed emblematic of something powerfully Swiftian in Levi’s work, where political disgust and human disgust bleed into each other. “Buffet Dinner” (1977) is the most Swiftian story of all, an account of a fancy dinner party at which the invited guests somehow include a kangaroo, navigating the human scene with excruciating awkwardness. The animal, with its “triangle of white fur,” clearly has the author’s sympathy, but the story conveys more than the difficulty of the outsider/survivor trying to fit into a life of trivial civility. There is distaste for the human animals as well as shame for the kangaroo, who relieves himself in a houseplant and then eats some of its leaves before finally fleeing. Levi’s human discomfort preceded his enslavement — in “Survival in Auschwitz,” he described himself as a repressed young man who, in part because of the self-consciousness imposed by four years of anti-Jewish laws, as well as by temperament, had lived before Auschwitz in “an unrealistic world of my own, a world inhabited by civilized Cartesian phantoms, by sincere male and bloodless female friendships.” He was “liberated” by Auschwitz in certain complex, paradoxical ways that filled him with pride and self-recrimination. In some sense, Levi’s endless theme is Freud’s notion, in “Civilization and Its Discontents,” that man can stand neither repression nor the lifting of repression. Not having a divine idea of human nature, Levi was constantly exposing the fault lines of secular humanism — he defended human dignity even as he developed a growing sense that the human animal was somehow indefensible. Despite many memoirs, he almost never wrote as a husband or father, though he was both, which further complicates our understanding of his vision of life. Though he has become a sort of secular saint, he can often seem like Michelangelo’s Christ in “The Last Judgment,” turning away coldly from the saved even as he consigns the sinners to hell. But Levi’s heroism as a writer is felt everywhere in his work. The committed intelligence of his voice offers its own deep consolation, however bleak his vision became and however tempted he was to flee, like Gulliver, from a species that had fallen lower than the beasts. Gulliver began looking at his face in the mirror as a way of training himself to tolerate again the sight of a human creature. Levi, in these ingenious and disquieting stories as in the rest of his writing, held up a mirror to his own mind, and in so doing performed a lasting service. After the barbarisms of the last century — which have followed us into this one — reading Levi remains an indispensable way of readapting ourselves to the complexity of being human. Jonathan Rosen is the editorial director of Nextbook. His most recent novel is “Joy Comes in the Morning.” What was this article about?","completion":"This article is a review of Primo Levi's short stories and their themes, focusing on the way his experiences in Auschwitz and his perspective on humanity influenced his writing.

Levi's writing is characterized by a mixture of humor, detachment, and underlying disgust, reflecting his personal struggles with the complexities of being human. Despite Levi's bleak vision, his heroism as a writer is felt throughout his work, offering consolation and insight into the human condition after the barbarisms of the 20th century."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 46*u - 3*u + 43 = 0 for u.","completion":"Sure, we'll start by solving the equation 46*u - 3*u + 43 = 0 step by step. First, you should combine like-terms on the left hand side. In this case, the like-terms are 46*u and -3*u. When you subtract 3*u from 46*u, you get 43*u: 46*u - 3*u + 43 = 0 simplifies to 43*u + 43 = 0 The next step is to isolate the u-variable. You do this by getting rid of any terms that do not involve the variable you're solving for on the left hand side. This means you'll need to subtract 43 from both sides of the equation to remove +43 from the left side. This maintains the balance of the equation (anything you do to one side must be done to the other side, as well): 43*u + 43 - 43 = 0 - 43 simplifies to 43*u = -43 At this stage, your equation should be 43*u = -43. Now, it's time to solve for u. To do this, you'll need to divide both sides of the equation by 43: 43*u / 43 = -43 / 43 simplifies to u = -1 Based on these calculations, the solution to the equation 46*u - 3*u + 43 = 0 is u = -1. This means that if you substitute -1 for u in your original equation, it should maintain the equality. Substituting u in the original equation: 46*(-1) - 3*(-1) + 43 = 0 This simplifies to: -46 + 3 + 43 = 0 And further to: 0 = 0 Since both sides of your equation equals 0 after substitising u = -1, this check validates your solution.

Let's talk about a movie that's really fun, it's called \\"Finding Nemo.\\" It's a colorful animation about a little fish named Nemo who gets lost in the big, big ocean. So, Nemo is a tiny clownfish who lives with his dad, Marlin, in a safe and snug anemone. One day, Nemo gets very curious and naughty, and swims too far from his home. Oh, no! A fisherman catches him and transfers him to a fish tank in a dentist's office, which is really long and kind of scary journey away. Even though his dad is usually scared of everything, he becomes a superdad to find Nemo. He meets a really forgetful fish named Dory, who can't remember things properly, but she's very sweet, and becomes his best friend. The movie is like a big adventurous journey, where you encounter sharks who are trying to be vegetarians, turtles who like to surf the ocean currents, and seagulls who can only say \\"mine, mine\\".

Article: College students constantly hear the praises of education.We have all become used to believing that a college education is always a guarantee of an easier life.I was nine years old when my fourth-grade teacher presented me with a task, to write down all of the things I wanted in my life.I filled my paper with things like: own a big house and have servants; be rich and have a good job.The next day my teacher handed back my paper and in red ink she wrote: \\" GO TO COLLEGE.\\" For a long time, I was convinced that once I obtained an education, BAM! Life would be easier. However, education cannot promise all wishes, dreams, and desires.Society must reject the foolish idea that a college education's main purpose is to satisfy our desires and secure success.Like most challenging things, education is a gamble in which results depend entirely on people's ability to look past their wants to see the realism and reason behind their wants. For instance, my first year of college, I took a sociology class.In class, we were taught that Third World countries were poor.We learned that our quality of life would be almost impossible for an average person in those countries.I began to examine my own desire to be rich.To always go after money felt selfish when knowing others had none at all.Learning about other society's financial situations forced me to look beyond what I wanted. Through the process of education, everything once desired is tested.Wanting something no longer is enough; it's more important to examine why we want it and whether we really want it.When my desire for money changed, everything changed.I stopped longing for money-driven careers and stopped valuing the people who had them.I began to examine the things I purchased and my reason for wanting them. Education is a tool to be used to develop and advance our desires, so we can discover the things that are truly significant in life.Education is a source to expand our society to see beyond the superficial appeals and the \\"quick fixes\\" , leaving the belief of an... Question: Why does the author mention her sociology class? Answer: Answer:","completion":"The author mentions her sociology class to illustrate how education can reshape our desires and help us see beyond our superficial wants. In the sociology class, she learned about the financial struggles and living conditions in Third World countries, which made her reevaluate her own desire for wealth and material possessions. This realization led her to change her focus from money-driven careers and examine her own consumer choices. The sociology class serves as an example of how education can challenge our perspectives, enabling personal growth and self-reflection."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This place was in the northern part of the city. Lots of big trucks, cars, and buses came in and out of the terminal every day moving people and things all around. One day, a man came to this busy terminal. He was wearing a hard hat and jacket, which made him look like the other workers there. Sometimes, people wear clothes like these to stay safe while working with heavy tools and machines. But this man was not there to work; he was there to trick everyone. He started talking to the people who worked at the terminal and made them believe that he was their friend. He said, \\"Hey, I work here too, even though you might not recognize me\\". The people at the transport terminal believed him because he was wearing the same kind of clothes as them. So, they thought of him as their co-worker. The sneaky man had a plan. He told the staff at the transport terminal that he needed to borrow something called \\"metal road plates.\\" These are big, flat pieces of metal that are used to cover up holes in the road when people are working on them. Each of the metal road plates is very expensive, costing £600, which is about the same as 600 ice cream cones! He wanted to take five of these metal road plates away with him. And guess what? Because the workers at Bounds Green transport terminal thought that the man was their friend, they let him take the five metal road plates. He was very clever in tricking them and they never even realized that he was not their co-worker. After the sneaky man took the metal road plates, he disappeared, and the people at the terminal later found out that they had been tricked.

While my experience was far better than last time, I just still think this place lacks, well, a lot. There were two patrons in the bar and only two more that entered in a two hour time period. Granted, it was Wednesday, but it's hard to imagine how this place can stay in business. It was a bit awkward because there was no music playing, so I felt compelled to play something on the jukebox. Any new songs were two credits (1) so that kind of sucked, luckily I'm a fan of 90's music... The bartender (yes, the very same that cut me off previously) was actually really sweet this time, so that definitely warrants a star increase. It's still the only bar that I know of that is cash only, which is pretty inconvenient. It was a lot better this time, but this place is still boring and doesn't really have much to offer.

People who are nearsighted can only see things that are very close to their eyes. Many people who do a lot of close work, such as writing and reading, become nearsighted. Then they have to wear glasses in order to see distant things clearly. People who are farsighted face just the opposite problem. They can see things that are far away, but they have difficulty reading a book if they don't hold it at arm's length. If they want to do much reading, they must get glasses too. Other people do not see clearly because their eyes are not exactly the right shape. This, too, can be corrected by glasses. Some people's eyes become cloudy because of cataracts . Long ago these people often became blind. Now, however, it is possible to operate on the cataracts and remove them. When night falls, colors become fainter to the eyes and finally disappear. After your eyes have grown used to the dark, you can see better if you use the side of your eyes rather than the centers. Sometimes, after dark, you see a small thing to one side of you.

Question: suppose if lungs stop working properly and at a lower rate happens, how will it affect a SMALLER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"When the lungs are not working properly and are functioning at a lower rate, it leads to a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. This situation could arise due to various factors, such as respiratory diseases, lung injuries, or other conditions that affect lung function. The diminished supply of oxygen in the bloodstream can have several consequences, as it affects various aspects of the body's functionality. To understand the implications of this situation, let's first consider the role that oxygen plays within the body. Oxygen is crucial for various bodily processes, and is necessary for the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the primary molecule used to store and transfer energy within cells. When there is an insufficient supply of oxygen, it impacts the body's ability to create energy to fuel vital cellular processes. The smaller amount of oxygen delivered to the bloodstream affects the body in several ways: 1. Decreased energy production: With less oxygen available, the body is unable to produce sufficient ATP to meet its energy needs. This can lead to fatigue, weakness, and reduced physical endurance, as the body struggles to perform even basic tasks. 2. Lower tissue and organ function: A lack of oxygen supply can impair the function of various tissues and organs, as insufficient energy compromises their ability to carry out normal processes. Over time, this can lead to the degradation of these tissues and possible organ failure. 3. Compromised immune function: The immune system relies on a consistent supply of oxygen to carry out its functions effectively. A diminished oxygen supply can weaken the immune system, increasing vulnerability to infections and illnesses. 4. Acid-base imbalance: When oxygen levels are low, the body may shift to using anaerobic processes for producing energy, which leads to the increased production of lactic acid. This can cause an acid-base imbalance, known as acidosis, resulting in a variety of symptoms including shortness of breath, confusion, and even coma in severe cases. 5. Cognitive impairment: The brain relies on a steady oxygen supply to function optimally. When oxygen levels decrease, cognitive functions such as memory, decision-making, and problem-solving can be negatively impacted. 6. Cardiovascular effects: In an attempt to compensate for the lower oxygen levels, the heart may pump blood faster in an effort to increase the delivery of oxygen throughout the body. This can put strain on the heart, leading to increased heart rate, shortness of breath, and possible long-term cardiovascular effects. In summary, the supposed perturbation of lungs functioning at a lower rate, leading to a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream, has a significant and negative effect on the body. The consequences range from decreased energy production and impaired organ function to compromised immune function, acid-base imbalances, cognitive impairment, and potential cardiovascular effects. It is essential to maintain proper lung function to ensure adequate oxygen supply and overall health and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Picture the scene: You come home after work feeling too exhausted to cook -only to find a delicious meal worthy of a Michelin-starred restaurant waiting for you. It sounds like a fantasy, but it could be about to come true thanks to a robot chef developed by British scientists. Those scientists have come up with a set of robotic arms so smart that _ are capable of cooking meals all by themselves. The device will be sold from as early as 2017 as part of a purpose-built high-tech kitchen. Scientists at Moley Robotics spent almost 18 years developing the hands. According to its creators, the arms can chop, stir, whisk and baste well enough to recreate almost anything you would care to eat, whether it is a simple home-cooked supper, or a complicated creation designed by a world-class chef. The hands move a little slowly, hovering strangely above the work surface whenever they are not busy, but they imitate human movements closely enough that they can do things such as wiping a spoon on the edge of a pan to prevent drips. Mr Oleynik, who is leading the project, said, \\"All the things which are possible with the hand are possible here. There is no limitation.

Movie plot title: The Enforcer Movie plot: In Marin County, two gas company men are lured by a scantily-clad woman to a remote spot in Mill Valley and killed by Bobby Maxwell (DeVeren Bookwalter). Maxwell's gang, the People's Revolutionary Strike Force (PRSF), plans to use the gas men's uniforms and van as part of an ambitious series of crimes that will make them rich. Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) and his partner Frank DiGiorgio (John Mitchum), after dealing with a chronic fainter, arrive at a liquor store where robbers have taken hostages. The robbers demand a car with a police radio; the inspector provides one by driving his squad car into the store and shooting the robbers. His superior Captain McKay (Bradford Dillman) reprimands Callahan for \\"excessive use of force\\", injuring the hostages, and causing 14,379 of damage to the store, and temporarily transfers him out of the Homicide unit. While assigned to Personnel, Callahan participates in the interview process for promotions, and learns that affirmative action means that three of the new inspectors will be female including Kate Moore (Tyne Daly), despite her very limited field experience. The PRSF uses the gas company van to steal M72 LAW rockets, Colt M16 rifles, a Taser and other weapons from a warehouse. In the course of the robbery, three people are killed: a security guard whom Maxwell kills for his keys; DiGiorgio, whom Maxwell stabs in the back after he stumbles in on the robbery after discovering the guard's body; one of Maxwell's accomplices is accidentally shot when DiGiorgio's gun goes off.

Given the question: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ). Tom and Jim go running together once a week. This week Jim skipped his warm up before exercising, because he was a bit late. Tom warmed up properly before running. Which runner had an increased blood flow to the muscles? The answer is:","completion":"Tom had an increased blood flow to the muscles. Step 1: Understand the question The question is asking which of the two runners, Tom and Jim, had increased blood flow to their muscles. To answer this, we need to understand the effects of warming up on muscles. Step 2: Analyze the information From the given information, we know that a proper warm-up gradually increases the intensity of a physical activity, which in turn helps to prepare the muscles for the activity. Warming up increases blood flow to the muscles and raises the heart rate, which results in warmed-up muscles and tendons being less likely to get injured. Step 3: Compare the two runners Tom warmed up properly before running, while Jim skipped his warm-up. This means that Tom experienced the benefits of warming up, such as increased blood flow to his muscles and an increased heart rate, while Jim did not. Step 4: Answer the question Based on the analysis, we can conclude that Tom had an increased blood flow to the muscles because he properly warmed up before running."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Savage struggled in the first half against the Bengals' stout defense, being sacked on two back-to-back plays in the first quarter for a huge loss. The first score of the game came on a last second 43-yard field goal from Randy Bullock to put Cincinnati up 3-0 going into halftime. The Texans responded on their first possession in the second half with a 25-yard field goal from Nick Novak to tie the game at 3-3. The Bengals punted the ball on their next possession. Receiving the ball back, another drive stalled for the Texans as they had to settle for a 22-yard field goal from Novak to take a 6-3 lead. Cincinnati tried to respond to the Houston field goal, but a tipped pass from Andy Dalton was intercepted by Quentin Demps. The Texans came up short on the interception and were forced to punt the ball back. After receiving the kick, the Bengals quickly struck with Dalton finding Brandon LaFell for an 86-yard touchdown pass. With Bullock making the extra point the Bengals took a 10-6 lead with 10:45 left to play. Houston responded on their next drive with a 24-yard touchdown run from Alfred Blue, but Novak's extra point was blocked. After both teams traded punts, the Bengals marched down to the Houston 25-yard line to try the game-winning field goal.

Q: Botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) has been reported to have analgesic effects independent of its action on muscle tone, possibly by acting on neurogenic inflammation. Such a mechanism may be involved in peripheral neuropathic pain.', 'A possible direct analgesic effect of BTX-A pain processing was investigated in 29 patients with focal painful neuropathies and mechanical allodynia using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Patients received a one-time intradermal administration of BTX-A (20-190 units) into the painful area. Outcome measures, evaluated at baseline, then at 4, 12, and 24 weeks, included average spontaneous pain intensity, quantified testing of thermal and mechanical perception and pain, allodynia to brushing (area, intensity), neuropathic symptoms, clinical global impression, and quality of life.', 'BTX-A treatment, relative to placebo, was associated with persistent effects on spontaneous pain intensity from 2 weeks after the injection to 14 weeks. These effects correlated with the preservation of thermal sensation at baseline (p < 0.05). BTX also improved allodynia to brush and decreased pain thresholds to cold, without affecting perception thresholds. There were sustained improvements in the proportion of responders (number needed to treat for 50% pain relief: 3.03 at 12 weeks), neuropathic symptoms, and general activity.

Would \\"It can be uniform, with constant angular rate of rotation (and constant speed), or non-uniform with a changing rate of rotation.\\" be a reasonable answer? OPT: (a). No. (b). Yes. Answer:","completion":"(a). No. The provided statement, \\"It can be uniform, with constant angular rate of rotation (and constant speed), or non-uniform with a changing rate of rotation,\\" is not a reasonable answer to the question about the relationship between the directions of the velocity and force vectors in a circular motion. The statement describes the types of circular motion (uniform and non-uniform) but does not explain the relationship between force and velocity vectors. A more appropriate answer is as follows: In circular motion, the velocity vector is always tangent to the path of motion, pointing in the direction of the object's movement around the circle. The force vector, on the other hand, points toward the center of the circle, which is known as centripetal force. Centripetal force is responsible for keeping the object in its circular path. In a uniform circular motion, the object moves at a constant speed around the circle, meaning its angular rate of rotation is also constant. Although the speed remains constant, the direction of the velocity vector continually changes as the object goes around the circle. Therefore, acceleration exists, which also acts centripetally towards the center of the circle. In non-uniform circular motion, the rate of rotation (angular speed) is not constant. The object might experience angular acceleration, leading to changes in both speed and direction. In this case, the force vector still has a centripetal component that acts towards the center of the circle, but it might also have a tangential component that causes the change in the object's speed. So, the relationship between the velocity and force vectors in circular motion is that the velocity vector is always tangent to the circular path, while the force vector has a centripetal component directed towards the circle's center. This relationship holds in both uniform and non-uniform circular motion, although additional tangential force components may exist in non-uniform motion."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The park is divided into three zones: WesternWorld, MedievalWorld and RomanWorld. The entertainment in all three areas consists primarily of interaction by the guests with androids programmed to act in character (the Old West, medieval Europe, and pre-Christian Rome, respectively). The androids are indistinguishable from human beings, apart from minor flaws in their hands, and guests are encouraged to indulge in any fantasy, including killing the androids. The androids are programmed to respond positively to guest requests, specifically including requests for sex. Delos's guests pay 1,000 a day for the experience.Peter Martin (Benjamin) a first-timer and his friend John Blane (Brolin), who has visited previously, come to the WesternWorld zone, where one of the main attractions is the Gunslinger (Yul Brynner), a robot programmed to start duels. Thanks to its programming, humans can always outdraw the Gunslinger and kill it. The guns issued to the guests also have temperature sensors that prevent them from firing at each other or anything else living but allow them to 'kill' the room-temperature androids.Gradually, the technicians running Delos begin to notice problems with the androids. In what may be the first mention of the concept of a computer virus in a film, the technical staff describe inexplicable problems and breakdowns spreading \\"like a disease\\" between the machines, first in one area of the park and then on to the others. First, the robots in MedievalWorld begin suffering an inexplicable number of systemic failures. Then, a robot rattlesnake strikes Blane. Against her programming, a female servant android refuses a guest's request for sex. The failures increase until the robotic Black Knight kills a guest in a sword-fight in MedievalWorld. The resort's supervisors, in increasing desperation, attempt to regain control by shutting down power to the entire park. Unfortunately, this results in trapping them...

U.S. President Donald Trump attempted to reset his relationship with Africa on Monday, as he hosted Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year. In January, Nigeria joined a list of outraged African countries demanding an explanation from the U.S. ambassador after Trump's reported vulgar comments referring to African countries.

The premise is the first sentence of a story, and the second sentence, which is the initial context, provides more information about the story's context and the story's general plot. The original ending is the last three sentences of the story. Also, a counterfactual context is a slight modification to the initial context. You should write a new story ending that edits the original story ending as little as possible to regain coherence with the counterfactual context. To sum up, you should write the last three sentences of a story based on the premise(first sentence) and the counterfactual context(second sentence) of the story. Input: Premise: Anna was still a little tired. Initial Context: So she decided to make more coffee. Original Ending: Anna emptied out the coffee pot. She put in a new filter and coffee grounds. She added water to the tank and turned on the machine. Counterfactual Context: She took a nap. Output:","completion":"The task here is asking you to rewrite the story's ending in a way that is consistent with a new, altered circumstance (counterfactual context), while keeping the ending as similar as possible to the original ending. The guidelines provided are: 1. The premise: This is the first sentence of the story, which sets the scene or explains the initial situation. In the given example, the premise is \\"Anna was still a little tired.\\" 2. The initial context: This is the second sentence which makes the story more specific. It provides more information about the situation, early action, or plans the character has. For this task, it's \\"So she decided to make more coffee.\\" 3. The original ending: These are the last three sentences, which form the initial ending of the story. Here it is about Anna emptying out the coffee pot, putting in a new filter along with coffee grounds, adding water to the tank, and then turning on the machine. 4. The counterfactual context: This is a modified version of the initial context, which changes the direction of the story. In this case, instead of making more coffee to tackle her tiredness, \\"She took a nap.\\" To perform the task, you need to write an ending to the story that fits the counterfactual context but still stays as close as possible to the actions and themes of the original ending. You have to gauge the modifying impact of the counterfactual context on the original ending and accordingly write the new ending. For example: New ending: \\"Anna settled down on the couch comfortably. She pulled the warm blanket over her. Soon she was lost in a peaceful nap.\\" Here, the new ending is crafted considering that Anna, instead of making coffee, elects to take a nap, but the actions - settling down and getting comfortable - still represent the care taken in the preparation steps from the original ending."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Two teams of runners took part in a study about exercise.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which event would most likely cause a rapid extinction of organisms? Your answer:","completion":"A rapid extinction of organisms, also known as a mass extinction, is a catastrophic event that leads to a significant reduction in the number of species on Earth in a relatively short period. Mass extinctions have occurred several times throughout Earth's history, with the most famous example being the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) event that wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs. Several factors can cause mass extinctions, such as intense volcanic activity, climate change, invasive species, or cosmic events like asteroid impacts. The event that would most likely cause a rapid extinction of organisms is a large-scale cosmic impact event, specifically a collision with a massive asteroid or comet. Here's why a large-scale cosmic impact event would be the most likely cause of a rapid extinction of organisms: 1. Sudden and widespread devastation: A massive asteroid or comet impact would cause enormous destruction upon collision with Earth. The impact would release an immense amount of energy equivalent to the explosion of millions of nuclear bombs. This instantaneous release of energy would cause widespread fires and a massive heat pulse, incinerating a large portion of Earth's biomass and killing a considerable number of organisms in the direct vicinity of the impact. 2. Global climate change: The massive amounts of debris and dust ejected into the atmosphere as a result of the impact event would lead to a dramatic decrease in sunlight reaching the Earth's surface. This phenomenon, called an \\"impact winter,\\" would result in a rapid drop in global temperatures, often lasting for years or even decades. A sudden, extreme shift in the climate would have severe consequences for many species, disrupting food chains, ecosystems, and habitats. 3. Ocean acidification: The impact event could also release substantial amounts of sulfur and other gases that would react with water vapor in the Earth's atmosphere, causing precipitation to become acidic. This acid rain could alter the chemistry of the oceans, leading to ocean acidification and directly affecting marine ecosystems. Many marine species would not be able to survive the drastic change in their environment, leading to a cascade of extinctions throughout the food chain. 4. Loss of biodiversity and ecosystem collapse: The combination of widespread destruction, global climate change, and ocean acidification would have long-lasting effects on Earth's biodiversity. Entire ecosystems could collapse as species struggle to adapt to these rapid environmental changes. The loss of numerous species, especially those that play crucial roles in ecosystems (such as pollinators, predators, and decomposers), would significantly affect other organisms and further contribute to the rapid extinction of organisms. In conclusion, a large-scale cosmic impact event, such as a collision with a massive asteroid or comet, would be the most likely cause of a rapid extinction of organisms due to the vast and sudden devastation it would inflict upon Earth. The immediate destructive effects, coupled with the long-lasting and widespread ecological consequences, would lead to the collapse of ecosystems and the extinction of numerous species in a relatively short period."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: The invention of stained glass windows can be attributed to a man who likely lived where? Context: Red was the color of the banner of the Byzantine emperors. In Western Europe, Emperor Charlemagne painted his palace red as a very visible symbol of his authority, and wore red shoes at his coronation. Kings, princes and, beginning in 1295, Roman Catholic cardinals began to wear red costumes. When Abbe Suger rebuilt Saint Denis Basilica outside Paris in the early 12th century, he added stained glass windows colored blue cobalt glass and red glass tinted with copper. Together they flooded the basilica with a mystical light. Soon stained glass windows were being added to cathedrals all across France, England and Germany. In Medieval painting red was used to attract attention to the most important figures; both Christ and the Virgin Mary were commonly painted wearing red mantles.

Math Problem Solve -47*l - 336 = -12*l - 19*l for l.","completion":"To solve the equation -47*l - 336 = -12*l - 19*l for l, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the like terms on both sides of the equation. On the right side, we can combine the l terms: -12*l - 19*l = (-12 - 19)*l = -31*l. So, the equation becomes: -47*l - 336 = -31*l Step 2: Isolate the variable (l) by moving it to one side of the equation. To do this, start by adding 31*l to both sides to eliminate it from the right side: -47*l + 31*l - 336 = -31*l + 31*l This simplifies to: -16*l - 336 = 0 Step 3: Isolate l by moving the constant term (-336) to the other side of the equation. To do this, add 336 to both sides: -16*l - 336 + 336 = 0 + 336 This simplifies to: -16*l = 336 Step 4: Solve for l by dividing both sides by the coefficient of l, which is -16: -16*l / -16 = 336 / -16 This gives: l = -21 So, the solution for the equation -47*l - 336 = -12*l - 19*l is l = -21."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sotloff, who freelanced for Time and Foreign Policy magazines, had last been seen in Syrian in August 2013 until he appeared in a video released online last month by the Islamic State group that showed the beheading of fellow American journalist James Foley. Dressed in an orange jumpsuit against the backdrop of an arid Syrian landscape, Sotloff was threatened in that video with death unless the U.S. stopped airstrikes on the group in Iraq.

In the video posted Tuesday online, Sotloff says -- in a message surely scripted by his captors -- that he is \\"paying the price\\" for U.S. military intervention.

A masked ISIS figure in the new video speaks to U.S. President Barack Obama, telling him, \\"Just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.\\" The Islamic State has thrived and mutated during the civil war in Syria. It swept into Iraq in June, seizing large swaths of the country's Sunni-dominated northern and western provinces. Obama ordered targeted airstrikes in Iraq to begin in early August after ISIS fighters began targeting ethnic Yazidis and launching attacks toward the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil. ISIS appeared to date the execution video of Sotloff, referencing specific U.S. military actions in recent days, including U.S. airstrikes that helped over the weekend to break the siege of Amerli -- a northern Iraqi town home to thousands of minority Shiite Turkmen. Intelligence officials are analyzing the video, trying to answer some key questions, a senior U.S. administration official said. Among the questions, the official said: When was it shot? Where was it shot? Is the killer in the Sotloff video the same one in the Foley video? Until they answer those questions, the official said the administration does not want to speculate.

The newspaper, citing unnamed aid workers involved in efforts to gain his release, said he was abducted near a refugee camp in the northern Syrian province of Idlib. British Prime Minister David Cameron told reporters he was aware of reports about the video and called Sotloff's killing \\"an absolutely disgusting and despicable act.\\" Who was Sotloff? Sotloff disappeared while reporting from Syria in August 2013, but his family kept the news secret, fearing harm to him if they went public. Out of public view, the family and government agencies had been trying to gain his release for the past year. Last week, Sotloff's mother, Shirley Sotloff, released a video pleading with ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi not to kill her son. \\"Steven is a journalist who traveled to the Middle East to cover the suffering of Muslims at the hands of tyrants. Steven is a loyal and generous son, brother and grandson,\\" she said. \\"He is an honorable man and has always tried to help the weak.\\" Her plea was met with taunting responses on social media by ISIS supporters. Sotloff, 31, grew up in South Florida with his mother, father and younger sister. He majored in journalism at the University of Central Florida. His personal Facebook page lists musicians including the Dave Matthews Band, Phish, Miles Davis and movies including \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" and \\"The Big Lebowski\\" as favorites. On his Twitter page, he playfully identifies himself as a \\"stand-up philosopher from Miami.\\" He graduated from another college, began taking Arabic classes and subsequently picked up freelance writing work for a number of publications, including Time, Foreign Policy, World Affairs and The Christian Science Monitor.

Choose from: * Kaylee was thrilled!. * Kaylee was really disappointed..","completion":"Kaylee was thrilled! She could hardly contain her excitement as she gazed upon the beagle puppies running and playing in the soft grass on the farm. They were just as she had always imagined them to be - small, cuddly, and absolutely adorable with their big floppy ears and soulful eyes. Her heart swelled with affection, and she knew that today would be one of the most memorable days of her life. Entering the fenced-in play area, her eyes sparkled with anticipation. Several puppies ran toward her, tails wagging excitedly, eager to greet their newest visitor. Kaylee knelt down, her arms outstretched to welcome them. The soft fur and playful nips sent shivers of happiness down her spine. She could see that each of the puppies had a unique personality and charm, making the decision even more difficult. Kaylee's parents lovingly watched from a distance as she interacted with the frisky bunch. Knowing how much their daughter had wanted a furry companion, they were overjoyed to see her dreams finally coming true. As they chatted with the breeder about the puppies' care, they couldn't help but feel a heartwarming sense of accomplishment for giving their precious girl this incredible gift. As the minutes went by, Kaylee began to carefully observe the puppies. She considered which one would make the perfect addition to their family and home. One in particular caught her attention - a slightly smaller beagle with a distinctive white patch on its chest. The puppy seemed to possess a curious and gentle nature, repeatedly inching forward to sniff at Kaylee's hand and then scampering back to the safety of its siblings. Drawn to its endearing shyness, Kaylee reached out to the timid pup and scooped it up into her arms. The puppy whimpered a little, unsure of its new situation, but soon began to relax and snuggle into Kaylee's embrace. As she cradled the bundle of love close to her heart, she felt a magical connection that told her that this was the one. This was her puppy. With the decision made and tears of joy brimming in her eyes, Kaylee carried the puppy to her parents, eager to introduce them to their newest family member. Her parents smiled, recognizing the unmistakable connection between their daughter and the little beagle. After discussing the practical aspects with the breeder, they completed the adoption process and prepared to bring home their newest family member. On the ride home, Kaylee held her new puppy close, thanking her parents profusely for the wonderful gift. They were delighted to see their daughter so happy and filled with love for her new friend. In that moment, the family bond grew stronger, united by their shared joy and the newest addition to their lives. Once home, Kaylee introduced the puppy to its new environment, making sure to provide a comfortable and welcoming space for her best birthday present ever. As the days turned into weeks and then months, Kaylee and her beagle, now named Bella, grew inseparable. Their bond flourished as they shared countless adventures, creating lifelong memories and a friendship that would remain unshakable. In the end, Kaylee's birthday gift had brought her more than just a puppy; it had blessed her with a devoted friend, a confidant, and a loyal companion through all the ups and downs of life. And for her parents, it was a heartwarming reminder of the true beauty of a loving family and the magic of a birthday wish come true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Videodrome Movie plot: Max Renn (James Woods) is the president of CIVIC-TV (Channel 83, Cable 12), a Toronto UHF television station specializing in sensationalistic programming. Displeased with his station's current lineup (which mostly consists of softcore pornography and gratuitous violence), Max is looking for something that will break through to a new audience. One morning, he is summoned to the clandestine office of Harlan (Peter Dvorsky), who operates CIVIC-TV's unauthorized satellite dish which can intercept broadcasts from as far away as Asia. Harlan shows him Videodrome, a plotless television show apparently being broadcast out of Malaysia which depicts the brutal torture and eventual murder of anonymous victims in a reddish-orange chamber. Believing this to be the future of televisionâ(staged) snuff TVâMax orders Harlan to begin unlicensed use of the show. Appearing on a talk show, Max defends his station's programming choices to Nicki Brand (Deborah Harry), a sadomasochistic psychiatrist and radio host, and Professor Brian O'Blivion (Jack Creley), a pop-culture analyst and philosopher who will only appear on television if his image is broadcast into the studio, onto a television, from a remote location. O'Blivion delivers a speech prophesying a future in which television supplants real life. Max dates Nicki, who is sexually aroused when he shows her an episode of Videodrome and coaxes him into having sex with her while they watch it. Max goes once again to Harlan's office, where Harlan tells him that the signal delay which caused it to appear to be coming from Malaysia was a ploy by the broadcaster and that Videodrome is being broadcast out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Max tells Nicki this and she excitedly goes to Pittsburgh to try and audition for the show under the guise of a business trip, but never returns. Max contacts Masha (Lynne Gorman), a softcore pornographer, and asks her to help him find out the truth about Videodrome.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Use information from the paragraph to answer the question. Paragraph : In erosion, a slower moving stream will only carry smaller particles. Question: A fast moving stream is capable of carrying larger or smaller particles than a slow moving stream? The answer to this question is:","completion":"A fast moving stream is capable of carrying both larger and smaller particles compared to a slow moving stream. The information given in the paragraph mentions that in erosion, a slower moving stream will only carry smaller particles. This implies that the capacity of a stream to carry particles is influenced by its speed. As the speed of the stream increases, so does its ability to carry more massive particles. Erosion is a natural process where the Earth's surface gets worn down due to wind, water, and ice movement. In the context of streams, the flowing water picks up and transports particles of various sizes like sand, silt, clay, pebbles, and even larger rocks depending on the water's velocity. A fast moving stream possesses a higher kinetic energy that enables it to lift, transport, and carry more massive particles or sediment sizes that a slow moving stream would not be able to move. This higher kinetic energy is instrumental in the erosional process and contributes to the breakdown and transportation of materials from one place to another. Conversely, a slow moving stream has lower kinetic energy and, as a result, can only carry smaller particles like fine sand, silt, and clay. The larger rocks or pebbles remain on the stream bed as they are too heavy for the slow moving stream to lift and transport. In conclusion, a fast moving stream is capable of carrying both larger and smaller particles, whereas a slow moving stream can only carry smaller particles due to its lower kinetic energy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The first written record of St Kilda may date from 1202 when an Icelandic cleric wrote of taking shelter on \\"the islands that are called Hirtir\\". Early reports mentioned finds of brooches, an iron sword and Danish coins, and the enduring Norse place names indicate a sustained Viking presence on Hirta, but the visible evidence has been lost. In the late 14th century John of Fordun referred to it as 'the isle of Irte (insula de Irte), which is agreed to be under the Circius and on the margins of the world'. The islands were historically part of the domain of the MacLeods of Harris, whose steward was responsible for the collection of rents in kind and other duties. The first detailed report of a visit to the islands dates from 1549, when Donald Munro suggested that: \\"The inhabitants thereof ar simple poor people, scarce learnit in aney religion, but M’Cloyd of Herray, his stewart, or he quhom he deputs in sic office, sailes anes in the zear ther at midsummer, with some chaplaine to baptize bairnes ther.\\"Despite the chaplain's best efforts, the islanders' isolation and dependence on the bounty of the natural world meant their philosophy bore as much relationship to Druidism as it did to Christianity until the arrival of Rev. John MacDonald in 1822. Macauley (1764) reported the existence of five druidic altars, including a large circle of stones fixed perpendicularly in the ground near the Stallir House on Boreray.Coll MacDonald of Colonsay raided Hirta in 1615, removing 30 sheep and a quantity of barley. Thereafter, the islands developed a reputation for abundance. At the time of Martin's visit in 1697 the population was 180 and the steward travelled with a \\"company\\" of up to 60 persons to which he \\"elected the most 'meagre' among his friends in the neighbouring islands, to that number and took them periodically to St. Kilda to enjoy the nourishing and plentiful, if primitive, fare of the island, and so be restored to their wonted health and strength.\\"","completion":"The present-day name of the islands that were historically part of the domain of the MacLeods of Harris is St Kilda."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Each category has specific features that you should use to make your decision. Solution: Sentence: \\"lung, pancreas, ovarian, and cervical cancers.\\" Section: Background To figure out whether the category is correct, let's examine the sentence in the context of each category's definition: 1. Background - This category usually offers context or explains the importance of the problem, previous relevant works, what's lacking in them, high-level research questions, and how this research might benefit other researchers. 2. Purpose - This category entails specific objectives, goals, or hypotheses that the researchers aim to achieve or test. 3. Method - This category involves procedures and steps of the research that the researchers followed to obtain their results. 4. Finding - This category presents the outcomes of the research, such as achievements, conclusions, and observed behaviors. Given the sentence only lists some types of cancers, we can assume it's part of providing context for the research topic and addressing the importance of studying these specific cancers. Therefore, the sentence best fits the Background category. Answer: True In this case, the given category, Background, is correct for the sentence.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Because I am extremely vulnerable to both slick advertising and peer pressure, I've been thinking about getting an iPad. But here's the problem: I'm cheap, and the iPad's not. If I'm going to fork over at least 499 for a new device, I want to try it out and make sure it's not just a larger, shinier version of my iPhone. But if I went to my local Apple Store, I'd get to spend only a few minutes testing out the machine. I wanted more time than that, so I rented one for 15 a day from a guy on SnapGoods. The Internet start-up in Brooklyn runs on simple reasoning: there are people who want to borrow stuff - camping equipment, food processors, robot vacuums, etc. - and there are people who have stuff they want to lend. SnapGoods helps these two groups connect over the Web. SnapGoods is one of many sites that have sprung up to facilitate offline sharing. Some sites have a narrow, obvious focus (like SwapBabyGoods.com) while others are more obscure (Neighborhood Fruit helps people share what's growing in their yards or find fruit trees on public land). But regardless of whether the sharing is free or involves a fee, these transactions often come with a stick-it-to-the-man attitude. \\"Borrow these things from your neighbors,\\" reads one earnest request on neighborrow.com, \\"The owner-ship has SAILED!\\" All of these sites are encouraging something academics call collaborative consumption - in other words, peer-to-peer sharing or renting. Renting something you don't need to use very often makes a lot more sense than buying it and letting it collect dust in your garage. There's a green aspect as well, since sharing helps cut down on overall use of resources. But one of collaborative consumption's most surprising benefits turns out to be social. In an era when families are scattered around the country and we may not know the people down the street from us, sharing things - even with strangers we've just met online - allows us to make meaningful connections. \\"This isn't just about saving the environment or saving a dollar,\\"...

We will examine each usage below to provide a clearer understanding of the similarities and differences in the contexts. In the first sentence from BBC News (2004), the term \\"prise\\" refers to using tools (such as pliers, scissors, rubber gloves, and knives) to force open products. This context clearly highlights the application of physical force or pressure to separate or open the items. In modern English, \\"prise\\" or its more common alternative \\"pry\\" (particularly in American English) is understood to mean the act of using force to move or open something. The second sentence from Sax Rohmer's novel, \\"The Quest of the Sacred Slipper\\" (1919), also utilizes the meaning of \\"prise,\\" but in a slightly different context. Here, the term relates to a character attempting to open a box (presumably locked, closed, or stuck) when he was attacked. In this early 20th-century usage, \\"prise\\" likewise denotes the application of force or leverage to open the box. The subtle difference to note is that, in the early 1900s, \\"prise\\" may have been a more commonly used term for this meaning than in current times where its alternative \\"pry\\" is often preferred. In summary, \\"prise\\" carries the same meaning in both sentences, albeit with a slight shift in usage over time. In both instances, the term refers to the act of applying force or pressure to open or separate objects that are difficult to access."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself. In this article, I’m going to list and briefly explain the blood tests that are most commonly used, for the primary medical care of older...

The most practical option for carrying a small folding knife would be in your pocket. Here is the rationale behind selecting \\"pocket\\" as the optimal choice: 1. Portability: A small folding knife is designed to be compact and easily transportable. Placing it in your pocket ensures that it is easily accessible at all times, and you can carry it with you wherever you go. This provides you with a convenient tool for various purposes like cutting ropes, opening packages, or even in self-defense situations. 2. Safety: Folding knives are specifically designed with safety features that prevent the blade from accidentally opening while being carried. Storing the knife in your pocket helps ensure that these safety features are utilized, reducing the risk of accidental injuries. 3. Versatility: Carrying a small folding knife in your pocket ensures that you have a useful tool on hand for a wide range of scenarios. Whether you're outdoors camping, hiking, or fishing, or even indoors at home or work, having a folding knife readily available can prove invaluable in many situations. 4. Convenience: Other options, such as placing the knife in a kitchen drawer, a fishing boat, a garbage bag, or on a table, can be limiting and situational. The kitchen drawer, for example, would restrict its accessibility to only when you are indoors. A fishing boat would indicate that the knife is primarily used for fishing activities. Garbage bags and tables are also impractical choices as they can either lead to the knife getting lost or posing a hazard. In summary, carrying a small folding knife in your pocket is the optimal choice due to its portability, safety, versatility, and convenience. Having a folding knife readily available in your pocket ensures that you have a handy tool for various situations, while also minimizing the risk of accidents and providing quick access when needed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Involving oneself in different aspects of production can lead to a deeper understanding and appreciation for the film as a whole. By engaging with the crew, assisting in problem-solving, and contributing creatively to the project, an actor like Kevin can have a more significant impact on the final product. Moreover, active participation in the filmmaking process can help actors develop a more nuanced understanding of their characters, storylines, and relationships with other characters in the movie. This understanding can, in turn, lead to a more authentic and compelling portrayal of their roles, which can ultimately enhance the overall quality of the film.

Q:Given the below context: After the October Tour, U2 decamped to a rented cottage in Howth, where they lived, wrote new songs, and rehearsed for their third album, War. Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December. War's lead single, \\"New Year's Day\\", was released on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. Nonetheless, it was the band's first commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while reaching number 12 in the US. War's sincerity and \\"rugged\\" guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time. A record on which the band \\"turned pacifism itself into a crusade\\", War was lyrically more political than their first two records, focusing on the physical and emotional effects of warfare. The album included the protest song \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", in which Bono lyrically tried to contrast the events of the 1972 Bloody Sunday shooting with Easter Sunday.

Step 1: Building rapport with the sprites To gain the trust of the sprites, Oraden and Tahir engaged in small talk with their hosts, asking about their lifestyle, customs, and traditions. They were careful to show respect for the sprites' way of life, and to express genuine interest in their stories and experiences.

You exclude the assets you use for everyday life. For example, your primary residence, car, clothes and business equipment are not used in your zakat asset calculations. It's based on what's left after you take care of you and your family's living expenses. Some examples of zakat-eligible assets include stocks, savings, investment properties, cash, business income or precious metals such as gold. Determine how much your zakat-eligible assets are worth for the year. Debt from credit cards, college or other loans subtracts from your personal net worth. These outstanding debts are deducted from your total zakat-eligible assets. If you obtained a personal loan of any type (car, home, cash), then look at how much you pay per month to your creditors, not the entire outstanding debt. Add up how much you owe each month to your creditors. Multiple this amount by 12 to calculate your annual liability amount. Subtract your liabilities from your zakat-eligible assets. For example, your assets for the year total 6,000 and your liabilities total 2,000. Your zakat net worth or zakat pool of money is 4,000 (6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000).","completion":"This article talks about how to figure out how much zakat (charity) you need to pay.

Article: Television and films are good too, but it's better if you have something you can watch over and over and over and over. You can really get down the content, start noticing things you never noticed before, and your brain can relax instead of flailing about, trying to keep up. Ask some friends if they have a series you can borrow! Thanks to satellite TV, British, American and Australian television programmes and films are widely available all over the world. Try recording them! Watch with subtitles at first and then without them as you gain confidence. The better you get, the more you'll look forward to \\"studying.\\" Try watching a TV show or movie with English subtitles and a second time with subtitles in your native language. The BBC World Service is just one excellent source of spoken English and even broadcasts programs for learners. Have it on in the background while you go about doing your household tasks. Just streaming English all the time can help you learn it passively. You don't have to sit down and stare at your radio -- just let it soak in! Radio a little too old-fashioned? You've no excuse -- there's internet radio, too, you know! There are podcasts on virtually every subject and the classics like NPR and \\"This American Life\\" can all be found online. Podcasts allow you to slow down and rewind broadcasts so you can re-listen phrases that are unfamiliar to you. You can listen to the radio online, watch TV clips, read articles, and even play games to improve your English. You can even chat with people! There are also many pages on the web dedicated to teaching English as a foreign language. Real people are better, but the Internet is still a great tool. Both the BBC and Wikipedia have versions of their site aimed at ESL learners. But there are also dozens of other websites that offer worksheets, articles, word problems, and stories that are at specific grade levels, too. If you're not in a class or don't have a native speaker at your disposal, it may seem pretty hard to get better at writing. How do you know if you're doing it correctly? Simple! Use websites that will correct your work! Search through Google to find websites that assist in correcting your grammar - many which are free of charge. Again, no excuses! It's easy to forget about the writing skill. But doing this, too, as much as you can, will make serious waves in your improvements. Write your emails in English, write yourself notes in English, write your blog in English. Even if you can't correct it, make it a habit. Not only is it fun, but you will learn words and pronunciation. And new music! Pick one each day and study it until you know it by heart. Find a genre that appeals to you and choose some songs that don't go too fast -- hardcore rap is not a good place to start when it comes to learning English! Think the Beatles, Michael Buble, Elvis, or even musical theatre. This can be a substitution to listening to the radio. Have the songs you've been learning playing in the background and sing along! And then, who knows, maybe you'll find yourself at karaoke next weekend! Rosetta Stone can cost a pretty penny, but it's useful. Some even offer accessibility to a native speaker! But that's not the only kid on the block -- there's Pimsleur and Michel Thomas as well, just to name two more. Each advocates a different type of learning -- which one would work best for you? Ask around if anyone in your circle has these CDs already. There's no point in paying for them twice! And some of the stuff can be found online, too. You just gotta get a little creative!

Hi, Carolyn: Both of my parents died in the past year. I had spent every single Christmas with them at my childhood home. Needless to say, I am dreading the holidays. I have small children of my own now. If one more person tells me to start my own tradition I’ll scream. If we had more money I would go away to someplace warm, but that’s not in the cards. Is there anything I can do that won’t make it suck? Orphan at Christmas: You could just embrace the suck. It sounds as if that’s what you want to do, actually; you’re ruling out the only logical answers as too daunting or expensive. Any time you find yourself asking people for suggestions and then rejecting them all, consider that you already know what you want and just crave others’ permission to want it. I am very sorry about your parents. Losing both in one year makes for a much more abrupt transition. So don’t try to hide from or change any of it: You don’t have what you want, you’re grieving, you have little kids who need you, and you just want to crawl into a hole, and everyone has a pat answer for something you think is anything but. What approach accommodates all of these? Can you hand off the planning to your spouse? Do you have sibs to commiserate with? Can you think of the minimum you need to do for your kids (small kids require minimal holiday fuss), and set aside a block of time for honoring your parents, and one for just giving yourself what you need? If even that’s too much, you really can wing it. Holidays are just days, whenever you need them to be. Some of the freight can come off. Re: Orphan: My father died the week before Christmas. I got sick of people telling us to make our own tradition — I liked our old one just fine. We went with the flow and did what felt right each year. The first year was a movie and Chinese. Ten years later we have traditions back. It took time to heal — don’t deny that process! Re: Orphan: You don’t have to start a tradition as some huge, fully thought-out event that you are locked into for the rest of your life. When our kids were really young I started a Christmas Eve thing where I would buy every single frozen appetizer that looked good. I would just keep throwing sheets in the oven and we would all sit around the fireplace with Christmas music and eat whatever we wanted. The kids loved it so much I still do it — and they are 28 and 30. Just be with people you care about. That is the only tradition that matters. Anonymous: Brilliant idea. Stealing it. Re: Orphan: I’m so sorry for your loss. I lost my mom in February last year, and I was dreading the holidays. And I was paralyzed, like you. So I punted to my husband, and he rose to the occasion and made us a plan. So that’s my answer: Your husband probably isn’t mourning as you are, so please ask for his help.

Choose the next sentence.(CNN) -- Mohamed Morsi is an American-educated engineer who vowed to stand for democracy, women's rights and peaceful relations with Israel if he won the Egyptian presidency. He is also an Islamist figure who has argued for barring women from the Egyptian presidency and called Israeli leaders \\"vampires\\" and \\"killers.\\" One analyst describes him as an \\"icon\\" of those seeking an \\"extreme agenda.\\" On Monday, the Muslim Brotherhood announced that Morsi, 60, had defeated his rival Ahmed Shafik, who briefly served as prime minister in the waning days of Mubarak's regime, in the weekend run-off election. The official vote count was scheduled to be finished at some point Monday, with final results to be announced Thursday \\"It went back on its word, suspecting that its gains since the January 2011 revolution could be undermined by the military council that has ruled since the fall of President OPTIONS: - Ahmed Shafik.\\" - American.\\" - CNN.\\" - Egyptian.\\" - Freedom and Justice Party.\\" - Islamist.\\" - Israel.\\" - Israeli.\\" - Mohamed Morsi.\\" - Morsi.\\" - Mubarak.\\" - Muslim Brotherhood.\\"","completion":"Hosni Mubarak.\\" \\"It went back on its word, suspecting that its gains since the January 2011 revolution could be undermined by the military council that has ruled since the fall of President Hosni Mubarak.\\" This sentence further elaborates on the complex political landscape in Egypt at the time. Following the January 2011 revolution, the country saw the end of President Hosni Mubarak's regime, which had been in power for more than 30 years. The military council then took over, leading to a turbulent transition period marked by ongoing protests and struggles for power. It was within this context that Mohamed Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood's candidate, emerged victorious in the presidential run-off election against Ahmed Shafik, who had served as prime minister during Mubarak's final days in power. Morsi's victory was seen as a significant success for the Brotherhood, which had been outlawed and suffered persecution under the previous regime. However, the situation was far from settled, as the military council continued to wield significant power, and suspicion arose that it might undermine the gains made by the Brotherhood and other new political forces since the revolution. As a result, many saw Morsi's election as a test of the commitment to democracy and the new political order in Egypt, as well as a reflection of the challenges and internal divisions that the country faced in its ongoing process of political transformation. Additionally, Morsi's controversial positions and past remarks further fueled the debate about his presidency and its implications for Egypt's future. While he vowed to be a champion of democracy, women's rights, and peaceful relations with Israel, his record and affiliations with the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood raised questions and concerns. Critics pointed to his calls for barring women from the Egyptian presidency and his inflammatory statements against Israeli leaders as evidence of a potentially extremist agenda. Ultimately, Morsi's tenure as president was short-lived, as massive protests and a military coup in 2013 led to his ouster and the suspension of the Egyptian constitution. His presidency serves as a cautionary tale of the difficulties and complexities faced by countries undergoing a transition from authoritarian rule to democracy, as well as the challenges of balancing and reconciling diverse political forces and ideologies in the pursuit of a more inclusive and stable future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As they managed to escape from Babulu, Seetha and Lakshmi quickly developed a strong bond. Knowing the troubles that Lakshmi had been facing, Seetha decided to help her find shelter. They approached Mohan, a kind-hearted man known for his philanthropy. Touched by Lakshmi's story, Mohan agreed to provide her with shelter at his place. During her stay at Mohan's, Lakshmi often found solace by visiting the local doctor for emotional and physical support. The doctor was impressed by Lakshmi's virtues and resilience amidst the adversities she faced in life. As time went on, the doctor fell in love with Lakshmi and soon, he expressed his desire to marry her. Lakshmi, who had always admired the doctor's kindness and compassion, agreed to the proposal. On the day of their wedding, Ramudu, Seetha, and Mohan attended the joyous event, celebrating the union of Lakshmi and the doctor.

During this stage of life, many people raise a family and strive to attain career goals. They start showing physical signs of aging, such as wrinkles and gray hair. Typically, vision, strength and reaction time start declining. Diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular or heart disease, and cancer are often diagnosed during this stage of life.

Options: a ) 23 , b ) 27 3 / 4 , c ) 20 1 / 2 , d ) 27 1 / 2 , e ) 11 A:","completion":"b ) 27 3 / 4 Explanation: To solve this problem, we can use the concept of work and the formula: Work = number of men * number of days. From the problem, we know that 14 men can complete the work in 32 days. So, the work can be represented as: Work = 14 men * 32 days Now, we are asked for the number of days required for 16 men to complete the same work. Let's represent the unknown number of days as \\"x\\". Then, we can write the equation for the given scenario: Work = 16 men * x days Since both the equations represent the same work, we can set them equal to each other: 14 men * 32 days = 16 men * x days Next, we need to solve for x.

Article: Sleep helps your body recover and fight inflammation, so it’s important to get a full night’s sleep, which for most people is between 7 and 8 hours. If you’re having trouble getting that much sleep, reorganize your schedule so that you’re devoting enough time to preparing for sleep and sleeping every day. If you have trouble falling asleep, try relaxing before bedtime and avoiding looking at electronic screens once in bed. These practices can help people fall asleep faster. If you have chronic trouble with insomnia, speak with your doctor about potential medical solutions, like cognitive behavior therapy. One of the many health benefits of exercise is that it can reduce inflammation. Your 2.5 hours of exercise a week only needs to be moderate in intensity, meaning it raises your heartbeat but does not necessarily strain your muscles, like taking a walk. Spread your 2.5 hours of exercise throughout the week. If you’re worried about aggravating an injury, speak to your doctor or physical therapist about how to develop an exercise plan that works for you. Use a Fitbit or other personal fitness tracker to help you meet your exercise goals during the week. High levels of stress can increase inflammation in the body. They can also make it more difficult to sleep, which helps the body fight inflammation. Take small breaks when working during the day, perhaps just to get some fresh air or stretch for a couple minutes. Give yourself time at the end of the day to relax by exercising, engaging in a hobby, or simply spending time with friends or family members. if you need to.

First thing I love about Cupcakes-A-Go-Go?? They are open until EIGHT on the weekends. This is perfect for all those late night cupcake cravings. Well, maybe eight is only late if you are the mother of three small children. So yes...let me rephrase...this is perfect for all those mid-evening cupcake cravings! We stopped by Cupcakes-A-Go-Go last Saturday night about about 7:40 and they had a plethora of available flavors. To me this is good AND bad. Good, because it means that there is more for me to choose from. Bad because it means they are clearly not the type of shop that makes all their cupcakes fresh in the morning and keep them out until they sell out. It makes me wonder, on the average, how long they DO sit out - are most made the day of? Just wondering... As for the cupcakes themselves, well, I will review each one individually because I feel like they were all pretty different. Here is the order I tried them. (For the record, I did not eat these all myself, I did share...a little.) ;) 1. Mint Oreo: This was the first one I tried, and I was very impressed. The cake was moist and dense with excellent flavor. The frosting was their \\"traditional\\" cream cheese based frosting (which I know only from reading other Yelp reviews) and it fit the cupcake well. It was also thick and dense and complimented the cake perfectly. This one was great. :) 2. Lemon Meringue: I was expecting a nice zesty lemon cupcake. I was disappointed. The cake was a bit dry and the flavor just so-so. The meringue frosting tasted fine. I was pretty underwhelmed. 3. Peanut Butter Cookie Dough: I was SO excited for this cupcake. I was SO let down. The cake was very, very dry. The chunk of cookie dough in the middle was hard. The frosting was the cream cheese based frosting again, which just didn't fit with the rest of it. It did not feel like a cohesive dessert. None of worked together. It was not good. Bummer. 4. Black Forest: First of all - this cupcake looked incredible. It was like the picture-perfect cupcake with it's chocolate cake, white whipped frosting, and a cherry on top. And, I'm happy to report that it tasted even better than it looked!! The cake was just right - sweet, moist, melted in my mouth. The cherries were tasty and didn't feel like they came from a can. The whipped topping was just like grandma makes - not super sweet and made of fresh whipping cream. The entire thing my my trip to Cupcakes-A-Go-Go worth it. THIS is what I hoped all my cupcakes would be. I also purchased a Strawberries and Cream cupcake and a German Chocolate cupcake, but I was far too generous and gave those to my in-laws. What was I thinking?! Part of me wants to give this place 3 stars - because only half of the cupcakes I tried were awesome - one was the opposite of awesome. However, I think I will go with 4. Really good, but could use some improvements. I have now am halfway to a free cupcake (Buy 12 get one free - which is great because you don't have to buy all 12 at one time!), so I will definitely be back to try some more. Hopefully the next ones will wow me and force me to add that last star!

Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental illness. The view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not generally supported. On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their thin counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass. Obesity is mostly preventable through a combination of social changes and personal choices. Changes to diet and exercising are the main treatments. Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, such as those high in fat and sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber. Medications may be taken, along with a suitable diet, to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption. If diet, exercise, and medication are not effective, a gastric balloon or surgery may be performed to reduce stomach volume or bowel length, leading to feeling full earlier or a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food. Obesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide, with increasing rates in adults and children. In 2014, 600 million adults (13%) and 42 million children under the age of five were obese. Obesity is more common in women than men. Authorities view it as one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century. Obesity is stigmatized in much of... - Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Not all tumors are cancerous; benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body. Possible signs and symptoms include a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss and a change in bowel movements. While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they may have other causes. Over 100 types of cancers affect humans. Tobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths. Another 10% is due to obesity, poor diet, lack of physical activity and drinking alcohol. Other factors include certain infections, exposure to ionizing radiation and environmental pollutants. In the developing world nearly 20% of cancers are due to infections such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human papillomavirus (HPV). These factors act, at least partly, by changing the genes of a cell. Typically many genetic changes are required before cancer develops. Approximately 510% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects from a person's parents. Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests. It is then typically further investigated by medical imaging and confirmed by biopsy. Many cancers can be prevented by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, not drinking too much alcohol, eating plenty of vegetables, fruits and whole grains, vaccination against certain infectious diseases, not eating too much processed and red meat, and avoiding too much sunlight exposure. Early detection through screening is useful for cervical and colorectal cancer. The benefits of screening in breast cancer are controversial. Cancer is often treated with some combination of radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Pain and symptom management are an important part of care. Palliative care is particularly important in people with advanced disease. The chance of survival depends on the type of cancer and extent of disease at the start of treatment. In children under 15 at... - Eating disorders are mental disorders defined by abnormal eating habits that negatively affect a person's physical or mental health. They include binge eating disorder where people eat a large amount in a short period of time, anorexia nervosa where people eat very little and thus have a low body weight, bulimia nervosa where people eat a lot and then try to rid themselves of the food, pica where people eat non-food items, rumination disorder where people regurgitate food, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder where people have a lack of interest in food, and a group of other specified feeding or eating disorders. Anxiety disorders, depression, and substance abuse are common among people with eating disorders. These disorders do not include obesity. The cause of eating disorders is not clear. Both biological and environmental factors appear to play a role. Cultural idealization of thinness is believed to contribute. Eating disorders affect about 12 percent of dancers. Those who have experienced sexual abuse are also more likely to develop eating disorders. Some disorders such as pica and rumination disorder occur more often in people with intellectual disabilities. Only one eating disorder can be diagnosed at a given time. Treatment can be effective for many eating disorders. This typically involves counselling, a proper diet, a normal amount of exercise, and the reduction of efforts to eliminate food. Hospitalization is occasionally needed. Medications may be used to help with some of the associated symptoms. At five years about 70% of people with anorexia and 50% of people with bulimia recover. Recovery from binge eating disorder is less clear and estimated at 20% to 60%. Both anorexia and bulimia increase the risk of death. In the developed world binge eating disorder affects about 1.6% of women and 0.8% of men in a given year. Anorexia affects about 0.4% and bulimia affects about 1.3% of young women in a given year. During the entire life up to 4% of women have anorexia, 2% have bulimia, and 2% have... - Professor Gerald Francis Morris Russell (born 12 January 1928) is a British psychiatrist. In 1979 he published the first description of bulimia nervosa, and Russell's sign has been named after him. - Bulimia nervosa , also known as simply bulimia , is an eating disorder characterized by binge eating followed by purging . Binge eating refers to eating a large amount of food in a short amount of time . Purging refers to attempts to rid oneself of the food consumed . This may be done by vomiting or taking a laxative . Other efforts to lose weight may include the use of diuretics , stimulants , fasting , or excessive exercise . Most people with bulimia have a normal weight . The forcing of vomiting may result in thickened skin on the knuckles and breakdown of the teeth . Bulimia is frequently associated with other mental disorders such as depression , anxiety , and problems with drugs or alcohol . There is also a higher risk of suicide and self - harm . Bulimia is more common among those who have a close relative with the condition . The percentage risk that is estimated to be due to genetics is between 30 % and 80 % . Other risk factors for the disease include psychological stress , cultural pressure for a certain body type , poor self - esteem , and obesity . Living in a culture that promotes dieting and having parents that worry about weight are also risks . Diagnosis is based on a person 's medical history , however this is difficult as people are usually secretive about their binge eating and purging habits . Furthermore , the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa takes precedence over that of bulimia . Other similar disorders include binge eating disorder , Kleine - Levin syndrome , and borderline personality disorder . Cognitive behavioral therapy is the primary treatment for bulimia . Antidepressants of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRI ) or tricyclic antidepressant class may have a modest benefit . While outcomes with bulimia are typically better than in those of anorexia , the risk of death among those affected is higher than that of the general population . At 10 years after receiving treatment about 50 % of people are fully recovered . Globally , bulimia was estimated to affect 6.5... - Vomiting, also known as emesis and throwing up, among other terms, is the involuntary, forceful expulsion of the contents of one's stomach through the mouth and sometimes the nose. Vomiting can be caused by a wide variety of conditions; it may present as a specific response to ailments like gastritis or poisoning, or as a non-specific sequela of disorders ranging from brain tumors and elevated intracranial pressure to overexposure to ionizing radiation. The feeling that one is about to vomit is called nausea, which often precedes, but does not always lead to, vomiting. Antiemetics are sometimes necessary to suppress nausea and vomiting. In severe cases, where dehydration develops, intravenous fluid may be required. - A mental disorder, also called a mental illness or psychiatric disorder, is a diagnosis by a mental health professional of a behavioral or mental pattern that may cause suffering or a poor ability to function in life. Such features may be persistent, relapsing and remitting, or occur as a single episode. Many disorders have been described, with signs and symptoms that vary widely between specific disorders. The causes of mental disorders are often unclear. Theories may incorporate findings from a range of fields. Mental disorders are usually defined by a combination of how a person behaves, feels, perceives, or thinks. This may be associated with particular regions or functions of the brain, often in a social context. A mental disorder is one aspect of mental health. Cultural and religious beliefs, as well as social norms, should be taken into account when making a diagnosis. Services are based in psychiatric hospitals or in the community, and assessments are carried out by psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, and clinical social workers, using various methods but often relying on observation and questioning. Treatments are provided by various mental health professionals. Psychotherapy and psychiatric medication are two major treatment options. Other treatments include social interventions, peer support, and self-help. In a minority of cases there might be involuntary detention or treatment. Prevention programs have been shown to reduce depression. Common mental disorders include depression, which affects about 400 million, dementia which affects about 35 million, and schizophrenia, which affects about 21 million people globally. Stigma and discrimination can add to the suffering and disability associated with mental disorders, leading to various social movements attempting to increase understanding and challenge social exclusion. - A brain tumor or intracranial neoplasm occurs when abnormal cells form within the brain. There are two main types of tumors: malignant or cancerous tumors and benign tumors. Cancerous tumors can be divided into primary tumors that start within the brain, and secondary tumors that have spread from somewhere else, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the part of the brain involved. These symptoms may include headaches, seizures, problem with vision, vomiting, and mental changes. The headache is classically worse in the morning and goes away with vomiting. More specific problems may include difficulty in walking, speaking, and with sensation. As the disease progresses unconsciousness may occur. The cause of most brain tumors is unknown. Uncommon risk factors include inherited neurofibromatosis, exposure to vinyl chloride, EpsteinBarr virus, and ionizing radiation. The evidence for mobile phones is not clear. The most common types of primary tumors in adults are meningiomas (usually benign), and astrocytomas such as glioblastomas. In children, the most common type is a malignant medulloblastoma. Diagnosis is usually by medical examination along with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. This is then often confirmed by a biopsy. Based on the findings, the tumors are divided into different grades of severity. Treatment may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Anticonvulsant medication may be needed if seizures occur. Dexamethasone and furosemide may be used to decrease swelling around the tumor. Some tumors grow gradually, requiring only monitoring and possibly needing no further intervention. Treatments that use a person's immune system are being studied. Outcome varies considerably depending on the type of tumor and how far it has spread at diagnosis. Glioblastomas usually have poor outcomes while meningiomas usually have good outcomes. The average five-year survival rate for brain cancer in the... - Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. Risk factors include mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, alcoholism, or substance misuse. Others are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to method of suicide, such as firearms and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, there is little evidence for their effectiveness. The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries, and is partly related to the availability of effective means. Common methods include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. Suicide resulted in 842,000 deaths globally in 2013 (up from 712,000 deaths in 1990). This makes it the 10th leading cause of death worldwide. Approximately 0.5% to 1.4% of people die by suicide, about 12 per 100,000 persons per year. Three quarters of suicides globally occur in the developing world. Rates of completed suicides are generally higher in men than in women, ranging from 1.5 times as much in the developing world to 3.5 times in the developed world. Suicide is generally most common among those over the age of 70; however, in certain countries those aged between 15 and 30 are at highest risk. There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year. Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long-term disabilities. In the Western world, attempts are more common in young people and females. Views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. The Abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide an offense towards God due to the belief in the sanctity of life. During the samurai era in Japan, a form of... - Osteoarthritis (OA) is a type of joint disease that results from breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone. The most common symptoms are joint pain and stiffness. Initially, symptoms may occur only following exercise, but over time may become constant. Other symptoms may include joint swelling, decreased range of motion, and when the back is affected weakness or numbness of the arms and legs. The most commonly involved joints are those near the ends of the fingers, at the base of the thumb, neck, lower back, knee, and hips. Joints on one side of the body are often more affected than those on the other. Usually the symptoms come on over years. It can affect work and normal daily activities. Unlike other types of arthritis, only the joints are typically affected. Causes include previous joint injury, abnormal joint or limb development, and inherited factors. Risk is greater in those who are overweight, have one leg of a different length, and have jobs that result in high levels of joint stress. Osteoarthritis is believed to be caused by mechanical stress on the joint and low grade inflammatory processes. It develops as cartilage is lost and the underlying bone becomes affected. As pain may make it difficult to exercise, muscle loss may occur. Diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms, with medical imaging and other tests occasionally used to either support or rule out other problems. In contrast to rheumatoid arthritis, which is primarily an inflammatory condition, in osteoarthritis, the joints do not typically become hot or red. Treatment includes exercise, efforts to decrease joint stress, support groups, and pain medications. Efforts to decrease joint stress include resting and the use of a cane. Weight loss may help in those who are overweight. Pain medications may include paracetamol (acetaminophen) as well as NSAIDs such as naproxen or ibuprofen. Long-term opioid use is generally discouraged due to lack of information on benefits as well as risks of addiction and other side effects. If... - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a psychosocial intervention that is the most widely used evidence-based practice for treating mental disorders. Guided by empirical research, CBT focuses on the development of personal coping strategies that target solving current problems and changing unhelpful patterns in cognitions (e.g., thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes), behaviors, and emotional regulation. It was originally designed to treat depression, and is now used for a number of mental health conditions. - A psychiatrist is a physician who specializes in psychiatry, the branch of medicine devoted to the diagnosis, prevention, study, and treatment of mental disorders. Psychiatrists are medical doctors, unlike psychologists, and must evaluate patients to determine whether their symptoms are the result of a physical illness, a combination of physical and mental ailments, or strictly psychiatric. - Evidence-based practice (EBP) is an interdisciplinary approach to clinical practice that has been gaining ground following its formal introduction in 1992. It started in medicine as evidence-based medicine (EBM) and spread to other fields such as audiology, speech-language pathology, dentistry, nursing, child life specialty, psychology, social work, education, library and information science. EBP is traditionally defined in terms of a \\"three legged stool\\" integrating three basic principles: (1) the best available research evidence bearing on whether and why a treatment works, (2) clinical expertise (clinical judgment and experience) to rapidly identify each patient's unique health state and diagnosis, their individual risks and benefits of potential interventions, and (3) client preferences and values - Alcoholism, also known as alcohol use disorder (AUD), is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol that results in problems. It was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when two or more of the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use. Risky situations include drinking and driving or having unsafe sex among others. Alcohol use can affect all parts of the body but particularly affects the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, and immune system. This can result in mental illness, WernickeKorsakoff syndrome, an irregular heart beat, liver failure, and an increase in the risk of cancer, among other diseases. Drinking during pregnancy can cause damage to the baby resulting in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Generally women are more sensitive to alcohol's harmful physical and mental effects than men. Both environmental factors and genetics are associated with alcoholism with about half the risk attributed to each. A person with a parent or sibling with alcoholism is three to four times more likely to be alcoholic themselves. Environmental factors include social, cultural, and behavioral influences. High stress levels, anxiety, as well as inexpensive easily accessible alcohol increases risk. People may continue to drink partly to prevent or improve symptoms of withdrawal. A low level of withdrawal may last for months following stopping. Medically, alcoholism is considered both a physical and mental illness. Both questionnaires and certain blood tests may detect people with possible alcoholism. Further information is then collected to confirm the...

The woman puts an ice cube on her neck and asks if the man can feel it. She explains that these are goose bumps. Then she puts the ice cube on his neck. A woman in a nurses uniform looks trough the glass door before she enters, calling the woman Sissi (Franka Potente). She has mail and gives a letter to Sissi, who is very surprised about it, and to the man next to her. The man opens the letter immediately. The letter is written in Braille, which reveals that he is blind. Sissi doesnt open the letter immediately.In a big hall, a group of people gather together and sit in a big circle. Some of them are doctors and nurses, among them Sissi. The people are behaving strangely. They are patients of the psychiatric clinic.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"Letters to the Unseen\\" Step 1: Analyze the plot The plot revolves around a number of distant individuals who connect through letters and unexpected encounters. It involves sensitive topics such as mental health, loss, and existential questioning. The key elements are letter-writing, a mental health clinic, a blind man, and a woman named Sissi. It also touches on death and human connection in a delicate way. Step 2: Develop the title The main idea is about connection amongst unseen and distant people. These characters don't really 'see' each other in the usual ways - either because they're in different locations (such as the woman writing the first letter), in a mental health clinic (like Sissi), or because one is physically unable to see (the blind man). Therefore, the title should represent this idea of unseen connections or correspondences. \\"Letters\\" represent the medium of their connection. Hence, \\"Letters to the Unseen\\" is a fitting title for this movie plot as it touches on the themes of distance, unseen connections, and the significant role of letters within the narrative."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Joy Division were an English rock band formed in 1976 in Salford, Greater Manchester.

It projects about into the Bering Sea between Norton Sound, the Bering Strait, the Chukchi Sea, and Kotzebue Sound, just below the Arctic Circle. The entire peninsula is about long and - wide. Like Seward, Alaska, it was named after William H. Seward, the United States Secretary of State who fought for the U.S. purchase of Alaska. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - The Kigluaik Mountains are a mountain chain running east to west on western Alaska's Seward Peninsula. - The Bering Strait (\\"Beringov proliv\\", Yupik: \\"Imakpik\\") is a strait of the Pacific, which borders with the Arctic to north. It is located between Russia and the United States. Named after Vitus Bering, a Danish-born explorer in the service of the Russian Empire, it lies slightly south of the Arctic Circle being at about 65° 40' N latitude.

This range forms a major divide between drainage basins draining into the Pacific Ocean and the Arctic Ocean. The tallest peak, Mount Bendeleben is at the summit, and is located on the west end. Bits of the range go into the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve, but most of the peaks remain unclaimed. The Tubutulik River flows in the area. - Chukchi Sea is a marginal sea of the Arctic Ocean. It is bounded on the west by the Long Strait, off Wrangel Island, and in the east by Point Barrow, Alaska, beyond which lies the Beaufort Sea. The Bering Strait forms its southernmost limit and connects it to the Bering Sea and the Pacific Ocean. The principal port on the Chukchi Sea is Uelen in Russia. The International Date Line crosses the Chukchi Sea from northwest to southeast. It is displaced eastwards to avoid Wrangel Island as well as the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug on the Russian mainland. - Kotzebue Sound (\\"Qikiqtaruk\\" in Iñupiaq) is an arm of the Chukchi Sea in the western region of the U.S. state of Alaska.

The WHO finds that poor cooking, heating and lighting technologies are killing millions of people each year. Indoor air pollution results from the use of dangerous fuels and cook-stoves in the home. To help fight the problem, the WHO announced, new guidelines aimed at reducing household pollutants. WHO officials say nearly three billion people are unable to use clean fuels and technologies for cooking? heating and lighting. And they say more than seven million people die from exposure to indoor or outdoor air pollution each year. Of that number, the WHO says about 4. 3 million people die from household air pollution given off by simple coal cook-stoves. Most of the deaths are in developing countries. Carlos Dora is Coordinator in the WHO's Department of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. He says people should not use unprocessed coal and kerosene fuel indoors. He says opening a window or door to let out the harmful air will not improve the situation. It will only pollute the outdoors. WHO officials say indoor pollution leads to early deaths from stroke, heart and lung disease, childhood pneumonia and lung cancer. Women and girls are the main victims. The United Nations found that more than 95 percent of households in sub-Saharan Africa depend on solid fuels for cooking. It says huge populations in India, China and Latin American countries, such as Guatemala and Peru, are also at risk. Nigel Bruce is a professor of Public Health at the University of Liverpool. He says researchers are developing good cook-stoves and other equipment to burn fuels in a more efficient way.

And in Africa a you can buy a solar lamp for less than 1. 00. Question: According to WHO officials, we can know that Yes or no, is the answer \\"simple coal cook-stoves cause too many deaths\\"? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, according to WHO officials, simple coal cook-stoves cause too many deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about 4.3 million people die from household air pollution each year, primarily due to the use of dangerous fuels and cook-stoves in the home. The majority of these deaths are occurring in developing countries where unprocessed coal and kerosene fuel are commonly used indoors for cooking, heating, and lighting. Indoor air pollution, which is a consequence of using these hazardous fuels and technologies in households, is responsible for a significant number of early deaths from various health conditions. These include stroke, heart and lung disease, childhood pneumonia, and lung cancer. Women and girls are predominantly affected due to their more significant involvement in cooking and domestic chores. The United Nations found that over 95% of households in sub-Saharan Africa rely on solid fuels for cooking. Populations in India, China, and Latin American countries like Guatemala and Peru are also at considerable risk as they depend on these dangerous fuels and cook-stoves for their day-to-day needs. In response to this alarming situation, the WHO has issued new guidelines to reduce household pollutants and improve overall indoor air quality. The organization emphasizes that people should avoid using unprocessed coal and kerosene fuel indoors. Opening windows and doors to let out toxic air does not significantly improve the situation. Instead, it only contributes to outdoor air pollution. Efforts are being made to develop safer and more efficient cook-stoves and technologies that can significantly reduce the number of deaths caused by household air pollution. Some affordable options, such as induction stoves in India and solar lamps in Africa, are already available for purchase. By investing in and adopting cleaner, better alternatives, the world can significantly lower the tragic death toll associated with simple coal cook-stoves and unsafe household practices."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: One event that helps educate young people about things they can do for others is National Youth Service Day (NYSD). Every year on this day, organizations all over the country celebrate young volunteers, educate young people about how they can help their country, and invite them to participate in service projects. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell said, \\"National Youth Service Day honors young volunteers and is an invitation to others to join hands and do our part as Americans.\\" Founded in 1988, NYSD originally took place on a Tuesday. Now the event lasts from Friday until Sunday so that more people can participate in it. More than 200 organizations work together to create thousands of projects each year. Millions of young people across the United States take part in these service projects. Long before the event, people, community groups, schools, and nonprofit organizations think of ways to meet their communities' needs. Then, they plan projects for young volunteers. Projects include bringing food to hungry people, tutoring younger children and helping senior citizens. During the event, young people from the community do things like planting neighborhood gardens and cleaning up local parks. The organizations that contribute to NYSD believe that volunteering and community service are important activities for people of all ages, but especially for young people. Young people who volunteer are more likely to do well in school, vote, and contribute to charities. More important, they help other people and make the world a better place for everyone.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. His trial's over. And now it turns out that George Zimmerman might need the same thing millions of Americans are looking for: a job. As Zimmerman and his legal team mounted their defense, they convinced people across the country to donate hundreds of thousands of dollars to help him. Living expenses, bodyguards and expert witnesses were costly, they argued on websites set up to raise money in the case. So what's next, now that a jury has acquitted him? For the 29-year-old Florida man, the financial picture is cloudy. Critics have already accused Zimmerman of profiting from the case. Will the donations keep pouring in? Will he win a monetary reward in his defamation lawsuit against NBC? Could he cash in on his personal story with a book or movie deal? Beyond the legal costs, Zimmerman's attorney says the case has come at a high price. Fear for his safety has made him live off the grid for months. \\"I don't know how he gets a job where he is out in public,\\" Zimmerman's lawyer Mark O'Mara said, \\"without having the fear of somebody finding out where he works.\\" Expert to Zimmerman: Pick a new career path. Before he shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in February 2012, Zimmerman had studied criminal justice. He applied to become a police officer in Virginia in 2009, but was rejected due to bad credit, according to testimony in his trial. Even with more money in his bank account, that career path shouldn't be on the table anymore, an expert told CNN. \\"That is the absolute worst thing you can do,\\" said reputation management counselor Mike Paul. \\"It might be your old passion; you need to find a new passion. And it needs to be helping people in a very different way -- a way that is much more compassionate, not just involving law enforcement.\\" So far, Zimmerman's lawyers and family have been tight-lipped about his next steps. O'Mara describes his client as a marked man, arguing that his options are limited due to death threats he faces. \\"The first time that he got out of jail, he slept a lot. I think he is going to have to take a lot of time to relax, to center himself, to get used to his new reality, which is a free man, exonerated,\\" brother Robert Zimmerman Jr. told CNN en EspaÃ±ol on Sunday. \\"And he is going to have to take his own steps as he sees fit, whatever brings him the best result.\\" Whatever he does, his brother said, it will have to be under the radar. \\"As he engages the world, as anyone in his situation would, without restrictions,\\" Robert Zimmerman said, \\"he's going to have to learn to move about in a very low-profile way and keep to himself.\\" Race perhaps simplest disagreement in Zimmerman post-trial interviews. Donations fueled defense, led to wife's arrest. But online, at least, being low-profile hasn't exactly been Zimmerman's style. Through websites set up for his defense, he raked in hundreds of thousands of dollars. One site, gzdefensefund.com, raised more than 330,000 in just over a year, according to a spokesman for Zimmerman's lawyer. That's in addition to about 200,000 Zimmerman raised on his own through a PayPal account before O'Mara took the case. Where did that money go? A summary on the website gives examples of how Zimmerman spent some of the donations: 95,000 for bail bond, about 56,000 for security and a whopping 61,747.54 for living expenses over an eight-month period. \\"If 61,747.54 sounds like a lot of money for living expenses for 8 months -- you are right,\\" the website says. \\"It's more than most people earn in a year. Most of George's living expenses for the first several months were allocated to providing a safe, secure place for George and his wife, Shellie, to live.\\" At one point after his arrest, the site says, Zimmerman was hiding out in a location that was so remote that it cost 2,500 to connect a phone line. Raising hundreds of thousands of dollars from supporters for your case is a good thing, right? Well, it wasn't for Shellie Zimmerman, who now faces a perjury charge. Prosecutors allege she lied when she told a Florida judge during a bail hearing for her husband in April 2012 that the family was indigent. In fact, they argue, George Zimmerman actually had about 135,000 at the time. She's pleaded not guilty, and has a court date in the case scheduled for next month. Even if donations keep pouring in, Zimmerman shouldn't necessarily take all the money he's offered, said Gene Grabowski, a crisis public relations manager. \\"He's got to be careful to avoid the appearances of creating more divisions by accepting money or support openly from groups that, maybe, that would create more friction because of the tenor of this case,\\" he said. \\"He's got to be careful about who he associates with afterwards, even if they are offering financial support.\\" Despite outrage, federal charges uncertain in case. What about a book? A juror in the high-profile case has already inked a deal with an agent for a possible book. Could a book or a made-for-TV movie be in Zimmerman's future? Last week HLN's Nancy Grace said a multimillion-dollar book for Zimmerman would probably be in the offing. And that possibility is already drawing sharp criticism. In an editorial titled \\"Zimmerman's acquittal shouldn't lead to riches,\\" The Philadelphia Inquirer argued Monday that Zimmerman is \\"likely to be offered millions through lucrative book and movie deals.\\" \\"It would be a shame,\\" the newspaper said, \\"if the unnecessary death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin produced more paydays for the man who fatally shot the unarmed black teenager in the heart during a scuffle.\\" Civil lawsuits surge to the forefront. Even with the criminal trial over, Zimmerman still is likely to face several legal battles. Activists are pushing for the federal government to file civil rights charges against him. And it's possible Martin's family will file a civil wrongful death case, which could threaten Zimmerman's pocketbook. They haven't said yet if they will. That could be more likely, some analysts say, if it appeared Zimmerman was profiting from the case. A book or movie deal could make Zimmerman more vulnerable to a wrongful death suit, criminal defense attorney Randy Reep told USA Today. And then there's another case that Zimmerman started, suing NBC Universal over edited versions of a 911 call Zimmerman made. That lawsuit alleges that NBC deliberately edited an audio tape of his 911 call to make Zimmerman sound racist. \\"Because of NBC's deceptive and exploitative manipulations, the public wrongly believes that Zimmerman 'use(d) a racial epithet' while describing Martin during the call to the dispatcher on that fateful night,\\" the suit says. NBC Universal has disputed the accusations. \\"There was no intent to portray Mr. Zimmerman unfairly,\\" the company said last year. \\"We intend to vigorously defend our position in court.\\" The lawsuit says Zimmerman is seeking \\"damages in excess of the jurisdictional limit,\\" but doesn't specify a dollar figure. Zimmerman's brother says the family is focusing on getting a fresh start. But so far, the verdict hasn't put a stop to debate over the controversial case. And it's unclear what that could mean for Zimmerman's cash flow.

It touches on the challenges Zimmerman would face in returning to his previous line of work in criminal justice and law enforcement, as well as the possible civil actions that could come from Trayvon Martin's family.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: 30.3 Roots Roots help to anchor a plant, absorb water and minerals, and serve as storage sites for food. Taproots and fibrous roots are the two main types of root systems. In a taproot system, a main root grows vertically downward with a few lateral roots. Fibrous root systems arise at the base of the stem, where a cluster of roots forms a dense network that is shallower than a taproot. The growing root tip is protected by a root cap. The root tip has three main zones: a zone of cell division (cells are actively dividing), a zone of elongation (cells increase in length), and a zone of maturation (cells differentiate to form different kinds of cells). Root vascular tissue conducts water, minerals, and sugars. In some habitats, the roots of certain plants may be modified to form aerial roots or epiphytic roots.

I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

Cook the mixture: Ask an adult to help you place the saucepan on the stove and turn the heat to medium-high. Let the mixture boil until the candy thermometer reaches 300°F (150°C), which is when it's the right temperature for hard candy. 5. Add cherry flavor and color: Once the mixture is at the correct temperature, turn off the heat, and carefully add the cherry flavoring and red food coloring.

The ship lands in a lake situated around the local fjords of ancient Norway during the time of the Vikings 709AD. From its wreckage emerge two bitter enemies: One) a soldier from another world that speaks Icelandic and states that he came from an Island to the North Kainan and two) a bloodthirsty creature known as the Moorwen. Man and creature both seek revenge for violence committed against them. Before he has a chance to track down the alien, Kainan the Outlander is captured by a Viking warrior, and is held prisoner in the local village led by King Rothgar. As the Moorwen ravages the Viking lands, killing everything in its path, Kainan forms an alliance with the primitive but fierce warriors. Whilst trying to hunt for the Moorwen, war brews among the Vikings, which culminated with both sides taking immense losses. As the enemy Vikings retreat into the forests, the Moorwen strikes, leaving the vikings no choice but to run for help to their once close enemies. Together, the two sides attempt to destroy the Moorwen as a single band of Vikings. The Vikings thus construct a pit filled with oil to lure the Moorwen inside and plan to ignite the fuel, burning the Moorwen, with the help of Kainan. The plan to incinerate the Moorwen fails, leaving the village to take massive casualties, and with the surprise that the Moorwen had given birth to a new, younger Moorwen, which surprises the Vikings from behind and kills the Viking Leader in the process. This leaves the villages in fear and its warriors demoralised, most of the vikings leave the village in search of a new home and safety. Kainan and the remaining loyal warriors stand together to destroy the Moorwen. Kainan realizes from the last battle, that the Moorwen is almost impenetrable with the current metals used, and assists the Vikings by salvaging pieces of his crashed spacecraft and forging weapons capable of harming the creature.

Glue a border around the handle. Cut out a long strip of cardboard the same width as the handle and glue it to the pieces.;","completion":"In order to glue together your cardboard sniper rifles, you can choose between the following two options: OPTION A: 1. Cut \\"filler pieces\\" or cardboard squares smaller than your rifle hand pieces to fit in the middle. To do this, first measure your rifle hand pieces and determine the size needed for the filler pieces. Make sure the filler pieces are slightly smaller so they can fit in between the two main hand pieces. 2. Glue a border around the handle. To create a border, start by measuring the thickness of your handle and cut strips of cardboard to this size. You can create a consistent border by using a ruler or other straight edge to help you cut the cardboard to the desired dimensions. Once you've cut the strips, apply glue to the edges of the handle and attach the border accordingly. You can also use tape to help hold these pieces in place while the glue dries. 3. Cut out a long strip of cardboard the same width as the handle and glue it to the pieces. Measure and mark the length and width of the strip needed, then cut it out using a straight edge and utility knife or scissors. Apply glue to the strip and attach it to the top of your filler pieces and border, connecting the two main hand pieces in the process. Make sure the strip is properly aligned and apply pressure to ensure the strip adheres correctly. You may also want to use clamps or tape to help hold the strip in place while the glue dries. OPTION B: 1. Cut \\"filler pieces\\" or cardboard squares bigger than your rifle hand pieces to fit in the middle. In this option, the filler pieces will provide some overlap with the main hand pieces. Measure the size needed for these filler pieces and cut them accordingly, keeping in mind that they should be slightly larger than the main hand pieces to create the desired effect. 2. Glue a border around the handle. Similar to Option A, measure the thickness of your handle and cut strips of cardboard for the border. Apply glue to the edges of the handle and attach the border pieces. You can use tape to help keep these pieces in place while the glue dries. 3. Cut out a long strip of cardboard the same width as the handle and glue it to the pieces. Measure the dimensions required for the strip, and cut it out with a straight edge and cutting tool. Apply glue to the long strip and attach it to the top of your filler pieces and border, joining the two main hand pieces. Ensure the strip is aligned and press down firmly.

With memories of last year's killer typhoons still fresh, Typhoon Megi roared across the Philippines on Monday, ripping through roofs and cutting off electricity. The cyclone's peak wind speeds decreased as the system moved over the Sierra Madre mountains, but it still packed sustained winds of around 167 kph (103 mph) with gusts up to 204 kph (126 mph), according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. This is down from peak sustained winds of 212 kph, with gusts up to 259 kph (161 mph), over the weekend. Megi, also known as Typhoon Juan, was expected to pick up steam again as it heads over the South China Sea. Current forecasts from the Joint Typhoon Center show the storm heading toward the southeastern China coast, just west of Hong Kong. In the Philippines, five people have died in what the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council is billing as the strongest storm of the year, according to Catherine Martin, manager of disaster management services at the Philippine National Red Cross. Emergency workers pulled the body of Vicente Decena, 53, from a bloated river; a tree fell on the house of Aileen Respicio, 20, killing her and injuring her child. Five others were injured elsewhere, the disaster council reported. Even as it weakened, Megi continued to pose a serious threat. Trees swayed and relentless rains inundated roads. Storm chaser James Cabrera, who was in Luzon, said parts of the Philippines could see 300 to 500 millimeters (12 to 20 inches) of rain. \\"Unfortunately, this is a part of the world where the infrastructure is quite fragile, the power grid is quite fragile and a lot of people live in quite basic houses,\\" James Reynolds, a storm chaser who is on Luzon, told CNN on Monday. \\"We have learned our lessons from the grim experiences we had during typhoons Ondoy [known internationally as Ketsana] and Pepeng [Parma],\\" House Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr. said, according to the Philippine News Agency. \\"We must all cooperate because nature's wrath exempts no one.\\" A year ago, tens of thousands of people were in evacuation centers as four consecutive typhoons drenched the Philippines. About 500 people were reported dead. Journalist Eduardo Lingao in Manila contributed to this report for CNN.

Article: The first two Earth-like worlds orbiting another star have been detected, although neither are believed to be suitable for life. But if the planets had water in the past, there's a good chance they could have hung on to it long enough for life to take hold, Linda Elkins-Tanton, with the Carnegie Institution in Washington DC, told reporters on a conference call Tuesday. The planets, known as Kepler-20e and 20f, are the smallest planets found so far by NASA's Kepler telescope, which was launched three years ago to look for Earth-sized worlds around other stars. SCIENCE CHANNEL VIDEO: Lonely Planet The newly discovered planets have diameters of 6,900 miles and 8,200 miles -- equivalent to 0.87 times Earth -- slightly smaller than Venus -- and 1.03 times Earth. They join three Neptune-sized gas giant planets circling the parent star Kepler-20, which is slightly smaller and dimmer than the sun. The system is located about 1,000 light years away in the constellation Lyra. While Kepler-20e and 20f are not thought to be habitable, it is \\"the next major milestone along the road to finding habitable planets around stars beyond the sun,\\" said Kepler project scientist Nick Gautier, with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. SLIDE SHOW: Top Exoplanets for Alien Life The two new discoveries were found by a team led by Francois Fressin of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, using NASA's Kepler orbiting space telescope. The results were published online in the journal Nature. Finding the relatively small planets was a feat. Kepler monitors more than 150,000 stars for tiny wobbles in light. The wobbles signal a planet as it passes in front of the star and dims the light reaching the telescope. The discovery follows the announcement earlier this month of Kepler-22b, a planet around twice the diameter of Earth that is orbiting the right distance from its parent star for liquid water to exist on its surface. Water is believed to be a key ingredient for life. \\"Kepler-22b has the right temperature, but it is too big. What we're announcing today are just the right size, but too hot. But you can bet that the hunt is on to find a planet that combines the best of both worlds, a true earth twin,\\" said astronomer David Charbonneau with Harvard University. SLIDE SHOW: Exquisite Exoplanetary Art Unlike our solar system where the rocky planets Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars orbit closer in to the sun than the gas giants Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, the five planets circling Kepler-20 are a mix of rocky and gas planets and all orbit closer to their parent star than Mercury is to the sun. \\"The architecture of that planetary system is crazy,\\" Charbonneau said. \\"Rocky planets and gas giants happily mingle together. This is the first time we've seen anything like this.\\" \\"I really want to dare my fellow astronomers to try to explain how this system could have formed,\\" he said. ||||| MOFFETT FIELD, Calif. - NASA's Kepler mission has discovered the first Earth-size planets orbiting a sun-like star outside our solar system. The planets, called Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f, are too close to their star to be in the so-called habitable zone where liquid water could exist on a planet's surface, but they are the smallest exoplanets ever confirmed around a star like our sun. The discovery marks the next important milestone in the ultimate search for planets like Earth. The new planets are thought to be rocky. Kepler-20e is slightly smaller than Venus, measuring 0.87 times the radius of Earth. Kepler-20f is a bit larger than Earth, measuring 1.03 times its radius. Both planets reside in a five-planet system called Kepler-20, approximately 1,000 light-years away in the constellation Lyra. Kepler-20e orbits its parent star every 6.1 days and Kepler-20f every 19.6 days. These short orbital periods mean very hot, inhospitable worlds. Kepler-20f, at 800 degrees Fahrenheit, is similar to an average day on the planet Mercury. The surface temperature of Kepler-20e, at more than 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit, would melt glass. \\"The primary goal of the Kepler mission is to find Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone,\\" said Francois Fressin of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., lead author of a new study published in the journal Nature. \\"This discovery demonstrates for the first time that Earth-size planets exist around other stars, and that we are able to detect them.\\" The Kepler-20 system includes three other planets that are larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune. Kepler-20b, the closest planet, Kepler-20c, the third planet, and Kepler-20d, the fifth planet, orbit their star every 3.7, 10.9 and 77.6 days. All five planets have orbits lying roughly within Mercury's orbit in our solar system. The host star belongs to the same G-type class as our sun, although it is slightly smaller and cooler. The system has an unexpected arrangement. In our solar system, small, rocky worlds orbit close to the sun and large, gaseous worlds orbit farther out. In comparison, the planets of Kepler-20 are organized in alternating size: large, small, large, small and large. \\"The Kepler data are showing us some planetary systems have arrangements of planets very different from that seen in our solar system,\\" said Jack Lissauer, planetary scientist and Kepler science team member at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif. \\"The analysis of Kepler data continues to reveal new insights about the diversity of planets and planetary systems within our galaxy.\\" Scientists are not certain how the system evolved but they do not think the planets formed in their existing locations. They theorize the planets formed farther from their star and then migrated inward, likely through interactions with the disk of material from which they originated. This allowed the worlds to maintain their regular spacing despite alternating sizes. The Kepler space telescope detects planets and planet candidates by measuring dips in the brightness of more than 150,000 stars to search for planets crossing in front, or transiting, their stars. The Kepler science team requires at least three transits to verify a signal as a planet. The Kepler science team uses ground-based telescopes and the Spitzer Space Telescope to review observations on planet candidates the spacecraft finds. The star field Kepler observes in the constellations Cygnus and Lyra can be seen only from ground-based observatories in spring through early fall. The data from these other observations help determine which candidates can be validated as planets. To validate Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f, astronomers used a computer program called Blender, which runs simulations to help rule out other astrophysical phenomena masquerading as a planet. On Dec. 5 the team announced the discovery of Kepler-22b in the habitable zone of its parent star. It is likely to be too large to have a rocky surface. While Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f are Earth-size, they are too close to their parent star to have liquid water on the surface. \\"In the cosmic game of hide and seek, finding planets with just the right size and just the right temperature seems only a matter of time,\\" said Natalie Batalha, Kepler deputy science team lead and professor of astronomy and physics at San Jose State University. \\"We are on the edge of our seats knowing that Kepler's most anticipated discoveries are still to come.\\" NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., manages Kepler's ground system development, mission operations and science data analysis. JPL managed the Kepler mission's development. Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corp. in Boulder, Colo., developed the Kepler flight system and supports mission operations with the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado in Boulder.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Kiraly grew up in Santa Barbara, California. He began playing volleyball at age six with encouragement from his father, Dr. Laszlo Kiraly, who had been a member of the Hungarian Junior National team prior to fleeing the country during the Hungarian national uprising of 1956. At age 11, Kiraly entered his first beach volleyball tournament paired with his father. Kiraly attended Santa Barbara High School, where he was a member of the boys' varsity volleyball team. Kiraly had a long career on the professional beach circuit, and with 148 career wins is the 'winningest' player in the sport's history. He won at least one tournament in 24 of the 28 seasons he played in a career that spanned four decades. He claimed titles with 13 partners, and in domestic events he made it to the semifinals over 80% of the time. Kiraly competed into his mid-40s. Kiraly played in his first beach tournament at age 11 as his father's partner. Kiraly has said as an 11-year-old he was thrilled to discover in beach volleyball he could compete with grown men on even terms. He earned his A and AA rating on the beach at the age of 15 and his AAA rating at 17. Kiraly's first big beach breakthrough came at Hermosa Beach in 1978. As a 17-year-old who had just graduated from high school, he shocked Hermosa onlookers by gaining the finals before he and partner Marco Ortega lost to the day's dominant team on the beach, Jim Menges and Greg Lee. In the early 1980s, Kiraly made a successful beach team pairing with UCLA teammate Sinjin Smith. The partnership split up as Kiraly came to focus on the U.S National Team. In 1992 Kiraly left his indoor career behind, returning to the U.S. to play beach volleyball full-time on the AVP tour. Kiraly chose Kent Steffes as his doubles partner. Steffes was a talented younger player who had left UCLA early to start playing on the professional beach tour. Kiraly and Steffes soon became the dominant pairing on the tour, supplanting former teammate and doubles partner Smith and his partner Randy Stoklos as the beach's top team. In 1996 Kiraly returned to the Olympics, this time competing in beach volleyball with his partner, Steffes. Kiraly and Steffes won the gold medal, the first ever awarded for men's beach volleyball. Kiraly continued to win tournaments into his 40s, recording two AVP tournament victories with his partner Brent Doble in 2002 and 2003, and four more with Mike Lambert in 2004 and 2005. Kiraly's last victory came in August 2005, when he and Lambert won at Huntington Beach. In 2006, Kiraly partnered with Larry Witt, and in 2007 partnered with Kevin Wong. His teams continued to make high placings. Over his career on the beach, Kiraly won over 3 million in prize money, and earned considerably more in endorsements. Kiraly retired from the AVP tour after the 2007 season. Ultimately Kiraly won 148 professional beach volleyball titles, 74 of them with Steffes. The next closest player in total wins is Sinjin Smith at 139. Following Smith is his longtime partner, Randy Stoklos, at 122. The next closest player behind these four from the top two teams is Emanuel Rego, with 78 wins. What was his position","completion":"in the sport's history, based on career wins?

She shared an apartment in Montparnasse with Amedeo Modigliani and posed for him as well . Another friend was adventure novelist Charles Beadle , with whom she had several things in common . He grew up in Hackney , spent time in South Africa ( participating in the Boer War as a member of the British South African Police ) , and published several novels about bohemian life in Paris . When Beadle came to America , from Paris , in November 1916 , he listed Hastings as his nearest friend in Paris . Towards the end of her life she felt excluded from the literary recognition she felt her due , and blamed Orage , whom she accused of conspiring to keep her out of literary circles in Britain , and she published a pamphlet , The Old New Age , bitterly criticising him in 1936 . In 1943 , probably suffering from cancer , she killed herself with gas from a domestic cooker . - Philip Mairet (full name: Philippe Auguste Mairet; 18861975) was a designer, writer and journalist. He had a wide range of interest: crafts, Alfred Adler and psychiatry, and Social Credit. He was also a translator of major figures including Sartre. He wrote biographies of Sir Patrick Geddes and A. R. Orage, with both of whom he was closely associated. - The New Age was a British literary magazine, noted for its wide influence under the editorship of A. R. Orage from 1907 to 1922. It began life in 1894 as a publication of the Christian Socialist movement; but in 1907 as a radical weekly edited by Joseph Clayton, it was struggling. In May of that year, Alfred Orage and Holbrook Jackson, who had been running the Leeds Arts Club, took over the journal with financial help from George Bernard Shaw. Jackson acted as co-editor only for the first year, after which Orage edited it alone until he sold it in 1922. By that time his interests had moved towards mysticism, and the quality and circulation of the journal had declined. According to a Brown University press release, \\"\\"The New Age\\" helped to shape modernism in literature and the arts from 1907 to 1922\\". It ceased publication in 1938. Orage was also associated with \\"The New English Weekly\\" (193249) as editor during its first two years of operation (Philip Mairet took over at his death in 1934). - Kathleen Mansfield Murry (nee Beauchamp; 14 October 1888 9 January 1923) was a prominent New Zealand modernist short story writer who was born and brought up in colonial New Zealand and wrote under the pen name of Katherine Mansfield. At 19, Mansfield left New Zealand and settled in the United Kingdom, where she became a friend of modernist writers such as D.H. Lawrence and Virginia Woolf. In 1917 she was diagnosed with extrapulmonary tuberculosis, which led to her death at the age of 34. - George Holbrook Jackson (31 December 1874 16 June 1948) was a British journalist, writer and publisher. He was recognised as one of the leading bibliophiles of his time. - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Adeline Virginia Woolf (née Stephen; 25 January 1882 28 March 1941) was an English writer and one of the foremost modernists of the twentieth century. - Tarr is a modernist novel by Wyndham Lewis, written in 190911, revised and expanded in 191415 and first serialized in the magazine \\"The Egoist\\" from April 1916 until November 1917. The American version was published in 1918, with an English edition published by the Egoist Press appearing shortly afterwards; Lewis later created a revised and final version published by Chatto and Windus in 1928. Set in the bohemian milieu of pre-war Paris, it presents two artists, the Englishman Tarr and the German Kreisler, and their struggles with money, women, and social situations. The novel abounds in somewhat Nietzschean themes. Tarr, generally thought to be modelled on Lewis himself, displays disdain for the 'bourgeois-bohemians' around him, and vows to 'throw off humour' which he regardsespecially in its English formas a 'means of evading reality' unsuited to ambition and the modern world. This self-conscious attitude and the situations that it brings about are, ironically, a major source of the novel's pervasive dark humour. Kreisler, a violent German Romantic of protean energy and a failure as an artist, is in many ways the focus of the novel. An indication of the extremity of his vivid portrait is Lewis's own wondering several years later if he had, in Kreisler, anticipated the personality of Hitler. - The Leeds Arts Club was founded in 1903 by the Leeds school teacher Alfred Orage and Yorkshire textile manufacture Holbrook Jackson, and was probably one of the most advanced centres for modernist thinking in Britain in the pre-First World War period. - Percy Wyndham Lewis (18 November 1882 7 March 1957) was an English painter and critic (he dropped the name 'Percy', which he disliked). He was a co-founder of the Vorticist movement in art, and edited the literary magazine of the Vorticists, \\"BLAST\\". His novels include his pre-World War I-era novel \\"Tarr\\" (set in Paris), and \\"The Human Age\\", a trilogy comprising \\"The Childermass\\" (1928), \\"Monstre Gai\\" and \\"Malign Fiesta\\" (both 1955), set in the afterworld. A fourth volume of \\"The Human Age\\", \\"The Trial of Man,\\" was begun by Lewis but left in a fragmentary state at the time of his death. He also wrote two autobiographical volumes, \\"Blasting and Bombardiering\\" (1937) and \\"Rude Assignment: A Narrative of my Career Up-to-Date\\" (1950).

After abandoning her graduate studies, Malena is determined to find her purpose and rekindle her relationship with her estranged father, a well-regarded local fruit tycoon dubbed \\"The Citrus King.\\" One sunny afternoon, Malena is happily strolling through the bustling farmer's market, indulging in one of her favorite pastimes: gathering fresh produce, especially oranges, to create her exquisite fruit salads. As she hurries back home to prepare for a long-awaited, but rather tense, dinner with her father, something from her bursting shopping bag slips away unnoticed: three plump, gleaming oranges. Across the way, an aspiring yet struggling musician, Leo, is performing for whatever change he can collect. The oranges rolling out of Malena's shopping bag capture his attention, and a single thought lingers: these oranges could be his lucky charm. He picks them up, feeling an inexplicable surge of energy and inspiration. Feeling the power of Malena's lost oranges, Leo embarks on a quest to find her, the rightful owner of the fruit. Unbeknownst to him, he starts composing beautiful songs like never before, and soon begins to see his dream becoming a reality as the town grows smitten by his newfound talent. Simultaneously, Malena faces her fair share of turbulent events. Apart from revisiting the fraught and difficult relationships with her father and childhood best friend, she starts to think that her fruit salad seems bitterly imperfect without the three missing oranges. Leo eventually tracks down Malena and returns the good-fortune oranges. As they share their stories, the enchanting power of the oranges surprisingly brings a reconciliatory gust in Malena's life. Her father, moved by Leo's enchanting music and Malena's ceaseless resolve, agrees to mend their relationship, and Malena finds solace in her father's heart, without feeling diminished in her pursuits.

According to documents discovered in the National Archives, home office doctors approved and oversaw experimental drug trials on children at two approved schools in the United Kingdom during that period. This revelation has inevitably raised a plethora of ethical questions and concerns revolving around the nature of these drug trials and the safety and well-being of the children involved. Background: Approved Schools - What They Were Approved Schools were a type of reform institution for children in the UK, established under the 1933 Children and Young Persons Act. These specialized institutions aimed at rehabilitating juvenile delinquents by offering education, vocational training, and discipline and were under the jurisdiction of the home office. In these schools, students were typically under the age of 18 and were placed there either by court order or voluntarily by their parents. The Drug Trials: Purpose and Execution According to the National Archives files, experimental drug trials were conducted in two undisclosed approved schools in the 1960s. The main objective of these trials was to test the efficacy and safety of newly developed medications. With approval granted by home office doctors, the trials were carried out in a series of phases, with varying dosages and therapeutic schedules. The documents reveal that the experiments included testing tranquilizers, sedatives, and other psychoactive drugs on the young subjects. Given the sensitive nature of the trials, the identity of the schools, doctors, and children involved has not been disclosed. However, it is clear from the records that the subjects of these trials were likely juvenile delinquents attending these institutions, potentially making them vulnerable to emotional, psychological, and physical exploitation. Ethical Concerns and Implications The newly unearthed information raises several ethical concerns. First and foremost, the children were not in a position to provide informed consent to participate in these experimental drug trials. Even if their legal guardians or the courts had given consent, it is questionable whether this consent was informed or voluntary, considering the societal and disciplinary context of the approved schools. Additionally, the protocols for conducting drug tests in the 1960s were significantly less stringent than those in place today. Consequently, issues such as transparency, safety checks, and proper monitoring of negative side effects might not have been adequately addressed at the time. Finally, the use of already disadvantaged young people as subjects in these drug trials highlights the disturbing nature of the power dynamics that made such experiments possible. These children were involuntarily placed in these institutions, making them particularly susceptible to maltreatment and exploitation. Addressing Past Wrongs: The Way Forward Acknowledging this appalling chapter in our history serves as a solemn reminder of the responsibility we have towards future generations. It is essential to learn from this dark past and enforce rigorous protocols for clinical trials, ensuring the well-being and safety of all trial participants, especially vulnerable populations. Furthermore, it is our duty to ensure that access to quality healthcare, education, and rehabilitation remain primary rights for all individuals, regardless of their age or social status. In conclusion, the discovery of these experimental drug trials in approved schools from the 1960s is both shocking and saddening. It provides important insights into the historical context of clinical trials and the mistreatment of vulnerable populations. It is crucial for society to openly address these disturbing findings and work towards rectifying the wrongs committed to ensure that future generations do not suffer from such unethical practices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the 19th-century, it was used in a much narrower sense by English writers to discuss developments in the early Italian libretto, e.g., \\"Rigoletto\\" and \\"Un ballo in maschera\\". Characteristic are the influence of French bourgeois drama, female instead of male protagonists, and the practice of opening the action with a chorus. - Opera seria (plural: \\"opere serie\\"; usually called \\"dramma per musica\\" or \\"melodramma serio\\") is an Italian musical term which refers to the noble and \\"serious\\" style of Italian opera that predominated in Europe from the 1710s to c. 1770.

He was a contemporary of the older Virgil and Horace, with whom he is often ranked as one of the three canonical poets of Latin literature.

The form first evolves in the 18th century, when composers including Antonio Vivaldi, Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel wrote organ concertos with small orchestras, and with solo parts which rarely call for the organ pedal board. During the Classical period organ concerto became popular in many places, especially in Bavaria, Austria and Bohemia (whether called there a concerto, pastorella, or sonata), reaching a position of being almost an integral part of the church music tradition of \\"jubilus\\" character. From the Romantic era fewer works are known. Finally, there are some 20th- and 21st-century examples, of which the concerto by Francis Poulenc has entered the basic repertoire, and is quite frequently played. - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor. - The masque was a form of festive courtly entertainment that flourished in 16th- and early 17th-century Europe, though it was developed earlier in Italy, in forms including the intermedio (a public version of the masque was the pageant). A masque involved music and dancing, singing and acting, within an elaborate stage design, in which the architectural framing and costumes might be designed by a renowned architect, to present a deferential allegory flattering to the patron. Professional actors and musicians were hired for the speaking and singing parts. Often the masquers, who did not speak or sing, were courtiers: the English queen Anne of Denmark frequently danced with her ladies in masques between 1603 and 1611, and Henry VIII and Charles I of England performed in the masques at their courts. In the tradition of masque, Louis XIV of France danced in ballets at Versailles with music by Jean-Baptiste Lully. - Poseidon (Greek: ) was one of the twelve Olympian deities of the pantheon in Greek mythology. His main domain was the ocean, and he is called the \\"God of the Sea\\". Additionally, he is referred to as \\"Earth-Shaker\\" due to his role in causing earthquakes, and has been called the \\"tamer of horses\\". He is usually depicted as an older male with curly hair and a beard. - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - Tamerlano (\\"Tamerlane\\", HWV 18) is an opera seria in three acts written for the Royal Academy of Music theatre company, with music by George Frideric Handel to an Italian text by Nicola Francesco Haym, adapted from Agostin Piovene's \\"Tamerlano\\" together with another libretto entitled \\"Bajazet\\" after Nicolas Pradon's \\"Tamerlan, ou La Mort de Bajazet\\". - Tragédie en musique (Musical tragedy), also known as tragédie lyrique (French lyric tragedy), is a genre of French opera introduced by Jean-Baptiste Lully and used by his followers until the second half of the eighteenth century. Operas in this genre are usually based on stories from Classical mythology or the Italian romantic epics of Tasso and Ariosto. The stories may not have a tragic ending in fact, they generally don't but the atmosphere must be noble and elevated. The standard \\"tragédie en musique\\" has five acts. Earlier works in the genre were preceded by an allegorical prologue and, during the lifetime of Louis XIV, these generally celebrated the king's noble qualities and his prowess in war. Each of the five acts usually follows a basic pattern, opening with an aria in which one of the main characters expresses their feelings, followed by dialogue in recitative interspersed with short arias (\\"petits airs\\"), in which the main business of the plot occurs. Each act traditionally ends with a \\"divertissement\\", offering great opportunities for the chorus and the ballet troupe. Composers sometimes changed the order of these features in an act for dramatic reasons. - George Frideric (or Frederick) Handel (born , ; 23 February 1685 (O.S.) [(N.S.) 5 March] 14 April 1759) was a German, later British baroque composer who spent the bulk of his career in London, becoming well known for his operas, oratorios, anthems, and organ concertos. Handel received important training in Halle and worked as a composer in Hamburg and Italy before settling in London in 1712; he became a naturalised British subject in 1727. He was strongly influenced both by the great composers of the Italian Baroque and by the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition. - An anthem is a musical composition of celebration, usually used as a symbol for a distinct group, particularly the national anthems of countries. Originally, and in music theory and religious contexts, it also refers more particularly to short sacred choral work and still more particularly to a specific form of Anglican church music. - Giulio Cesare in Egitto (Italian for \\"Julius Caesar in Egypt\\", HWV 17), commonly known as Giulio Cesare, is a dramma per musica (\\"opera seria\\") in three acts composed for the Royal Academy of Music by George Frideric Handel in 1724. The libretto was written by Nicola Francesco Haym who used an earlier libretto by Giacomo Francesco Bussani, which had been set to music by Antonio Sartorio (1676). The opera was a success at its first performances, was frequently revived by Handel in his subsequent opera seasons and is now one of the most often performed Baroque operas. Composition history. \\"Giulio Cesare in Egitto\\" was first performed at the King's Theatre in the Haymarket, London on 20 February 1724. The opera was an immediate success. A contemporary wrote in a letter on 10 March 1724: ...the opera is in full swing also, since Hendell's new one, called Jules César in which Cenesino and Cozzuna shine beyond all criticism has been put on. The house was just as full at the seventh performance as at the first. - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores). - Ballet is a type of performance dance that originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia. It has since become a widespread, highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary based on French terminology. It has been globally influential and has defined the foundational techniques used in many other dance genres. Becoming a ballet dancer requires years of training. Ballet has been taught in various schools around the world, which have historically incorporated their own cultures to evolve the art. - Giovanni Bononcini (or Buononcini) (18 July 1670 9 July 1747) (sometimes cited also as Giovanni Battista Bononcini) was an Italian Baroque composer, cellist, singer and teacher, one of a family of string players and composers. - Italian opera is both the art of opera in Italy and opera in the Italian language. Opera was born in Italy around the year 1600 and Italian opera has continued to play a dominant role in the history of the form until the present day. Many famous operas in Italian were written by foreign composers, including Handel, Gluck and Mozart. Works by native Italian composers of the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Verdi and Puccini, are amongst the most famous operas ever written and today are performed in opera houses across the world. - Jean-Baptiste Lully (born Giovanni Battista Lulli ; 28 November 1632 22 March 1687) was an Italian-born French composer, instrumentalist, and dancer who spent most of his life working in the court of Louis XIV of France. He is considered a master of the French baroque style. Lully disavowed any Italian influence in French music of the period. He became a French subject in 1661. - A myth is any traditional story consisting of events that are ostensibly historical, though often supernatural, explaining the origins of a cultural practice or natural phenomenon. The word \\"myth\\" is derived from the Greek word mythos, which simply means \\"story\\". Mythology can refer either to the study of myths, or to a body or collection of myths. Myth can mean 'sacred story', 'traditional narrative' or 'tale of the gods'. A myth also can be a story to explain why something exists. - Opera buffa (plural: \\"opere buffe\\"; Italian for \\"comic opera\\") is a genre of opera. It was first used as an informal description of Italian comic operas variously classified by their authors as \\"commedia in musica\\", \\"commedia per musica\\", \\"dramma bernesco\\", \\"dramma comico\\", \\"divertimento giocoso\\". - An oratorio is a large musical composition for orchestra, choir, and soloists. Like an opera, an oratorio includes the use of a choir, soloists, an ensemble, various distinguishable characters, and arias. However, opera is musical theatre, while oratorio is strictly a concert piecethough oratorios are sometimes staged as operas, and operas are sometimes presented in concert form. In an oratorio there is generally little or no interaction between the characters, and no props or elaborate costumes. A particularly important difference is in the typical subject matter of the text. Opera tends to deal with history and mythology, including age-old devices of romance, deception, and murder, whereas the plot of an oratorio often deals with sacred topics, making it appropriate for performance in the church. Protestant composers took their stories from the Bible, while Catholic composers looked to the lives of saints, as well as to Biblical topics. Oratorios became extremely popular in early 17th-century Italy partly because of the success of opera and the Catholic Church's prohibition of spectacles during Lent. Oratorios became the main choice of music during that period for opera audiences. - The characters of the \\"\\" usually represent fixed social types, stock characters, such as foolish old men, devious servants, or military officers full of false bravado. The main categories of these characters include servants, old men, lovers, and captains. The characters are exaggerated \\"real characters\\", such as a know it all doctor called Il Dottore, a greedy old man called Pantalone, or a perfect relationship like the Innamorati. - In Greek mythology, Aegeus or Aegeas, was an archaic figure in the founding myth of Athens. The \\"goat-man\\" who gave his name to the Aegean Sea was, next to Poseidon, the father of Theseus, the founder of Athenian institutions and one of the kings of Athens. - Operetta is a genre of light opera, \\"light\\" in terms both of music and subject matter. What is the relationship between 'teseo' and 'tragédie en musique'? The answer is:","completion":"Teseo is an opera seria with music by George Frideric Handel and Italian-language libretto by Nicola Francesco Haym, which is based on Thésée, a tragédie en musique by Jean-Baptiste Lully and Philippe Quinault. The relationship between Teseo and tragédie en musique lies in their shared source material and the influence of French operatic style on Handel's composition. Thésée is an early example of a tragédie en musique, a genre of French opera characterized by an elevated, noble atmosphere, and often based on stories from Classical mythology or Italian romantic epics. Teseo, as an adaptation of Lully's Thésée, draws upon the same mythological story of Theseus from Ovid's Metamorphoses. While Teseo is an opera seria, a genre that was predominant in Italy and characterized by serious, often mythological stories, its connection to Thésée and the tragédie en musique reflects the influence of French culture and music, further demonstrating the blending of styles and the exchange of ideas across different European musical traditions during the Baroque era."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This typically occurs in aquatic environments, where the organic materials settle and mix with mud, clay, and sand, forming a thick layer of sediments on the bottom. As more sediment accumulates on top of the organic layer, it creates pressure, setting the stage for the subsequent transformation processes like kerogen formation, molecular cracking, and eventually the formation of petroleum or natural gas."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The ice will sharpen your blades and eliminate any grease trapped in the drain. Using ice cubes to maintain your garbage disposal is the more sound solution, as ice will help clean the blades without causing any damage. Ice cubes can effectively remove grease and debris stuck in the drain without posing any risk to the garbage disposal's blades. As the ice cubes are crushed, they can even help to sharpen the blades slightly. Grinding small rocks, on the other hand, is not a good idea, as rocks are much harder than ice and can cause damage to the disposal's blades and motor.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Once upon a time, there was a beautiful girl called Cinderella.Her mother died and Cinderella's father had a new wife, who only loved her two ugly daughters.A handsome prince wanted to find a wife and invited all the girls to a dance.The ugly sisters had beautiful clothes but Cinderella stayed at home in the kitchen.A fairy helped Cinderella and used magic to give her pretty clothes and a carriage to go to the dance, but told her to leave at midnight because the magic would end by then.The prince liked Cinderella a lot and danced with her.Then the clock started ringing 12 p.m.and Cinderella ran out of the hall, leaving one glass shoe behind. The prince wanted the lovely girl to be his wife.He walked around town with the shoe trying to find her.The ugly sisters wanted to marry the prince and tried to put the shoe on, but their feet were like elephants'.Then the prince asked Cinderella to try.The mother and ugly sisters laughed, but they stopped when the shoe went on Cinderella's foot.The prince made Cinderella his wife, and they lived happily ever after. Options: A she hated dances B her sisters were ugly C she had no nice clothes D She didn't like the prince Answer: C she had no nice clothes Question: Answer:","completion":"\\"Why did Cinderella initially not attend the prince's dance?\\" A) She hated dances B) Her sisters were ugly C) She had no nice clothes D) She didn't like the prince The correct answer is C) She had no nice clothes. According to the story, Cinderella could not go to the dance because she did not have appropriate attire. She only had her usual modest clothing suitable for her chores in the kitchen, and not the beautiful dresses befitting a royal gathering like the one the prince was holding. It was the intervention of a good-hearted fairy who used magic to provide Cinderella with beautiful clothes and a carriage for her to attend the dance. This portrays the harsh life of Cinderella who, despite her outer beauty and inner virtues, was marginalized and denied privileges like attending the prince's dance just because she lacked the material provisions like nice clothes. Her decision to stay behind was not out of dislike for the prince (option D), nor did it have anything to do with her consideration of her sisters' appearances (option B). Furthermore, the text does not suggest that Cinderella had a dislike for dances that kept her from attending (option A). Her condition was primarily a result of her unfortunate circumstance and not a matter of personal preference or personality. This information and evidence help reinforce why option C, \\"she had no nice clothes,\\" is the correct answer to the question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The Chargers had a chance to get on the scoreboard midway through the first quarter, but placekicker Josh Lambo missed wide-right on a 48-yard field goal attempt. Toward the end of the first quarter, the Broncos added to the lead, when linebacker Danny Trevathan intercepted an errant pass by Chargers' quarterback Philip Rivers and returned it for a 25-yard touchdown.

Answer based on context: The stock market crashed in October 1929, and ushered in the Great Depression. By the winter of 1932-33, the economy was so perilous that the unemployment rate hit the 25 percent mark. Unions lost members during this time because laborers could not afford to pay their dues and furthermore, numerous strikes against wage cuts left the unions impoverished: \\"one might have expected a reincarnation of organizations seeking to overthrow the capitalistic system that was now performing so poorly. Some workers did indeed turn to such radical movements as the Communist Party, but, in general, the nation seemed to have been shocked into inaction\\". Though unions were not acting yet, cities across the nation witnessed local and spontaneous marches by frustrated relief applicants. In March 1930, hundreds of thousands of unemployed workers marched through New York City, Detroit, Washington, San Francisco and other cities in a mass protest organized by the Communist Party's Unemployed Councils. In 1931, more than 400 relief protests erupted in Chicago and that number grew to 550 in 1932. The leadership behind these organizations often came from radical groups like Communist and Socialist parties, who wanted to organize \\"unfocused neighborhood militancy into organized popular defense organizations\\". How many more relief protests erupted in Chicago between the number recorded in 1931 and the number in 1932?","completion":"To calculate the difference in the number of relief protests between 1931 and 1932 in Chicago, I subtract the number in 1931 from the number in 1932. The text mentions that there were more than 400 relief protests in Chicago in 1931 and this number grew to 550 in 1932. To determine how many more protests took place in 1932 as compared to 1931, here are the steps I will follow: 1. Note the number of protests in 1932 (550 protests). 2. Subtract the number of protests in 1931 (400 protests) from this number. Calculation: 550 (protests in 1932) - 400 (protests in 1931) = 150 Therefore, there were approximately 150 more relief protests in Chicago in 1932 compared to 1931.

Nigel Farage faced fury from Jewish community leaders today after he formed a pact with a Polish MEP whose party leader has been accused of denying the Holocaust to get EU funding. The Board of Deputies of British Jews said it was 'gravely concerned' by Ukip's deal to accept a member of the Polish Congress of the new Right (KNP) into its grouping in the European Parliament. Robert Iwaszkiewicz's decision to join the Eurosceptic EFDD (Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy) group headed by Mr Farage means it has enough members to increase its funding and standing in the parliament. Ukip leader NIgel Farage has come under pressure after his party was joined in an EU grouping by Robert Iwaszkiewicz. But Mr Iwaszkiewicz has been criticised for joking about hitting women and his party's leader has questioned whether Hitler knew about the Holocaust and suggested women are less intelligent and should not vote. Today Board of Deputies vice president Jonathan Arkush said the KNP should be 'roundly rejected' and described Mr Farage's welcoming of Mr Iwaszkiewicz in order to get money as 'beyond belief'. He said: 'Robert Iwaszkiewicz belongs to an extremist party whose leader has a history of Holocaust denial, racist remarks and misogynistic comments. 'Extremists and racists should be roundly rejected, not embraced. Even France's far right Front National rejected the (KNP) as being too extreme. 'For Ukip to choose such a figure as Robert Iwaszkiewicz as a bedfellow, apparently for money, is beyond belief. 'Nigel Farage now has some very serious questions to answer. He has placed in issue the credibility of Ukip.' But Mr Farage said his party needed to do deals to make sure its voice was heard and insisted he would not work with extremists. 'I have found nothing in this guy's background to suggest he is a political extremist at all. He has joined our group to save us,' he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One. 'All of us in the European Parliament have to make compromises to make sure that our voice is heard. I want us to have our voice, I want us to have a group, but I will not do it at any price. 'If it came to a decision that do we cast Ukip into the outer darkness of a non-attached group here or do a deal with a known prominent extremist in Europe, I would not do that deal.' Asked about the MEP's reported comment that there were 'quite a few wives around who'd be brought back down to earth' if their husbands hit them, Mr Farage, said: 'I think that comment was a joke'. But he added: 'I've never met him, I've never spoken to him.' As the row erupted, Mr Farage insisted he had never met or spoken to Mr Iwaszkiewicz. KNP leader Janusz Korwin-Mikke has been described as one of the most controversial figures in Polish politics, but Ukip emphasised that Mr Iwaszkiewicz was joining the group in a personal capacity. The EFDD was thrown into disarray last week when one its members, a Latvian MEP, quit. Groupings need to have at least 25 MEPs from seven different countries. If the group had disbanded it would have meant a loss to Ukip of about 2million euros a year in funding for its MEPs and Mr Farage would have got less speaking time in the parliament. Michael Dugher MP, Labour's shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, said: 'Here are UKIP forming an alliance with a far-right party in Europe that denies the fact that millions were murdered in the Holocaust, in order to keep receiving hundreds of thousands of pounds from the European Parliament. 'This shows once again that UKIP do not share the values of decent working people in Britain.' However Rabbi Shneur Zalman Odze, a former Ukip MEP candidate, said: 'Robert Iwaszkiewicz was the only Polish member asked to join the EFDD Group. The only comment he made on Hitler was that he was an evil man who should have been executed. 'Korwin-Mikke is not a member of the EFDD group. 'Both UKIP Party and EFDD Group abhors and rejects any scent of anti-Semitism. As a Jewish rabbi, I was number four on the UKIP North West MEP candidate list, and I can assure you in my many years in UKIP I have never once experienced any anti-Semitism. 'All groups in the European Parliament have very odd bedfellows, for examples, the Tories are part of a pan European party aECR with Islamist AK Party of Turkey, Labour are in a Group with homophobes from Croatia. The Greens were recently led by MEP Danny Cohen-Bendit with very odd views on child sexuality. 'The rules to get Group speaking time and funding are set by the European Parliament, not by Ukip.'

The story of the boy Yuuki is the story of such a disaster. Yuuki lived with his family in a seaside village, below a small mountain. One day, as he played on top of the mountain, Yuuki felt a small earthquake but it was not strong enough to frighten anybody. Soon after, however, Yuuki noticed the sea darken and begin running away from the shore very fast, leaving behind wide areas of beach that had never been seen before. Yuuki remembered reading that just before a terrible tsunami, the sea suddenly and quickly rolls backward. He ran to the beach, warning the villagers who had gathered to admire the new beach land. But no one listened. They laughed at him and continued playing in the new sand. Desperate, Yuuki could think of only one thing to do. He lit a tree branch, raced to the rice fields and began burning the harvested rice. Then he called out, \\"Fire! Fire! Everyone run to the mountain! Now!\\" When everyone reached the mountain top, a villager cried out, \\"Yuuki is mad! I saw him set the fire.\\" Yuuki hung his head in shame, but said nothing as the villagers screamed at him. Just then, someone shouted, \\"Look!\\" In the distance a huge dark wave of water was speeding towards the shore. When it hit the shore, it destroyed everything. On the mountain everyone stared at the village ruins in terror. \\"I'm sorry I burned the fields,\\" said Yuuki, his voice trembling. \\"Yuuki,\\" the village chief answered. \\"You saved us all.\\" The villagers cheered and raised Yuuki into the air. \\"We were going to celebrate our rice harvest tonight,\\" said one, \\"but now we'll celebrate that we're all still alive!\\" Options: A He told them about the earthquake.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the orchestra to whose funds Bould always contributed his share of the recording fees? , can you please find it? In 1952 the LPO negotiated a five-year contract with Decca Records, which was unusually rewarding for the orchestra, giving it a 10 per cent commission on most sales. On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds. In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the Communist party; when the cold war began some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell's private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra's chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be \\"seriously jeopardized financially\\" if Russell remained in post. A later writer, Richard Witts, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.In 1953 Boult once again took charge of the orchestral music at a coronation, conducting an ensemble drawn from UK orchestras at the coronation of Elizabeth II. During the proceedings, he conducted the first performances of Bliss's Processional and Walton's march Orb and Sceptre. In the same year he returned to the Proms after a three-year absence, conducting the LPO. The notices were mixed: The Times found a Brahms symphony \\"rather colourless, imprecise and uninspiring\\", but praised Boult and the orchestra's performance of The Planets. In the same year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Royal Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including Paul Kletzki, Jean Martinon, Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, Georg Solti, Walter Susskind and Vaughan Williams.In 1956 Boult and the LPO visited Russia.

Goal: to accommodate many birds at a bird feeder Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? Options: i. attach many different perches to the sides of the bird feeder using a hammer and nails or glue ii. attach many different perches to the bottom of the bird feeder using a hammer and nails or glue...I think the answer is","completion":"Option i: attach many different perches to the sides of the bird feeder using a hammer and nails or glue. Both methods can help achieve the goal of accommodating many birds at a bird feeder, but option i is more reasonable for several reasons. Below is a detailed analysis of each option's advantages and disadvantages, leading to the conclusion that attaching perches to the sides of the bird feeder is a more effective approach. Option i: Attach many different perches to the sides of the bird feeder using a hammer and nails or glue Advantages: 1. Attaching perches to the sides can provide more space for birds to land and feed simultaneously. This increases the number of birds that can use the feeder at once without feeling overcrowded or being forced to wait in line. 2. Installing perches on the sides of the feeder offers more options for customizing their length, positioning, and spacing. This allows the accommodation of various bird species, sizes, and preferences. 3. By strategically placing the perches on the sides, the bird feeder can be made more visually appealing. A well-thought-out design can also reduce the chances of birds bumping into each other or getting in each other's way. 4. Attaching perches to the sides and varying their heights can enable birds to choose a suitable perch based on their size or the natural pecking order. This promotes an organized and efficient feeding system. Disadvantages: 1. Nailing or gluing perches to the sides might call for additional maintenance, especially if heavy or large bird species land on them. However, this is a minor issue that can be easily resolved by using sturdy materials and ensuring a vigilant maintenance routine. Option ii: Attach many different perches to the bottom of the bird feeder using a hammer and nails or glue Advantages: 1. Attaching perches to the bottom provides a flat, stable surface for birds to land and feed. This can make it easier for some bird species to access the feeder. 2. Placing perches under the feeder may help to prevent seeds from falling onto the ground or getting scattered, keeping the feeding area clean and minimizing the risk of attracting other animals or pests. Disadvantages: 1. Attaching perches to the bottom of the bird feeder can restrict the number of birds that can feed at once. Since the feeder blocks access from the top, only a few birds will be able to perch beneath it. 2. Installing perches on the bottom risks becoming a sanitation issue. Bird droppings can accumulate on and around the perches, ultimately contaminating the bird seed and posing a health risk to the birds. 3. Positioning perches under the feeder can lead to a cramped and congested landing area. This may deter birds from using the feeder altogether and result in territorial disputes among the birds. Conclusion: After carefully evaluating both options, it is clear that attaching perches to the sides of the bird feeder (option i) is the more reasonable method to accommodate many birds at once. This solution provides more perching space, caters to various bird species and sizes, and reduces the risk of contamination or territorial disputes. While option ii does have some merits, its disadvantages outweigh the benefits, making option i the more practical choice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Does \\"While each scene has its own character and completeness it must fit into the general sequence to which it belongs.\\" correctly answer the question of Who seemed to have been dominated by geometrical pattern and order?","completion":"The given statement, \\"While each scene has its own character and completeness it must fit into the general sequence to which it belongs,\\" does not directly answer the question, \\"Who seemed to have been dominated by geometrical pattern and order?\\" To provide a comprehensive response to the question, we should first understand what is meant by 'geometrical pattern and order'. In art and design, geometrical pattern and order refer to the use of geometry in creating repetitive patterns, structured compositions, and overall harmony in visual works. This can include the use of shapes, lines, and symmetry to create aesthetically pleasing and well-ordered designs. Now, we can approach the question by discussing various artists, architects, or designers who were known for their use of geometrical patterns and order in their work. One possible answer could be the famous painter Piet Mondrian, who was known for his distinctive style that was heavily influenced by geometrical patterns. Mondrian was a Dutch abstract painter who is often regarded as a founder of the De Stijl art movement and was best known for his works featuring rectangular forms, straight lines, and primary colors. His compositions exemplified simplicity, harmony, and the ideal balance between elements. He created a visual language known as \\"neoplasticism,\\" characterized by the use of basic forms and colors. Another example could be the Ancient Greeks, who were particularly conscious of geometric patterns and order in their architecture and art. From the perfectly proportioned Parthenon temple to their intricate pottery designs, the Greeks demonstrated an appreciation for mathematics, symmetry, and harmony. The famous Greek sculptor Polykleitos even introduced the Canon of Proportions, a set of mathematical ratios aimed at creating the ideal human figure. A third example can be found in Islamic art and architecture, where artists skillfully used geometric patterns to create intricate, detailed, and harmonious designs in their work. Islamic artists often regarded geometry as a universal language that transcended cultural boundaries and symbolized the infinity of God. Their works showcase the beauty and complexity that can be achieved from basic geometric shapes, such as squares, circles, or polygons, creating a sense of order and unity in their designs. Therefore, it would be more accurate to answer the question of who seemed to have been dominated by geometrical pattern and order by naming artists, architects, or designers like Piet Mondrian, the Ancient Greeks, or Islamic artists and architects, rather than the given statement that each scene has its own character and belongs to its general sequence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Process: - Greenhouse gases are released into the air by human activities - The earth changes energy from the sun into heat - Heat rises from the ground - Greenhouse gas molecules in the atmosphere prevent the heat from going into space - The temperature of the earth increases - The temperature continues to rise and melts the polar ice caps - The temperature rises even faster. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a volcano erupts ejecting tons of greenhouse gases happens, how will it affect a SMALLER greenhouse effect. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation, in this case a volcanic eruption ejecting tons of greenhouse gases, will indeed influence the process, both directly and indirectly. Here's how it would affect a smaller greenhouse effect: Step 1: The volcanic eruption will add more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, especially if it's a significant eruption on a larger scale. This is the direct effect. Reasoning: Volcanic eruptions do produce greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, as well as aerosols which can have both a cooling (sulfur dioxide which forms sulfates in the atmosphere and reflects sunlight back to space) and warming effect (soot which absorbs sunlight). Step 2: The additional greenhouse gases caused by the volcanic eruption would enhance the greenhouse effect beyond what human activity contributes because greenhouse gas molecules prevent heat from escaping into space. Reasoning: As the concentration of such gases increases in the atmosphere, more heat will be trapped which will continue to raise the earth's temperature more than it would under the smaller greenhouse effect. Step 3: An increased temperature from the enhanced greenhouse effect will speed up the process of polar ice melting and possibly causing the temperature to rise even faster. Reasoning: The Earth’s surface becomes hotter with an intensified greenhouse effect, speeding up the melting of polar ice caps, which leads to a feedback loop where less sunlight is reflected back into space by ice, further increasing the temperature (known as the ice-albedo effect). In conclusion, the volcanic eruption in the perturbation hypothesis would indeed heighten the greenhouse effect, resulting in increased global temperatures and faster melting of the polar ice caps.

Based on the premise \\"All non-urban areas are rural.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Some non-urban areas are still not rural.\\" is true?","completion":"Based on the premise \\"All non-urban areas are rural.\\", the statement suggests a clear dichotomy between urban and non-urban (rural) areas, indicating that there are no other classifications or categories in this context. This implies that if an area is not urban, it must be rural; if it is not rural, it is urban. Now, let us analyze the hypothesis \\"Some non-urban areas are still not rural.\\" The hypothesis attempts to assert that there are non-urban areas that do not belong to the rural category. This goes against the logic of the initial premise, which explicitly states that all non-urban areas fall under the rural category. To further illustrate this point, let's use a Venn diagram as a visualization tool. In this case, we have two categories: urban (U) and rural (R). Since the premise states that non-urban areas are rural, we can imagine a circle containing all urban areas (U) and another circle containing all rural areas (R). Now, according to the premise, every area must be in one of these two circles. In other words, the entire space outside the circle representing urban areas (U) must be part of the circle representing rural areas (R). Hence, the hypothesis \\"Some non-urban areas are still not rural\\" is attempting to propose that there is an overlap between non-urban areas not contained in the rural area circle. However, due to the premise's strict categorization of areas into either urban or rural, there can be no such overlap. Consequently, based on the given premise, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"Some non-urban areas are still not rural\\" is true. In fact, we can definitively state that the hypothesis is false according to the given premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

President Donald Trump’s decision to reverse a policy of separating families coming across the U.S. southern border came in the wake of a political firestorm that fired up opposition Democrats and alarmed even some Republicans. At the very least, it likely set the stage for immigration to be a key issue in November. Trump was in combat mode Wednesday during a political rally in Duluth, Minnesota, where he vowed to make immigration a central focus in the upcoming congressional campaign. “If you want to create a humane, lawful system of immigration then you need to retire the Democrats and elect Republicans to finally secure our borders,” Trump said to an enthusiastic crowd, some chanting, “Build the wall!” Just hours earlier, the president reversed his controversial policy of separating children from their parents by signing an executive order in the White House. “We are going to have strong, very strong, borders. But we are going to keep the families together,” he said. Trump decided to back away from the controversial policy of separating families after an outcry from around the country that included protests in several states, including Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Also driving the outrage was a recording of children crying out for their parents released by the investigative journalist group ProPublica. The separation policy drew condemnation from Republicans including former first lady Laura Bush and a host of Democrats. “We should be able to agree that we will not keep kids in child internment camps indefinitely and hidden away from public view,” said Maryland Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings. “What country is that? This is the United States of America!” Advocates for a tough border policy sided with the president including Art Arthur of the Center for Immigration Studies.

He started acting in 1952 and was the first sportsman to be nominated to the Rajya Sabha (upper house) of India. He worked as Hindi and Punjabi film producer, director and writer, and he acted in films and television. - An upper house, sometimes called a Senate, is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature (or one of three chambers of a tricameral legislature), the other chamber being the lower house. The house formally designated as the upper house is usually smaller, and often has more restricted power, than the lower house. Examples of upper houses in countries include the UK's House of Lords, Canada's Senate, India's Rajya Sabha, Russia's Federation Council, Ireland's Seanad, Germany's Bundesrat and the United States Senate. - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance. - Bhakti Mein Shakti is a 1978 Bollywood film directed by and starring Dara Singh . - A politician (from \\"politics\\" + \\"-ian\\", from the Greek title of Aristotle's book \\"Politika\\", meaning \\"Civic Affairs\\") is a person active in party politics, or a person holding or seeking office in government. In democratic countries, politicians seek elective positions within a government through elections or, at times, temporary appointment to replace politicians who have died, resigned or have been otherwise removed from office. In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, bribery, revolutions and intrigues. Some politicians are experienced in the art or science of government. Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people. Broadly speaking, a \\"politician\\" can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in any bureaucratic institution.

In everyday usage, temperature indicates a measure of how hot or cold an object is. Temperature is an important parameter in chemistry. When a substance changes from solid to liquid, it is because there was an increase in the temperature of the material. Chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased. Many unstable materials (such as enzymes) will be viable longer at lower temperatures. Now, I have a new situation: Susan went to the store to buy some bags of ice for a party she was having later in the day. When she got home she put one bag of ice in the sink and another in the freezer, but then was distracted by a phone call and forgot to put the other bag in the freezer.

Answer this question please: Which sample will be viable for longer, the one on the counter top or the one in refrigerated storage? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The sample that will be viable for longer is the one placed in refrigerated storage. This is because lower temperatures help to preserve and maintain the stability of enzymes and other sensitive biological materials. In the case of the rat liver enzymes, the refrigerated storage slows down the rate of degradation, maintaining its activity and stability for a longer period of time. On the other hand, the sample left on the countertop will be exposed to higher temperatures and consequently, suffer from faster degradation, making it less viable than the refrigerated sample."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

People seem to prefer clear liquid over gray liquid because the OPTIONS: 1. clear liquid looks pure.. 2. gray liquid looks pure..","completion":"Once upon a time, in a bustling city called Liquida, an incredible phenomenon occurred that had everyone baffled. The city was renowned for its exquisite and diverse selection of liquids, that had become an integral part of the inhabitant's lives. People from all over the world traveled to Liquida to experience the unique liquids that the city had to offer. Every corner of the city prided itself on providing a wide array of liquids, ranging from water to fruit juices, to even some rare magical potions. One day, the residents of Liquida noticed an unusual divide in people's choices. People seemed to prefer clear liquid over gray liquid. No one seemed to be able to explain why such a preference had suddenly emerged. After observing the situation for quite some time, the city council decided to gather some experts to unravel the mystery behind this sudden preference. A team comprising the best scientists, researchers, and psychologists took up the task of conducting an extensive study. They analyzed people's choices to determine the possible reasons for their preference. After months of intensive research, the experts narrowed down the potential explanations to two distinct possibilities: 1. clear liquid looks pure, or 2. gray liquid looks pure. As the experts dug deeper into the people's psyche, they discovered that the preference for clear liquid was deeply rooted in the subconscious minds of the residents. The majority of the population equated clear liquid with purity, which had led to a bias in their choices. The clarity of the liquid was commonly associated with cleanliness, transparency, and overall higher quality. Numerous interviews and surveys revealed that the residents believed that clear liquids were more refined, free of impurities, and were believed to have a positive impact on their health and overall well-being. Surprisingly, the few who did prefer gray liquid also associated it with purity. This group of people saw the unique, mystical allure of the gray liquid, which they believed contained hidden powers and properties. For them, the opacity of the liquid represented a mysterious, unexplored territory that held the promise of undiscovered secrets. This small group of enthusiasts was daring and adventurous, eager to challenge conventional norms and explore the unknown. Despite their differences in preferences, both groups maintained that they were drawn to their respective choices out of a desire to experience purity in some form or another. This revelation opened many intriguing doors of exploration for the city council and the experts, who began to question the very concept of purity. The city council, in an attempt to satisfy the diverse preferences of its people, decided to capitalize on this insight. To embrace and celebrate the city's renowned liquid culture, they decided to host a grand festival called \\"The Pure Liquid Festival.\\" During this event, the city would showcase both clear and gray liquids to highlight the different aspects of purity associated with them. The streets of Liquida were adorned with vibrant decorations, signifying the unity in diversity of liquid preferences. The clear liquid and gray liquid were presented side-by-side in sparkling crystal glasses, encouraging people to embrace their fellow citizens' preferences. As the festival progressed, the residents developed a newfound appreciation for one another's choices, cultivating a sense of harmony and understanding within the community. The Pure Liquid Festival became an annual event, enlivening the streets and uniting the city of Liquida under the shared theme of purity. The story of the people's preference for clear liquid over gray liquid gradually turned into a tale of enlightenment and unity, reminding the world that even in our differences, we can find common ground and celebrate the things that bring us together. In the end, the people of Liquida learned a very important lesson: that the essence of purity is not limited to appearances, but lies in the acceptance and appreciation of diversity, supporting one another's choices, and finding beauty in the most unexpected of places. And so, the residents of Liquida carried on, celebrating and cherishing the vast array of liquids that their magical city had to offer, united in their love for the enchanting world of Liquida."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The College paid £200,000 and contributed 4.5 hectares of land in return for exclusive use of the facilities during the daytime only. The UK Sports Council defended the deal on the grounds that the whole community would benefit, while the bursar claimed that Windsor, Slough and Eton Athletic Club was \\"deprived\\" because local people (who were not pupils at the College) did not have a world-class running track and facilities to train with.

It was known to be made up primarily of Americo-Liberians who had mixed African and European ancestry. Pick from: I. Yes II. It's impossible to say III. No","completion":"I. Yes Based on the given context, we can indeed draw the hypothesis that the Republican Party, earlier named the Liberian Party, was a political party founded soon after the establishment of Liberia in 1848. It is mentioned that the party was made up primarily of Americo-Liberians who had mixed African and European ancestry. This information directly supports the hypothesis. The context highlights that the founding of the Republican Party, or the Liberian Party as it was first known, took place shortly after Liberia's establishment. This offers a clear link between the two, since the formation of a political party is common and expected in the wake of a new nation's creation. Moreover, the context provides a brief description of the party's demographic makeup—the Americo-Liberians, who had a mix of African and European ancestry. This information provides additional understanding of the party's character and goals, as well as how its members distinguished themselves from their opponents in the True Whig Party. Furthermore, it can be inferred that the Republican Party was an influential political organization of its time, given that it had a significant rival in the form of the True Whig Party. The existence of this opposition may have contributed to the shaping of Liberia's political landscape, with both parties playing crucial roles in order to maintain Liberia's stability and growth as a fledgling nation. In conclusion, based on the context provided, we can confidently draw the hypothesis that the Republican Party, earlier named the Liberian Party, was founded soon after Liberia's establishment in 1848 and was composed primarily of Americo-Liberians with mixed African and European ancestry."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The name Phosphorus is derived from two Greek words - \\"phos\\" meaning light and \\"phoros\\" meaning bearer or bearing. Phosphorus is a non-metal element that is a member of the nitrogen group in the periodic table. It is highly reactive and is rarely found in its elemental form in nature, usually occurring in mineral form as a phosphate. Phosphorus is an essential element for life on Earth, playing a critical role in biological processes such as energy transfer, cellular structure, and DNA synthesis. It is a key component of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is responsible for storing and transferring energy within cells, and of nucleic acids, which form the genetic code. Phosphorus exists in several allotropic forms, which are different structural arrangements or conformations of the same element. The two most common forms are white phosphorus and red phosphorus. White phosphorus is a highly reactive and toxic form, while red phosphorus is more stable and less toxic. Black phosphorus, an allotrope with a layered structure, is also known but is less common. The discovery of phosphorus is credited to the German alchemist Hennig Brand in 1669. Brand isolated phosphorus from human urine while attempting to discover the legendary Philosopher's Stone, which was believed to have the ability to turn common metals into gold. He observed that phosphorus would glow in the dark and emit a faint light when exposed to air, a property now known as phosphorescence. This unique characteristic inspired him to name the newly discovered element after the Greek term for \\"light bearing\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

White House officials on Wednesday laid out plans to send National Guard troops to the United States’ southern border with Mexico, as part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to confront what he says is a growing problem with illegal immigrants. The decision to deploy the U.S. military to the border represents a major new aspect of Trump’s wide-ranging immigration crackdown. But major parts of the move are unclear, including how many troops will be sent, when they will deploy, or what exactly they will do. “It will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and are moving quickly,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We are anxious to have this support.” In the U.S., the active duty military is generally restricted from domestic law enforcement functions, which would include apprehending border crossers. However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles. Nielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other “support functions.” She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include “as many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.” A senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective. “Suffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,” the official said. Trump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members. Trump repeatedly has threatened to deploy the military to help secure the border, especially as a caravan of Central American migrants makes it way north through Mexico, with some headed for the U.S. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Before you can get your car back, you need to know why it was impounded. In some cases, if someone else was driving your car at the time, you may not be aware of the reason at first, but you (as the owner) are probably still responsible.","completion":"First, gather necessary documents. After determining the reason your car was impounded, you will need to gather important documents to prove your ownership and identity. These documents usually include: 1. Government-issued identification (such as a driver's license or passport) 2. Proof of vehicle registration 3. Proof of vehicle insurance 4. Relevant payment receipts or proof of a payment plan (if your car was impounded due to unpaid parking tickets or other fines) Second, find the impound lot. Next, you must locate the impound lot where your car is being held. This information is typically provided on the notice or ticket you received. If you are unsure or haven't received any notice, you can: 1. Contact your local police department or traffic authority 2. Search online for impound lots or tow yards in your area Third, verify storage and release fees. Before visiting the impound lot, it is important to find out the fees associated with the storage and release of your impounded car. Impound fees can be quite expensive, so it's important to be prepared. Keep in mind that the longer your car remains in the impound lot, the more fees you may incur. You can contact the impound lot to find out the exact costs associated with your case. In some cases, you may be able to negotiate a reduced fee or a payment plan depending on your financial situation. However, keep in mind that this will depend on the specific regulations of the impound lot and local laws. Fourth, pay outstanding fines or address legal issues Depending on why your car was impounded, you may need to pay outstanding fines or deal with legal issues before you can retrieve your car. If your car was impounded for unpaid parking tickets, traffic violations, or other legal reasons, you will need to settle the outstanding debts before your car can be released. If necessary, consider consulting with a lawyer or seeking legal counsel to help deal with any legal matters related to your impounded car. Fifth, visit the impound lot and retrieve your car. Once you have all the necessary documents, fees, and information, it's time to visit the impound lot and retrieve your car. Bring your identification, proof of ownership, and any required payment with you. Present the required documents to the impound lot staff, pay any outstanding fees, and follow their instructions to retrieve your car. Remember to take your time inspecting the car once it's released, as there may be damages or losses that occurred while it was in the impound lot. Make sure to address these concerns with the impound lot staff immediately if you notice any issues. Lastly, prevention is key after retrieval. Now that you have your car back, it's essential to ensure that a similar situation doesn't happen again. Address any underlying issues that led to your car being impounded, such as unpaid fines or legal issues. Be responsible when parking, and obey local traffic laws and regulations. Ensuring that your car remains insured and properly registered can also prevent problems in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: This article: Development of \\"Push the Button\\" began while the Sugababes travelled to the United States to work on their fourth studio album, Taller in More Ways (2005). American producer and songwriter Dallas Austin collaborated with the group during the album's initial stages of development. He visited London to work with them, although the group later travelled to the US and stayed with him at his mansion in Atlanta, Georgia. Austin wrote five tracks for the album, including \\"Push the Button\\", which he composed in collaboration with the Sugababes. According to group member Heidi Range, the song was \\"the very last thing\\" completed for the album.\\"Push the Button\\" was conceptualised after group member Keisha Buchanan developed an infatuation with another artist who was collaborating with Austin. Buchanan told Jess Cartner-Morley of The Guardian that she made advances towards the man, but he was unaware of her intentions: \\"I really liked this guy, so I'd be like, there's this good movie coming out, you know, dropping hints. And he'd be like, that movie sounds great, let me know what it's like if you go see it. I knew he liked me too but he just wasn't getting what I was trying to say.\\" Austin advised Buchanan to tell the man to \\"push that button\\" or she would eventually move on.Mutya Buena, another member of the Sugababes, clarified Buchanan's encounter with the artist to Hot Press magazine's Jackie Hayden, saying: \\"We all knew there was something going on between them at the time, but we try to give each other space.\\" She described \\"Push the Button\\" as a song \\"with meaning and real life references\\", and characterised it as having a \\"street vibe\\". Austin produced the song, which was recorded at DARP Studios in Atlanta & Home Recordings, London. \\"Push the Button\\" was mixed by Jeremy Wheatley at TwentyOne Studios, London, in collaboration with Richard Edgeler. Rick Shepphard engineered the song. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the studio where the song that was conceptualised after group member Keisha Buchanan developed an infatuation with another artist recorded?, what is it ? A:","completion":"The name of the studio where the song \\"Push the Button\\" was recorded, after group member Keisha Buchanan developed an infatuation with another artist, is DARP Studios in Atlanta. Additionally, parts of the song were also recorded at Home Recordings in London."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does the sentence \\"Electric motors may be classified by electric power source type, internal construction, application, type of motion output, and so on.\\" answer the question \\"What does DC stand for?\\"","completion":"No, the sentence \\"Electric motors may be classified by electric power source type, internal construction, application, type of motion output, and so on.\\" does not answer the question \\"What does DC stand for?\\". However, I can provide a detailed explanation for the term DC and its relation to electric motors. DC stands for Direct Current, which is a type of electric current that flows continuously in one direction. In the context of electric motors, DC refers to a type of motor that is powered by direct current, rather than by alternating current (AC), which periodically changes direction. It is important to understand the difference between these two types of current when discussing electric motors. Direct current is produced by sources like batteries, fuel cells, and solar cells, while alternating current is typically supplied by power grids, as it can be efficiently transmitted over long distances and easily transformed to different voltages. The use of direct current in electric motors has some specific advantages and disadvantages compared to alternating current. Advantages of DC motors include: 1. Simple and straightforward design: DC motors have a simpler construction compared to AC motors, which often makes them more straightforward to understand and maintain. 2. High starting torque: This type of motor provides a higher starting torque, which is crucial in applications that demand an immediate and strong force to get the system up and running. 3. Speed control: DC motors also offer easier speed control compared to many AC motors. This control can be achieved by simply changing the input voltage, making them popular in applications where variable speeds are required. 4. High efficiency: In many cases, DC motors can be more efficient than AC motors, especially at low speeds. Disadvantages of DC motors include: 1. Maintenance: The brushes and commutator in DC motors require regular maintenance and can wear out over time, potentially leading to reduced reliability. 2. Limited applications: In many industrial and commercial applications, AC motors are preferred due to their ease of use with existing power systems, lower maintenance requirements, and scalability. 3. Less suited for high-power applications: While DC motors are great for small appliances and devices, they might be less suitable for larger, high-power applications that require a more robust solution. In the provided sentence, \\"electric power source type\\" refers to the kind of power source (such as AC or DC) used by the electric motor. However, the sentence does not explicitly mention the meaning of DC or its implications. To directly answer the question \\"What does DC stand for?\\", it stands for Direct Current, which is one of the classifications of electric motors based on their power source."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:Y},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],j={key:0},N={key:1};function R(o,e,h,m,n,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
